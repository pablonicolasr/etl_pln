Afore Sandy got up the stair he manished to mairter the feck o' his Sabbath claes wi' the whitenin';
an' I was akinda feard Mistress Mikaver micht mistak' him for the scone-baker's ghost.  But
we got him made gey snod, an' syne we gaed inby to the ben-hoose fireside, an' had a crack
wi' young Aleck.  That's the son's name.  Sandy an' him got started aboot mustaings, an' Indeens,
an' boomirangs, an' scoots an' ither scoondrils, till I cudna be deaved ony langer wi' their
forrin blethers; so ben to but-the-hoose I gaed to hae a twa-handit crack wi' Aleck's mither.

When I opened the door, here's as mony lassies as wudda startit a noo mill.  They'd been a'
deckin' themsel's but-the-hoose afore they cam' ben to see Aleck, d'ye see?  He made himsel'
rale frank, an' speer'd for a' their mithers, an' a'thing; an' then we got roond the ben-hoose
table, an' had a fine game at the totum for cracknets.

Sandy juist got gey pranky, as uswal, afore he was lang startit.  He's aye the same when he
gets amon' young lassies, the auld ass 'at he is.

"T tak's them a' but ane," he roared in the middle o' the game; an' he grippit up a nivfu'
o' the crack-nets, an' into his moo wi' them.  His een gaed up intil his heid, an' gin I hadna
gien him a daud i' the back, that garred the nets flee oot o' his moo a' ower tha table, he'd
been a chokit korp in a meenit or twa, juist as shure's the morn's Setarday.

But little did I think what was afore's!  Gin I'd kenned, I'd latten him chok, the mairterin'
footer 'at he is.

We a' gaed awa' doon the yaird aboot half-past seven, to see a noo henhouse 'at Aleck had been
tarrin' that efternune.  He maun be a handy earl, mind ye.

"Tak' care o' your frocks, for that tar's weet yet," says Aleck to the lassies.

"Ay, man, so it is," says Sandy, takin' a slaik o't aff wi' his fingers, an' syne dichtin't
on the tail o' his sirtoo, the nesty character, 'at I shud say sic a wird!

"Man, Aleck," says Sandy, when we were a' on the green juist takin' a look roond aboot's, "it
looks juist like the streen that you sat up 'on that very tree there, an' pappit Gairner Winton
wi' oslins that you'd stealt ooten his ain gairden.  I mind I was here when he cam' doon to
tell your father aboot your ongaens.  You was a wild tyke o' a laddie, I can tell ye.  Your
father gae you an awfu' paikin'; but fient a hair did you care.  He wasna weel dune tannin'
you when you was roarin' 'Hairy Grozers'--that was a by-name o' the Gairner's--in at Winton's
shop door.  You was a roid loon."

Aleck took a richt herty lauch at Sandy's blethers, an' the twa o' them were juist thick an'
three-faud afore they were half-an-'oor thegither. Yet wudda thocht they'd kent ane anither
sin' ever they were doakit.

Gin we cam' back, Aleck's mither had a fine supper a' ready on the table.  She had a can'le
here an' there, an' pucklies o' chuckinwirth an' persly scattered roond the rob-roys.  It was
awfu' nice.  It would raley garred ye think ye was amon' braw fowk.  I was juist sittin' admirin't
when Aleck says, "Ay, then, are ye a' ready?"

We had to hover a blink till Mistress Mikaver ran ben the hoose for a knife to Mey Mershell.

"Mester Bowden 'ill say the grace noo," says Aleck; an' Sandy was on his feet like the shot
o' a gun, hostin' to clear his throat.  I dreedit he wud mak' a gutter o't somewey or ither,
an' so I keepit my een open.  Sandy shut his, an' so did a' the rest.  He leaned forrit an'
spread oot the muckle clunkers o' hands o' him on the tap o' the peat o' a big roobarb tert.
"O Lord," was a' the len'th he'd gotten, when in he gaed, up near to the elbas amon' the het
roobarb; an' by a' the skoilin' an' roarin' ever I heard, there never was the like!  A gey
grace it was, I can tell ye!  It'll no' be the morn nor next day 'at I'll forget it.  He roared
an' yowled like I kenna what, an' black-gairded reed-het roobarb terts, till I thocht he wudda
opened the very earth.

"O, haud your tongue, Sandy Bowden!" I cried, my very heid like to rive wi' his yalpin'.

"Haud my tongue?" says he.  "Hoo can I haud my tongue, an' my airms stewin' amon' boilin' jeelie?"

Juist at this meenit Aleck aff wi' Sandy's coat syne he but the hoose wi' him an' garred him
shove his airms ower the heid in his mither's floor pock.  It deidened the pain in a wink,
an' efter a whilie we got the airms rowed up.  I cudna gae ben to bid the ither fowk guid-nicht,
my hert was that sair; an' Sandy was hingin' his heid like a sick dog. Puir man, he has mibby
mair than me to thole; but I wudda gien a five-pound note 'at I hadna left my ain hoose this
nicht.  I'll awa' to my bed, for my hert's perfeckly i' my moo.

IX.

THE GREAT STORM OF NOVEMBER, 1893.

Eh, sirce me, what a nicht we had on Setarday mornin'!  O, haud your tongue!  Though I should
live lang eneuch to bury Sandy Bowden, an' hae a golden weddin' wi' my second man, I'll never
forget it.  It mak's me shaky-trimilly yet to think aboot it.  Sandy's gaen aboot wi' a' the
hair cut aff the back o' his heid, an' fower or five strips o' stickin' plester battered across
his scawp.  He got an awfu' mishap, puir man. I thocht his heid was a' to smash, but, fortunately,
it turned oot fully harder than the biscuit tin it cam' into contact wi'.

It would be aboot ane o'clock or thereaboot when Sandy gae me a daud wi' his elba that garred
me a' jump.  I had an awfu' busy day on Friday; an' I was sleepin' as soond's a tap.

"'Oman," says he, "there's something fearfu' gaen on doon the yaird somewey.  Wud that be the
Dyed Wallop an' her man fechtin', or what i' the world's earth can it be?  Harken, Bawbie!
Did you ever hear sic yawlin'?"

"Bliss me, Sandy man," says I, "that's the wind soochin' throo the trees in the banker's gairden,
an' fizzin' in amon' the pipes o' the water barrels.  It's shurely an awfu' nicht o' wind."

Juist at this meenit you wudda thocht the very deevil himsel' had gotten grips o' the frame
o' oor winda.  He garred it rattle like the thunder at Hewy White's theatre; then he yawled,
an' hooed, an' growled like five hunder cats an' as mony dogs wirryin' them, an' a' the fowk
'at echt them fechtin' at the same time.  This feenisht up wi' a terrific yawl; an' Sandy dived
doon in ablo the claes.

"Ye fear'd nowt," says I, "what are ye fleein' awa' doon there for? Ye'll hae my feet sterved
to death wi' cauld.  Lie up on your pillow an' lat the claes doon to the fit o' the bed."

For a hale strucken 'oor this gaed on, an' sometimes I akwilly thocht I fand the bed shakin'.
Oor birdie (he hings at the winda) began to wheek-wheek wi' fear, an I wanted Sandy to rise
an' tak' the puir cratur doon.

"The feint a-fear o' me," says he, the hertless skemp 'at he is.  "If you want the canary i'
the bed aside you, you can rise an' tak' him doon yersel'."

I raise an' took the puir craturie doon, an' hang him up on the ither side o' the room; an,'
mind ye, ye wud raley thocht the bit beastie kent, for it gae a coodie bit cheep or twa, an
juist cooered doon to sleep again.  Juist as I was gaen awa' to screw doon the gas, it gae
twa or three lowps, an' oot it gaed; an' afore I kent whaur I was, there was a reeshilin' an'
rummelin' on the ruif that wudda nearhand fleggit the very fowk i' the kirkyaird. It is a tribulation
which God permits as a judgment to come upon all the world, a tribulation in which Satan is
concerned, in which he manifests his malice and his wrath. This tribulation has an altogether
punitive character.

"Preserve's a'," says I, heich oot, "whaur are ye, Sandy?  Are ye there?  What's come ower
ye?  Are ye deid?"

"I'm here, Bawbie," says a shiverin' voice in aneth the bed.  "I'm here, Bawbie.  Ye'll hear
Gabriel's tuter juist i' the noo.  O, Bawbie, I've been a nesty footer o' a man, an' ill-gettit
scoot a' my days.  I wiss I cud juist get hauds o' the Bible on the drawers-heid, Bawbie. Did
ye hear the mountins an' the rocks beginnin' to fa'?"

"Come awa' 'oot ablo there, Sandy," I says, says I, "an' no' get your death o' cauld, an' be
gaen aboot deavin fowk wi' you an' your reums. The mountins an' rocks is the brick an' lum-cans
aff Mistress Mollison's hoose, I'm thinkin'."  An' I cudna help addin'--"It's ower late to
be thinkin' aboot startin' to the Bible efter Gabriel's begun to blaw his tuter, Sandy.  Come
awa' to your bed!"

Sandy got himsel' squeezed up atween the bed an' the wa'; an' at ilky hooch an whirr 'at the
wind gae he wheenged an' groaned like's he was terriple ill wi' his inside; an' aye he was
sayin', "I've been a lazy gaen-aboot vegabon', an' ill-hertit vague. And this continues. It has
continued for a good many years, longer than those who were used
by the Holy Spirit in the recovery of the blessed Hope, anticipated.

The infinite patience of the Lord has delayed the next great event.


"For ony sake, Bawbie," roared Sandy oot o' the bed, "wait till I get on my breeks.  If ye
lave me, I'll g'wa' in a fit--as shore's ocht."

We got doon the stair an' I lichtit the fire an' got the kettle to the boil, an' we sat an'
harkined to the wind skreechin' doon the lum, an' groanin' an' wailin' amon' the trees ower
the road, an' soochin' roond aboot the washin'-hoose.  I raley never heard the marrow o't.
The nicht o' the fa'a'in' o' the Tay Brig was but the blawin' oot o' a can'le aside it.  I'
the middle o' an awfu' sooch there was a fearfu' reeshil at oor door, an' Sandy fair jamp aff
his chair wi' the start.

"A'ye in, Sandy?" cried Dauvid Kenawee, in a nervish kind o' a voice.

I awa' an' opened the door, an' here was Dauvid an' Mistress Kenawee--Dauvid wi' his pints
wallopin' amon' his feet, an' his weyscot lowse, an' Mistress Kenawee juist wi' her short-goon
an' a shallie on.

"This is shurely the end o' the world comin'," said Mistress Kenawee, near greetin'.  "O dear
me, I think something's genna come ower me."

"Tuts 'oman, sit doon," says Dauvid, altho' he was in a fell state aboot her.  I cud see that
brawly.

The sicht o' the puir wafilly budy akinda drave the fear awa frae me; an' I maskit a cup o'
tea, an' crackit awa till her till we got her cowshined doon.  Their back winda had been blawn
in, and Dauvid had tried to keep oot the wind wi' a mattress; but the wind had tummeled baith
Dauvid an' the mattress heels ower gowrie, an' the wife got intil a terriple state.  They cudna
bide i' the hoose ony langer, an' i' the warst o't a', they cam' awa through a shoer o' sklates,
an' bricks, an' lum-cans, an' gless, to see if we wud lat them in.

I garred Sandy pet on a bit ham, and drew anower the table, and tried to keep them frae thinkin'
aboot it; but at ilka whizz an' growl the wind gae, baith Sandy an' Mistress Kenawee startit
an' took a lang breath.

I'm shure we hadna abune a moofu' o' tea drucken, an' Sandy was juist awa' to tak' aff' the
ham, when the fryin' pan was knockit ooten his hand, an' doon the lum cam' a pozel o' bricks
an' shute that wudda filled a cairt.  Sandy fell back ower an' knockit Mistress Kenawee richt
i' the flure.  The ham dip gaed up the lum in a gloze, an' here was Sandy an' Dauvid's wife
lyin' i' the middle o' a' the mairter o' rubbitch.  Mistress Kenawee's face, puir thing, was
as white as a cloot; but Sandy's was as black as the man More o' Vennis, the bleckie that smored
his wife i' the theatre for carryin' on wi' a sodger.

What a job Dauvid an' me had gettin' them roond.  We poored a drappie brandie doon baith their
throats; an' Sandy opened his een an' says, "Ay; I've been an awfu' blackgaird; I have that!"
He had come doon wi' the back o' his heid on a biscuit tin fu' o' peyse meal, an' had smashed
the tin an' sent the meal fleein' a' ower the hoose.  But the cratur had gotten an awfu' tnap
on the back o' the heid, an' he was bluidin' gey sair.  Gin daylicht brook, Dauvid an' me had
gotten the twa o' them akinda into order, and Sandy was able to open the shop.  He had an awfu'
ruggin' an' tuggin' afore he cud get the door to open; an' he cam' into me an' says, "Dod,
Bawbie, I think the hoose has gotten a terriple thraw.  The shop door 'ill nether go back nor
forrit!"

I gaed oot to see what was ado.  Eh, sirce, if you had only seen oor street!  The beach ootby
at the Saut Pan, whaur there's a free coup for rubbitch, was naething till't!  It juist mindit
me o' the picture, in oor big Bible, o' Jerusalem when the fowk cam' back frae Babylon till't--it
was juist a' lyin' a cairn o' lowse steens an' half bricks.

There's neen o's 'ill forget Friday nicht in a hurry, or I'm muckle misteen.

SANDY AND HIS FAIRNTICKLES.

There's twa things Sandy Bowden's haen sin' ever I got acquant wi' him--an' that's no' the
day nor yesterday--that's fairntickles an' cheepin' buits.  I never kent Sandy bein' withoot
a pair o' 'lastic-sided buits that gaed squakin' to the kirk like twa croakin' hens.  I've
seen the fowk sometimes turn roond-aboot in their seats, when Sandy cam' creakin' up the passage,
as gin they thocht it was a brass-band comin' in.  But Sandy appears to think there's something
reverint an' Sabbath-like in cheepin' buits, an' he sticks to them, rissen be't or neen.  I
can tell ye, it's a blissin' there's no' mony mair like him, or we'd hae gey streets on Sabbath.
The noise the maitter o' twenty chields like Sandy cud mak' wi' their buit soles wud fair deave
a hale neeperhude.

Hooever, it wasna Sandy's buits I was to tell you aboot; it was my nain.  But afore I say onything
aboot them, I maun tell you aboot the fairntickles.  As I was sayin', Sandy's terriple fairntickled
aboot the neck an' the sides o' the nose, an' oor lest holiday made him a hankie waur than
uswal.  He's a gey prood mannie too, mind ye, although he winna haud wi't.  But I can tell
you it's no a bawbee-wirth o' hair oil that sairs Sandy i' the week.  But that's nether here
nor there.

Weel, Sandy had been speakin' aboot his fairntickles to Saunders Robb. Saunders, in my opinion,
is juist a haiverin' auld ass.  He's a hoddel-dochlin', hungert-lookin' wisgan o' a cratur;
an', I'm shure, he has a mind to match his body.  There's naethin' he disna ken aboot--an',
the fac' is, he kens naething.  He's aye i' the wey o' improvin' ither fowk's wark.  There's
naethin' Saunders disna think he could improve, excep' himsel' mibby.  I canna be bathered
wi' the chatterin', fykie, kyowowin' little wratch.  He's aye throwin' oot suggestions an'
hints aboot this and that.  He's naething but a suggestion himsel', an' I'm shure I cud of'en
throw him oot, wi' richt gude will.

Weel, he'd gien Sandy some cure for his fairntickles, an' Sandy, unbekent to me, had gotten
something frae the druggie an' mixed it up wi' a guid three-bawbee's-wirth o' cream that I
had in the upstairs press.  He had rubbit it on his face an' neck afore he gaed till his bed;
but he wasna an 'oor beddit when he had to rise.  An' sik a sicht as he was!  His face an'
neck were as yellow's mairyguilds, an' yallower; an' though I've taen washin' soda, an' pooder,
an' the very scrubbin' brush till't, Sandy's gaen aboot yet juist like's he was noo oot o'
the yallow fivver an' the jaundice thegither.

"Ye'll better speer at Saunders what'll tak' it aff," says I till him the ither mornin'.

"If I had a grip o' Saunders, I'll tak' mair than the fairntickles aff him," says he; an' faigs,
mind you, there's nae sayin' but he may do't; he's a spunky carlie Sandy, when he's raised.
