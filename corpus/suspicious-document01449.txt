{FN15-4} SAT is literally "being," hence "essence; reality." SANGA is "association." Sri Yukteswar
called his hermitage organization SAT-SANGA, "fellowship with truth."

{FN15-5} "If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light."-MATTHEW
6:22. During deep meditation, the single or spiritual eye becomes visible within the central
part of the forehead.  This omniscient eye is variously referred to in scriptures as the third
eye, the star of the East, the inner eye, the dove descending from heaven, the eye of Shiva,
the eye of intuition, etc.

{FN15-6} "He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not
see? . . . he that teacheth man knowledge, shall he not know?"-PSALM 94:9-10.

{FN15-7} Folklore of all peoples contains references to incantations with power over nature.
The American Indians are well-known to have developed sound rituals for rain and wind. Tan
Sen, the great Hindu musician, was able to quench fire by the power of his song. Charles Kellogg,
the California naturalist, gave a demonstration of the effect of tonal vibration on fire in
1926 before a group of New York firemen.  "Passing a bow, like an enlarged violin bow, swiftly
across an aluminum tuning fork, he produced a screech like intense radio static.  Instantly
the yellow gas flame, two feet high, leaping inside a hollow glass tube, subsided to a height
of six inches and became a sputtering blue flare. Another attempt with the bow, and another
screech of vibration, extinguished it."

CHAPTER: 16

OUTWITTING THE STARS

"Mukunda, why don't you get an astrological armlet?"

"Should I, Master? I don't believe in astrology."

"It is never a question of BELIEF; the only scientific attitude one can take on any subject
is whether it is TRUE. The law of gravitation worked as efficiently before Newton as after
him. The cosmos would be fairly chaotic if its laws could not operate without the sanction
of human belief.

"Charlatans have brought the stellar science to its present state of disrepute. Astrology is
too vast, both mathematically {FN16-1} and philosophically, to be rightly grasped except by
men of profound understanding. If ignoramuses misread the heavens, and see there a scrawl instead
of a script, that is to be expected in this imperfect world. One should not dismiss the wisdom
with the 'wise.'

"All parts of creation are linked together and interchange their influences. The balanced rhythm
of the universe is rooted in reciprocity," my guru continued. "Man, in his human aspect, has
to combat two sets of forces-first, the tumults within his being, caused by the admixture of
earth, water, fire, air, and ethereal elements; second, the outer disintegrating powers of
nature. So long as man struggles with his mortality, he is affected by the myriad mutations
of heaven and earth.

"Astrology is the study of man's response to planetary stimuli. The stars have no conscious
benevolence or animosity; they merely send forth positive and negative radiations. Of themselves,
these do not help or harm humanity, but offer a lawful channel for the outward operation of
cause-effect equilibriums which each man has set into motion in the past.

"A child is born on that day and at that hour when the celestial rays are in mathematical harmony
with his individual karma. His horoscope is a challenging portrait, revealing his unalterable
past and its probable future results. But the natal chart can be rightly interpreted only by
men of intuitive wisdom: these are few.

"The message boldly blazoned across the heavens at the moment of birth is not meant to emphasize
fate-the result of past good and evil-but to arouse man's will to escape from his universal
thralldom. What he has done, he can undo. None other than himself was the instigator of the
causes of whatever effects are now prevalent in his life. He can overcome any limitation, because
he created it by his own actions in the first place, and because he has spiritual resources
which are not subject to planetary pressure.

"Superstitious awe of astrology makes one an automaton, slavishly dependent on mechanical guidance.
The wise man defeats his planets--which is to say, his past-by transferring his allegiance
from the creation to the Creator. The more he realizes his unity with Spirit, the less he can
be dominated by matter. The soul is ever-free; it is deathless because birthless. It cannot
be regimented by stars.

"Man IS a soul, and HAS a body. When he properly places his sense of identity, he leaves behind
all compulsive patterns. So long as he remains confused in his ordinary state of spiritual
amnesia, he will know the subtle fetters of environmental law.

"God is harmony; the devotee who attunes himself will never perform any action amiss. His activities
will be correctly and naturally timed to accord with astrological law. After deep prayer and
meditation he is in touch with his divine consciousness; there is no greater power than that
inward protection."

"Then, dear Master, why do you want me to wear an astrological bangle?" I ventured this question
after a long silence, during which I had tried to assimilate Sri Yukteswar's noble exposition.

"It is only when a traveler has reached his goal that he is justified in discarding his maps.
During the journey, he takes advantage of any convenient short cut. The ancient rishis discovered
many ways to curtail the period of man's exile in delusion. There are certain mechanical features
in the law of karma which can be skillfully adjusted by the fingers of wisdom.

"All human ills arise from some transgression of universal law. The scriptures point out that
man must satisfy the laws of nature, while not discrediting the divine omnipotence. He should
say: 'Lord, I trust in Thee, and know Thou canst help me, but I too will do my best to undo
any wrong I have done.' By a number of means-by prayer, by will power, by yoga meditation,
by consultation with saints, by use of astrological bangles-the adverse effects of past wrongs
can be minimized or nullified.

"Just as a house can be fitted with a copper rod to absorb the shock of lightning, so the bodily
temple can be benefited by various protective measures. Ages ago our yogis discovered that
pure metals emit an astral light which is powerfully counteractive to negative pulls of the
planets. Subtle electrical and magnetic radiations are constantly circulating in the universe;
when a man's body is being aided, he does not know it; when it is being disintegrated, he is
still in ignorance. Can he do anything about it?

"This problem received attention from our rishis; they found helpful not only a combination
of metals, but also of plants and-most effective of all-faultless jewels of not less than two
carats. The preventive uses of astrology have seldom been seriously studied outside of India.
One little-known fact is that the proper jewels, metals, or plant preparations are valueless
unless the required weight is secured, and unless these remedial agents are worn next to the skin."

"Sir, of course I shall take your advice and get a bangle. I am intrigued at the thought of
outwitting a planet!"

"For general purposes I counsel the use of an armlet made of gold, silver, and copper. But
for a specific purpose I want you to get one of silver and lead." Sri Yukteswar added careful
directions.

"Guruji, what 'specific purpose' do you mean?"

"The stars are about to take an unfriendly interest in you, Mukunda. Fear not; you shall be
protected. In about a month your liver will cause you much trouble. The illness is scheduled
to last for six months, but your use of an astrological armlet will shorten the period to twenty-four
days."

I sought out a jeweler the next day, and was soon wearing the bangle.  My health was excellent;
Master's prediction slipped from my mind. He left Serampore to visit Benares. Thirty days after
our conversation, I felt a sudden pain in the region of my liver. The following weeks were
a nightmare of excruciating pain. Reluctant to disturb my guru, I thought I would bravely endure
my trial alone.

But twenty-three days of torture weakened my resolution; I entrained for Benares. There Sri
Yukteswar greeted me with unusual warmth, but gave me no opportunity to tell him my woes in
private. Many devotees visited Master that day, just for a DARSHAN. {FN16-2} Ill and neglected,
I sat in a corner. It was not until after the evening meal that all guests had departed. My
guru summoned me to the octagonal balcony of the house.

"You must have come about your liver disorder." Sri Yukteswar's gaze was averted; he walked
to and fro, occasionally intercepting the moonlight. "Let me see; you have been ailing for
twenty-four days, haven't you?"

"Yes, sir."

"Please do the stomach exercise I have taught you."

"If you knew the extent of my suffering, Master, you would not ask me to exercise." Nevertheless
I made a feeble attempt to obey him.

"You say you have pain; I say you have none. How can such contradictions exist?" My guru looked
at me inquiringly.

I was dazed and then overcome with joyful relief. No longer could I feel the continuous torment
that had kept me nearly sleepless for weeks; at Sri Yukteswar's words the agony vanished as
though it had never been.

I started to kneel at his feet in gratitude, but he quickly prevented me.

"Don't be childish. Get up and enjoy the beauty of the moon over the Ganges." But Master's
eyes were twinkling happily as I stood in silence beside him. I understood by his attitude
that he wanted me to feel that not he, but God, had been the Healer.

I wear even now the heavy silver and lead bangle, a memento of that day-long-past, ever-cherished-when
I found anew that I was living with a personage indeed superhuman. On later occasions, when
I brought my friends to Sri Yukteswar for healing, he invariably recommended jewels or the
bangle, extolling their use as an act of astrological wisdom.

I had been prejudiced against astrology from my childhood, partly because I observed that many
people are sequaciously attached to it, and partly because of a prediction made by our family
astrologer: "You will marry three times, being twice a widower." I brooded over the matter,
feeling like a goat awaiting sacrifice before the temple of triple matrimony.

"You may as well be resigned to your fate," my brother Ananta had remarked. "Your written horoscope
has correctly stated that you would fly from home toward the Himalayas during your early years,
but would be forcibly returned. The forecast of your marriages is also bound to be true."

A clear intuition came to me one night that the prophecy was wholly false. I set fire to the
horoscope scroll, placing the ashes in a paper bag on which I wrote: "Seeds of past karma cannot
germinate if they are roasted in the divine fires of wisdom." I put the bag in a conspicuous
spot; Ananta immediately read my defiant comment.

"You cannot destroy truth as easily as you have burnt this paper scroll." My brother laughed
scornfully.

It is a fact that on three occasions before I reached manhood, my family tried to arrange my
betrothal. Each time I refused to fall in with the plans, {FN16-3} knowing that my love for
God was more overwhelming than any astrological persuasion from the past.

"The deeper the self-realization of a man, the more he influences the whole universe by his
subtle spiritual vibrations, and the less he himself is affected by the phenomenal flux." These
words of Master's often returned inspiringly to my mind.

Occasionally I told astrologers to select my worst periods, according to planetary indications,
and I would still accomplish whatever task I set myself. It is true that my success at such
times has been accompanied by extraordinary difficulties. But my conviction has always been
justified: faith in the divine protection, and the right use of man's God-given will, are forces
formidable beyond any the "inverted bowl" can muster.

The starry inscription at one's birth, I came to understand, is not that man is a puppet of
his past. Its message is rather a prod to pride; the very heavens seek to arouse man's determination
to be free from every limitation. God created each man as a soul, dowered with individuality,
hence essential to the universal structure, whether in the temporary role of pillar or parasite.
His freedom is final and immediate, if he so wills; it depends not on outer but inner victories.

Sri Yukteswar discovered the mathematical application of a 24,000-year equinoctial cycle to
our present age. {FN16-4} The cycle is divided into an Ascending Arc and a Descending Arc,
each of 12,000 years. Within each Arc fall four YUGAS or Ages, called KALI, DWAPARA, TRETA,
and SATYA, corresponding to the Greek ideas of Iron, Bronze, Silver, and Golden Ages.

My guru determined by various calculations that the last KALI YUGA or Iron Age, of the Ascending
Arc, started about A.D. 500. The Iron Age, 1200 years in duration, is a span of materialism;
it ended about A.D.  1700. That year ushered in DWAPARA YUGA, a 2400-year period of electrical
and atomic-energy developments, the age of telegraph, radio, airplanes, and other space-annihilators.

The 3600-year period of TRETA YUGA will start in A.D. 4100; its age will be marked by common
knowledge of telepathic communications and other time-annihilators. During the 4800 years of
SATYA YUGA, final age in an ascending arc, the intelligence of a man will be completely developed;
he will work in harmony with the divine plan.

A descending arc of 12,000 years, starting with a descending Golden Age of 4800 years, then
begins {FN16-5} for the world; man gradually sinks into ignorance. These cycles are the eternal
rounds of MAYA, the contrasts and relativities of the phenomenal universe. {FN16-6} Man, one
by one, escapes from creation's prison of duality as he awakens to consciousness of his inseverable
divine unity with the Creator.

Master enlarged my understanding not only of astrology but of the world's scriptures. Placing
the holy texts on the spotless table of his mind, he was able to dissect them with the scalpel
of intuitive reasoning, and to separate errors and interpolations of scholars from the truths
as originally expressed by the prophets.

"Fix one's vision on the end of the nose." This inaccurate interpretation of a BHAGAVAD GITA
stanza, {FN16-7} widely accepted by Eastern pundits and Western translators, used to arouse
Master's droll criticism.

"The path of a yogi is singular enough as it is," he remarked. "Why counsel him that he must
also make himself cross-eyed? The true meaning of NASIKAGRAM is 'origin of the nose, not 'end
of the nose.' The nose begins at the point between the two eyebrows, the seat of spiritual
vision." {FN16-8} Because of one SANKHYA {FN16-9} aphorism, "ISWAR-ASHIDHA,"-"A Lord of Creation
cannot be deduced" or "God is not proved," {FN16-10}--many scholars call the whole philosophy
atheistical.

"The verse is not nihilistic," Sri Yukteswar explained. "It merely signifies that to the unenlightened
man, dependent on his senses for all final judgments, proof of God must remain unknown and
therefore non-existent. True SANKHYA followers, with unshakable insight born of meditation,
understand that the Lord is both existent and knowable."
