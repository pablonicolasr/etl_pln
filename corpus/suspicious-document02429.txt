FRENCH SETTLEMENT IN WISCONSIN.

Settlement was not the object of the French in the Northwest. The authorities saw as clearly
as do we that the field was too vast for the resources of the colony, and they desired to hold
the region as a source of peltries, and contract their settlements. The only towns worthy of
the name in the Northwest were Detroit and the settlements in Indiana and Illinois, all of
which depended largely on the fur trade.[144] But in spite of the government the traffic also
produced the beginnings of settlement in Wisconsin. About the middle of the century, Augustin
de Langlade had made Green Bay his trading post. After Pontiac's war,[145] Charles de Langlade[146]
made the place his permanent residence, and a little settlement grew up. At Prairie du Chien
French traders annually met the Indians, and at this time there may have been a stockaded trading
post there, but it was not a permanent settlement until the close of the Revolutionary war.
Chequamegon bay was deserted[147] at the outbreak of the French war. There may have been a
regular trading post at Milwaukee in this period, but the first trader recorded is not until
1762.[148] Doubtless wintering posts existed at other points in Wisconsin.

The characteristic feature of French occupancy of the Northwest was the trading post, and in
illustration of it, and of the centralized administration of the French, the following account
of De Repentigny's fort at Sault Ste. Marie (Michigan) is given in the words of Governor La
Jonquière to the minister for the colonies in 1751:[149]

"He arrived too late last year at the Sault Ste. Marie to fortify himself well; however, he
secured himself in a sort of fort large enough to receive the traders of Missilimakinac....
He employed his hired men during the whole winter in cutting 1100 pickets of fifteen feet for
his fort, with the doublings, and the timber necessary for the construction of three houses,
one of them thirty feet long by twenty wide, and two others twenty-five feet long and the same
width as the first. His fort is entirely furnished with the exception of a redoubt of oak,
which he is to have made twelve feet square, and which shall reach the same distance above
the gate of the fort. His fort is 110 feet square.

"As for the cultivation of the lands, the Sieur de Repentigny has a bull, two bullocks, three
cows, two heifers, one horse and a mare from Missilimakinac.... He has engaged a Frenchman
who married at Sault Ste. Marie an Indian woman to take a farm; they have cleared it and sowed
it, and without a frost they will gather 30 to 35 sacks of corn. The said Sieur de Repentigny
so much feels it his duty to devote himself to the cultivation of these lands that he has already
entered into a bargain for two slaves[150] whom he will employ to take care of the corn[151]
that he will gather upon these lands."

[Footnote 151: The French minister for the colonies expressing approval of this post writes
in 1752: "As it can hardly be expected that any other grain than corn will grow there, it is
necessary at least for a while to stick to it, and not to persevere stubbornly in trying to
raise wheat." On this Dr. E.D. Neill comments: "Millions of bushels of wheat from the region
west and north of Lake Superior pass every year ... through the ship canal at Sault Ste. Marie."
The corn was for supplying the voyageurs.]

THE TRADERS' STRUGGLE TO RETAIN THEIR TRADE.

While they had been securing the trade of the far Northwest and the Illinois country, the French
had allowed the English to gain the trade of the upper Ohio,[152] and were now brought face
to face with the danger of losing the entire Northwest, and thus the connection of Canada and
Louisiana. The commandants of the western posts were financially as well as patriotically interested.
In 1754, Green Bay, then garrisoned by an officer, a sergeant and four soldiers, required for
the Indian trade of its department thirteen canoes of goods annually, costing about 7000 livres
each, making a total of nearly $18,000.[153] Bougainville asserts that Marin, the commandant
of the department of the Bay, was associated in trade with the governor and intendant, and
that his part netted him annually 15,000 francs.

When it became necessary for the French to open hostilities with the English traders in the
Ohio country, it was the Wisconsin trader, Charles de Langlade, with his Chippeway Indians,
who in 1752 fell upon the English trading post at Pickawillany and destroyed the center of
English trade in the Ohio region.[154] The leaders in the opening of the war that ensued were
Northwestern traders. St. Pierre, who commanded at Fort Le Boeuf when Washington appeared with
his demands from the Governor of Virginia that the French should evacuate the Ohio country,
had formerly been the trader in command at Lake Pepin on the upper Mississippi.[155] Coulon
de Villiers, who captured Washington at Fort Necessity, was the son of the former commandant
at Green Bay.[156] Beaujeau, who led the French troops to the defeat of Braddock, had been
an officer in the Fox wars.[157] It was Charles de Langlade who commanded the Indians and was
chiefly responsible for the success of the ambuscade.[158] Wisconsin Indians, representing
almost all the tribes, took part with the French in the war.[159] Traders passed to and from
their business to the battlefields of the East. For example, De Repentigny, whose post at Sault
Ste. Marie has been described, was at Michillimackinac in January, 1755, took part in the battle
of Lake George in the fall of that year, formed a partnership to continue the trade with a
trader of Michillimackinac in 1756, was at that place in 1758, and in 1759 fought with Montcalm
on the heights of Abraham.[160] It was not without a struggle that the traders yielded their
beaver country.

THE ENGLISH AND THE NORTHWEST. INFLUENCE OF THE INDIAN TRADE ON DIPLOMACY.

In the meantime what was the attitude of the English toward the Northwest? In 1720 Governor
Spotswood of Virginia wrote:[161] "The danger which threatens these, his Maj'ty's Plantations,
from this new Settlement is also very considerable, for by the communication which the French
may maintain between Canada and Mississippi by the conveniency of the Lakes, they do in a manner
surround all the British Plantations. They have it in their power by these Lakes and the many
Rivers running into them and into the Mississippi to engross all the Trade of the Indian Nations
w'ch are now supplied from hence."

Cadwallader Colden, Surveyor-General of New York, says in 1724: "New France (as the French
now claim) extends from the mouth of the Mississippi to the mouth of the River St. Lawrence,
by which the French plainly shew their intention of enclosing the British Settlements and cutting
us off from all Commerce with the numerous Nations of Indians that are everywhere settled over
the vast continent of North America."[162] As time passed, as population increased, and as
the reports of the traders extolled the fertility of the country, both the English and the
French, but particularly the Americans, began to consider it from the standpoint of colonization
as well as from that of the fur trade.[163] The Ohio Company had both settlement and the fur
trade in mind,[164] and the French Governor, Galissonière, at the same period urged that France
ought to plant a colony in the Ohio region.[165] After the conquest of New France by England
there was still the question whether she should keep Canada and the Northwest.[166] Franklin,
urging her to do so, offered as one argument the value of the fur trade, intrinsically and
as a means of holding the Indians in check. Discussing the question whether the interior regions
of America would ever be accessible to English settlement and so to English manufactures, he
pointed out the vastness of our river and lake system, and the fact that Indian trade already
permeated the interior. In interesting comparison he called their attention to the fact that
English commerce reached along river systems into the remote parts of Europe, and that in ancient
times the Levant had carried on a trade with the distant interior.[167]

That the value of the fur trade was an important element in inducing the English to retain
Canada is shown by the fact that Great Britain no sooner came into the possession of the country
than she availed herself of the fields for which she had so long intrigued. In a report of
the Lords Commissioners for Trade and Plantations in 1772 we find the attitude of the English
government clearly set forth in these words:[175]

"The great object of colonization upon the continent of North America has been to improve and
extend the commerce and manufactures of this kingdom.... It does appear to us that the extension
of the fur trade depends entirely upon the Indians being undisturbed in the possession of their
hunting grounds, and that all colonization does in its nature and must in its consequence operate
to the prejudice of that branch of commerce.... Let the savages enjoy their deserts in quiet.
Were they driven from their forests the peltry trade would decrease."

In a word, the English government attempted to adopt the western policy of the French. From
one point of view it was a successful policy. The French traders took service under the English,
and in the Revolutionary war Charles de Langlade led the Wisconsin Indians to the aid of Hamilton
against George Rogers Clark,[176] as he had before against the British, and in the War of 1812
the British trader Robert Dickson repeated this movement.[177] As in the days of Begon, "the
savages took the part of those with whom they traded." The secret proposition of Vergennes,
in the negotiations preceding the treaty of 1783, to limit the United States by the Alleghanies
and to give the Northwest to England, while reserving the rest of the region between the mountains
and the Mississippi as Indian territory under Spanish protection,[178] would have given the
fur trade to these nations.[179] In the extensive discussions over the diplomacy whereby the
Northwest was included within the limits of the United States, it has been asserted that we
won our case by the chartered claims of the colonies and by George Rogers Clark's conquest
of the Illinois country. It appears, however, that in fact Franklin, who had been a prominent
member and champion of the Ohio Company, and who knew the West from personal acquaintance,
had persuaded Shelburne to cede it to us as a part of a liberal peace that should effect a
reconciliation between the two countries. Shelburne himself looked upon the region from the
point of view of the fur trade simply, and was more willing to make this concession than he
was some others. In the discussion over the treaty in Parliament in 1783, the Northwestern
boundary was treated almost solely from the point of view of the fur trade and of the desertion
of the Indians. The question was one of profit and loss in this traffic. One member attacked
Shelburne on the ground that, "not thinking the naked independence a sufficient proof of his
liberality to the United States, he had clothed it with the warm covering of our fur trade."
Shelburne defended his cession "on the fair rule of the value of the district ceded,"[180]
and comparing exports and imports and the cost of administration, he concluded that the fur
trade of the Northwest was not of sufficient value to warrant continuing the war. The most
valuable trade, he argued, was north of the line, and the treaty merely applied sound economic
principles and gave America "a share in the trade." The retention of her Northwestern posts
by Great Britain at the close of the war, in contravention of the treaty, has an obvious relation
to the fur trade. In his negotiations with Hammond, the British ambassador in 1791, Secretary
of State Jefferson said: "By these proceedings we have been intercepted entirely from the commerce
of furs with the Indian nations to the northward--a commerce which had ever been of great importance
to the United States, not only for its intrinsic value, but as it was the means of cherishing
peace with these Indians, and of superseding the necessity of that expensive warfare which
we have been obliged to carry on with them during the time that these posts have been in other
hands."[181]
