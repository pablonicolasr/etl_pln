CHAPTER I.

THE LITTLE COLOUR GRINDER

IT was a bright morning of early April, many hundred years ago; and through all the fields
and meadows of Normandy the violets and cuckoo-buds were just beginning to peep through the
tender green of the young grass. The rows of tall poplar-trees that everywhere, instead of
fences, served to mark off the farms of the country folk, waved in the spring wind like great,
pale green plumes; and among their branches the earliest robins and field-fares were gaily
singing as a little boy stepped out from a small thatched cottage standing among the fields,
and took his way along the highroad.

That Gabriel Viaud was a peasant lad, any one could have told from the blouse of blue homespun,
and the wooden shoes which he wore; and that he felt the gladness of the April time could easily
be known by the happy little song he began to sing to himself, and by the eager delight with
which he now and then stooped to pluck a blue violet or to gather a handful of golden cuckoo-buds.

A mile or two behind him, and hidden by a bend in the road, lay the little village of St. Martin-de-Bouchage;
while in the soft blue distance ahead of him rose the gray walls of St. Martin's Abbey, whither
he was going.

Indeed, for almost a year now the little boy had been trudging every day to the Abbey, where
he earned a small sum by waiting upon the good brothers who dwelt there, and who made the beautiful
painted books for which the Abbey had become famous. Gabriel could grind and mix their colours
for them, and prepare the parchment on which they did their writing, and could do many other
little things that helped them in their work.

The lad enjoyed his tasks at the Abbey, and, above all, delighted in seeing the beautiful things
at which the brothers were always busy; yet, as he now drew near the gateway, he could not
help but give a little sigh, for it was so bright and sunny out-of-doors. He smiled, though,
as he looked at the gay bunches of blossoms with which he had quite filled his hands, and felt
that at least he was taking a bit of the April in with him, as he crossed the threshold and
entered a large room.

"Good morrow, Gabriel," called out several voices as he came in, for the lad was a general
favourite with the brothers; and Gabriel, respectfully taking off his blue peasant cap, gave
a pleasant "good morrow" to each.
