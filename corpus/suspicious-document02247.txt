Seth Wilmarth

Little is known of the builder of the Pioneer, Seth Wilmarth, and nothing in the way of a satisfactory
history of his business is available. For the reader's general interest the following information
is noted.[16]

Seth Wilmarth was born in Brattleboro, Vermont, on September 8, 1810. He is thought to have
learned the machinist trade in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, before coming to Boston and working
for the Boston Locomotive Works, Hinkley and Drury proprietors. In about 1836 he opened a machine
shop and, encouraged by an expanding business, in 1841 he built a new shop in South Boston
which became known as the Union Works.[17] Wilmarth was in the general machine business but
his reputation was made in the manufacture of machine tools, notably lathes. He is believed
to have built his first locomotive in 1842, but locomotive building never became his main line
of work. Wilmarth patterned his engines after those of Hinkley and undoubtedly, in common with
the other New England builders of this period, favored the steady-riding, inside-connection
engines. The "Shanghais," so-called because of their great height, built for the Boston and
Worcester Railroad by Wilmarth in 1849, were among the best known inside-connection engines
operated in this country (fig. 14). While the greater part of Wilmarth's engines was built
for New England roads, many were constructed for lines outside that area, including the Pennsylvania
Railroad, Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Erie.

A comparison of the surviving illustrations of Hinkley and Wilmarth engines of the 1850's reveals
a remarkable similarity in their details (figs. 14 and 15). Notice particularly the straight
boiler, riveted frame, closely set truck wheels, feedwater pump driven by a pin on the crank
of the driving wheel, and details of the dome cover. All of the features are duplicated exactly
by both builders. This is not surprising considering the proximity of the plants and the fact
that Wilmarth had been previously employed by Hinkley.

In 1854 Wilmarth was engaged by the New York and Erie Railroad to build fifty 6-foot gauge
engines.[18] After work had been started on these engines, and a large store of material had
been purchased for their construction, Wilmarth was informed that the railroad could not pay
cash but that he would have to take notes in payment.[19] There was at this time a mild economic
panic and notes could be sold only at a heavy discount. This crisis closed the Union Works.
The next year, 1855, Seth Wilmarth was appointed master mechanic of the Charlestown Navy Yard,
Boston, where he worked for twenty years. He died in Malden, Massachusetts, on November 5, 1886.

locomotives by C. H. Caruthers were printed with several errors concerning the locomotives
of the Cumberland Valley Railroad and prompted the preparation of these present remarks on
the history of Wilmarth's activities. Note that on page 359 it is reported that only one compensating-lever
engine was built for the C.V.R.R. in 1854, and not two such engines in 1852. The Pioneer is
incorrectly identified as a "Shanghai," and as being one of three such engines built in 1871
by Wilmarth.
