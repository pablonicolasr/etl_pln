Mary Liddiard, by W.H.G. Kingston.

Mary is the daughter of a missionary somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.  It is towards the end
of the eighteenth century.  Some but not all of the natives on the island have been converted.
The author expounds at great length on the central truth of Christianity.

There is an attack by the natives of another island, which Mary and her friends survive by
hiding in a cave.  Later they are obliged to leave the island by canoe.  There is a great storm,
but they survive it, being picked up by an English missionary vessel.  There is a happy ending,
with a great family reunion.

MARY LIDDIARD, BY W.H.G. KINGSTON.

CHAPTER ONE.

A MISSIONARY STATION IN AN ISLAND OF THE PACIFIC DESCRIBED.--THE GIRLS' SCHOOL SUPERINTENDED
BY MRS LIDDIARD, HER DAUGHTER MARY, AND LITTLE MAUD.--MARY LIDDIARD'S NARRATIVE.--INTRODUCE
TO MY READERS LISELE, THE CHIEF'S DAUGHTER, ONE OF OUR PUPILS.--MY MOTHER EXPLAINS THE GOSPEL
TO HER.

These words were ascending from the lips of a number of dark skinned girls assembled round
a fair haired English lady in a building thickly thatched with the leaves of the sugar cane,
beneath the shade of a grove of tall cocoanut trees, in one of the many far off beautiful islands
of the wide Pacific.  The building, erected by the natives after their own fashion, was the
school-house of a missionary station lately established by Mr Liddiard, and the lady was his
devoted wife.  It stood upon a platform of coral-stone, raised about two feet from the ground,
while the roof projected a considerable distance beyond the walls, and was supported by stout
posts formed of the bread-fruit tree, tightly bound to the rafters by ropes of sinnet.

After the conclusion of the hymn of praise--a sound unwonted in that long benighted region,
whose groves had hitherto echoed only with the shouts and wild laughter of the savage heathens,
as they performed their barbarous rites, and the shrieks and groans of their victims--the pupils
grouped themselves round Mrs Liddiard on the mats with which the floor was spread.

They were of various ages; some were children, others full grown young women.  All kept their
eyes fixed on her attentively, as if anxious to understand every word she said.  Some were
clothed in light cotton dresses, their black hair neatly braided and ornamented with a few
sweet scented wild flowers, while others were habited in garments of native cloth, formed from
the paper mulberry tree.

By the side of Mrs Liddiard sat, on low stools, two young girls, whose light complexions contrasted
with that of their dark skinned sisters. Though she spoke in the native language, the two English
girls understood her perfectly, and appeared to be as attentive as their companions, and anxious
to set a good example to the rest.  One of them, with black hair, called little Maud, who seemed
to be about eleven years old, had a grave expression of countenance; the other, Mrs Liddiard's
daughter Mary, was very like her mother, with light hair and blue eyes, full of animation and
intelligence.

On one side of the house the ground sloped away down to a beach seen between the Pandanus and
cocoanut trees, of fine white sand fringing a calm lagoon of the deepest blue, beyond which
appeared a long line of foaming breakers, ever dashing against a coral reef, which extended
parallel with the coast as far as the eye could reach.  On the other side rose the steep sides
of a range of rocky and picturesque mountains, clothed to their summits with the richest and
densest foliage, numberless creepers climbing up the trees, and hanging from branch to branch,
while here and there, amid openings of the forest, several sparkling cascades came rushing
down from the far off heights, now falling in sheets of glittering foam, now dashing from ledge
to ledge, and at length making their way into the lagoon.

Near the girls' school-house was a building of considerably larger dimensions, and of much
greater height, with numerous windows and a porch.  It was the mission chapel erected by the
native Christians.  At a short distance from it was Mr Liddiard's residence, a neat cottage
with a broad verandah in front, partaking more of the European style than any of the other
edifices.

Under the shade of the trees were numerous huts, inhabited by the converts, who had left their
former homes and gathered round their pastor.  Among them was a hut somewhat larger than the
rest, which had been built by the zealous native teacher Nanari, who had come from a distant
island to bring the glad tidings of salvation to the people; and undaunted by the opposition
of the heathens, had long laboured alone, until the arrival of Mr Liddiard, under whom he now
acted as catechist and assistant.

Notwithstanding the unceasing exertions and prayers of Nanari, aided by his faithful wife,
and of Mr and Mrs Liddiard, comparatively few of the natives had as yet been gathered into
Christ's fold.  The greater part of the island was inhabited by fierce heathens, who still
carried on frequent wars against each other; and angry with their countrymen for having abandoned
the faith of their forefathers, constantly threatened them and the missionaries with destruction.

In spite of the dangers which surrounded him, Mr Liddiard continued dauntlessly to labour to
win souls to Christ, knowing well in whom he trusted; and that although it might not be allowed
to him while on earth to see the fruit of his toils, yet that a rich harvest would some day
be reaped.

The missionary's life was not an idle one.  When not engaged in preaching the gospel or in
giving instruction to his converts, he was compelled to work with his hands to obtain his daily
food, and he and Nanari, with the young men who had become Christians, were engaged in the
taro grounds or in their gardens, attending to the cultivation of the bread-fruit tree, yams,
casavas, sweet potatoes, and other vegetables.  He had also built his own house, and manufactured
his furniture, and had every day some manual work to perform besides being engaged in studying
the language and translating the Bible and other works, for the instruction of the natives.
Thus, from morning till night, he and his wife were actively employed.  Although Mary and little
Maud could now give them some assistance in household matters, the young girls themselves required
instruction, which also occupied a portion of their time.  Maud was not their own child, though
they had educated her, for she was friendless and destitute, and they loved her as a daughter.

To return to the school-house I have described.  I should say that I was the Mary I have mentioned,
the missionary's daughter.  I will tell more about little Maud by-and-by.  We used to act as
assistant teachers to my mother.  As soon as the address she had given was over we went among
the girls to answer any questions they might put to us, or to help in their tasks.

"Malay," said a girl at the further end of the room, near whom I had seated myself (`Malay'
was the name the natives always called me).  "I wish to know if your God always sees you."

"Yes, indeed, He does," I answered.  "He sees and knows everything I think and say and do."

"Then I would rather not lotu," she said.  "Because I don't think that the gods of my people
know what they do, or what they think or say, and I am very sure that I shall wish to do many
things which might displease them.  Not long ago I laughed and jeered at them, and I am sure
that they did not find me out."

The term "lotu," I should explain, is used by the natives to signify changing their religion,
or becoming Christians.

"But our God, Jehovah, is above all gods.  He made the world and all the human race, and He
therefore knows everything that you and all heathen people do and say and think.  The darkness
is no darkness with Him, and the day and night to Him are both alike," I answered.  "But come
to mother, Lisele, and she will explain the matter to you more clearly than I can do."

Lisele was the daughter of a heathen chief, who was very well disposed towards the Christians;
and although he would not lotu himself, he allowed Lisele, who was very intelligent, and possessed
an inquiring mind, to attend the school.  She was about two years older than I was, and I think
any one who had seen her dressed in her costume of native cloth of the finest texture, with
a wreath of white flowers in her raven hair, would have thought her very pretty.  She was as
yet imperfectly instructed in Christian truth, and possessed of high spirits and an independent
will--a mere child of nature.  It was evidently necessary to treat her with the greatest caution
to prevent her running away from us and rejoining her former heathen associates.

Lisele, taking my hand, came and sat down at my mother's feet, and I then put the question
that she had asked me.  "Yes, indeed, Lisele," said my mother.  "Jehovah not only sees all
you do, and hears all you say, but knows every thought which is passing through your mind,
and if you think anything that is wrong, and utter even a careless word, He is grieved at it.
He is so pure and holy that even the bright heavens are not clean in His sight; and were He
to treat us as we deserve, when we indulged for a moment in an evil thought, or departed in
the slightest degree from the truth, He might justly punish us; but He is merciful, kind, and
long-suffering, and thus He allows sinners to continue in life, to give them an opportunity
of repenting and turning to Him."

"Then there would be no use for my father and all the chiefs and people whom I know to lotu,
for they have done over and over again all sorts of things which you have told me Jehovah hates,"
remarked Lisele.  `The blood of Jesus Christ,' I repeat, `cleanseth from all sin.'"

The Indian girl stood with her eyes open, gazing at my mother, and lost with astonishment at
what she had heard.

"But surely we must do something to gain this great favour from God.  We must labour and toil
for Him.  We must pay Him all we have in recompense for the bad things we have done, that have
offended Him so much," she exclaimed.

"No! we poor weak creatures have nothing to do.  We could do nothing to make amends for the
ill we have done, to blot out our sins; and all the wealth we possess could not recompense
God, for all things are His.  But the debt has been paid for us by Jesus, he became our surety,
and when we go to Him, and trust to Him, and pray to Him, as He is now seated at the right
hand of God, He acts the part of our advocate, and pleads for us with God, urging that He Himself
paid the debt, and, therefore, that we have nothing to pay and nothing to do.  God in His mercy
has promised a free and full pardon to all who trust to Him.  `Pardon for sin is the gift of
God,' and the King who makes the present requires nothing in return but gratitude and love
and obedience."

"I think I understand," said Lisele.  "If my father was to conquer another tribe who had offended
him, and, instead of putting them to death, was to pardon them all, and to give them a country
rich in bread-fruit trees and taro grounds, they would be bound to love and serve Him, and
give Him the best produce of their lands."

"Exactly," said my mother.  "But Jehovah does not require the fruits of the earth, for `all
things are His.'  What He wants is the willing obedience of His creatures.  He wishes them
to obey His laws, to be kind, and merciful, and courteous, and pitiful, to all their fellows,
not returning evil for evil, but good for evil, and endeavouring to make known His name and
His power and goodness to all those who do not know it.  That we may know His will, when Jesus
Christ came into the world to die for man, He set us the example we are to follow.  Then as
our hearts are prone to evil, and Satan is ever going about seeking to mislead us, He has sent
His Holy Spirit to instruct our minds, to support us and help us to withstand the deceits of
Satan."

"Then I think it must be Satan who makes my people fight with each other, and do all sorts
of things that you tell me God's Book says are so wrong," exclaimed Lisele.  "I must try and
persuade my father to worship Jehovah, and then, perhaps, the Holy Spirit you tell me of will
prevent him from spending his life in fighting and killing people.  It has always seemed to
me a very bad thing to do, and that it would be much better if people would live together in
peace, and dance and sing and amuse themselves without the constant fear of being attacked
by their enemies and killed."

"Undoubtedly, my dear girl, if anyone turns to Jehovah, trusting to Jesus Christ, and seeks
the aid of the Holy Spirit whom He has promised to send, he will be enabled to do His will.
God cannot lie.  Everything He has promised He will fulfil," answered my mother.  "I pray that
you will be enabled to explain this matter to the chief, your father."

"Yes! yes! that I will," cried Lisele.  "Till this moment I did not understand it.  I thought
that it must be a very difficult thing to serve Jehovah, and that those who had done anything
to offend Him were to toil and work to the end of their days, and even then have very little
chance of being received into favour."

"Satan tries to persuade man that such is the case, that he may turn his eyes away from the
all-sufficient atonement made by Christ on Calvary, and prevent him from trusting to that,
and that alone," said my mother. "Satan hates the atonement, because it is that which destroys
his power, and he cares nothing when people try to be good, and try to please God, trusting
to themselves, provided they have no faith in the atoning sacrifice of Christ, in the all-cleansing
power of His blood," observed my mother.  "If you will reflect, my dear girl, on the fact that
God made us and gives us all the blessings we enjoy, and that consequently we owe Him everything,
you will see that nothing we do can make amends to Him for the sins we have committed, because
if we were to devote every moment of our lives to His service we should only be doing our duty.
Then again, a sin which has been committed cannot be undone; so it is written against us in
the great book prepared for the day of judgment.  God is so pure and holy that even the heavens
are not clean in His sight, and He is so just that He cannot forgive sin; we only mock Him
when we ask Him to forgive us our sins, if we plead our own merits, because, as I have shown
you, we cannot possibly have any merits to plead--all our merits are but as filthy rags, they
cannot cover up our vileness and sinfulness.  But then Jehovah is all merciful as well as just,
and He has, therefore, formed that blessed plan of salvation, the gospel plan, just suited
to our wants, by which we can take advantage of the all perfect merits of Jesus Christ, and
make them our own--our vileness being covered up by His righteousness, our nakedness clothed
with His pure and spotless robes, so that Jehovah does not see our sins; they are put away
as far as the east is from the west; they are blotted out of the great book of remembrance.
This is done immediately the sinner trusts in the Saviour.  It is not to be done.  All the
work was done on Calvary, when Jesus cried, `It is finished!'  All that God requires is that
the sinner should take advantage of that work finished by Jesus, by trusting to Him alone,
thus becoming completely qualified for heaven.  May God, the Holy Spirit, enable you to understand
this truth."

The Indian girl sat down, and for some time appeared lost in thought; then starting up with
the impetuous manner which her ardent disposition made her assume, she asked, in her native
tongue, "Then if I believe that Jesus Christ, the sinless Son of Jehovah, left the glories
of heaven, and became man, and suffered a fearful death on the cross, His precious blood being
then shed, and that He suffered this punishment instead of me, and that God's justice is thereby
satisfied, am I no longer to fear punishment?  Does God no more look at my sins?  Am I received
into His favour?  Oh then how grateful ought I to be to God, how much ought I to love Jehovah's
kind Son, how ought I to try to serve and obey and please Him!"

"Yes, indeed, Lisele, if you thus trust in Christ, if you believe that His blood was shed for
you, that you are sprinkled with it, you may be assured that God has taken you into favour,
that He has blotted out all your sins, and that when you leave this world you will be received
into that glorious heaven which He has prepared for all those who love Him."

"Oh, I am sure what you tell me is true," exclaimed the Indian girl, clasping her hands, while
a look of joy irradiated her countenance.  "I long to know more of that kind and merciful Jesus,
and love Him and serve Him.  I must go and tell my father all you have said, and get him to
come and hear himself about Jehovah.  Your religion is just what we want in this country, for
nothing else will prevent the people from fighting and murdering each other, which cannot be
pleasing to a good God, though our priests tell us that our gods delight in war and in the
human sacrifices offered to them, and encourage our warriors to kill and burn their prisoners."

"Our religion is not only suited to the inhabitants of these islands, but to people of all
countries, and at all times," said my mother.  "It is the only true religion, because it is
the only one which God has given to man, and He has sent us the Bible that we may learn what
His will is, and He pours out the Holy Spirit that we may understand and be enabled to perform
it.  And the time will come when `all kings shall fall down before Him; all nations shall serve
Him,'" (Psalm 72 verse 11.)

All the other girls had returned to their homes.  Lisele remained, eager to gain more information
about the wonderful things she had heard.  What a happy thing it would be if boys and girls
in Britain were as anxious to obtain spiritual knowledge as was the young savage girl in that
Pacific island!

CHAPTER TWO.

OUR STATION THREATENED BY HEATHEN NATIVES.--LISELE, ACCEPTING THE TRUTH, DESIRES THE CONVERSION
OF HER FATHER, AND OBTAINS PERMISSION FROM HER AUNT AND ABELA TO VISIT HIM.--I DESCRIBE OUR
VOYAGE, WHEN LITTLE MAUD WAS FOUND.--CONDITION OF THE STATION AT THE TIME WHEN MY NARRATIVE
COMMENCES.

Our little Christian settlement was truly an oasis in the wilderness. We were closely beset
by heathens, and frequently we could see them assembling on the hill side, performing their
savage dances, or threatening our destruction with fierce gestures--shaking their clubs and
spears, and shrieking and hooting wildly.

Most of the converts settled round us belonged to the tribe of Masaugu, Lisele's father; for
although he himself still remained a heathen, he did not oppose those of his people who wished
to lotu, or become Christians.

Among them was Lisele's aunt, the sister of her mother, with whom she resided, and through
her influence Lisele had first been induced to attend the school.

On the day I have spoken of, when it was time for Lisele to return to her aunt's house, she
invited me to accompany her, which my mother gave me permission to do.  She wanted me to assist
her in persuading her aunt to allow her to return to her father.

"I have been so long accustomed to speak falsehoods, that if I tell her that I wish to go she
will not believe my object," said Lisele. "Besides, she will not think it possible that so
fierce a warrior as my father will consent to lotu; but I heard your mother say the other day,
that with Jehovah nothing is impossible, and therefore I believe that if I pray that my father's
heart may be changed, he will, notwithstanding his fierceness, become a Christian."

"I am very sure that Jehovah will hear your prayers," I remarked, "if you offer them up according
to His own appointed way, through Jesus Christ; but still He will take His own good time to
bring about what you desire.  My father often says we must not expect to have our prayers answered
exactly in the way we wish.  God knows what is best, and oftentimes He does not accomplish
that which we desire; and though we cannot comprehend His reasons, still it is our duty to
pray on in faith, without ceasing.  Jehovah, too, often allows those He loves to suffer; and
though they may complain that the sufferings are very hard to bear, He will assuredly lift
them up and support them, for He has said, `My strength is made perfect in weakness,'" (2 Corinthians
12 verse 9). This conversation lasted till we reached the house of Abela, Lisele's aunt.

Abela was a woman of about forty, her face, though not handsome, and with a serious expression,
was mild and pleasing.  She was dressed in an ample petticoat, made from the fibres of the
hibiscus, while over her shoulders she wore a tippet somewhat resembling a small poncho, which
completely shrouded the upper part of her form.  Having finished the labours of the day (for
although of high rank, she was compelled, like others, to work for her support), she was seated
on a mat, with a book open on her knees, from which she was endeavouring to read.  Not having
long been a convert, she had as yet made but little progress in her studies.  She affectionately
welcomed her niece and me as we took our seats near her.  Lisele then eagerly poured forth
what she had been hearing, so rapidly, that I could scarcely follow her.

"It is all true," said Abela, when her niece at length ceased speaking. "I praise Jehovah that
you know it."

When, however, Lisele told her of her wish to go back to her father, Abela hesitated.  "He
will not understand you, my child," she exclaimed, "and perhaps will not allow you to return
to people whom he may think so foolish."

"Oh, but I'll pray for him," answered Lisele.  "I'll ask Jehovah to help me, and I know He
will hear me, so I shall not have to trust to my own strength."

Abela remained silent for some time, and I saw that she was engaged in prayer.

"You shall go, my child," she said at length.  "Jehovah will take care of you, and may He prosper
your undertaking."

Delighted at having obtained this permission, Lisele returned to spend the evening with us,
for my father wished to have an opportunity of speaking to her.  He warned her of the opposition
she must expect to meet with from her people, and of the dangers she would have to encounter,
especially as he knew that she had been sought in marriage by a young heathen chief, who might
wish to detain her.

"But now I know the truth.  I will never consent to marry one who is a heathen," she answered.
"And I do not intend to remain.  I will only try to persuade my father to visit you, and then
I will return."

Lisele set off the next day, accompanied by two Christian people of her tribe, who promised
to protect her from the heathens, and aid her return should it be opposed, even although they
might risk their lives in so doing.  We were very sorry to lose her, as we feared that efforts
would be made to prevent her returning among us.

Maud could not restrain her tears.  "I know too well how cruelly these heathens can act," she
said.  "They will not hesitate to carry her off to some distant island, whence she cannot possibly
escape; or, if she offends them by what she says, they may even kill her."  Dear Maud had indeed
had bitter experience of the barbarities often committed by the savage islanders.

My father had for some years been a missionary in another part of the Pacific, when it was
settled that he should occupy the Station where we now were.  I was too young at the time to
remember much about what occurred, so I can describe only what I have heard.  As there was
then no missionary vessel to convey us, we embarked on board a whaler, the Christian captain
of which undertook to carry us to our destination.  He was, however, unable to make a direct
passage, as he had in the prosecution of his business first to visit several other places,
still, as no other means of getting where we wished to go were likely to occur, my father was
glad to embrace the opportunity thus offered.  We had been for some time at sea when a fearful
storm arose, which compelled us to run before it under bare poles, and carried us a long way
out of our course.  The vessel received also considerable damage, losing one of her masts and
several spars.  At length a beautiful island appeared in sight, covered thickly with trees,
and directly ahead was seen a commodious harbour.  The captain therefore ran into it and came
to an anchor, that the damages which the vessel had received might be repaired.  He soon found
that it was inhabited by numerous savages, who pushed off in their canoes to visit the strange
ship.  He, however, had so long been acquainted with the treacherous character of the natives
of most of the Pacific islands, that he would allow no one to come on board, and he had also
boarding-nettings triced up to guard against any sudden attack they might venture to make.
We had on board a Sandwich islander, who managed to make himself understood by the natives.
Through his means our good captain let them know that he wished to cut down some trees, and
that he was ready to pay for permission to do so. The captain then inquired for their chief,
and said that if he would come off and receive part of the payment, the remainder would be
given after the spars had been brought on board, and as a proof of his good intentions, he
sent the chief a present of an axe and a piece of cloth. This had the desired effect; and in
a short time an old warrior came alongside in his canoe, and announced himself as the chief
of the district.  The Sandwich islander then explained what the captain wished, and certain
articles which had been agreed on were given to him, he undertaking, while the trees were being
cut down and carried off, to keep his people at a distance to prevent the possibility of any
dispute arising.

As soon as the chief and his followers had returned to the shore, two boats' crews, well armed,
put off, and while one party were engaged in felling the trees, the other remained drawn up
to guard against any attack which the natives might treacherously venture to make.  The spars
having been brought on board, the old chief returned for the promised remainder of the payment.
He seemed highly pleased with the transaction.

"I see that you are wise and just people," he observed.  "If all whites who come to our shores
acted in the same way, we would be their friends; but it has not been always so, and after
they have ill-treated and cheated us, we have been tempted to take advantage of their folly
and carelessness to revenge ourselves."

This remark induced the captain, through the interpreter, to make inquiries as to what the
chief alluded to.  At length he learned that some time before a vessel, with white people on
board, had come into the harbour to obtain sandal wood; that after the natives had supplied
a large quantity, sufficient to fill her, the captain had refused the promised payment; but,
in spite of this, that the crew were allowed to go on shore and wander about in small parties,
when some of them had quarrelled with the natives and ill-treated them.  In consequence the
sailors had been set upon, and killed every man of them.  A party of warriors then put off
for the ship, and pretending they had come to trade, clambered up her sides before the part
of the crew who had remained on board had heard of the massacre, or suspected their intentions.
The savages thus taking them at a disadvantage, put every person to death, with the exception
of a woman and child, who were saved by the intervention of the old chief.  The vessel, it
appeared, by some accident, caught fire, and had been utterly destroyed.

The captain, on hearing this, made eager inquiries about the poor woman and the child.  The
former, however, had, he found soon afterwards, died, leaving the little girl in possession
of the chief.

Instead of threatening the old chief with the vengeance of his people, as some might have done,
he spoke to him gently, saying that he himself had not come there as a judge, or to take vengeance
for injuries which other white men might have received, but that we wished to know whether
he would be ready to give up the little girl he had under his care.  The old man seemed very
much struck by this style of address, and confessed that the child was still living with him,
but that he was very fond of her, and that when she grew up he hoped that she might become
the wife of one of his sons.

This of course made the captain still more anxious to recover her, and he used every argument
he could think of to induce the old man to give her up.  He told him that, unaccustomed to
the mode of life of his people, she would probably die, as her mother had done, and that if
he really loved her, he would be anxious for her safety, and that though he had paid him liberally
for the trees, he would give him twice the amount of goods if he would, without delay, bring
the little girl on board. This last argument seemed to weigh greatly with the chief, and he
said he would think about it, and returned on shore, leaving us in doubt, however, what he
would do.

Our anxiety about the poor girl was, as may be supposed, very great. The men, on hearing of
the matter, came aft, and each one said that he would be ready to contribute some article to
induce the chief to give her up.  Some even proposed, that should he refuse, to land and compel
him to do so by force of arms.  The captain thanked them for their zeal, but told them that
that was not the way he conceived Christian men should act.

I well remember that evening, when we were assembled to worship God as usual, in the cabin,
how my father lifted up his voice in prayer, that the heart of the chief might be moved to
restore the little Christian damsel to those who would bring her "up in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord," and that she might be saved from the fearful fate the old man intended for her.
God never fails to listen to the prayers of believers.

The next morning, as we anxiously turned our eyes towards the shore, the chief's canoe was
seen coming off.

"Our prayer has been answered," exclaimed my father, who was watching it through a spy-glass.
"There is a child by his side."

The sailors sprang into the rigging, and every one on board eagerly watched the approach of
the canoe.  It was soon alongside, and the little girl we had been looking for was handed up
on deck, followed by the old chief.  She was dressed in a clean white frock, and her hair was
neatly braided, and ornamented with flowers and feathers; but she looked thin and ill, and
sadly scared.  When my mother approached the gangway she flew towards her, and threw herself
into her arms, as if she was sure that she should find in her a loving friend.

"Mamma! mamma!" she exclaimed; but she could utter no other words; and had it not been for
those sounds we should have supposed that she had lost the power of speech.  My mother could
not restrain her tears, as she held the forlorn little creature to her heart.

Such was the way in which we met with little Maud.

Nothing would induce her to leave my mother while the old chief remained on board; and although
he and his people might have treated her kindly, they certainly had not won her love.

Having received the promised reward, to which the captain added a few other articles, the chief
prepared to take his departure, evidently very well satisfied with the transaction.  The captain,
however, warned him, that should he venture to attack another vessel he would not escape a
severe punishment; but that if he would promise to behave well towards white people in future,
they would come and trade with him, and bring him a greater blessing than he could at present
comprehend.  The captain said this, because he hoped that some day he might be able to convey
a missionary to the place, that he might spread the blessings of the gospel among the heathen
inhabitants.

After the ship was refitted we put to sea, but she was some time engaged in catching whales,
so that our voyage was a very long one.  The little girl who had been rescued from the savages
was utterly unable to explain anything that had happened to her.

Weeks passed away, and not a word did she utter, and my father and mother began to fear that
the hardships she had gone through had deprived her of her senses.  For a long time she could
not be induced to leave my mother's side, and seemed to mistrust every one else.  If separated
from her, even for a few moments, she would run back again, and seizing her gown, glance up
with an imploring look, as if begging to be protected from some imaginary danger--she would
not even trust herself with me, and seemed to fancy that I might hurt her.  Possibly she might
have been ill-treated by the native children, and was unable to distinguish the difference.
Gentle and careful treatment, however, had its due effect on her, and her fears were gradually
allayed.

At length one day she, of her own accord, took my hand, and looking into my face said, "Girl
not hurt poor Maud."  These were the first words we had heard her utter.  Until then also we
were ignorant of her name.

Putting my arms round her neck I kissed her, and answered, "No indeed I will not hurt you,
but I will treat you as a dear sister, and love you very very much."

A faint smile passed over her countenance, as if she comprehended my answer.  After that she
would remain contentedly with me--still her mind, for some time longer, continued apparently
in the same state as at first.  My father and mother, however, felt sure that her senses would
ultimately be restored.  They were not mistaken; but even when she had begun to speak, she
made no allusion to the circumstances of the massacre, or her life among the natives, and we
forbore to ask her any questions.

When at last we landed here, her alarm at seeing the natives was very great, and my father
was afraid that it would cause her mind to relapse into its former state.  By doing all we
could to re-assure and cheer her, no ill effects occurred.  When once we were settled, and
she had got accustomed to the scenery, and the appearance of the people, her improvement was
more rapid.  In course of time her mind and bodily health were perfectly restored.  On seeing
me at my lessons, she showed a strong wish to join me, and though she had forgotten even her
letters, if she had ever known them, she made rapid progress, so that she was soon able to
read fluently, when she eagerly perused every book my father would allow her to have from his
library.  Even then, however, she could give no account of her former life, and we knew no
more of little Maud than at first.  My father and mother treated her as they would a daughter,
while I looked upon her and loved her as a younger sister.

We had now been upwards of three years at the Station.  My father had laboured on in faith,
as a missionary in all regions must be prepared to do, for as yet only the comparatively small
body of Christians as I have mentioned, who had settled round us, had been brought out of heathenism,
while the larger number of the population appeared even more hostile to the new faith than
at first.  Still my father would often say, when he felt himself inclined to despond, "Let
us recollect the value of one immortal soul, and all our toils and troubles will appear as
nothing." Such was the state of things at the mission station when my history commences.

CHAPTER THREE.

THE ISLANDS OF THE PACIFIC DESCRIBED.--MY MOTHER'S ILLNESS.--NASILE, A MESSENGER FROM LISELE,
COMES TO THE SETTLEMENT, FOLLOWED SHORTLY BY LISLETE AND MASAUGU, WHO PROMISES TO LOTU AFTER
HE HAS DEFEATED HIS ENEMIES.--MY FATHER WARNS HIM IN VAIN OF THE FEARFUL DANGER HE RUNS BY
PUTTING OFF BECOMING A CHRISTIAN.

The vast Pacific--in one of the islands of which the events I am describing occurred--presents
a wide and hopeful field for missionary enterprise.  It is scattered over with numberless islands--in
most cases so clustered together as to form separate groups--some rising in lofty mountains
out of the sea, surrounded by coral reefs, beautiful and picturesque in the extreme, while
others are elevated but a few feet above the ocean, generally having palm trees growing on
them.  These latter are known more particularly as coral and lagoon islands.  The islands of
the character I have last mentioned have been produced by the gradual sinking of the land beneath
the ocean, when on its reaching a certain depth, countless millions of coral insects have built
their habitations on it, and have continued building till they reached the surface--the new
islands consequently keeping the forms of the submerged lands which serve as their foundations.
The lagoon islands have been formed by the insects building round the edge of some submerged
crater. As the land sank the creatures have continued to build upwards, and thus a ring of
coral rock has arisen in the ocean--sometimes complete, at others with a break or opening in
it.  In other instances the coral insects have built near the shore, and as the land has sunk
they have continued to build upwards, but in consequence of requiring the pure salt water,
have not advanced towards the land, which, however, still sinking, a wide space of water has
appeared between it and the structure raised by them.  This is the cause of the numerous encircling
reefs which are found around so many of the islands of the Pacific--affording harbours within
them, and sheltering the shore from the fury of the waves.

Many of the islands are also of volcanic origin; some contain active volcanoes, and while the
land in some instances has sunk, in others it has risen, and is broken into the most curious
and fantastic shapes, bringing up also with it the coral rocks which were formed on it while
it lay beneath the sea.

Most of these islands are clothed with a varied and rich vegetation. The climate of those at
a distance from the equator is generally healthy, but that of others near the line, especially
to the westward, is unhealthy in the extreme, so that even the natives of other islands of
the same ocean cannot live on them throughout the year.

The eastern groups are inhabited by a brown skinned and generally handsome race, often not
darker than Spaniards, and supposed to be descended from a common stock, as in general appearance
and language there is a great resemblance.

The groups of the large islands to the westward on either side of the equator are peopled by
a black and savage race, in many respects resembling the negroes of Africa, and sunk even still
lower in barbarism.  Such are the inhabitants of the Fijis, New Caledonia, and New Hebrides,
the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and others to the northward of them.

When Captain Cook sailed over the Pacific, and till many years afterwards, the people of these
beautiful islands were sunk in the grossest idolatry and barbarism.

Towards the end of the last century, when the Christian Churches awoke to their responsibilities
for making known the glad tidings of salvation to their heathen fellow-creatures--societies
were formed to send missionaries to various parts of the world.  A band of twenty-nine missionaries,
some of them unhappily untried, were sent out by the London Missionary Society in 1796, to
the Pacific islands.  They made slow progress, but at length, in 1815, idolatry was overthrown
at Tahiti, and the gospel firmly established in that island.

Two years afterwards, the Rev. J. Williams and the Rev. W. Ellis, two of the most distinguished
missionaries who have laboured among the islands of the Pacific, arrived at Tahiti.  The former
took up his abode at Raiatea, one of the Society islands, and afterwards going alone to the
island of Rarotonga, though not bred a shipwright, built there, with his own hands, aided only
by the natives, a vessel of about seventy tons burden.  Having rigged her with sails of matting,
he and a native crew returned to Raiatea, and thence he proceeded to Samoa with a large party
of missionaries, for the purpose of leaving them at different islands on the way.  He sailed
in her afterwards over many thousand miles of ocean, visiting missionary stations--the little
craft truly performing her duty as the "Messenger of Peace."

She was the first of many missionary vessels which have since been sent out by different societies
to the Pacific.  Some have been lost, but their places have been supplied by others; indeed
it is only by means of such vessels that the now numerous missionary stations scattered throughout
that wide ocean, can be properly maintained.

How well might some of the beautiful yachts which float idly on the waters of the Solent, be
employed, if their owners, influenced by the love of immortal souls, would hoist the banner
of peace at their mast-heads, and go forth to those distant islands, to sail here and there
visiting the isolated stations, or conveying fresh missionaries to the numberless groups still
in heathen darkness.

I cannot help saying this when I recollect how often, for long months, and even for years together,
we were left without a visit from any European Christian, and how eagerly we watched the approach
of each sail which appeared in the horizon, hoping that she might bring us news of distant
friends, or necessaries of which we stood greatly in need, or still more, that a brother might
be on board who might afford counsel and encouragement in the difficulties by which we were
surrounded.  My dear father often felt the want of the assistance I have spoken of.  My mother
was indeed a helpmate meet for him, and was a source of comfort and consolation; but especially
when the heathens threatened our lives and those of the native converts, oh, how thankful he
would have been for the advice and support of an experienced Christian friend.

My mother had for some time been a sufferer from illness, and though she still continued her
usual duties, we watched her form grow thinner, and her cheek paler, day by day.  My father,
strange as it may seem, did not appear to remark the change, but Maud and I, when we were together,
could not help speaking about it.  Still, as my mother did not complain, we could only hope
that, should her anxiety about the condition of the mission decrease by its prospects becoming
more promising, her health would improve.

We did all we could to lessen her cares by assisting her in her household duties.  Maud and
I learned to cook, and we also cleaned and swept out the house and kept it in order, with the
help of a native girl, who, though not very expert, was willing to learn and to follow the
example we set her.

We were anxiously expecting the return of Lisele, and Maud and I paid frequent visits to Abela,
to inquire whether she had received any message from her niece.  She shook her head sorrowfully,
saying she was afraid that Masaugu was too much wedded to his heathen practices to be induced
to abandon them by any arguments Lisele could use, and that he was far more likely to prevent
her from returning.  This made us very sad, for we had had hopes that Lisele had really become
a Christian, and would remain faithful to the truth.

Abela guessed by our looks what was passing in our minds, and she added, "though the chief's
heart is very hard, I have been praying that it may be changed, and I know that with Jehovah
nothing is impossible."

While we were still seated in the hut, a native arrived whom we knew, from his scanty dress
and his wild savage look, to be still a heathen. He brought a message to Abela from her niece,
saying that she hoped shortly to return to the settlement, as her father had consented to pay
the English missionary a visit.

"I shall rejoice to see her again," said Abela to the native.  "And has she spoken to you,
my friend, of the true religion?"

"Yes, she has told me that we cannot see the great Jehovah who made the world and all things
in it, but that He sees us and knows everything we think of, say, and do; and that He hates
all sin, but that He loves the sinner, and wishes all human beings to come and live with Him
for ever and ever in the beautiful place He has prepared for them," was the prompt and unexpected
answer.

"But has she told you that you are a sinner, and that your sins must be wiped away before you
are fit to go to that pure and beautiful heaven she spoke of?  Has she told you how you can
become fit for heaven, and has she pointed out to you the only way you can go there?" asked Abela.

"Yes, she told me that many things I thought right are very wrong in the sight of Jehovah,
and that I cannot undo what I have once done, and that the only way by which those things can
be blotted out, is by believing that Jehovah's dear Son came down upon earth and was punished
by a cruel death instead of me, and that if I believe this, and trust to Him, I shall be received
into that glorious place above the blue sky, which He has prepared for all who love Him," answered
the native.

"But do you believe this?" asked Abela.  "Do you believe that Jehovah is satisfied that another
was punished instead of you, and that He therefore has set you free?"

"I did not understand it, but it seemed very good," answered the native. "I should like to
remain and learn more about the matter."

"Oh yes, do remain," exclaimed Abela.  "Go not back to worship again the blocks of stone in
which our countrymen put their trust.  The English missionary will explain matters more clearly
to you than I can."

I assured Nasile--for such the native told us was his name--that my father would gladly explain
the truth to him, and leaving him in conversation with Abela, we hastened homewards with the
satisfactory intelligence.

In a short time we saw a party coming across the hill.  At first their appearance caused some
consternation, it being supposed that they were heathens intending to attack the village. 
As they drew nearer, however, Masaugu was distinguished at their head, accompanied by Lisele.
The chief was a tall fine man, with ample folds of native cloth round his waist and over his
shoulders.  My father hastened out to meet him, and welcome him to the Station, and Maud and
I followed.  As soon as Lisele saw us she ran forward and threw her arms round me, and then
embraced Maud, calling us her dear sisters, and telling us how rejoiced she was to come back.

"I was afraid at first that my father would not listen to me," she said. "But I prayed and
prayed, and at length, to my joy, he said that he would go and hear more of the strange things
I had told him of."

My father at first intended to conduct the chief into the chapel; but though he was willing
to go, several of his followers were afraid of entering it, believing that some incantations
would be used, and that they might be compelled to lotu against their will.  The whole party
therefore seated themselves in a shady place outside.  Here my father addressed the chief;
and he hoped that while speaking to him, what he said might be attended to and understood by
many of his followers.  Not saying a word about the false gods he worshipped, my father told
him of the greatness and power and love and mercy of Jehovah, and explained to him the simple
plan of salvation which He has offered to sinful man.

The chief appeared much interested.  "I understand," he answered, "that the white man's God
is greater and more powerful than my gods, and I am resolved soon to worship Him, as I am sure
He can do more for me than they can; but I have some enemies who have offended me, and I am
about to set out on an expedition to punish them, and when I have obtained the victory, I will
return and do as I have promised."

"Oh! my friend," exclaimed my father, "I should have told you of Satan, who is allowed--we
know not why--to go about the world to deceive men, and he it is who has made you resolve to
do this.  Jehovah does not allow you to say that you will serve Him by-and-by.  He requires
you and all men to obey Him at once.  Satan, on the contrary, ever strives to persuade people
to put off serving Jehovah till by-and-by, that he may get them altogether into his own power
before they can do so.  Thus it is that he deceives men and destroys their souls in all parts
of the world, and thus he has done at all times.  Jehovah has told us that He will not allow
us to punish our enemies, but that we are to love them and do good to them.  Oh! let me warn
and entreat you not to go on the expedition you propose."

The chief was silent for some time.  Lisele and Abela, who had arrived, united with my father
in entreating him to remain and hear more of the truth.

"What you say may be very right and good for those who profess to follow Jehovah," he answered
at length, "but I have not yet abandoned my gods, and they will, I am sure, help me to gain
the victory.  What I say is wise, is it not?" he added, turning to his heathen attendants.
Of course they all applauded him, and greatly to my fathers grief, he arose to take his departure.

"Remember, oh chief, that I have warned you," said my father.  "We cannot pray that you may
gain the victory, because Jehovah will give it as He thinks fit; but we will pray that your
heart may be changed, and that you may still worship Him whom you now reject."

"Alas! how many act as this poor heathen is doing," said my father, after Masaugu and his companions
had gone away.  "They believe in God, and yet, blinded by Satan, fancy in their folly that
they can safely put off the time to begin serving and obeying Him."

CHAPTER FOUR.

OUR ANXIETIES INCREASE ON THE DEPARTURE OF MASAUGU.--MY FATHER IS SUMMONED TO VISIT A SICK
MISSIONARY AT ANOTHER ISLAND, AND WE ARE LEFT UNDER THE CHARGE OF NANARI, THE NATIVE MISSIONARY.--MY
MOTHER'S SUDDEN DEATH.--A VESSEL APPEARS OFF THE COAST, AND AT KANARI'S SUGGESTION I SEND OFF
A NOTE, WARNING THE CAPTAIN OF THE DANGER TO WHICH HE IS EXPOSED FROM THE NATIVES.

We rejoiced to find that Lisele was allowed to remain with her aunt at the settlement.  She
had tried, even before her return to the settlement, to persuade her father to abandon his
intentions of going to war.  The tribe he intended to attack inhabited an island some leagues
away to the south, and as we stood on the shore we could see its blue outline rising out of
the ocean.  Lisele had reminded her father that he had professed to wish us well, and that
by going away he would leave us exposed to the attacks of other heathen tribes, who would now
venture without hesitation through his territory, to attack us.  He replied that they would
not dare to do so, as he had threatened them with punishment on his return should they molest them.

"Alas!" said Lisele, who told us this when we went to see her at her aunt's house.  "Suppose
he is defeated, what protection shall we then have from our enemies?"

"We must trust in Jehovah, my child," said Abela.  "Or, if he thinks fit to allow us to be
afflicted, we must submit without murmur to His will. We know that we can but suffer here for
a short season, and that He has prepared a glorious and happy home for those who love Jesus,
and obey His commandments down on earth.  Oh yes! since I have known the truth, I have learned
to understand that this world is a place of trial, and that we must not look for peace and
happiness and rest while we are in it. God indeed made the world beautiful, and intended it
to be happy, but Satan persuaded man to sin, and sin has caused man to depart from God, and
brought all the disorder and misery and suffering which we see around us.  Faith in Jesus Christ
can alone remedy all these evils, and I am sure that they will exist till all the world learns
to love and obey Him."

These remarks of Abela will show that she had made great advances in Christian knowledge, and
was well able to instruct her young niece.

Lisele came back with us to the school, which my mother, although weak and suffering still,
insisted on superintending.  I think that she herself was not aware how ill she really was.

We used to go down every morning to the sea to bathe in a little sheltered cove, almost surrounded
by high rocks, where there was no danger of a visit from a shark.  Here my father had built
a small hut in which Maud and I might dress.  The native girls dispensed with any such accommodation,
and while we were content to swim about in the bay, they would boldly strike out a long distance
from the land.  Even when the wind blew strong on the shore, and the surf came rolling in,
they would dash through it, now diving under a huge breaker, now rising to its foaming summit,
and playing about as securely as if they were on the dry land.

Two mornings after the chief had paid us a visit we went down as usual to bathe, when we saw
a large fleet of canoes, propelled by paddles, gliding over the smooth water of the lagoon
towards the passage which communicated with the open sea.  On first seeing them we were about
to hurry home, fearing that they might be enemies, but Lisele quieted our alarm, by telling
us that they were her father's fleet, starting on his proposed expedition.  They were curious
looking vessels.  Each consisted of two long narrow canoes placed side by side, but at some
distance from each other, and united by strong beams, on which a platform or stage was erected,
thus making one vessel.  The rowers sat with long paddles on either side, while on the deck
stood the warriors in their war-paint and feathers, and flourishing their lances and whirling
their clubs, inciting each other to the deeds of valour, or rather of cruelty, which they intended
to perform.  Instead of a mast in the centre, there was a triangle with the ends fixed on either
side, on which the mat-formed sail extended on a long yard ready to be hoisted.

As they glided by the sound of the wild shouts and shrieks they uttered reached our ears.

"May my poor father be protected," said Lisele to me, as we watched them.  "Once I should have
thought what we see very fine, and should have sung and clapped my hands with joy.  Now that
I know how wicked it is to go and fight and kill other human beings, I feel inclined to weep
with sorrow."

"We must pray for your father, Lisele," I said, "that God will turn his heart and make him
see the crime of warfare."

"Yes, yes; that is my comfort," she answered.

When the canoes reached the outlet from the lagoon the sails were hoisted, and at a rapid rate
they glided away over the ocean, while Lisele, Maud, and I, knelt down on the sand and prayed,
not that God would give the victory to the chief, but that He would turn his heart and make
him to know the truth.

As we were leaving the beach we saw another canoe coming round a headland through the lagoon,
which she had entered by a further off passage.  Had the strange canoe been a little sooner
she would have encountered the fleet, and very likely have been stopped and compelled to accompany
the war party.  Her appearance caused us some anxiety.  If she had heathens on board, they
might land and rob us, or cause us even more serious annoyance.  We continued to watch her,
as we knew that we should have plenty of time to escape and give warning at the village before
she could come to shore.  At length we discovered a flag flying from the end of her yard, and
great was my joy to see that on it was worked a dove with the olive branch of peace--I consequently
hoped that a missionary might be on board coming to visit us.  We waited therefore for the
arrival of the canoe.  We could distinguish, however, as she drew near, only natives on her
deck.  They all were in the dress adopted by Christian converts--in shirts and trousers.

The canoe soon ran up on the beach, when a native stepped on shore with a letter in his hand.
He told me that he had been sent by Mr Hilton, a missionary stationed on an island about fifty
miles off.  Mr Hilton was very ill, and entreated my father to come and see him; for, believing
that he should not recover, he was anxious to commit his motherless children to his charge.
We accordingly conducted the messenger up to the house.

The letter caused my father much grief and perplexity.  He sorrowed to hear of his friend's
illness, and felt anxious to go to him, and yet he was unwilling to leave my mother and us
for so long a time, when the settlement might possibly be annoyed by heathens.  Still he knew
that he could with confidence leave the instruction of the people to Nanari, who would also
protect my mother and us to the best of his power.  He sent for Nanari, and spoke to him on
the subject.

"God helping me, I will do all that man can do," answered Nanari.  "And nothing shall tempt
me to quit the post you have committed to my charge."

My mother, feeling for our poor friend and for the young ones who might soon be deprived of
his protection, sacrificing her own wishes, urged my father to go as he was requested.  As
there was no time to be lost if he would see his friend alive, bidding us a tender, and it
seemed to me a peculiarly solemn farewell, he went on board the canoe, which immediately set
sail on her return.  We accompanied him to the beach, and watched the vessel till she was lost
to sight in the distance.

On our return home we found my mother suffering greatly.  The agitation of parting from my
father had been more than she could bear.  Oh, how I longed to recall him!  Little could he
have known her dangerous state. My father had a knowledge of medicine, and he might have applied
remedies of which we were ignorant.  Good Abela came up on hearing how ill my mother was, though
she could afford us but little assistance. Suddenly, as I gazed at my mother, a fearful conviction
came upon me that she was dying.  She knew herself that such was the case.  I cannot even now
bear to dwell upon the sad scene, for sad indeed it was to us, though my mother's heart was
lifted up with joy and hope.

"God's will be done, my children," she said, taking Maud's and my hand in hers.  "He will care
for and protect you though troubles arise which may seem overwhelming."

Abela and Nanari assured her that they would devote themselves to our service, yet the absence
of my father must have been a sore trial to her.

During that night she breathed her last, and I was left motherless; so, indeed, was dear Maud,
to whom she had been truly a mother.

Then quickly followed the funeral.  All the Christians of the settlement stood round the grave,
in a beautiful spot which had been set apart for the purpose, at a short distance from the
chapel, when Nanari offered up a prayer that God's Holy Spirit would influence the hearts of
all present, and enable them to possess the same hope of a joyous resurrection as that in which
my mother died, he then addressed the people, urging them to put faith in God's goodness and
wisdom, and telling them that though troubles might come, not therefore to suppose that He
had forgotten to be gracious, but to go on praying and trusting in Him, till He might think
fit to call them out of this world, to be with Him in glory and happiness unspeakable.

Maud and I spent that sad evening with our hands clasped together, often weeping but seldom
speaking.  My heart bled for my poor father, as I thought of his grief and anguish, when, on
his return he would find that my mother had been taken from him.

"Still," said Maud, looking up in my face, "he will know that she is in joy surpassing human
understanding, and we cannot tell from what trials and sufferings she may thus have escaped."

With the last thought I was greatly comforted.

As we stood together in the verandah that evening, gazing up into the sky and thinking of the
glories now revealed to my mother, we saw a bright star with a long tail of light, such as
we had never before beheld.  I knew at once from its appearance that it was a comet.  Many
of the natives had seen it too, and we heard their voices uttering exclamations of surprise
and terror.  Soon afterwards we saw Lisele approaching.  She hesitated, as if unwilling to
intrude on our grief, but I called to her, and she came up to us.  I told her what I knew about
comets, and begged her to try and calm the alarm of her people, and to assure them that it
was but a luminous mass, and that it betokened neither good nor evil to the inhabitants of
this world, though Jehovah directed its course, as He orders everything else in the universe.

"Ah, but the heathens will not think so," she exclaimed, "and we know not what effect it may
have upon their minds.  Perhaps they will think it is sent through the incantations of the
Christians, and will come in consequence and attack us."

I scarcely thought this possible, but Lisele was positive that it would have a bad effect.
She went, however, to tell the Christian natives what I had said, and to assure them that the
comet would do them no harm.

Oh, how sad was that night and the next morning, when we looked on the bed on which my mother
had slept, and knew that we should never again see her dear face there, so calm and beautiful.
We had, however, our duties to perform, and we set about them as we knew she would have desired.

While we were thus engaged Nanari appeared to learn if there was anything he could do for us,
saying that the people would bring us all the food we might require, and begging that we would
not be anxious on that score.  He then told us that a vessel was off the coast, and by going
to the front of the house we saw her.  We hoped that she might have friends on board coming
to visit our Station, or that where my father and Mr Hilton were, as we knew how gladly she
would be welcomed there.

As we watched her, we saw at length, to our disappointment, from the course she was steering,
that she was not coming to our Station, but was apparently about to enter a harbour further
down the coast.

"I would that I could warn those on board of the character of the natives where she is going,"
said Nanari, when he saw this.  "Unless they are on their guard I fear that they may be treated
as others have been."

We had only one small canoe at the Station, but Nanari said that if we would write a message
he would induce two of the Christian natives to carry it off.  I accordingly hastily wrote
a note, warning the captain of the vessel against any treachery which might be intended, and
with much satisfaction saw the canoe paddle off towards her.  The breeze, however, was strong,
and it seemed doubtful whether the canoe would reach the stranger before she came to an anchor.

CHAPTER FIVE.

WE RECEIVE THE SAD TIDINGS OF THE MASSACRE OF THE CREW OF THE VESSEL.--I STILL HOPE THAT SOME
MAY HAVE ESCAPED, AND LISELE TAKES MEANS TO RESCUE THEM.--SHE SENDS HER COUSIN TOFA, TO MAFOA,
THE YOUNG CHIEF TO WHOM HER FATHER HAS BETROTHED HER.--A FEARFUL HURRICANE.--THE HEATHEN NATIVES
PREVENTED BY IT FROM ATTACKING THE SETTLEMENT AND SEIZING US.

We could scarcely hope that my father would have had time to return, yet we anxiously looked
for his arrival.  The canoe with the two natives had been unable to reach the vessel, and information
was brought to Lisele that they had been seized and killed by the heathens, who had gone out
in chase of them.  A bright light was also seen at night in the direction of the harbour in
which the vessel was supposed to have anchored; and the next day the dreadful rumour reached
us that Nanari's worst apprehensions had been realised, that she had been surprised by the
treacherous natives, and that every person on board had been put to death.  At first we could
not believe so fearful a story, but Lisele assured us that she had no doubt of its truth.

"Is it not possible that some may have escaped?"  I exclaimed, when Lisele gave me the account.
"Have all the people on board the beautiful vessel, sailing by so proudly the other day, been
killed?  Should any have escaped could we not take means to let them know that there are Christian
friends here who would welcome them?  If my father was at home I am sure he would make all
effort to rescue the unhappy people."

Lisele replied that although the tribe who had committed the deed were at present at peace
with her people, that even should any white man have escaped it would be difficult to get them
out of the heathens' hands, but that she would try what could be done.  "There is a young chief
among them who is more inclined than the rest of the people to be friendly with my father,"
she observed.  "Although he is a brave warrior, he is neither fierce nor cruel; and if, by
chance, any of the white men have fallen into his power he may possibly have spared their lives.
I will try to send a message to him and ask him to protect them, and to give them up to your
father.  Yet I fear there is very little probability of any having escaped."

Lisele's answer gave me very little hope that any had escaped the massacre; but I was sure
that she would take every means to ascertain the truth.  Nanari, when he heard the account,
was willing to go himself, but both Abela and Lisele entreated him not to make the attempt--urging
that the heathens were so enraged at him for having caused so many people to lotu, that they
would be certain, should he venture among them, to put him to death.

He at length was persuaded to abandon his design, and Lisele undertook to send a young relative,
who, although a heathen, was attached to her, and would do whatever she desired.  Being still
a boy he had not accompanied her father, but he was more likely to succeed than anybody she
could think of.  In the course of the day Tofa, the lad of whom Lisele spoke, made his appearance.
He was a fine intelligent-looking youth, and I could not help hoping that through the means
of his cousin he might be brought to know the truth.  He seemed proud of the mission given
to him, though he was well aware of the danger he incurred.

"Tell Mafoa that if he really regards me as he professes, he will act according to my wishes,
and treat the white men as friends," said Lisele.  Mafoa was the young chief of whom she had
spoken, and who, I had no doubt, from this remark, entertained hopes of making her his wife.

Recollecting that should any seamen have escaped, they would have a difficulty in understanding
young Tofa, I wrote a short note which I hoped would prove of more service than the last I
had sent, mentioning the missionary station, and saying that we and the Christian natives would
gladly afford them all the assistance in our power.  Several other messages having been given
to Tofa, he set off on his expedition; and we kneeling down, offered up a prayer for his success.

Notwithstanding our anxiety, with the assistance of Lisele and Abela, we held school as usual,
while Nanari conducted the service in the chapel, and instructed the young men and boys, as
was his custom.  The night was as calm as the preceding one.  The comet could be seen winding
its solitary course through the heavens, appearing even brighter than before.  After Maud and
I had gazed at it for some time we retired to our beds.  I heard her sobbing, giving way at
length to the sorrow she had restrained in my presence--not that she could have felt my mother's
loss more than I did, but I was older, and had endeavoured, though the strife was a hard one,
to command my feelings.  At length I heard her sobs cease, and I in time forgot my sorrow in sleep.

We were both suddenly awakened by a fearful noise.  We started up--all was dark.  There came
the sound of the wind howling in the trees and falling timber, and the roaring of the sea,
as it dashed upon the reef with tremendous force, and rocks crashing down from the mountain
heights.  A hurricane was raging.  We sat up trembling with alarm.  My first thought was for
my dear father, should he now be at sea returning to us.  Then other dreadful sounds, like
thunder breaking overhead. Something else terrific besides the hurricane was occurring, it
seemed to us, yet we dared not leave the house for fear of being blown away by the wind.  After
some time we assisted each other to dress, as well as we could, in the dark, for we expected
every moment that the roof would be carried off, or the house itself blown down.  We remembered
several hurricanes, but this appeared more violent than any that had before occurred.  We had
been protected during former ones, and we knew that the same power would take care of us now.
I had proposed lighting the lamp, when Maud observed, should the house be blown down, it might
set the thatch on fire, and the whole village would be burnt.

"Let us remain in darkness, for remember God sees us as if it was light, she said.  Darkness
is no darkness with Him--the day and night to Him are both alike."

I agreed with Maud, and together we knelt down side by side to pray for protection.  Although
the tempest continued to rage without, our house, built by my father's hands, stood firm. 
It was, like his own faith, well knit and bound together.  He had not forgotten, when erecting
it, that such hurricanes were likely to occur, and he had accordingly prepared for them.

So should we go through life, not trembling with the fear of misfortunes, but ready to encounter
them should they overtake us.

Hour after hour seemed to pass by as we thus knelt and prayed.  Every now and then we could
not help starting up, as a more fearful crash than usual sounded in our ears.  Still the wished-for
daylight did not appear.  The truth was, that since the commencement of the storm but a short
time only had elapsed, though in our desolation and solitude it had appeared very long.

At length we heard a knocking at the door.  I made my way, followed by Maud, to open it, when
two figures appeared, and I heard the voices of Nanari and Lisele.  During the moment the door
was open I observed a bright glare in the sky above the waving and bending trees, but it was
only for a moment, as immediately they were inside they closed the door behind them.

"Are you safe, are you uninjured?" they exclaimed.  "We could not bear to leave you all alone,
and, trusting to Jehovah's protection, we ventured up here, hoping to comfort you."

We thanked them for coming, and I led the way into our sitting-room. "What dreadful event is
occurring in addition to the hurricane?"  I asked.  "Can the forest be on fire?"

"The mountain has burst forth, and is sending up stones and ashes into the air, while hot streams
of lava are flowing down its sides," answered Nanari.  "Not one but many forests may be burned,
but we are in the hands of Jehovah, and should not fear, my daughter."

I inquired whether he thought that the ashes or streams of lava might reach as far as the settlement,
he believed that, shut in as we were, by a separate range of hills, that the lava at all events
would not run down towards us; though, with regard to the ashes and stones, how far they might
be carried, he could not say, and again he added the same consolation he had before offered.

Poor Lisele was in much affliction.  Her father might probably be at sea--as I feared mine
was--and exposed to the dreadful tempest, and she could not hope that he, having set forth
against the warnings of his Christian friends, would be under the protection of Jehovah.  "Alas!
alas!" she exclaimed, wringing her hands, should he be driven out over the ocean and lost,
he will not have known the good and merciful God who would--had he listened to the advice given
him--have received him as a son, and taken him to dwell with Him for ever in the glorious country
you have told me of beyond the skies.

"We have prayed for your father, and may continue to pray for him, my child," said Nanari.
"And Jehovah may still find a way to preserve him from the danger in which he is placed." 
Thus conversing, and often kneeling down to pray, we passed the hours of darkness.

As dawn approached, the hurricane began to abate; and by the time the sun rose out of the eastern
ocean, it had entirely ceased.  As we opened the door and gazed forth we had reason to be more
than ever thankful that we had escaped destruction.  Several tall trees, a short distance from
the house, lay torn up by the roots, and huge boughs strewed the ground in every direction.
The chapel and school-house had escaped injury; but Nanari, who went out to ascertain whether
any of the people had suffered, came back with a sad report.  Several of the cottages had been
blown down, two people had been killed, and many more injured.

Leaving Maud and Lisele to attend to the house, I accompanied Nanari to visit the sufferers.
While receiving instruction as a missionary he had been taught the simple methods to be pursued
under such circumstances. Abela, I was thankful to find, had escaped, and she assisted us in
bathing and binding up the wounds and setting the limbs of those who had been hurt.  There
was sorrow for those who had been killed, but it was not such sorrow as the heathen would have
shown who have no hope.

"Jehovah is merciful, and has called our brothers to a better and happier land than this,"
exclaimed those who stood around, preparing to carry the dead to their graves.

We were not aware of it at the time--but we learned afterwards--that on that very night a band
of savage heathens were on their way to attack the settlement with the intention of killing
Nanari, and carrying off Lisele and us as prisoners.  How dreadful would have been our fate
had they succeeded, and, unwarned as we were, we should have been taken by surprise without
the possibility of escaping.

The volcano continued raging during the day, but the natives, accustomed to see its fires burst
forth from time to time, were less alarmed at it than they were at the appearance of the comet.
As I watched it, I conceived the hope that a stream of lava, flowing down between us and the
more hostile heathen tribes, might prevent them from approaching to attack us.

CHAPTER SIX.

LISELE AND I FEEL GREAT ANXIETY ON ACCOUNT OF OUR FATHER'S NOT RETURNING.--TOFA ALSO HAS NOT
APPEARED.--WE ARE ASSEMBLED IN THE CHAPEL, WHEN TOFA, WITH A WHITE STRANGER, ARRIVES AND WARNS
US THAT THE HEATHENS THREATEN AN ATTACK.--TOFA TAKES CHARGE OF HIS COMPANION.--WE FLY TO THE
MOUNTAINS, AND WITNESS THE BURNING OF OUR VILLAGE.  WE LIE CONCEALED IN A CAVE, WHILE THE SAVAGES
SEARCH FOR US.

The hurricane had caused sad damage to the cocoanut groves and plantations in our little settlement,
and we had no doubt that it, in addition to the eruption of the volcano, had produced still
more destructive effects throughout the island, but I own that my thoughts were far more occupied
with my anxiety about my father.  In vain we watched for the return of his canoe.  No sail
appeared in the blue ocean in the direction of the island to which he had gone.  Lisele too
was overwhelmed with grief at the non-appearance of her father; her only hope was that he had
conquered his enemies and remained in possession of their country.  Still he would, she thought,
before this, have despatched a canoe to announce his victory.

Two days passed away, and we began to look for the return of young Tofa; but on the third day,
when he did not come, fears for his safety were added to our other troubles.  The chief, indeed,
the only refuge from our sorrows, was prayer; how great was the comfort that brought to our
hearts none but those who have experienced it can tell.

We continued to attend to our usual duties.  Though the younger girls and boys assembled for
school, the older people were too much agitated and alarmed to attend to their studies; they
were also chiefly employed during the day in repairing the damages caused by the storm.

In the evening, however, they all assembled in the chapel for public prayer.  Nanari was addressing
them, when the noise of feet was heard without, and directly afterwards Tofa appeared, followed
by a young white man.  The latter took off his hat when he saw how we were engaged, and stood
reverentially at the door for a moment, as if unwilling to interrupt us, though evidently in
a state of great agitation.

Tofa, however, influenced by no such feelings, exclaimed loudly, "Fly! fly! and hide yourselves.
Your enemies are approaching, and will be here anon.  Mafoa tried to prevent them, but he could
not prevail."

"My friends!" exclaimed Nanari, "the warning has been sent that you all may seek for safety.
For myself, I will remain with the aged and wounded people, who cannot fly; but you, my daughters,"
turning to Maud and me, "who have been committed to my charge, I must see that you are placed
in a secure hiding-place, where the heathens cannot find you."

"We will place ourselves under your guidance," I answered, "but you must also take care that
this stranger does not again fall into the hands of the heathens," I added, turning to the
young man who was standing at the door, and who appeared to be above the rank of a common sailor.
"Tell me," I asked, "are you the only person who has escaped from the vessel, which we heard
was burned the other day along the coast?"

"I fear that such is the case, and why my life was spared I cannot tell you," he answered.
"I jumped overboard, and was swimming towards the shore, when I was taken up by a canoe, in
which was a young chief, who made signs that he would protect me, and faithfully kept his word.
I should have remained with him had I not received a note sent, I presume, by you."

This was said in a hurried tone, while Nanari was arranging a plan for our safety.

I told the stranger of the warning we had just received from Tofa of the threatened attack
by the heathens, supposing that he might not have understood what the lad might have said to him.

While some of our friends ran off to the huts to obtain provisions, Abela and Lisele taking
our hands, told us that we must set off at once to the mountains, till the fury of the heathens
had ceased.  Three or four of our other friends also prepared to accompany us.

"But what will this stranger do?"  I asked.  "Surely if the heathens find him when no longer
under the protection of Mafoa, they will put him to death."

"He is under my care," exclaimed Tofa.  "I promised Mafoa that I would protect him, and I will
show them that I am clever enough to hide him away even although the whole tribe come to look
for him."

I explained this to the young stranger, and advised him to put himself under Tofa's guidance.
Nanari having commended us to the care of Jehovah, we and our friends, not stopping even to
obtain anything at the house, hurried off towards the mountains, while Tofa led the stranger
by a more direct way up a precipice, which was too steep for us to climb. As we were quitting
the chapel, turning my eyes seaward for a moment, I caught sight of several sails dotting the
ocean in the far distance.  I pointed them out to Lisele.

"They may be my father's canoes," she exclaimed, "and he might arrive in time to protect us."

"Alas! even should they be Masaugu's fleet, they may be too late for that," said Abela.  "We
must not delay on such a chance; perhaps, too, they may prove more deadly foes than those from
whom we fly.  Let us hasten on, and we may be able to learn what they are when our charge is
in safety."

Thus urged, Lisele no longer hesitated.  Night was coming on, but provided we could make our
way, the darkness would assist us in eluding our savage foes should they pursue us.  The path
towards the mountains, at all times difficult, was rendered doubly so by the number of fallen
trees across it, thrown down by the hurricane.  Sometimes we had to climb over the trunks,
at others to creep under the branches.

"The heathens will be less able to discover our tracks," observed Lisele, "than if the path
had been open."

"Ah yes! my child," said Abela, "all is ordered for the best."

Now we went on and on, now clambering over wild rocks, now proceeding along a narrow valley,
now climbing its steep sides till we reached a height whence we could look back upon our settlement.
"Hark!" said Lisele, "what cries are those?"  We listened; the Indian girl's quick ear had
detected sounds which neither Maud nor I had till then perceived.

"Alas! alas!" she exclaimed, "they are the shouts of the savage heathens as they rush in among
those we have left behind, and rage at finding that we have escaped them."

That she was right in her conjecture we had too soon painful evidence. Several bright lights
appeared, and presently fierce flames burst forth from amid the trees.  The savages had set
the houses on fire to revenge themselves on the inhabitants who had for the present escaped
their fury.  Our friends, not stopping to watch the progress of the flames, hurried us on.
Proceeding along a narrow ridge, we once more descended down a ravine thickly covered with
trees.  The natives knew their way, but so dense was the foliage that to my eyes all appeared
dark around. We could hear the roar of a torrent close to us.  Now they led us along slippery
rocks, tightly holding our hands; now we found ourselves ascending, now descending, steep precipices.
At length they stopped, and drawing aside the thick foliage, Abela led us into a small cavern,
the front of which appeared to be completely concealed by underwood and numberless creepers
with which it was entwined.  A portion of the provisions, and some water which had been brought,
were placed by our sides.

"Here, my daughters, you will remain safe till the heathens, having searched for you in vain,
take their departure," said Abela.  "I know this spot well, for before Masaugu's father conquered
the territory he now holds, I and my family dwelt in the neighbourhood.  I discovered it as
a girl when rambling about the mountains with my brothers, who are dead, and no one else is
acquainted with it.  We ourselves propose to find concealment in different directions, for
should the heathens search for us, some may thus have a better prospect of escaping, and the
faith of Jehovah will still remain in the land."

Abela and her companions, having carefully allowed the shrubs to regain their natural position,
left Maud and me alone, and we soon lost the sound of their footsteps.  The cavern was perfectly
dry, and sufficient air found its way through the boughs to prevent the atmosphere from feeling
close.  Some mats had also been left for us, on which we could recline; but, as may be supposed,
the fearful events that had occurred, and the grief and anxiety which weighed on our hearts,
prevented us for many hours from sleeping.  No sound except that of the ceaseless roar and
splash of the neighbouring waterfall, reached our ears.  While we sat, shrouded in darkness,
it was difficult to avoid giving way to despondency.  We did not, I need scarcely say, forget
to pray, while we had cause to be thankful at having received sufficient warning to escape
from the cruel fate which would have overtaken us had we been at the settlement.

At last we slept, and the light of day was making its way through the dense foliage when we
awoke.  Our cavern, we now found, was even smaller than we had supposed.  There was no room
to walk about; indeed, it afforded us just space sufficient to lie down at full length.  As
we peered out between the bushes, we could see the opposite sides of the ravine rising up in
a perpendicular precipice directly before us.  This gave us an assurance that there was little
probability of our being discovered by the savages, even though they might search diligently
for us through the mountains.  Our friends had left us an ample supply of provisions so that
if necessary we might remain many days there without fear of starvation.  But what was to be
our future lot it was impossible to say.

"It is a great comfort to know that God will decide it for us," said Maud, putting her arms
round my neck.  "He knows what is best, and He will find a way of escape for those who trust
Him, out of all difficulties.  See," she added, "I have brought His word to comfort us," and
she produced a small Bible from her pocket, which she had thoughtfully put there when leaving
the chapel.

What consolation did that book give us!  We read and prayed, and then read again in a low voice,
and strange as it may seem to some, the time did not appear to drag heavily along; but calmness
came ever our minds-- our hearts were at peace, we no longer feared what man could do to us.

We had been reading together, when suddenly we both started.  A wild cry readied our ears;
it was echoed by others in different directions, some coming up the ravine, others sounding,
it seemed, overhead.  I felt Maud tremble as she clung to me.

"Can those cries come from the heathens, who have discovered our footsteps?" she whispered.
"If so, we are lost."

"Not lost, dear Maud," I answered.  "They can but take our lives, and I trust that though they
may be near they will not find us.  Our friends felt sure of our safety in this concealment,
so let us not despair, but it will be prudent not to speak."

We remained silent, clinging to each other.  Again the wild shrieks and cries echoed around
us, some of the voices appeared to be quite close. We sat listening anxiously--now the sounds
appeared to proceed from a greater distance.  Yes, we trusted that the savages were at length
passing by us, their shrieks grew fainter and fainter, and ultimately altogether ceased.

We had been again preserved from a threatened danger.  We could scarcely believe that it was
over when darkness once more crept up the ravine.

CHAPTER SEVEN.

WE REMAIN CONCEALED, NONE OF OUR FRIENDS APPEARING.--MAUD SEES A PERSON ON THE HILL.--OUR ALARM.--WE
AGAIN HEAR VOICES AND FOOTSTEPS.--OUR NATIVE FRIENDS RETURN AND BRING US SAD TIDINGS; YET WE
HAVE CAUSE TO BE THANKFUL THAT SOME HAVE ESCAPED.--WE ARE MAKING OUR WAY TO A CANOE, WHEN THE
HEATHENS PURSUE US.--ESCAPE.--CHARLES NORTON GIVES ME HIS HISTORY.

Two more days passed away, and none of our friends had come near us.  We began to fear that
they had been seized by the heathens.  Should such be the case, what must be our fate!

"We will wait where we are till our provisions are exhausted, and then we must make our way
down to the sea-shore, and perhaps we may be seen by some passing ship and taken off," said
Maud.  "Anything will be better than trusting ourselves to the savage heathens."

I agreed with her that this was the only plan we could follow, that, indeed, was almost a hopeless
one.

"But suppose papa has been detained longer than he expected with Mr Hilton, and returns to
the settlement.  If so, we may see him and reach his canoe," said Maud.  She always called
my father papa.

This idea of Maud's gave me new hope, and then I thought how sad must be our meeting when I
should have to tell him of our mother's death.

Our chief want in our cavern was water; but Maud managed, by creeping under the bushes, where
she was sure she could not be seen, to reach a pool filled by the never ceasing spray from
the cascade.  I entreated her, however, not to go out often, for I was afraid of her foot slipping,
or, notwithstanding her assertion, that some native passing over the mountain above us might
catch a glimpse of her.  She agreed, therefore, to wait till just after dawn, when no one was
likely to be at so great a distance from any habitation.  She went out one morning to fill
the gourd, which held our store of water, and when she came back she told me that she had seen
a person looking down towards her from a point a long way up above the top of the waterfall.

"I did not stop to look a second time," she said, "but, crouching down, crept back, in the
hopes that he might not have discovered me."

This circumstance caused us great alarm; still we hoped that even had any one seen her, he
might not be able to discover the entrance to our cavern.

"Perhaps the person I saw may have been Tofa, or the young Englishman," exclaimed Maud, as
if the thought had suddenly struck her.  "They would naturally come to look for us, especially
should they know that any of our friends had been discovered by the heathens, and they might
assist us greatly."

"I trust that our friends have escaped," I said.  "Though it seems strange that they should
be so long in returning to us, and as Tofa and the young Englishman are strangers, I would
rather trust myself to those whose fidelity has been well tried."

"Oh, but I am sure that the Englishman would defend us with his life," said Maud.  "I was struck
by the good expression of his countenance, and the way he behaved during the few moments we
saw him.  I do trust that he has escaped, and I long to know who he is, for I am sure that
he is not a common sailor."

In this I agreed with Maud: indeed, had I not known that it is imprudent to trust strangers,
I should have been very thankful to obtain his assistance.  Although he might be the person
Maud had soon, we knew that it would be very unwise to venture out of our concealment.

"Still I should like to try and look out through the brushwood, and then should we see him
approaching, and be sure that it is him, we might make ourselves known," said Maud.

As Maud was sure that she could do as she proposed without being discovered, I did not forbid
her, though I felt that it might be wiser to remain as closely concealed as we had been hitherto.
Still no one approached.

"After all, I may have been mistaken," said Maud, coming back and sitting down by my side.

We were employed as usual in reading, when the sound of voices at a distance reached our ears,
coming apparently up the ravine.  "Can they be the savages returning to look for us," whispered
Maud.

"I think that their voices would sound very differently to those we hear," I answered.  "They
would be wildly shrieking and shouting, unless they intended to attack an enemy unprepared
for them.  Still, as the persons may possibly be strangers, we will keep concealed."

We remained seated on the ground, hoping that should enemies be approaching, they would pass
by without discovering us.  The footsteps grew nearer.  We could hear them climbing up the
precipice to the ledge on which the cavern opened.  Maud, notwithstanding her usual courage,
trembled violently.

The boughs were drawn aside, when several natives appeared in front of us.  A second glance
showed us that they were entirely clothed according to the custom of the converts, and then,
to our joy, we saw that Abela was among them.  We sprang up and threw ourselves into her arms.

"My children," she said, "we have left you long; but we have had many difficulties to encounter,
and, alas! disasters have overtaken our friends.  But come, we have no time to lose, we will
tell you more as we go along."

We were thankful to find that besides Abela, those who had accompanied us to our hiding-place
had likewise escaped.  Our friends having taken the baskets, and the remainder of our provisions,
we set off down the ravine, which led, as we supposed, towards the sea-shore.  I immediately
inquired of Abela if she had heard of my father.

"Alas! no, my child," she answered, "Our good pastor's canoe has not returned; we have anxiously
kept watch for him, and he could scarcely have reached the shore without having been observed."
I then inquired for Nanari, who might, I hoped, have escaped.  "He died faithfully at his post
with those whom he would not desert," she answered.  "He was entreated by the sick and wounded
to fly, but would not, and then, alas! the savage people rushed in and slew him."

She then told me that Lisele was safe, although she had run great risk of being captured by
the heathens.  The fleet we had seen was the remnant of that with which Masaugu had set sail.
Though at first victorious in his expedition, he had been attacked by overwhelming numbers
of his enemies, and, with the loss of a large portion of his warriors, and many of his canoes,
had with difficulty reached the island.  On his arrival he found a large party of the heathens,
who had heard that he intended to lotu, arrayed against him, and once more he had to put to
sea.  He had, however, reached the end of the island where we now were.  There Lisele had joined
him, and, at her earnest entreaties, he had left a canoe to convoy us away.  Abela told us
also that Tofa and the young Englishman had been communicated with, and she hoped that they
would be found already on board the canoe.

"Oh then we will proceed at once to Mr Hilton's station," I exclaimed. "What joy it will be
if we find that my father has not yet quitted it."

"Such are Masaugu's intentions," said Abela.  "He has seen the folly of his conduct in going
to attack his enemies when so earnestly warned by your father, and now he wishes to remain
with the Christian missionary, that he may receive instruction in the truths he before despised."

The news we thus received caused us many conflicting feeling's.  We deeply grieved for the
loss of the faithful Nanari, while my anxiety about my father was still unrelieved.  Yet we
rejoiced that Masaugu, through the severe lesson he had received, should have been induced
to seek for Christian instruction.

Our path down the ravine was extremely difficult, and often dangerous, and we could make but
slow progress.  Abela, however, hurried on as fast as we could venture to proceed, for she
feared that the heathens, knowing that many of the Christians had escaped, would be searching
for us, and that although they might not dare to follow Masaugu's fleet, they would not hesitate
to attack the single canoe, with only a small party on board.  At length we caught sight of
the blue ocean, but the sparkling white lines of foam I saw dancing over it, made me fear that
the canoe would have a hard buffet with the waves.

We were already not far from the beach, when we saw two persons running towards us--they were
Tofa and the young Englishman.  "Hasten," they exclaimed; "a large band of our enemies are
coming along the shore, and we have been in dread that you would be cut off."  The latter,
who of course spoke in English, took Maud and me by the hands to assist us, and helped along
by him we soon reached the boat.  The crew stood ready with poles to urge on the canoe into
deep water.  We were speedily on board, and launching forth; the wind being favourable, a large
triangular mat sail was set, and we glided away from the beach.

Scarcely had we got beyond the reach of their spears, than the savages arrived at the spot
we had left.  Several were hurled at us, but happily no one was hit, and the next shower, which
the vindictive savages darted from their hands, fell short of our canoe.

Abela and every Christian with her knelt down on the deck and offered up an earnest prayer--in
which we joined--that the hearts of our foes might be changed, and that they would ere long
be brought to know the truth. The savages continued shrieking and shouting at us till we had
got outside the reef.  Happily no canoe was near, or they would undoubtedly have followed us.

We could see Masaugu's fleet in the far distance; but as our canoe was smaller than any of
his we could not hope to overtake him.  I was thankful, however, to find that he was steering
towards Mr Hilton's station, where we hoped in time to arrive.  The sea was, as I had feared,
very rough, and though our canoe was strong and buoyant, she was tossed much about, and had
it not been for the assistance of the young Englishman and Tofa, we should have had great difficulty
in clinging to the deck.  In the centre was a small house or cabin, generally used by the chief
or owner of the canoe, and this we found was to be devoted to our use at night as a sleeping
place.  Still, as I surveyed the curiously-constructed and apparently weak vessel, I could
not help feeling that a voyage on board her of the length we were about to attempt, must be
attended with much danger.  Happily we could say at sea as on shore, "We will trust ourselves
to the care of One all-powerful to save."

As I now had a better opportunity of observing the young stranger more particularly than before,
I felt more convinced than at first that he was a person of education.  His manner towards
Maud and me especially, was retiring and reserved, and he seemed unwilling to intrude himself
upon us.  After some time, however, he came and sat near us, and thanked me for the note I
had written, which, as he supposed, had not only been the means of obtaining his freedom, but
of his life being preserved.

"I wrote merely on the possibility of any European having escaped the massacre which I understood
had taken place," I answered.  "I can therefore claim no thanks from you."

"I am not the less grateful," he answered.  "I had so fully expected to be killed, that I feel
like one risen from the dead."

"I trust that you have risen to newness of life," I ventured to say, for I am sure it was a
remark my father would have made, and I felt anxious to be assured that the young man was under
religious impressions.  It was an opportunity indeed I dare not let pass by.

"Yes, Miss Liddiard, I do feel that," he exclaimed.  "And with what horror do I reflect what
would have been my doom had I died with my companions.  I knew the truth when I was a boy,
for I had been brought up by a pious father and mother, but I became careless and wild, and
neglected all their precepts and warnings.  I went on from bad to worse, and at length, believing
that if I could get out to the Pacific--of which I had read--I could enjoy unfettered liberty
and licence, I shipped on board a vessel bound out, round Cape Horn.  Having knocked about
in the way I proposed for some time, though, as may be supposed, I did not find the life among
rough seamen and fierce savages as agreeable as I had expected, I at length reached Sydney
in New South Wales.  I there joined the sandal wood trader, which has been so fearfully destroyed.

"Just before going on board I met an old friend of my father's, a missionary, whom I had known
at home.  He spoke to me seriously, and warned me against joining the vessel, knowing as he
did, the lawless character of her crew.  He offered to obtain my discharge if I would come
and live with him.  His words made a deep impression on my heart, although I was too self-willed
to follow his advice.  During the voyage, while we were sailing from island to island, those
words often and often recurred to my mind.  I in vain attempted to drive them from me.  When
I saw my companions being put to death--expecting to meet the same fate-- how earnestly I wished
that I had followed my friend's counsels.  I could only utter, `Lord be merciful to me a sinner,'
and entreated God to protect me.  When I found myself so unexpectedly preserved, I remembered
the prayer I had uttered, and resolved to give myself to the service of God in any way He might
open out for me.  You now know my brief history, Miss Liddiard.  I felt bound to give it you,
but I am unwilling to trouble you with more than I have already told you about myself.  My
name is Charles Norton."

"You can have no difficulty in finding opportunities of serving God, Mr Norton," I exclaimed.
"When we see thousands and tens of thousands of human beings scattered about this broad Pacific
ignorant of Him, and given over to abominable heathen practices, all requiring to be fed with
the bread of life.  Why should you not prepare yourself to go forth as a missionary among them?"

"I feel that I am too unworthy and sinful to undertake so serious an office," he said humbly.

"No human being could be qualified to go forth as a missionary of the gospel trusting alone
to his own merits, and no one would be found to undertake the office were all influenced by
the opinion you express," I observed.  "All must feel their unworthiness and we must take God
at His word, and believe that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin, and then go
forth and declare what great things He has done for us.  I repeat what I have heard my father
say:--We must not trust to our feelings, but we must believe that God is a rewarder of those
who diligently serve Him, not only of those who have all along done so."

"You have given me new life and hope," exclaimed the young man. "Henceforth, if my life is
spared, after having prepared myself for the task, I will devote it to making known the gospel
to the poor heathens of these regions."

CHAPTER EIGHT.

WHILE ON OUR PASSAGE IN THE CANOE A STORM ARISES.--WE ARE DRIVEN FAR AWAY TO LEEWARD OF THE
ISLAND.--ABELA INSTRUCTS TOFA IN THE TRUTH.-- SCARCITY OF FOOD AND WATER.--OUR SUFFERINGS BECOME
INTENSE.--THE NATIVE CREW GIVE WAY TO DESPAIR.

Although the sea was rough the canoe had made good progress towards our destination when night
came on.  The wind had been increasing, and I saw the natives looking anxiously at the sky,
which had become overcast. The darkness was intense, and we had no compass in the canoe by
which to direct our course.  The native boatmen, however, continued steering on, trusting to
the wind, which had remained steadily blowing from one quarter.  Still, as the waves rose,
and our frail canoe pitched and tossed about, it seemed to me that she would be unable to accomplish
the passage.

Abela was sitting by us.  "Alas," she exclaimed, "we have escaped the fury of our enemies only,
I fear, to perish in the waves."

"Nay, nay, Abela," said Maud.  "God, who has protected us heretofore, can protect us still.
He will find a way for us to escape if it is His will that we should do so."

"Ah, you are right," answered Abela, "and I am weak and faithless to doubt His love."

Still I must confess that it required much strong faith not to feel nervous and alarmed while
we saw the dark foaming seas rising up around us, and apparently every moment about to overwhelm
our little vessel. The crew had lessened the sail, but yet it seemed scarcely capable of withstanding
the furious blasts which struck it.  Maud and I, with Abela and the other women, sat close
together in the little hut on deck.  I observed that Mr Norton and Tofa had come nearer us
as if to try and prevent us from being washed away should a sea break on board, which it appeared
too probable would occur.  The canoe was excessively buoyant, or she could not have escaped
being overwhelmed.  Onward she continued to fly over the tumbling waters, and we at length,
becoming accustomed to the movement of the vessel, began to hope that she would reach the shore
in safety, and already the crew were looking out in the expectation of seeing it ahead.

All our hopes were to be disappointed.  A furious blast struck the sail, and before it could
be lowered it was torn away, with the spars which supported it, and we were left helpless on
the wild ocean.  To attempt to use the paddles in such a sea was useless.  The helmsman had
turned the head of the canoe away from the wind, and all that now could be done was to fly
before it.  The gale increased.  On we went, expecting every moment that the seas would overwhelm
us.

We could sit quiet and pray, but I felt much for our poor heathen crew, who had no such consolation.
Abela had called young Tofa to her side, and was endeavouring to explain to him the glorious
truths of the faith she held, he seemed greatly struck by her calm resignation.

"Formerly you would have shrieked out, and trembled with fear," he observed.  "Now you seem
as brave as the boldest of our warriors."

"I am brave, because I know in whom I trust," answered Abela.  "I have the support of the Holy
Spirit sent by Jehovah.  Though I am by myself still very weak, my soul is at peace, and I
know if I am taken away from this world that I shall go to a better and more glorious land,
where I shall live with my Saviour, who has redeemed me, and bought me with the price of His
most precious blood."

"Oh, how I wish I could go with you to that glorious land," said the lad.  "But I am not fit;
I could not be received there, if Jehovah is the pure and holy Being you say He is."

"You will be fit to go the moment you accept the offers Jesus makes you, and you are sure to
be received there," answered Abela, and once more she explained to him the simple plan of salvation.
"You see, my son, that you have nothing to do; but all has been done for you, to satisfy God's
justice.  You are bought by the blood of Jesus.  God makes you a free gift of salvation.  If
He required anything in return it would not be a free gift.  If you had anything to pay it
would show that the purchase was not completed by Christ.  Now God says that the purchase was
completed on Calvary, and He tells us that eternal salvation is a free gift; we, therefore,
offend God when we want to pay anything to Him in return, and we dishonour the purchase made
by Christ when we fancy that it is insufficient.  Still, after you have become the servant
of Christ, if life is spared you, you will desire to obey Him, and please Him, and do His will
by every means in your power.  This will show that you have a living faith, and that you are
really, as you profess to be, His disciple."

"Oh, I am sure what you say is true," exclaimed Tofa.  "Although I cannot yet understand it
all I believe in Jesus, I trust to Him, I will never never again worship the foolish idols
I have till now trusted in. You must tell me all you have said over and over again, for I wish
to know all I can about Jesus, that should the canoe be overwhelmed by the sea, I may be ready
to go and dwell with Him."

The young Englishman occasionally spoke to us.  He was not ignorant of gospel truth, but, alas,
he had long sinned against light and knowledge, and rejected what he knew in his heart to be
true.  His merciful preservation had been the means of changing that heart, he was really born
again, and now the knowledge he possessed seemed to come back to him.  Notwithstanding the
fearful danger in which we were placed, his manner was calm and composed.  He did not speak
to us as many a brave worldly man would have done, urging us to keep up our spirits, expressing
a hope that the storm would soon abate, and that we should be able to return to the land; he
observed only, "we must trust in God's merciful protection; let us remember that we are in
His hands."

Maud and I responded to what he said.

"Those days I spent in solitude in the mountains have, indeed, been precious days to me, Miss
Liddiard," he continued.  "I felt like the prodigal son, who had returned to his father, and
the bright gleam of His smile seemed to rest on me.  My only regret was, that I had not His
word to apply to, but many precious verses which I had learned as a child came back to me,
and afforded me comfort and consolation, and then I could pray as I had never prayed before."

I told him that we had been employed in the same way, and that happily having a Bible we could
turn to the sacred page, and draw comfort from the ever flowing fountain.

Thus the hours of darkness passed away.  The canoe, from the lightness of her construction,
rode easily over the seas, driving, as she now was, directly before the gale, and we were not
pitched and tumbled about as we had been when the wind was on her side, and we were attempting
to steer for the island.  When morning dawned the foaming waters were around us on every side,
and we could just distinguish in the far distance, almost astern, the dim outline of the island
which we had hoped to reach.  Had the weather been moderate the canoe men might have attempted
to make their way towards it, but that, was now impossible, and we continued to drive on, leaving
it further and further behind. Where we were going we could not tell.  The natives knew of
no islands in that direction, and I heard them reminding each other of several canoes which
had been blown off the land and had not again been heard of.

We asked Mr Norton his opinion.  He had, he said, during the last day he was on board examined
a chart, and he could afford us but little hope that we should reach any shore where we might
obtain a new mast and sail and be able to return the way we had come.  "There are islands a
long way off; but as the inhabitants, I fear, are savage in the extreme, it would be dangerous
to land amongst them," he added.  "Still, though we speak of the dangers we may have to encounter,
let us continue, trusting firmly that God is watching over us, and though we cannot yet see
the way by which He intends to save us--if such is His good will--He has nevertheless got it
ready, while we on our part are bound to make every exertion to preserve our lives.  As we
may not for a considerable time reach land, I must therefore, in the first place, strongly
urge the people to place themselves on an allowance of food and water.  We should use as little
as will suffice to sustain life, that we may the longer be able to hold out."

I explained what the young Englishman said to Abela; and she and Tofa spoke to their countrymen,
and persuaded them to do as he advised.  The wind had somewhat abated, but as it was still
too strong to permit of our making head against it, we continued to drive on as before.  We
read the Bible, and prayed several times during the day, and occasionally some of the heathen
crew came, and, kneeling down near us, listened while I read.

Abela, although she had not begun her studies till about two years before this, read very fairly,
but she was especially powerful in prayer, and her whole heart and soul seemed lifted up as
she poured forth her petitions--seldom failing to exclaim, "Lord be merciful to me a sinner."

The hours passed on, and we felt that an all-powerful hand was protecting our frail bark from
the fury of the seas.  When the water washed into the canoe beneath the platform, it was quickly
bailed out again, and everything was so firmly secured, that in spite of the tossing and tumbling
of the vessel she held as tightly together as at first.

Another day and another and another passed by, and still the strong wind prevented us from
attempting to return.  Many of the heathen crew appeared to have resigned themselves to their
fate, and had it not been for the influence Abela exerted over them--supported as she was by
the young Englishman and Tofa--I believe that they would quickly have consumed all the provisions,
and have then laid down to die.

We were already feeling the ill effects of the small amount of food we could venture to eat.
The sun too, burst forth, and its burning rays striking down upon us; we now, in addition to
hunger, began to feel the fearful sufferings of thirst.  What must it be should a calm come
on! And although the crew might then use their paddles with effect, their strength would be
gone, and very many days must pass before we could regain the island from which we had been driven.

Often and often I thought of my poor father.  I persuaded myself that he had certainly remained
with Mr Hilton, and that had we arrived in safety we should have had the happiness of seeing
him.  Now should he return to the settlement, what would be his feelings to find it desolate,
and to suppose, as he must, that we had shared the fate of the other inhabitants.

Our condition was also becoming, humanly speaking, fearful in the extreme.  As I looked at
Maud's pale countenance I feared that she could not long endure such suffering.  I was not
aware that I looked equally ill.  The young Englishman treated us with the most gentle and
constant attention; he even insisted on our taking a portion of his scanty allowance of food
and water, and when we refused to deprive him of it I am sure that he took means to add it
unseen to our shares.  At length the gale ceased, the canoe no longer tumbled about, and the
heat of the sun's rays--as they shone upon the glass-like surface of the ocean on which we
floated--was intense in the extreme.  Abela urged the crew to get out their paddles, but they
answered, as I had expected, "we cannot live to reach the island, and when our food and water
are exhausted, we will lie down and die.  There is nothing else for us to do."

CHAPTER NINE.

A CALM.--THE CANOE FLOATS MOTIONLESS ON THE OCEAN.--MANY OF OUR NUMBER APPEAR TO BE DYING FOR
WANT OF WATER.--I FEAR CHIEFLY FOR MAUD, WHEN A SAIL IS SEEN, AND, WITH A RISING BREEZE, SHE
APPROACHES.--WE ARE RECEIVED ON BOARD THE "TRUE LOVE," AND KINDLY TREATED BY CAPTAIN HUDSON
AND HIS WIFE.

The canoe still floated motionless on the calm ocean, which shone like a sheet of burnished
gold.  Maud and I lay in each other's arms, expecting thus to die.  Still we could whisper
together, and talk of the glories of that heaven we hoped soon to reach.  Abela sat like a
mother watching over us, but she too was sinking.  Of the heathen crew several appeared to
be dying, if they were not already dead; but others, who had listened to the Word of Life,
gathered round us that they might hear the instruction which Abela, as long as she had the
power of speech, afforded them.  Young Tofa bore up bravely, and Mr Norton struggled wonderfully
with his sufferings.  He occasionally rose to his feet and gazed around, as if he still hoped
help would come ere it was too late. Another day I felt sure must terminate the existence of
most of those on board.

I closed my eyes, feeling a faintness coming over me, when I was aroused by Mr Norton's voice.
I saw him standing up, with his arms outstretched, and his dim eye lighted up.

"A sail! a sail!" he exclaimed.  "She is bringing up the breeze--she is standing this way."

This announcement gave me a strength I did not believe that I possessed--I raised Maud in my
arms.  "We shall be saved, dearest; our prayers have been heard," I whispered.  She opened
her eyes, and seemed to comprehend me.

"We must make a signal, or the vessel may pass us," said Mr Norton. "Can you direct the natives
to assist me?  The broken spars, if lashed together, will answer for a flagstaff."

I explained what the young Englishman required, and Tofa and a few others, although scarcely
able to lift themselves from the deck, secured the spars, and fastened them together as he
desired.  A piece of matting answered for a flag, and the flagstaff was held up on the deck.

How eagerly we watched the distant sail.

"She looks like a whaler, and if so, a bright look-out is certain to be kept on board," observed
Mr Norton.

On she came.  Unless our small flag was observed, as the deck of the canoe rose but a few feet
above the water, should she pass only a mile or two on either side she might sail away without
noticing us.  We did not forget to pray that we might be seen.  She came nearer and nearer.
At length, to our joy, we saw a flag run up to her mast-head as an answer to our signal.

We were seen.  Still the breeze was light, and the ship seemed to be a long time coming up to us.

Every moment was of consequence.  I dreaded lest aid should come too late for dear Maud, while
several others appeared unable to last much longer.

How often do we mistrust God's mercy.  The vessel came close to us, and heaving-to, a boat
was lowered.

"She is a whaler," exclaimed Mr Norton.  "Water, water--bring water with you," he shouted;
but his voice was faint and hollow, he pointed to his lips.

The sign was understood, for the boat put back, and a cask was lowered into it.  In another
minute, with sturdy strokes, the boat's crew dashed alongside.  We heard the sound of English
voices.

"You seem in a sad plight, my lad," said the officer of the boat.  "We thought you were all
savages.  Are there any more of you on board?"

Mr Norton pointed to where Maud and I lay.  The cask of water was lifted on deck, and the officer
approached us with a cup.  I begged him to give Maud some.  He poured a few drops down her throat.

"Come, young lady, you must take some now," he said.

How delicious was that draught--it almost instantly revived me.  I gave Maud some more, and
then offered the cup to Abela.  Those of the crew who could move crawled towards the cask.
The young seaman poured it out from the cask into their hands, that they might obtain it sooner.
I remember thinking it a fearful waste that any of the precious liquid should be spilled. 
Not till all the rest had received some water would Mr Norton take the cup which the mate offered
him.

"Now, young ladies, the sooner we get you on board, where our captain and his good wife will
look after you, the better," exclaimed the mate, as he offered to carry us to the boat.  I
begged that Abela might be brought with us.  He lifted me up in his arms as if I had been a
feather, and others followed, with Maud and Abela.  Mr Norton had scarcely strength to reach
the boat.  I explained that Tofa was a chief's son, and that having rendered us great service,
I begged that he might be treated with attention.

In a few minutes we were on board the "True Love," and in Captain Hudson's cabin, under the
care of his kind motherly wife.  She almost shed tears as she saw us; Maud especially excited
her sympathy.

"Poor dear child, she could not have lasted another hour, and she now will require all the
care we can bestow on her.  And we must look after you too," she added, addressing me.  "I
wonder you have held out so well.  You must tell me all about it by-and-by.  You are too weak
to talk now.  I cannot get a word out of any one else--not even from the young Englishman.
He fainted on reaching the deck, and my husband is attending to him; but you need not be alarmed,
he will come round in time."

I inquired for Abela.

"The native woman is in one of the mate's cabins.  I will go and attend to her directly, and
all the rest who are alive are safe on board; but five or six of the poor Indians were dead,
I am told, before they could be lifted from the deck of the canoe."

I grieved much to hear this, for I had entertained hopes that all when brought under Christian
instruction would have accepted the truth; but God's ways are inscrutable--we only know that
they are just and right.

Soon after Mrs Hudson had placed me in bed, I sank into a state of almost insensibility, and
was conscious only that I was attended by a kind hand.  I could neither speak nor think, and
knew not to what place the ship was carrying us.  My first inquiry on coming to myself, when
I saw Mrs Hudson standing over me, was for dear Maud.  My heart leaped with joy when I heard
her voice saying, "I am here Mary--I am so very very glad to hear you speaking again."  I found
that she was lying on a sofa outside my cabin, to which Mrs Hudson said she had entreated to
be brought, that she might be near me.  Abela, I found was also recovering, and Mr Norton was
well, and devoted himself to the care of the sufferers, some of whom were still in a precarious
state.

"He is trying to learn their language, and the young prince is never weary in giving him instruction,"
said Mrs Hudson.

"They call Tofa the young prince, because the rest of his people pay him so much respect,"
observed Maud.

I was truly thankful to hear this of Mr Norton.  I should have trembled for him, lest after
getting safely on board the ship had he shown that he had forgotten his good resolutions.

"That young Englishman is a very superior person indeed," observed Mrs Hudson.  "He has made
inquiries about you and your sister every hour in the day, and I really believe had you been
taken from us it would have broken his heart; he looked so anxious when I told him how ill
you were. He constantly also speaks to our crew, and reads the Bible to them, and prays with
them in the forecastle.  They seem very well pleased to hear him, and though my husband has
prayers every Sunday, he cannot go among them and talk to them in the familiar way this young
man does.  He tells me, though I am sure he is a gentleman born by his manners, that he has
served before the mast, and therefore knows their habits and ways, and that there is nothing
like being on an equality with people to win their hearts."

"Yes, that is what a missionary must be if he follows the example of his Master," I said. 
"Jesus made Himself equal to the poorest, and of no reputation, that He might gain souls to
Himself."

"Ah yes, my dear young lady, if all ministers of the gospel as well as missionaries acted thus,
His blessed religion would make more progress in the world than it now does."

In addition to my other causes of gratitude I thanked God that we had been taken on board a
ship commanded by a believing captain, with a kind excellent wife.  Through His mercy we were
greatly indebted to Mrs Hudson's constant and affectionate care for our recovery.

CHAPTER TEN.

MAUD AND I WITH MOST OF OUR PARTY RECOVER.--MR NORTON INSTRUCTS THE CREW, AND PROVES THAT HE
IS REALLY CONVERTED.--THE GREAT KINDNESS OF CAPTAIN AND MRS HUDSON.--THEY OFFER TO TAKE US
TO ENGLAND, BUT WE RESOLVE TO REMAIN ON AN ISLAND INHABITED BY CHRISTIANS, ON WHICH WE LAND,
THAT WE MAY DEVOTE OURSELVES TO MISSIONARY WORK.--MAUD IS RESTORED TO HER PARENTS.--CAPTAIN
HUDSON, ON A SUBSEQUENT VOYAGE, BRINGS MY FATHER TO US, AND I, HAVING BECOME THE WIFE OF MR
NORTON, WE RETURN TO OUR ISLAND, WHERE MASAUGU HAVING BECOME A CHRISTIAN, WITH LISELE AND HER
HUSBAND, ARE RESIDING.--THE WHOLE OF THE INHABITANTS BEFORE MY FATHER'S DEATH BEING ALSO CONVERTED
TO THE TRUTH.

We had been many days on board, and Maud and I were able to enjoy the fresh air on deck, where
Captain Hudson warmly congratulated us, in his fatherly manner, on our recovery; arranging
cushions on which we could recline--for we were still too weak to sit up--and kindly doing
all he could for us.  How glad we were again to see Abela and her companions, and to comfort
them in their sorrow, for they believed that they should never again see their native land.

Young Tofa, however, was perfectly content.  "I shall learn more about the religion of Jehovah,
and that will be my support wherever I am," he observed.

Mr Norton came up and spoke to us so gently, and yet with unmistakable earnestness in his mariner.
"Oh Miss Liddiard," he said, "I am now more than ever sure that our merciful Father in heaven
hears the prayers of the greatest of sinners who have returned to Him.  I have never ceased
beseeching Him that you might be restored to health, and that while you may enjoy happiness
yourself, you may prove a blessing to many of our fellow-creatures."

"I do indeed hope that I may be of use to some," I answered.  "I desire no greater happiness
than to be employed in God's service."

"Such will, I believe, be the occupation of the blessed throughout eternity, although He has
not revealed to His creatures the way in which they are to be employed.  That surpasses human
comprehension," he observed.

A few days after this we came in sight of a high and picturesque island, even more beautiful
than the one we had left.

"My dear young lady," said Captain Hudson, "I should be very sorry to part with you, and would
gladly have carried you with me to old England, but the poor natives are, I am sure, anxious
to be put on shore, and as an English missionary resides on yonder island, and all the inhabitants
are Christians, I thought it best to go there to land those who desire to land.  Will you and
your sister remain with us?  The ship's time in these seas will soon be up, and when we get
to England our house shall be your home.  We have no children of our own, and my wife and I
will do our best to act the part of the parents you have lost."

My heart swelled with gratitude to the kind captain and his wife.  I could scarcely speak.
I had often thought of England, and how delightful it would be to see it, but I had resolved
to devote myself, as my dear father and mother had done, in endeavouring to make known the
gospel among the heathen islanders.  I knew their language and customs, and felt that I was
suited for the task.  I was sure also that Maud would not consent to leave me; still, I did
not wish to bias her should she desire to accept Captain and Mrs Hudson's offer.  My eyes filled
with tears as I took the captain's hand, and expressed my gratitude for his generous proposal.
I told him the object on which my heart was set, and had it not been for that, how thankful
I should have been to accept his offer.  I then explained that Maud was not my sister, and
gave him her history, adding, that she would indeed be fortunate to have such kind protectors
as I was sure he and Mrs Hudson would prove.

"I will ask her," said the captain.  "But I should like to have had you both."

I waited anxiously to hear what Maud would say, earnestly praying meantime that she would be
directed aright.  I had closed my eyes, when I felt Maud's arms round me.  "I cannot, no I
cannot leave you, dear Mary, where you go I will go," she whispered.  "If you had said yes
to the good captain I would gladly have accompanied you.  If you remain out here I will remain
also."

As we neared the harbour a canoe, manned by natives in white jackets and trousers and straw
hats, came off.  One of them, in good English, announced himself as a pilot, and under his
charge the "True Love" was safely conducted into a secure and beautiful harbour, where her
anchor was dropped.  Neat white-washed houses lined the shore; beyond them rose several buildings
of good size, the largest of which was a stone church with tower and belfry.  Plantations extended
on every side as far as the eye could reach.  Everything wore an aspect of peace and contentment.
How different from that of the heathen island we had left!  Yet a short time before the numerous
dark skinned natives, well clothed and in their right minds, were naked heathen savages, such
as those among whom we had dwelt, and often despaired would ever be brought to know the truths
of the gospel.

The boat was lowered, and Maud and I, with Mr Norton, Abela, and Tofa, were seated in her,
accompanied by Captain and Mrs Hudson, on our way to the house of Mr Arnold, the missionary
of which they had before spoken, and to whom, they had told us, they were well-known.  On landing
we proceeded along a well made clean road, at the further end of which, some way from the shore,
stood Mr Arnold's house.  How neat and beautiful it looked, with its garden full of flowering
shrubs, and a broad verandah in front!

Mr Arnold came out to meet us, followed by his wife.  A few words from Captain Hudson served
to explain who we were.

"Indeed you are welcome, most welcome," he exclaimed, taking our hands. "We have enough and
to spare, and there is work for all of you if, as I trust, you are willing to labour in the
Lord's vineyard."

We were soon seated around the missionary's hospitable board, for Captain Hudson's ship was
well-known, and Mrs Arnold had been preparing for the guests she was sure would come before
they left the Pacific. She was an interesting looking lady, but there was an expression of
sadness in her countenance, which at once struck me.  Our host and hostess had, of course,
many questions to ask, and we gave them an account of the dreadful events which had occurred
to us.  Captain Hudson told them of his wish to carry us on with him to England.

"We only desire to have willing labourers," observed Mr Arnold, "and they having counted the
cost must decide for themselves.  They have some experience what it is; and you, Mr Norton,
do you intend to return home?" he asked.

"My desire is, the Lord helping me, to prepare myself for a missionary among the heathen islanders
of these seas," he answered.  "I have counted the cost, and with God's grace I hope not to
turn back."

Mr Arnold warmly pressed his hand.  "We will pray that His grace will ever continue with you,"
he said.  I felt an infinite satisfaction at hearing this.

While the gentlemen went out to walk we remained with Mrs Arnold, who gave us much interesting
information about their island, and her account raised my hopes that our own poor savages,
as I called them, might some day enjoy the same inestimable blessings, and that smiling villages
and churches and schools might appear throughout the island.

On Mr Arnold's return I saw that he was greatly agitated, and cast an eager inquiring glance
at Maud.  He advanced towards her, but seemingly restrained himself, and taking his wife by
the hand, led her from the room.

During their absence Captain Hudson, sitting down by Maud, to my great surprise said, "Do you
think, my dear, that the poor lady you supposed was your mother was really so?"

Maud started, then seemed lost in thought.  "She was very, very kind to me, and I used to call
her `mamma,' because I had no other mamma then, but I have a faint idea that there was some
one else whom I loved still better, and who had given me to her, saying, that we should meet
again."

"Then I think there is no doubt it," exclaimed Captain Hudson.  "Suppose you were to find your
real father and mother, could you bear the joy of meeting them?" he asked.

Maud trembled all over, and I now began to suspect the truth.  In a few minutes Mr and Mrs
Arnold re-entered the room.  I was surprised at the wonderful command which Mr Arnold had over
himself.  He placed his wife on a sofa, and then led Maud up to her.

"It may be that we are in error," he said, "but God's goodness is great, and such as this dear
girl is might have been our child."

Mrs Arnold gazed at Maud's features for a few moments, then hastily took off her tippet.  On
her neck was a well-known mark which assured her that her hopes were realised.  She drew her
to her bosom and sobbed aloud.

We truly grieved to part with good Captain and Mrs Hudson, but we were to meet ere long again.
Our heathen crew were soon distributed among the inhabitants, and all of them earnestly desired
to be instructed in the truth.  Tofa made rapid progress in his studies under Mr Arnold, and
expressed his ardent wish to return as a missionary to his native land.  Mrs Norton laboured
devotedly as a catechist, and rendered the greatest service to Mr Arnold in his work, while
Maud and I assisted Mrs Arnold in the girls' school, as we had been accustomed to do under
my dear mother, while Abela was of great use among the older women.

Two years passed by, when it was announced that the "True Love" was once more entering the
harbour.  We hastened down to the landing-place to meet our kind old friend.  We saw the boat
coming with the captain and his wife and a gentleman with them.  Captain Hudson assisted him
to land.  He gazed anxiously at us as we approached, then tottered towards me with arms outstretched.

My joy was full.  He was my dear father.  He had supposed we had all perished, till Captain
Hudson, a short time before, had put in to visit Mr Hilton's station.  His former faith had
supported him through all his afflictions, and now, how full was his heart with gratitude at
having me restored to him.  I saw by his thin and wasted figure and pale countenance how much
he required a daughter's care.  He brought glorious intelligence from our island.

Masaugu had become a devoted Christian, and having made peace with his former foes, had, accompanied
by Lisele, returned home, many of his people having also cast aside their idols.

I have not hitherto said that a short time before Mr Norton had asked me to become his wife.
My father, hearing of his character from Mr Arnold, gave his full consent.  Captain Hudson
was bound in the direction of our island.  With my devoted husband and father, accompanied
by Abela and Tofa and several of our formerly heathen crew, we embarked on board the "True Love."

I could not have borne parting with Maud had I not known that she was left with loving parents,
who would amply supply my place as my husband supplied hers in my heart.

I need not say how joyfully we were welcomed by Lisele and her Christian husband, the young
chief.  We had, notwithstanding, many difficulties to encounter.  The heathens offered all
the opposition in their power, but at length they were conquered,--not by force of arms, but
by the power of gospel truth, and ere my dear father was laid beside my mother's grave, he
had the happiness of seeing the once heathen inhabitants of our island, as also of many others
in the Pacific, cast aside their idols and become faithful worshippers of Jehovah, trusting
to the all-cleansing of the blood of the Lamb slain on Calvary for sinners.

FINIS.
