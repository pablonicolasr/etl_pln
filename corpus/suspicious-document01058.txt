TOLSTOY ON SHAKESPEARE

I

Mr. Crosby's article[1] on Shakespeare's attitude toward the working classes suggested to me
the idea of also expressing my own long-established opinion about the works of Shakespeare,
in direct opposition, as it is, to that established in all the whole European world. Calling
to mind all the struggle of doubt and self-deceit,--efforts to attune myself to Shakespeare--which
I went through owing to my complete disagreement with this universal adulation, and, presuming
that many have experienced and are experiencing the same, I think that it may not be unprofitable
to express definitely and frankly this view of mine, opposed to that of the majority, and the
more so as the conclusions to which I came, when examining the causes of my disagreement with
the universally established opinion, are, it seems to me, not without interest and significance.

My disagreement with the established opinion about Shakespeare is not the result of an accidental
frame of mind, nor of a light-minded attitude toward the matter, but is the outcome of many
years' repeated and insistent endeavors to harmonize my own views of Shakespeare with those
established amongst all civilized men of the Christian world.

I remember the astonishment I felt when I first read Shakespeare. I expected to receive a powerful
esthetic pleasure, but having read, one after the other, works regarded as his best: "King
Lear," "Romeo and Juliet," "Hamlet" and "Macbeth," not only did I feel no delight, but I felt
an irresistible repulsion and tedium, and doubted as to whether I was senseless in feeling
works regarded as the summit of perfection by the whole of the civilized world to be trivial
and positively bad, or whether the significance which this civilized world attributes to the
works of Shakespeare was itself senseless. My consternation was increased by the fact that
I always keenly felt the beauties of poetry in every form; then why should artistic works recognized
by the whole world as those of a genius,--the works of Shakespeare,--not only fail to please
me, but be disagreeable to me? For a long time I could not believe in myself, and during fifty
years, in order to test myself, I several times recommenced reading Shakespeare in every possible
form, in Russian, in English, in German and in Schlegel's translation, as I was advised. Several
times I read the dramas and the comedies and historical plays, and I invariably underwent the
same feelings: repulsion, weariness, and bewilderment. At the present time, before writing
this preface, being desirous once more to test myself, I have, as an old man of seventy-five,
again read the whole of Shakespeare, including the historical plays, the "Henrys," "Troilus
and Cressida," the "Tempest," "Cymbeline," and I have felt, with even greater force, the same
feelings,--this time, however, not of bewilderment, but of firm, indubitable conviction that
the unquestionable glory of a great genius which Shakespeare enjoys, and which compels writers
of our time to imitate him and readers and spectators to discover in him non-existent merits,--thereby
distorting their esthetic and ethical understanding,--is a great evil, as is every untruth.

Altho I know that the majority of people so firmly believe in the greatness of Shakespeare
that in reading this judgment of mine they will not admit even the possibility of its justice,
and will not give it the slightest attention, nevertheless I will endeavor, as well as I can,
to show why I believe that Shakespeare can not be recognized either as a great genius, or even
as an average author.

For illustration of my purpose I will take one of Shakespeare's most extolled dramas, "King
Lear," in the enthusiastic praise of which, the majority of critics agree.

"The tragedy of Lear is deservedly celebrated among the dramas of Shakespeare," says Dr. Johnson.
It is, then, the best of Shakespeare's plays, for it is the one in which he was the most in
earnest."

"If the originality of invention did not so much stamp almost every play of Shakespeare," says
Hallam, "that to name one as the most original seems a disparagement to others, we might say
that this great prerogative of genius, was exercised above all in 'Lear.' It diverges more
from the model of regular tragedy than 'Macbeth,' or 'Othello,' and even more than 'Hamlet,'
but the fable is better constructed than in the last of these and it displays full as much
of the almost superhuman inspiration of the poet as the other two."

"'King Lear' may be recognized as the perfect model of the dramatic art of the whole world,"
says Shelley.

"I am not minded to say much of Shakespeare's Arthur," says Swinburne. "There are one or two
figures in the world of his work of which there are no words that would be fit or good to say.
Another of these is Cordelia. The place they have in our lives and thoughts is not one for
talk. The niche set apart for them to inhabit in our secret hearts is not penetrable by the
lights and noises of common day. There are chapels in the cathedrals of man's highest art,
as in that of his inmost life, not made to be set open to the eyes and feet of the world. Love,
and Death, and Memory, keep charge for us in silence of some beloved names. It is the crowning
glory of genius, the final miracle and transcendent gift of poetry, that it can add to the
number of these and engrave on the very heart of our remembrance fresh names and memories of
its own creation."

"Lear is the occasion for Cordelia," says Victor Hugo. "Maternity of the daughter toward the
father; profound subject; maternity venerable among all other maternities, so admirably rendered
by the legend of that Roman girl, who, in the depths of a prison, nurses her old father. The
young breast near the white beard! There is not a spectacle more holy. This filial breast is
Cordelia. Once this figure dreamed of and found, Shakespeare created his drama.... Shakespeare,
carrying Cordelia in his thoughts, created that tragedy like a god who, having an aurora to
put forward, makes a world expressly for it."

"In 'King Lear,' Shakespeare's vision sounded the abyss of horror to its very depths, and his
spirit showed neither fear, nor giddiness, nor faintness, at the sight," says Brandes. "On
the threshold of this work, a feeling of awe comes over one, as on the threshold of the Sistine
Chapel, with its ceiling of frescoes by Michael Angelo,--only that the suffering here is far
more intense, the wail wilder, and the harmonies of beauty more definitely shattered by the
discords of despair."

Such are the judgments of the critics about this drama, and therefore I believe I am not wrong
in selecting it as a type of Shakespeare's best.

As impartially as possible, I will endeavor to describe the contents of the drama, and then
to show why it is not that acme of perfection it is represented to be by critics, but is something
quite different.

II

The drama of "Lear" begins with a scene giving the conversation between two courtiers, Kent
and Gloucester. Kent, pointing to a young man present, asks Gloucester whether that is not
his son. Gloucester says that he has often blushed to acknowledge the young man as his son,
but has now ceased doing so. Kent says he "can not conceive him." Then Gloucester in the presence
of this son of his says: "The fellow's mother could, and grew round-wombed, and had a son for
her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed." "I have another, a legitimate son," continues
Gloucester, "but altho this one came into the world before he was sent for, his mother was
fair and there was good sport at his making, and therefore I acknowledge this one also."

Such is the introduction. Not to mention the coarseness of these words of Gloucester, they
are, farther, out of place in the mouth of a person intended to represent a noble character.
One can not agree with the opinion of some critics that these words are given to Gloucester
in order to show the contempt for his illegitimacy from which Edmund suffers. Were this so,
it would first have been unnecessary to make the father express the contempt felt by men in
general, and, secondly, Edmund, in his monolog about the injustice of those who despise him
for his birth, would have mentioned such words from his father. But this is not so, and therefore
these words of Gloucester at the very beginning of the piece, were merely intended as a communication
to the public--in a humorous form--of the fact that Gloucester has a legitimate son and an
illegitimate one.

After this, trumpets are blown, and King Lear enters with his daughters and sons-in-law, and
utters a speech to the effect that, owing to old age, he wishes to retire from the cares of
business and divide his kingdom between his daughters. This is the reason I can write an article
on the Letter-Bell, and other such subjects; I have never given the lie to my own soul. If I
have felt any impression once, I feel it more strongly a second time; and I have no wish to
revile and discard my best thoughts. There is at length a thorough keeping in what I write--not
a line that betrays a principle or disguises a feeling. If my wealth is small, it all goes
to enrich the same heap; and trifles in this way accumulate to a tolerable sum.--Or if the Letter-Bell
does not lead me a dance into the country, it fixes me in the thick of my town recollections,
I know not how long ago. It was a kind of alarm to break off from my work when there happened
to be company to dinner or when I was going to the play. The king rewards this daughter, also, and then asks his youngest, the favorite,
in whom, according to his expression, are "interess'd the vines of France and the milk of Burgundy,"
that is, whose hand is being claimed by the King of France and the Duke of Burgundy,--he asks
Cordelia how she loves him. Cordelia, who personifies all the virtues, as the eldest two all
the vices, says, quite out of place, as if on purpose to irritate her father, that altho she
loves and honors him, and is grateful to him, yet if she marries, all her love will not belong
to her father, but she will also love her husband.

Hearing these words, the King loses his temper, and curses this favorite daughter with the
most dreadful and strange maledictions, saying, for instance, that he will henceforth love
his daughter as little as he loves the man who devours his own children.

The courtier, Kent, defends Cordelia, and desiring to appease the King, rebukes him for his
injustice, and says reasonable things about the evil of flattery. Lear, unmoved by Kent, banishes
him under pain of death, and calling to him Cordelia's two suitors, the Duke of Burgundy and
the King of France, proposes to them in turn to take Cordelia without dowry. The Duke of Burgundy
frankly says that without dowry he will not take Cordelia, but the King of France takes her
without dowry and leads her away. After this, the elder sisters, there and then entering into
conversation, prepare to injure their father who had endowed them.

The second scene opens with Edmund, Gloucester's illegitimate son, soliloquizing on the injustice
of men, who concede rights and respect to the legitimate son, but deprive the illegitimate
son of them, and he determines to ruin Edgar, and to usurp his place. For this purpose, he
forges a letter to himself as from Edgar, in which the latter expresses a desire to murder
his father. Awaiting his father's approach, Edmund, as if against his will, shows him this
letter, and the father immediately believes that his son Edgar, whom he tenderly loves, desires
to kill him. The father goes away, Edgar enters and Edmund persuades him that his father for
some reason desires to kill him. Edgar immediately believes this and flees from his parent.

The relations between Gloucester and his two sons, and the feelings of these characters are
as unnatural as Lear's relation to his daughters, or even more so, and therefore it is still
more difficult for the spectator to transport himself into the mental condition of Gloucester
and his sons and sympathize with them, than it is to do so into that of Lear and his daughters.

In the fourth scene, the banished Kent, so disguised that Lear does not recognize him, presents
himself to Lear, who is already staying with Goneril. Lear asks who he is, to which Kent answers,
one doesn't know why, in a tone quite inappropriate to his position: "A very honest-hearted
fellow and as poor as the King."--"If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a King, thou
art poor enough--How old art thou?" asks the King. "Not so young, Sir, to love a woman, etc.,
nor so old to dote on her." To this the King says, "If I like thee no worse after dinner, I
will not part from thee yet."

These speeches follow neither from Lear's position, nor his relation to Kent, but are put into
the mouths of Lear and Kent, evidently because the author regards them as witty and amusing.

Goneril's steward appears, and behaves rudely to Lear, for which Kent knocks him down. The
King, still not recognizing Kent, gives him money for this and takes him into his service.
After this appears the fool, and thereupon begins a prolonged conversation between the fool
and the King, utterly unsuited to the position and serving no purpose. Thus, for instance,
the fool says, "Give me an egg and I'll give thee two crowns." The King asks, "What crowns
shall they be?"--"Why," says the fool, "after I have cut the egg i' the middle, and eat up
the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest
away both parts, thou borest thine ass on thy back o'er the dirt: thou hadst little wit in
thy bald crown when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak like myself in this, let him
be whipp'd that first finds it so."

In this manner lengthy conversations go on calling forth in the spectator or reader that wearisome
uneasiness which one experiences when listening to jokes which are not witty.

This conversation was interrupted by the approach of Goneril. She demands of her father that
he should diminish his retinue; that he should be satisfied with fifty courtiers instead of
a hundred. At this suggestion, Lear gets into a strange and unnatural rage, and asks:

    "Doth any here know me? Ha! 'tis not so.
     Who is it that can tell me who I am?"

And so forth.

While this goes on the fool does not cease to interpolate his humorless jokes. Goneril's husband
then enters and wishes to appease Lear, but Lear curses Goneril, invoking for her either sterility
or the birth of such an infant-monster as would return laughter and contempt for her motherly
cares, and would thus show her all the horror and pain caused by a child's ingratitude.

These words which express a genuine feeling, might have been touching had they stood alone.
But they are lost among long and high-flown speeches, which Lear keeps incessantly uttering
quite inappropriately. He either invokes "blasts and fogs" upon the head of his daughter, or
desires his curse to "pierce every sense about her," or else appealing to his own eyes, says
that should they weep, he will pluck them out and "cast them with the waters that they lose
to temper clay." And so on.

After this, Lear sends Kent, whom he still fails to recognize, to his other daughter, and notwithstanding
the despair he has just manifested, he talks with the fool, and elicits his jokes. The jokes
continue to be mirthless and besides creating an unpleasant feeling, similar to shame, the
usual effect of unsuccessful witticisms, they are also so drawn out as to be positively dull.
Thus the fool asks the King whether he can tell why one's nose stands in the middle of one's
face? Lear says he can not.--

     "Why, to keep one's eyes of either side 's nose, that what a
     man can not smell out, he may spy out."

     "Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?"

     "No."

     "Nor I either; but I can tell why a snail has a house."

     "Why?"

     "Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to his
     daughters and leave his horns without a case."

     "----Be my horses ready?"

     "Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the seven
     stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason."

     "Because they are not eight?"

     "Yes, indeed: thou would'st make a good fool."

And so on.

After this lengthy scene, a gentleman enters and announces that the horses are ready. The fool
says:

    "She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,
     Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter."

The second part of the first scene of the second act begins by the villain Edmund persuading
his brother, when their father enters, to pretend that they are fighting with their swords.
Edgar consents, altho it is utterly incomprehensible why he should do so. The father finds
them fighting. Edgar flies and Edmund scratches his arm to draw blood and persuades his father
that Edgar was working charms for the purpose of killing his father and had desired Edmund
to help him, but that he, Edmund, had refused and that then Edgar flew at him and wounded his
arm. Gloucester believes everything, curses Edgar and transfers all the rights of the elder
and legitimate son to the illegitimate Edmund. The Duke, hearing of this, also rewards Edmund.

In the second scene, in front of Gloucester's palace, Lear's new servant, Kent, still unrecognized
by Lear, without any reason, begins to abuse Oswald, Goneril's steward, calling him,--"A knave,
a rascal, an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound,
filthy, worsted-stocking knave;--the son and heir of a mongrel bitch." And so on. Then drawing
his sword, he demands that Oswald should fight with him, saying that he will make a "sop o'
the moonshine" of him,--words which no commentators can explain. When he is stopped, he continues
to give vent to the strangest abuse, saying that a tailor made Oswald, as "a stone-cutter or
a painter could not have made him so ill, tho they had been but two hours o' the trade!" He
further says that, if only leave be given him, he will "tread this unbolted villain into mortar
and daub the wall of a jakes with him."

Thus Kent, whom nobody recognizes, altho both the King and the Duke of Cornwall, as well as
Gloucester who is present, ought to know him well, continues to brawl, in the character of
Lear's new servant, until he is taken and put in the stocks.

The third scene takes place on a heath. Edgar, flying from the persecutions of his father,
hides in a wood and tells the public what kind of lunatics exist there--beggars who go about
naked, thrust wooden pricks and pins into their flesh, scream with wild voices and enforce
charity, and says that he wishes to simulate such a lunatic in order to save himself from persecution.
Having communicated this to the public, he retires.

The fourth scene is again before Gloucester's castle. Enter Lear and the fool. Lear sees Kent
in the stocks, and, still not recognizing him, is inflamed with rage against those who dared
so to insult his messenger, and calls for the Duke and Regan. The fool goes on with his jokes.

Lear with difficulty restrains his ire. Enter the Duke and Regan. Lear complains of Goneril
but Regan justifies her sister. Lear curses Goneril, and, when Regan tells him he had better
return to her sister, he is indignant and says: "Ask her forgiveness?" and falls down on his
knees demonstrating how indecent it would be if he were abjectly to beg food and clothing as
charity from his own daughter, and he curses Goneril with the strangest curses and asks who
put his servant in the stocks. Before Regan can answer, Goneril arrives. Lear becomes yet more
exasperated and again curses Goneril, but when he is told that it was the Duke himself who
ordered the stocks, he does not say anything, because, at this moment, Regan tells him that
she can not receive him now and that he had best return to Goneril, and that in a month's time
she herself will receive him, with, however, not a hundred but fifty servants. Lear again curses
Goneril and does not want to go to her, continuing to hope that Regan will accept him with
the whole hundred servants. But Regan says she will receive him only with twenty-five and then
Lear makes up his mind to go back to Goneril who admits fifty. But when Goneril says that even
twenty-five are too many, Lear pours forth a long argument about the superfluous and the needful
being relative and says that if man is not allowed more than he needs, he is not to be distinguished
from a beast. Lear, or rather the actor who plays Lear's part, adds that there is no need for
a lady's finery, which does not keep her warm. After this he flies into a mad fury and says
that to take vengeance on his daughters he will do something dreadful but that he will not
weep, and so he departs. A storm begins.

Such is the second act, full of unnatural events, and yet more unnatural speeches, not flowing
from the position of the characters,--and finishing with a scene between Lear and his daughters
which might have been powerful if it had not been permeated with the most absurdly foolish,
unnatural speeches--which, moreover, have no relation to the subject,--put into the mouth of
Lear. Lear's vacillations between pride, anger, and the hope of his daughters' giving in, would
be exceedingly touching if it were not spoilt by the verbose absurdities to which he gives
vent, about being ready to divorce himself from Regan's dead mother, should Regan not be glad
to receive him,--or about his calling down "fen suck'd frogs" which he invokes, upon the head
of his daughter, or about the heavens being obliged to patronize old people because they themselves
are old.

The third act begins with thunder, lightning, a storm of some special kind such as, according
to the words of the characters in the piece, had never before taken place. On the heath, a
gentleman tells Kent that Lear, banished by his daughters from their homes, is running about
the heath alone, tearing his hair and throwing it to the wind, and that none but the fool is
with him. In return Kent tells the gentleman that the dukes have quarrelled, and that the French
army has landed at Dover, and, having communicated this intelligence, he dispatches the gentleman
to Dover to meet Cordelia.

The second scene of the third act also takes place on the heath, but in another part of it.
Lear walks about the heath and says words which are meant to express his despair: he desires
that the winds should blow so hard that they should crack their cheeks and that the rain should
flood everything, that lightning should singe his white head, and the thunder flatten the world
and destroy all germens "that make ungrateful man!" The fool keeps uttering still more senseless
words. Enter Kent. Lear says that for some reason during this storm all criminals shall be
found out and convicted. Kent, still unrecognized by Lear, endeavors to persuade him to take
refuge in a hovel. At this point the fool pronounces a prophecy in no wise related to the situation
and they all depart. 

Afterwards, when he gets a servant in livery to do this for him, he may have other and more ostensible
sources of satisfaction--greater splendour, wealth, or fame; but he will not be so wholly in his
art, nor will his art have such a hold on him as when he was too
poor to transfer its meanest drudgery to others--too humble to despise
aught that had to do with the object of his glory and his pride, with
that on which all his projects of ambition or pleasure were founded.

"Entire affection scorneth nicer hands."
 This true feeling, expressed in simple words, might elicit sympathy,
but amidst the incessant, pompous raving it escapes one and loses its significance.

The hovel into which Lear is led, turns out to be the same which Edgar has entered, disguised
as a madman, i.e., naked. Edgar comes out of the hovel, and, altho all have known him, no one
recognizes him,--as no one recognizes Kent,--and Edgar, Lear, and the fool begin to say senseless
things which continue with interruptions for many pages. In the middle of this scene, enter
Gloucester, who also does not recognize either Kent or his son Edgar, and tells them how his
son Edgar wanted to kill him.

This scene is again cut short by another in Gloucester's castle, during which Edmund betrays
his father and the Duke promises to avenge himself on Gloucester. Then the scene shifts back
to Lear. Kent, Edgar, Gloucester, Lear, and the fool are at a farm and talking. Edgar says:
"Frateretto calls me, and tells me Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness...." The fool
says: "Tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a yeoman?" Lear, having lost his mind, says
that the madman is a king. The fool says no, the madman is the yeoman who has allowed his son
to become a gentleman. Lear screams: "To have a thousand with red burning spirits. Come hissing
in upon 'em,"--while Edgar shrieks that the foul fiend bites his back. At this the fool remarks
that one can not believe "in the tameness of a wolf, a horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's
oath." Then Lear imagines he is judging his daughters. "Sit thou here, most learned justicer,"
says he, addressing the naked Edgar; "Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she foxes." To
this Edgar says: "Look where he stands and glares! Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?" "Come
o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,----" while the fool sings:

    "Her boat hath a leak
     And she must not speak
     Why she dares not come over to thee."

Edgar goes on in his own strain. Kent suggests that Lear should lie down, but Lear continues
his imaginary trial: "Bring in their evidence," he cries. "Thou robed man of justice, take
thy place," he says to Edgar, "and thou" (to the fool) "his yoke-fellow of equity, bench by
his side. You are o' the commission, sit you too," addressing Kent.

"Purr, the cat is gray," shouts Edgar.

"Arraign her first, 'tis Goneril," cries Lear. "I here take my oath before this honorable assembly,
she kicked the poor king, her father."

"Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?" says the fool, addressing the seat.

"And here's another," cries Lear. "Stop her there! arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the
place! False justice, why hast thou let her 'scape?"

This raving terminates by Lear falling asleep and Gloucester persuading Kent, still without
recognizing him, to carry Lear to Dover, and Kent and the fool carry off the King.

The scene is transferred to Gloucester's castle. Gloucester himself is about to be accused
of treason. He is brought forward and bound. The Duke of Cornwall plucks out one of his eyes
and sets his foot on it. Regan says, "One side will mock another; the other too." The Duke
wishes to pluck the other out also, but some servant, for some reason, suddenly takes Gloucester's
part and wounds the Duke. Regan kills the servant, who, dying, says to Gloucester that he has
"one eye left to see some mischief on him." The Duke says, "Lest it see more, prevent it,"
and he tears out Gloucester's other eye and throws it on the ground. Here Regan says that it
was Edmund who betrayed his father and then Gloucester immediately understands that he has
been deceived and that Edgar did not wish to kill him.

Thus ends the third act.

The fourth act is again on the heath. Edgar, still attired as a lunatic, soliloquizes in stilted
terms about the instability of fortune and the advantages of a humble lot. Then there comes
to him somehow into the very place on the heath where he is, his father, the blinded Gloucester,
led by an old man. In that characteristic Shakespearean language,--the chief peculiarity of
which is that the thoughts are bred either by the consonance or the contrasts of words,--Gloucester
also speaks about the instability of fortune. He tells the old man who leads him to leave him,
but the old man points out to him that he can not see his way. Gloucester says he has no way
and therefore does not require eyes. And he argues about his having stumbled when he saw, and
about defects often proving commodities. "Ah! dear son Edgar," he adds, "might I but live to
see thee in my touch, I'd say I had eyes again." Edgar naked, and in the character of a lunatic,
hearing this, still does not disclose himself to his father. He takes the place of the aged
guide and talks with his father, who does not recognize his voice, but regards him as a wandering
madman. Gloucester avails himself of the opportunity to deliver himself of a witticism: "'Tis
the times' plague when madmen lead the blind," and he insists on dismissing the old man, obviously
not from motives which might be natural to Gloucester at that moment, but merely in order,
when left alone with Edgar, to enact the later scene of the imaginary leaping from the cliff.

Notwithstanding Edgar has just seen his blinded father, and has learnt that his father repents
of having banished him, he puts in utterly unnecessary interjections which Shakespeare might
know, having read them in Haronet's book, but which Edgar had no means of becoming acquainted
with, and above all, which it was quite unnatural for him to repeat in his present position.
He says, "Five friends have been in poor Tom at once: of lust, as Obidient; Hobbididance, prince
of dumbness; Mahu, of stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and mowing; who
since possesses chambermaids and waiting women."

Having pronounced these strange words, the blind Gloucester requests Edgar to lead him to a
certain cliff overhanging the sea, and they depart.

The second scene of the fourth act takes place before the Duke of Albany's palace. Goneril
is not only cruel, but also depraved. She despises her husband and discloses her love to the
villain Edmund, who has inherited the title of his father Gloucester. Edmund leaves, and a
conversation takes place between Goneril and her husband. The Duke of Albany, the only figure
with human feelings, who had already previously been dissatisfied with his wife's treatment
of her father, now resolutely takes Lear's side, but expresses his emotion in such words as
to shake one's confidence in his feeling. He says that a bear would lick Lear's reverence,
that if the heavens do not send their visible spirits to tame these vile offenses, humanity
must prey on itself like monsters, etc.

Goneril does not listen to him, and then he begins to abuse her:

    "See thyself, devil!
     Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
     So horrid as in woman."

"O vain fool," says Goneril.

After this a messenger enters, and announces that the Duke of Cornwall, wounded by his servant
whilst plucking out Gloucester's eyes, had died. Goneril is glad but already anticipates with
fear that Regan, now a widow, will deprive her of Edmund. Here the second scene ends. 

A learned Scotch professor found fault with an ingenious friend and arch-critic for cultivating
a rookery on his grounds: the professor declared "he would as soon think of encouraging a
froggery." This was barbarous as it was senseless.
 The gentleman says that her face reminded one of sunshine and rain.

And so forth.

The gentleman says that Cordelia desires to see her father, but Kent says that Lear is ashamed
of seeing this daughter whom he has treated so unkindly.

In the fourth scene, Cordelia, talking with a physician, tells him that Lear has been seen,
that he is quite mad, wearing on his head a wreath of various weeds, that he is roaming about
and that she has sent soldiers in search of him, adding that she desires all secret remedies
to spring with her tears, and the like.

She is informed that the forces of the Dukes are approaching, but she is concerned only about
her father and departs.

The fifth scene of the fourth act lies in Gloucester's castle. Regan is talking with Oswald,
Goneril's steward, who is carrying a letter from Goneril to Edmund, and she announces to him
that she also loves Edmund and that, being a widow, it is better for her to marry him than
for Goneril to do so, and she begs him to persuade her sister of this. Further she tells him
that it was very unreasonable to blind Gloucester and yet leave him alive, and therefore advises
Oswald, should he meet Gloucester, to kill him, promising him a great reward if he does this.

In the sixth scene, Gloucester again appears with his still unrecognized son Edgar, who (now
in the guise of a peasant) pretends to lead his father to the cliff. Gloucester is walking
along on level land but Edgar persuades him that they are with difficulty ascending a steep
hill. Gloucester believes this. Edgar tells his father that the noise of the sea is heard;
Gloucester believes this also. Edgar stops on a level place and persuades his father that he
has ascended the cliff and that in front of him lies a dreadful abyss, and leaves him alone.
Gloucester, addressing the gods, says that he shakes off his affliction as he can bear it no
longer, and that he does not condemn them--the gods. Having said this, he leaps on the level
ground and falls, imagining that he has jumped off the cliff. On this occasion, Edgar, soliloquizing,
gives vent to a yet more entangled utterance:

    "I know not how conceit may rob
     The treasury of life when life itself
     Yields to the theft; had he been where he thought,
     By this had thought been past."

He approaches Gloucester, in the character of yet a different person, and expressing astonishment
at the latter not being hurt by his fall from such a dreadful height. Gloucester believes that
he has fallen and prepares to die, but he feels that he is alive and begins to doubt that he
has fallen from such a height. Then Edgar persuades him that he has indeed jumped from the
dreadful height and tells him that the individual who had been with him at the top was the
devil, as he had eyes like two full moons and a thousand noses and wavy horns. Gloucester believes
this, and is persuaded that his despair was the work of the devil, and therefore decides that
he will henceforth despair no more, but will quietly await death. Hereupon enters Lear, for
some reason covered with wild-flowers. He has lost his senses and says things wilder than before.
He speaks about coining, about the moon, gives some one a yard--then he cries that he sees
a mouse, which he wishes to entice by a piece of cheese. Then he suddenly demands the password
from Edgar, and Edgar immediately answers him with the words "Sweet marjoram." Lear says, "Pass,"
and the blind Gloucester, who has not recognized either his son or Kent, recognizes the King's
voice.

Then the King, after his disconnected utterances, suddenly begins to speak ironically about
flatterers, who agreed to all he said, "Ay, and no, too, was no good divinity," but, when he
got into a storm without shelter, he saw all this was not true; and then goes on to say that
as all creation addicts itself to adultery, and Gloucester's bastard son had treated his father
more kindly than his daughters had treated him (altho Lear, according to the development of
the drama, could not know how Edmund had treated Gloucester), therefore, let dissoluteness
prosper, the more so as, being a King, he needs soldiers. He here addresses an imaginary hypocritically
virtuous lady who acts the prude, whereas

    "The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't
     With a more riotous appetite.
     All women inherit the gods only to the girdle
     Beneath is all the fiend's"--

and, saying this, Lear screams and spits from horror. This monolog is evidently meant to be
addressed by the actor to the audience, and probably produces an effect on the stage, but it
is utterly uncalled for in the mouth of Lear, equally with his words: "It smells of mortality,"
uttered while wiping his hand, as Gloucester expresses a desire to kiss it. Then Gloucester's
blindness is referred to, which gives occasion for a play of words on eyes, about blind Cupid,
at which Lear says to Gloucester, "No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes
are in a heavy case, your purse in a light." Then Lear declaims a monolog on the unfairness
of legal judgment, which is quite out of place in the mouth of the insane Lear. After this,
enter a gentleman with attendants sent by Cordelia to fetch her father. Lear continues to act
as a madman and runs away. The gentleman sent to fetch Lear, does not run after him, but lengthily
describes to Edgar the position of the French and British armies. Oswald enters, and seeing
Gloucester, and desiring to receive the reward promised by Regan, attacks him, but Edgar with
his club kills Oswald, who, in dying, transmits to his murderer, Edgar, Goneril's letter to
Edmund, the delivery of which would insure reward. In this letter Goneril promises to kill
her husband and marry Edmund. Edgar drags out Oswald's body by the legs and then returns and
leads his father away.
