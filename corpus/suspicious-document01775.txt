PREFATORY NOTE.

It will be observed that the greater part of this little book has been taken in one form or
other from Lockhart's Life of Sir Walter Scott, in ten volumes. No introduction to Scott would
be worth much in which that course was not followed. Indeed, excepting Sir Walter's own writings,
there is hardly any other great source of information about him; and that is so full, that
hardly anything needful to illustrate the subject of Scott's life remains untouched. As regards
the only matters of controversy,--Scott's relations to the Ballantynes, I have taken care to
check Mr. Lockhart's statements by reading those of the representatives of the Ballantyne brothers;
but with this exception, Sir Walter's own works and Lockhart's life of him are the great authorities
concerning his character and his story.

Just ten years ago Mr. Gladstone, in expressing to the late Mr. Hope Scott the great delight
which the perusal of Lockhart's life of Sir Walter had given him, wrote, "I may be wrong, but
I am vaguely under the impression that it has never had a really wide circulation. If so, it
is the saddest pity, and I should greatly like (without any censure on its present length)
to see published an abbreviation of it." Mr. Gladstone did not then know that as long ago as
1848 Mr. Lockhart did himself prepare such an abbreviation, in which the original eighty-four
chapters were compressed into eighteen,--though the abbreviation contained additions as well
as compressions. But even this abridgment is itself a bulky volume of 800 pages, containing,
I should think, considerably more than a third of the reading in the original ten volumes,
and is not, therefore, very likely to be preferred to the completer work. In some respects
I hope that this introduction may supply, better than that bulky abbreviation, what Mr. Gladstone
probably meant to suggest,--some slight miniature taken from the great picture with care enough
to tempt on those who look on it to the study of the fuller life, as well as of that image
of Sir Walter which is impressed by his own hand upon his works.

CHAPTER I.

ANCESTRY, PARENTAGE, AND CHILDHOOD.

Sir Walter Scott was the first literary man of a great riding, sporting, and fighting clan.
Indeed, his father--a Writer to the Signet, or Edinburgh solicitor--was the first of his race
to adopt a town life and a sedentary profession. Sir Walter was the lineal descendant--six
generations removed--of that Walter Scott commemorated in The Lay of the Last Minstrel, who
is known in Border history and legend as Auld Wat of Harden. Auld Wat's son William, captured
by Sir Gideon Murray, of Elibank, during a raid of the Scotts on Sir Gideon's lands, was, as
tradition says, given his choice between being hanged on Sir Gideon's private gallows, and
marrying the ugliest of Sir Gideon's three ugly daughters, Meikle-mouthed Meg, reputed as carrying
off the prize of ugliness among the women of four counties. Sir William was a handsome man.
He took three days to consider the alternative proposed to him, but chose life with the large-mouthed
lady in the end; and found her, according to the tradition which the poet, her descendant,
has transmitted, an excellent wife, with a fine talent for pickling the beef which her husband
stole from the herds of his foes. Meikle-mouthed Meg transmitted a distinct trace of her large
mouth to all her descendants, and not least to him who was to use his "meikle" mouth to best
advantage as the spokesman of his race. Rather more than half-way between Auld Wat of Harden's
times--i. e., the middle of the sixteenth century--and those of Sir Walter Scott, poet and
novelist, lived Sir Walter's great-grandfather, Walter Scott generally known in Teviotdale
by the surname of Beardie, because he would never cut his beard after the banishment of the
Stuarts, and who took arms in their cause and lost by his intrigues on their behalf almost
all that he had, besides running the greatest risk of being hanged as a traitor. This was the
ancestor of whom Sir Walter speaks in the introduction to the last canto of Marmion:--

    "And thus my Christmas still I hold,
    Where my great grandsire came of old,
    With amber beard and flaxen hair,
    And reverend apostolic air,--
    The feast and holy tide to share,
    And mix sobriety with wine,
    And honest mirth with thoughts divine;
    Small thought was his in after time
    E'er to be hitch'd into a rhyme,
    The simple sire could only boast
    That he was loyal to his cost;
    The banish'd race of kings revered,
    And lost his land--but kept his beard."

Sir Walter inherited from Beardie that sentimental Stuart bias which his better judgment condemned,
but which seemed to be rather part of his blood than of his mind. And most useful to him this
sentiment undoubtedly was in helping him to restore the mould and fashion of the past. Beardie's
second son was Sir Walter's grandfather, and to him he owed not only his first childish experience
of the delights of country life, but also,--in his own estimation at least,--that risky, speculative,
and sanguine spirit which had so much influence over his fortunes. The good man of Sandy-Knowe,
wishing to breed sheep, and being destitute of capital, borrowed 30l. from a shepherd who was
willing to invest that sum for him in sheep; and the two set off to purchase a flock near Wooler,
in Northumberland; but when the shepherd had found what he thought would suit their purpose,
he returned to find his master galloping about a fine hunter, on which he had spent the whole
capital in hand. This speculation, however, prospered. A few days later Robert Scott displayed
the qualities of the hunter to such admirable effect with John Scott of Harden's hounds, that
he sold the horse for double the money he had given, and, unlike his grandson, abandoned speculative
purchases there and then. In the latter days of his clouded fortunes, after Ballantyne's and
Constable's failure, Sir Walter was accustomed to point to the picture of his grandfather and
say, "Blood will out: my building and planting was but his buying the hunter before he stocked
his sheep-walk, over again." But Sir Walter added, says Mr. Lockhart, as he glanced at the
likeness of his own staid and prudent father, "Yet it was a wonder, too, for I have a thread
of the attorney in me," which was doubtless the case; nor was that thread the least of his
inheritances, for from his father certainly Sir Walter derived that disposition towards conscientious,
plodding industry, legalism of mind, methodical habits of work, and a generous, equitable interpretation
of the scope of all his obligations to others, which, prized and cultivated by him as they
were, turned a great genius, which, especially considering the hare-brained element in him,
might easily have been frittered away or devoted to worthless ends, to such fruitful account,
and stamped it with so grand an impress of personal magnanimity and fortitude. Sir Walter's
father reminds one in not a few of the formal and rather martinetish traits which are related
of him, of the father of Goethe, "a formal man, with strong ideas of strait-laced education,
passionately orderly (he thought a good book nothing without a good binding), and never so
much excited as by a necessary deviation from the 'pre-established harmony' of household rules."
That description would apply almost wholly to the sketch of old Mr. Scott which the novelist
has given us under the thin disguise of Alexander Fairford, Writer to the Signet, in Redgauntlet,
a figure confessedly meant, in its chief features, to represent his father. To this Sir Walter
adds, in one of his later journals, the trait that his father was a man of fine presence, who
conducted all conventional arrangements with a certain grandeur and dignity of air, and "absolutely
loved a funeral." "He seemed to preserve the list of a whole bead-roll of cousins merely for
the pleasure of being at their funerals, which he was often asked to superintend, and I suspect
had sometimes to pay for. He carried me with him as often as he could to these mortuary ceremonies;
but feeling I was not, like him, either useful or ornamental, I escaped as often as I could."
This strong dash of the conventional in Scott's father, this satisfaction in seeing people
fairly to the door of life, and taking his final leave of them there, with something of a ceremonious
flourish of observance, was, however, combined with a much nobler and deeper kind of orderliness.
Sir Walter used to say that his father had lost no small part of a very flourishing business,
by insisting that his clients should do their duty to their own people better than they were
themselves at all inclined to do it. And of this generous strictness in sacrificing his own
interests to his sympathy for others, the son had as much as the father.

Sir Walter's mother, who was a Miss Rutherford, the daughter of a physician, had been better
educated than most Scotchwomen of her day, in spite of having been sent "to be finished off"
by "the honourable Mrs. Ogilvie," whose training was so effective, in one direction at least,
that even in her eightieth year Mrs. Scott could not enjoy a comfortable rest in her chair,
but "took as much care to avoid touching her chair with her back, as if she had still been
under the stern eyes of Mrs. Ogilvie." None the less Mrs. Scott was a motherly, comfortable
woman, with much tenderness of heart, and a well-stored, vivid memory. Sir Walter, writing
of her, after his mother's death, to Lady Louisa Stewart, says, "She had a mind peculiarly
well stored with much acquired information and natural talent, and as she was very old, and
had an excellent memory, she could draw, without the least exaggeration or affectation, the
most striking pictures of the past age. If I have been able to do anything in the way of painting
the past times, it is very much from the studies with which she presented me. She connected
a long period of time with the present generation, for she remembered, and had often spoken
with, a person who perfectly recollected the battle of Dunbar and Oliver Cromwell's subsequent
entry into Edinburgh." On the day before the stroke of paralysis which carried her off, she
had told Mr. and Mrs. Scott of Harden, "with great accuracy, the real story of the Bride of
Lammermuir, and pointed out wherein it differed from the novel. She had all the names of the
parties, and pointed out (for she was a great genealogist) their connexion with existing families."[1]
Sir Walter records many evidences of the tenderness of his mother's nature, and he returned
warmly her affection for himself. His father, like Mr. Alexander Fairford, in Redgauntlet,
though himself a strong Hanoverian, inherited enough feeling for the Stuarts from his grandfather
Beardie, and sympathized enough with those who were, as he neutrally expressed it, "out in
'45," to ignore as much as possible any phrases offensive to the Jacobites. This anecdote brings
before the mind very vividly the character of Sir Walter's parents. The eager curiosity of
the active-minded woman, whom "the honourable Mrs. Ogilvie" had been able to keep upright in
her chair for life, but not to cure of the desire to unravel the little mysteries of which
she had a passing glimpse; the grave formality of the husband, fretting under his wife's personal
attention to a dishonoured man, and making her pay the penalty by dashing to pieces the cup
which the king's evidence had used,--again, the visitor himself, perfectly conscious no doubt
that the Hanoverian lawyer held him in utter scorn for his faithlessness and cowardice, and
reluctant, nevertheless, to reject the courtesy of the wife, though he could not get anything
but cold legal advice from the husband:--all these are figures which must have acted on the
youthful imagination of the poet with singular vivacity, and shaped themselves in a hundred
changing turns of the historical kaleidoscope which was always before his mind's eye, as he
mused upon that past which he was to restore for us with almost more than its original freshness
of life. With such scenes touching even his own home, Scott must have been constantly taught
to balance in his own mind, the more romantic, against the more sober and rational considerations,
which had so recently divided house against house, even in the same family and clan. That the
stern Calvinistic lawyer should have retained so much of his grandfather Beardie's respect
for the adherents of the exiled house of Stuart, must in itself have struck the boy as even
more remarkable than the passionate loyalty of the Stuarts' professed partisans, and have lent
a new sanction to the romantic drift of his mother's old traditions, and one to which they
must have been indebted for a great part of their fascination.

Walter Scott, the ninth of twelve children, of whom the first six died
in early childhood, was born in Edinburgh, on the 15th of August,
1771. Of the six later-born children, all but one were boys, and the
one sister was a somewhat querulous invalid, whom he seems to have
pitied almost more than he loved. At the age of eighteen months the
boy had a teething-fever, ending in a life-long lameness; and this was
the reason why the child was sent to reside with his grandfather--the
speculative grandfather, who had doubled his capital by buying a
racehorse instead of sheep--at Sandy-Knowe, near the ruined tower of
Smailholm, celebrated afterwards in his ballad of The Eve of St.
John, in the neighbourhood of some fine crags. To these crags the
housemaid sent from Edinburgh to look after him, used to carry him up,
with a design (which she confessed to the housekeeper)--due, of
course, to incipient insanity--of murdering the child there, and
burying him in the moss. Of course the maid was dismissed. After this
the child used to be sent out, when the weather was fine, in the safer
charge of the shepherd, who would often lay him beside the sheep. Long
afterwards Scott told Mr. Skene, during an excursion with Turner, the
great painter, who was drawing his illustration of Smailholm tower for
one of Scott's works, that "the habit of lying on the turf there among
the sheep and the lambs had given his mind a peculiar tenderness for
these animals, which it had ever since retained." Being forgotten one
day upon the knolls when a thunderstorm came on, his aunt ran out to
bring him in, and found him shouting, "Bonny! bonny!" at every flash
of lightning. One of the old servants at Sandy-Knowe spoke of the
child long afterwards as "a sweet-tempered bairn, a darling with all
about the house," and certainly the miniature taken of him in his
seventh year confirms the impression thus given. It is sweet-tempered
above everything, and only the long upper lip and large mouth, derived
from his ancestress, Meg Murray, convey the promise of the power which
was in him. Of course the high, almost conical forehead, which gained
him in his later days from his comrades at the bar the name of "Old
Peveril," in allusion to "the peak" which they saw towering high above
the heads of other men as he approached, is not so much marked beneath
the childish locks of this miniature as it was in later life; and the
massive, and, in repose, certainly heavy face of his maturity, which
conveyed the impression of the great bulk of his character, is still
quite invisible under the sunny ripple of childish earnestness and
gaiety. Scott's hair in childhood was light chestnut, which turned to
nut brown in youth. His eyebrows were bushy, for we find mention made
of them as a "pent-house." His eyes were always light blue. They had
in them a capacity, on the one hand, for enthusiasm, sunny brightness,
and even hare-brained humour, and on the other for expressing
determined resolve and kindly irony, which gave great range of
expression to the face. There are plenty of materials for judging what
sort of a boy Scott was. In spite of his lameness, he early taught
himself to clamber about with an agility that few children could have
surpassed, and to sit his first pony--a little Shetland, not bigger
than a large Newfoundland dog, which used to come into the house to be
fed by him--even in gallops on very rough ground. He became very early
a declaimer. Having learned the ballad of Hardy Knute, he shouted it
forth with such pertinacious enthusiasm that the clergyman of his
grandfather's parish complained that he "might as well speak in a
cannon's mouth as where that child was."
    Still, with vain fondness, could I trace
    Anew each kind familiar face
    That brighten'd at our evening fire!
    From the thatch'd mansion's grey-hair'd sire,
    Wise without learning, plain and good,
    And sprung of Scotland's gentler blood;
    Whose eye in age, quick, clear, and keen,
    Show'd what in youth its glance had been;
    Whose doom discording neighbours sought,
    Content with equity unbought;
    To him the venerable priest,
    Our frequent and familiar guest,
    Whose life and manners well could paint
    Alike the student and the saint;
    Alas! whose speech too oft I broke
    With gambol rude and timeless joke;
    For I was wayward, bold, and wild,
    A self-will'd imp, a grandame's child;
    But, half a plague and half a jest,
    Was still endured, beloved, caress'd."

A picture this of a child of great spirit, though with that spirit was combined an active and
subduing sweetness which could often conquer, as by a sudden spell, those whom the boy loved.
Towards those, however, whom he did not love he could be vindictive. His relative, the laird
of Raeburn, on one occasion wrung the neck of a pet starling, which the child had partly tamed.
"I flew at his throat like a wild-cat," he said, in recalling the circumstance, fifty years
later, in his journal on occasion of the old laird's death; "and was torn from him with no
little difficulty." And, judging from this journal, I doubt whether he had ever really forgiven
the laird of Raeburn. Towards those whom he loved but had offended, his manner was very different.
This spontaneous and fascinating sweetness of his childhood was naturally overshadowed to some
extent in later life by Scott's masculine and proud character, but it was always in him. And
there was much of true character in the child behind this sweetness. He had wonderful self-command,
and a peremptory kind of good sense, even in his infancy. While yet a child under six years
of age, hearing one of the servants beginning to tell a ghost-story to another, and well knowing
that if he listened, it would scare away his night's rest, he acted for himself with all the
promptness of an elder person acting for him, and, in spite of the fascination of the subject,
resolutely muffled his head in the bed-clothes and refused to hear the tale. His sagacity in
judging of the character of others was shown, too, even as a school-boy; and once it led him
to take an advantage which caused him many compunctions in after-life, whenever he recalled
his skilful puerile tactics. On one occasion--I tell the story as he himself rehearsed it to
Samuel Rogers, almost at the end of his life, after his attack of apoplexy, and just before
leaving England for Italy in the hopeless quest of health--he had long desired to get above
a schoolfellow in his class, who defied all his efforts, till Scott noticed that whenever a
question was asked of his rival, the lad's fingers grasped a particular button on his waistcoat,
while his mind went in search of the answer. Scott accordingly anticipated that if he could
remove this button, the boy would be thrown out, and so it proved. The button was cut off,
and the next time the lad was questioned, his fingers being unable to find the button, and
his eyes going in perplexed search after his fingers, he stood confounded, and Scott mastered
by strategy the place which he could not gain by mere industry. Out of school his fame stood
higher. At home he was much bullied by his elder brother Robert, a lively lad, not without
some powers of verse-making, who went into the navy, then in an unlucky moment passed into
the merchant service of the East India Company, and so lost the chance of distinguishing himself
in the great naval campaigns of Nelson. Perhaps Scott would have been all the better for a
sister a little closer to him than Anne--sickly and fanciful--appears ever to have been. The
masculine side of life appears to predominate a little too much in his school and college days,
and he had such vast energy, vitality, and pride, that his life at this time would have borne
a little taming under the influence of a sister thoroughly congenial to him. In relation to
his studies he was wilful, though not perhaps perverse. He steadily declined, for instance,
to learn Greek, though he mastered Latin pretty fairly. After a time spent at the High School,
Edinburgh, Scott was sent to a school at Kelso, where his master made a friend and companion
of him, and so poured into him a certain amount of Latin scholarship which he would never otherwise
have obtained. I need hardly add that as a boy Scott was, so far as a boy could be, a Tory--a
worshipper of the past, and a great Conservative of any remnant of the past which reformers
wished to get rid of. And the uniformly amicable character of these controversies between the
young people, itself shows how much more they were controversies of the imagination than of
faith. I doubt whether Scott's convictions on the issues of the Past were ever very much more
decided than they were during his boyhood; though undoubtedly he learned to understand much
more profoundly what was really held by the ablest men on both sides of these disputed issues.
The result, however, was, I think, that while he entered better and better into both sides
as life went on, he never adopted either with any earnestness of conviction, being content
to admit, even to himself, that while his feelings leaned in one direction, his reason pointed
decidedly in the other; and holding that it was hardly needful to identify himself positively
with either. As regarded the present, however, feeling always carried the day. Scott was a
Tory all his life.

CHAPTER II.

YOUTH--CHOICE OF A PROFESSION.

As Scott grew up, entered the classes of the college, and began his legal studies, first as
apprentice to his father, and then in the law classes of the University, he became noticeable
to all his friends for his gigantic memory,--the rich stores of romantic material with which
it was loaded,--his giant feats of industry for any cherished purpose,--his delight in adventure
and in all athletic enterprises,--his great enjoyment of youthful "rows," so long as they did
not divide the knot of friends to which he belonged, and his skill in peacemaking amongst his
own set. During his apprenticeship his only means of increasing his slender allowance with
funds which he could devote to his favourite studies, was to earn money by copying, and he
tells us himself that he remembered writing "120 folio pages with no interval either for food
or rest," fourteen or fifteen hours' very hard work at the very least,--expressly for this purpose.

In the second year of Scott's apprenticeship, at about the age of sixteen, he had an attack
of hæmorrhage, no recurrence of which took place for some forty years, but which was then the
beginning of the end. During this illness silence was absolutely imposed upon him,--two old
ladies putting their fingers on their lips, whenever he offered to speak. It was at this time
that the lad began his study of the scenic side of history, and especially of campaigns, which
he illustrated for himself by the arrangement of shells, seeds, and pebbles, so as to represent
encountering armies, in the manner referred to (and referred to apparently in anticipation
of a later stage of his life than that he was then speaking of) in the passage from the introduction
to the third canto of Marmion which I have already given. He also managed so to arrange the
looking-glasses in his room as to see the troops march out to exercise in the meadows, as he
lay in bed. His reading was almost all in the direction of military exploit, or romance and
mediæval legend and the later border songs of his own country. He learned Italian and read
Ariosto. Later he learned Spanish and devoured Cervantes, whose "novelas," he said, "first
inspired him with the ambition to excel in fiction;" and all that he read and admired he remembered.
Scott used to illustrate the capricious affinity of his own memory for what suited it, and
its complete rejection of what did not, by old Beattie of Meikledale's answer to a Scotch divine,
who complimented him on the strength of his memory. Such a memory, when it belongs to a man
of genius, is really a sieve of the most valuable kind. It sifts away what is foreign and alien
to his genius, and assimilates what is suited to it. In his very last days, when he was visiting
Italy for the first time, Scott delighted in Malta, for it recalled to him Vertot's Knights
of Malta, and much, other mediæval story which he had pored over in his youth. But when his
friends descanted to him at Pozzuoli on the Thermæ--commonly called the Temple of Serapis--among
the ruins of which he stood, he only remarked that he would believe whatever he was told, "for
many of his friends, and particularly Mr. Morritt, had frequently tried to drive classical
antiquities, as they are called, into his head, but they had always found his skull too thick."
Was it not perhaps some deep literary instinct, like that here indicated, which made him, as
a lad, refuse so steadily to learn Greek, and try to prove to his indignant professor that
Ariosto was superior to Homer? Scott afterwards deeply regretted this neglect of Greek; but
I cannot help thinking that his regret was misplaced. Greek literature would have brought before
his mind standards of poetry and art which could not but have both deeply impressed and greatly
daunted an intellect of so much power; I say both impressed and daunted, because I believe
that Scott himself would never have succeeded in studies of a classical kind, while he might--like
Goethe perhaps--have been either misled, by admiration for that school, into attempting what
was not adapted to his genius, or else disheartened in the work for which his character and
ancestry really fitted him. It has been said that there is a real affinity between Scott and
Homer. But the long and refluent music of Homer, once naturalized in his mind, would have discontented
him with that quick, sharp, metrical tramp of his own moss-troopers, to which alone his genius
as a poet was perfectly suited.

It might be supposed that with these romantic tastes, Scott could scarcely have made much of
a lawyer, though the inference would, I believe, be quite mistaken. His father, however, reproached
him with being better fitted for a pedlar than a lawyer,--so persistently did he trudge over
all the neighbouring counties in search of the beauties of nature and the historic associations
of battle, siege, or legend. And, it is true that these were the days of mental and moral fermentation,
what was called in Germany the Sturm-und-Drang, the "fret-and-fury" period of Scott's life,
so far as one so mellow and genial in temper ever passed through a period of fret and fury
at all. In other words these were the days of rapid motion, of walks of thirty miles a day
which the lame lad yet found no fatigue to him; of mad enterprises, scrapes and drinking-bouts,
in one of which Scott was half persuaded by his friends that he actually sang a song for the
only time in his life. But even in these days of youthful sociability, with companions of his
own age, Scott was always himself, and his imperious will often asserted itself. Writing of
this time, some thirty-five years or so later, he said, "When I was a boy, and on foot expeditions,
as we had many, no creature could be so indifferent which way our course was directed, and
I acquiesced in what any one proposed; but if I was once driven to make a choice, and felt
piqued in honour to maintain my proposition, I have broken off from the whole party, rather
than yield to any one." No doubt, too, in that day of what he himself described as "the silly
smart fancies that ran in my brain like the bubbles in a glass of champagne, as brilliant to
my thinking, as intoxicating, as evanescent," solitude was no real deprivation to him; and
one can easily imagine him marching off on his solitary way after a dispute with his companions,
reciting to himself old songs or ballads, with that "noticeable but altogether indescribable
play of the upper lip," which Mr. Lockhart thinks suggested to one of Scott's most intimate
friends, on his first acquaintance with him, the grotesque notion that he had been "a hautboy-player."
This was the first impression formed of Scott by William Clerk, one of his earliest and life-long
friends. It greatly amused Scott, who not only had never played on any instrument in his life,
but could hardly make shift to join in the chorus of a popular song without marring its effect;
but perhaps the impression suggested was not so very far astray after all. Looking to the poetic
side of his character, the trumpet certainly would have been the instrument that would have
best symbolized the spirit both of Scott's thought and of his verses. Mr. Lockhart himself,
in summing up his impressions of Sir Walter, quotes as the most expressive of his lines:--

    "Sound, sound the clarion! fill the fife!
      To all the sensual world proclaim,
    One crowded hour of glorious life
      Is worth a world without a name."

And undoubtedly this gives us the key-note of Scott's personal life as well as of his poetic
power. Above everything he was high-spirited, a man of noble, and, at the same time, of martial
feelings. Sir Francis Doyle speaks very justly of Sir Walter as "among English singers the
undoubted inheritor of that trumpet-note, which, under the breath of Homer, has made the wrath
of Achilles immortal;" and I do not doubt that there was something in Scott's face, and especially
in the expression of his mouth, to suggest this even to his early college companions. Unfortunately,
however, even "one crowded hour of glorious life" may sometimes have a "sensual" inspiration,
and in these days of youthful adventure, too many such hours seem to have owed their inspiration
to the Scottish peasant's chief bane, the Highland whisky. In his eager search after the old
ballads of the Border, Scott had many a blithe adventure, which ended only too often in a carouse.
It was soon after this time that he first began those raids into Liddesdale, of which all the
world has enjoyed the records in the sketches--embodied subsequently in Guy Mannering--of Dandie
Dinmont, his pony Dumple, and the various Peppers and Mustards from whose breed there were
afterwards introduced into Scott's own family, generations of terriers, always named, as Sir
Walter expressed it, after "the cruet."

For Scott's passion for romantic literature was not at all the sort of thing which we ordinarily
mean by boys' or girls' love of romance. No amount of drudgery or labour deterred Scott from
any undertaking on the prosecution of which he was bent. He was quite the reverse, indeed,
of what is usually meant by sentimental, either in his manners or his literary interests. As
regards the history of his own country he was no mean antiquarian. Indeed he cared for the
mustiest antiquarian researches--of the mediæval kind--so much, that in the depth of his troubles
he speaks of a talk with a Scotch antiquary and herald as one of the things which soothed him
most. "I do not know anything which relieves the mind so much from the sullens as trifling
discussions about antiquarian old womanries. It is like knitting a stocking, diverting the
mind without occupying it."[7] Thus his love of romantic literature was as far as possible
from that of a mind which only feeds on romantic excitements; rather was it that of one who
was so moulded by the transmitted and acquired love of feudal institutions with all their incidents,
that he could not take any deep interest in any other fashion of human society. Now the Scotch
law was full of vestiges and records of that period,--was indeed a great standing monument
of it; and in numbers of his writings Scott shows with how deep an interest he had studied
the Scotch law from this point of view. He remarks somewhere that it was natural for a Scotchman
to feel a strong attachment to the principle of rank, if only on the ground that almost any
Scotchman might, under the Scotch law, turn out to be heir-in-tail to some great Scotch title
or estate by the death of intervening relations. And the law which sometimes caused such sudden
transformations, had subsequently a true interest for him of course as a novel writer, to say
nothing of his interest in it as an antiquarian and historian who loved to repeople the earth,
not merely with the picturesque groups of the soldiers and courts of the past, but with the
actors in all the various quaint and homely transactions and puzzlements which the feudal ages
had brought forth. Hence though, as a matter of fact, Scott never made much figure as an advocate,
he became a very respectable, and might unquestionably have become a very great, lawyer. When
he started at the bar, however, he had not acquired the tact to impress an ordinary assembly.
In one case which he conducted before the General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland, when defending
a parish minister threatened with deposition for drunkenness and unseemly behaviour, he certainly
missed the proper tone,--first receiving a censure for the freedom of his manner in treating
the allegations against his client, and then so far collapsing under the rebuke of the Moderator,
as to lose the force and urgency necessary to produce an effect on his audience. But these
were merely a boy's mishaps. He was certainly by no means a Heaven-born orator, and therefore
could not expect to spring into exceptionally early distinction, and the only true reason for
his relative failure was that he was so full of literary power, and so proudly impatient of
the fetters which prudence seemed to impose on his extra-professional proceedings, that he
never gained the credit he deserved for the general common sense, the unwearied industry, and
the keen appreciation of the ins and outs of legal method, which might have raised him to the
highest reputation even as a judge.

All readers of his novels know how Scott delights in the humours of the law. By way of illustration
take the following passage, which is both short and amusing, in which Saunders Fairford--the
old solicitor painted from Scott's father in Redgauntlet--descants on the law of the stirrup-cup.
I do not believe that any one of Scott's contemporaries had greater legal abilities than he,
though, as it happened, they were never fairly tried. But he had both the pride and impatience
of genius. It fretted him to feel that he was dependent on the good opinions of solicitors,
and that they who were incapable of understanding his genius, thought the less instead of the
better of him as an advocate, for every indication which he gave of that genius. Scott continued
to practise at the bar--nominally at least--for fourteen years, but the most which he ever
seems to have made in any one year was short of 230l., and latterly his practice was much diminishing
instead of increasing. His own impatience of solicitors' patronage was against him; his well-known
dabblings in poetry were still more against him; and his general repute for wild and unprofessional
adventurousness--which was much greater than he deserved--was probably most of all against
him. Before he had been six years at the bar he joined the organization of the Edinburgh Volunteer
Cavalry, took a very active part in the drill, and was made their Quartermaster. Then he visited
London, and became largely known for his ballads, and his love of ballads. In his eighth year
at the bar he accepted a small permanent appointment, with 300l. a year, as sheriff of Selkirkshire;
and this occurring soon after his marriage to a lady of some means, no doubt diminished still
further his professional zeal. For one third of the time during which Scott practised as an
advocate he made no pretence of taking interest in that part of his work, though he was always
deeply interested in the law itself. In 1806 he undertook gratuitously the duties of a Clerk
of Session--a permanent officer of the Court at Edinburgh--and discharged them without remuneration
for five years, from 1806 to 1811, in order to secure his ultimate succession to the office
in the place of an invalid, who for that period received all the emoluments and did none of
the work. Nevertheless Scott's legal abilities were so well known, that it was certainly at
one time intended to offer him a Barony of the Exchequer, and it was his own doing, apparently,
that it was not offered. The life of literature and the life of the Bar hardly ever suit, and
in Scott's case they suited the less, that he felt himself likely to be a dictator in the one
field, and only a postulant in the other. Literature was a far greater gainer by his choice,
than Law could have been a loser. For his capacity for the law he shared with thousands of
able men, his capacity for literature with few or none.

CHAPTER III.

LOVE AND MARRIAGE.

One Sunday, about two years before his call to the bar, Scott offered his umbrella to a young
lady of much beauty who was coming out of the Greyfriars Church during a shower; the umbrella
was graciously accepted; and it was not an unprecedented consequence that Scott fell in love
with the borrower, who turned out to be Margaret, daughter of Sir John and Lady Jane Stuart
Belches, of Invernay. For near six years after this, Scott indulged the hope of marrying this
lady, and it does not seem doubtful that the lady herself was in part responsible for this
impression. Scott's father, who thought his son's prospects very inferior to those of Miss
Stuart Belches, felt it his duty to warn the baronet of his son's views, a warning which the
old gentleman appears to have received with that grand unconcern characteristic of elderly
persons in high position, as a hint intrinsically incredible, or at least unworthy of notice.
But he took no alarm, and Scott's attentions to Margaret Stuart Belches continued till close
on the eve of her marriage, in 1796, to William Forbes (afterwards Sir William Forbes), of
Pitsligo, a banker, who proved to be one of Sir Walter's most generous and most delicate-minded
friends, when his time of troubles came towards the end of both their lives. Whether Scott
was in part mistaken as to the impression he had made on the young lady, or she was mistaken
as to the impression he had made on herself, or whether other circumstances intervened to cause
misunderstanding, or the grand indifference of Sir John gave way to active intervention when
the question became a practical one, the world will now never know, but it does not seem very
likely that a man of so much force as Scott, who certainly had at one time assured himself
at least of the young lady's strong regard, should have been easily displaced even by a rival
of ability and of most generous and amiable character. An entry in the diary which Scott kept
in 1827, after Constable's and Ballantyne's failure, and his wife's death, seems to me to suggest
that there may have been some misunderstanding between the young people, though I am not sure
that the inference is justified. The passage completes the story of this passion--Scott's first
and only deep passion--so far as it can ever be known to us; and as it is a very pathetic and
characteristic entry, and the attachment to which it refers had a great influence on Scott's
life, both in keeping him free from some of the most dangerous temptations of the young, during
his youth, and in creating within him an interior world of dreams and recollections throughout
his whole life, on which his imaginative nature was continually fed--I may as well give it.
"He had taken," says Mr. Lockhart, "for that winter [1827], the house No. 6, Shandwick Place,
which he occupied by the month during the remainder of his servitude as a clerk of session.
Very near this house, he was told a few days after he took possession, dwelt the aged mother
of his first love; and he expressed to his friend Mrs. Skene, a wish that she should carry
him to renew an acquaintance which seems to have been interrupted from the period of his youthful
romance. Mrs. Skene complied with his desire, and she tells me that a very painful scene ensued."
His diary says,--"November 7th. Began to settle myself this morning after the hurry of mind
and even of body which I have lately undergone. I went to make a visit and fairly softened
myself, like an old fool, with recalling old stories till I was fit for nothing but shedding
tears and repeating verses for the whole night. This is sad work. The very grave gives up its
dead, and time rolls back thirty years to add to my perplexities. I don't care. I begin to
grow case-hardened, and like a stag turning at bay, my naturally good temper grows fierce and
dangerous. Yet what a romance to tell--and told I fear it will one day be. And then my three
years of dreaming and my two years of wakening will be chronicled, doubtless. But the dead
will feel no pain.--November 10th. At twelve o'clock I went again to poor Lady Jane to talk
over old stories. I am not clear that it is a right or healthful indulgence to be ripping up
old sores, but it seems to give her deep-rooted sorrow words, and that is a mental blood-letting.
To me these things are now matter of calm and solemn recollection, never to be forgotten, yet
scarce to be remembered with pain."[8] It was in 1797, after the break-up of his hopes in relation
to this attachment, that Scott wrote the lines To a Violet, which Mr. F. T. Palgrave, in his
thoughtful and striking introduction to Scott's poems, rightly characterizes as one of the
most beautiful of those poems. It is, however, far from one characteristic of Scott, indeed,
so different in style from the best of his other poems, that Mr. Browning might well have said
of Scott, as he once affirmed of himself, that for the purpose of one particular poem, he "who
blows through bronze," had "breathed through silver,"--had "curbed the liberal hand subservient
proudly,"--and tamed his spirit to a key elsewhere unknown.

These lines obviously betray a feeling of resentment, which may or may not have been justified;
but they are perhaps the most delicate produced by his pen. The pride which was always so notable
a feature in Scott, probably sustained him through the keen, inward pain which it is very certain
from a great many of his own words that he must have suffered in this uprooting of his most
passionate hopes. And it was in part probably the same pride which led him to form, within
the year, a new tie--his engagement to Mademoiselle Charpentier, or Miss Carpenter as she was
usually called,--the daughter of a French royalist of Lyons who had died early in the revolution.
She had come after her father's death to England, chiefly, it seems, because in the Marquis
of Downshire, who was an old friend of the family, her mother knew that she should find a protector
for her children. Miss Carpenter was a lively beauty, probably of no great depth of character.
The few letters given of hers in Mr. Lockhart's life of Scott, give the impression of an amiable,
petted girl, of somewhat thin and espiègle character, who was rather charmed at the depth and
intensity of Scott's nature, and at the expectations which he seemed to form of what love should
mean, than capable of realizing them. Evidently she had no inconsiderable pleasure in display;
but she made on the whole a very good wife, only one to be protected by him from every care,
and not one to share Scott's deeper anxieties, or to participate in his dreams. Yet Mrs. Scott
was not devoid of spirit and self-control. It is hinted that Mrs. Scott was, at the time of
Scott's greatest fame, far more exhilarated by it than her husband with his strong sense and
sure self-measurement ever was. Mr. Lockhart records that Mrs. Grant of Laggan once said of
them, "Mr. Scott always seems to me like a glass, through which the rays of admiration pass
without sensibly affecting it; but the bit of paper that lies beside it will presently be in
a blaze, and no wonder." The bit of paper, however, never was in a blaze that I know of; and
possibly Mrs. Grant's remark may have had a little feminine spite in it. At all events, it
was not till the rays of misfortune, instead of admiration, fell upon Scott's life, that the
delicate tissue paper shrivelled up; nor does it seem that, even then, it was the trouble,
so much as a serious malady that had fixed on Lady Scott before Sir Walter's troubles began,
which really scorched up her life. That she did not feel with the depth and intensity of her
husband, or in the same key of feeling, is clear. After the failure, and during the preparations
for abandoning the house in Edinburgh, Scott records in his diary:--"It is with a sense of
pain that I leave behind a parcel of trumpery prints and little ornaments, once the pride of
Lady Scott's heart, but which she saw consigned with indifference to the chance of an auction.
Things that have had their day of importance with me, I cannot forget, though the merest trifles;
but I am glad that she, with bad health, and enough to vex her, has not the same useless mode
of associating recollections with this unpleasant business."[9]

Poor Lady Scott! It was rather like a bird of paradise mating with an eagle. Yet the result
was happy on the whole; for she had a thoroughly kindly nature, and a true heart. Within ten
days before her death, Scott enters in his diary:--"Still welcoming me with a smile, and asserting
she is better." She was not the ideal wife for Scott; but she loved him, sunned herself in
his prosperity, and tried to bear his adversity cheerfully. In her last illness she would always
reproach her husband and children for their melancholy faces, even when that melancholy was,
as she well knew, due to the approaching shadow of her own death.

CHAPTER IV.

EARLIEST POETRY AND BORDER MINSTRELSY.

Scott's first serious attempt in poetry was a version of Bürger's Lenore, a spectre-ballad
of the violent kind, much in favour in Germany at a somewhat earlier period, but certainly
not a specimen of the higher order of imaginative genius. However, it stirred Scott's youthful
blood, and made him "wish to heaven he could get a skull and two cross-bones!" a modest desire,
to be expressed with so much fervour, and one almost immediately gratified. Probably no one
ever gave a more spirited version of Bürger's ballad than Scott has given; but the use to which
Miss Cranstoun, a friend and confidante of his love for Miss Stuart Belches, strove to turn
it, by getting it printed, blazoned, and richly bound, and presenting it to the young lady
as a proof of her admirer's abilities, was perhaps hardly very sagacious. It is quite possible,
at least, that Miss Stuart Belches may have regarded this vehement admirer of spectral wedding
journeys and skeleton bridals, as unlikely to prepare for her that comfortable, trim, and decorous
future which young ladies usually desire. At any rate, the bold stroke failed. The young lady
admired the verses, but, as we have seen, declined the translator. Perhaps she regarded banking
as safer, if less brilliant work than the most effective description of skeleton riders. Indeed,
Scott at this time--to those who did not know what was in him, which no one, not even excepting
himself, did--had no very sure prospects of comfort, to say nothing of wealth. It is curious,
too, that his first adventure in literature was thus connected with his interest in the preternatural,
for no man ever lived whose genius was sounder and healthier, and less disposed to dwell on
the half-and-half lights of a dim and eerie world; yet ghostly subjects always interested him
deeply, and he often touched them in his stories, more, I think, from the strong artistic contrast
they afforded to his favourite conceptions of life, than from any other motive. There never
was, I fancy, an organization less susceptible of this order of fears and superstitions than
his own. When a friend jokingly urged him, within a few months of his death, not to leave Rome
on a Friday, as it was a day of bad omen for a journey, he replied, laughing, "Superstition
is very picturesque, and I make it, at times, stand me in great stead, but I never allow it
to interfere with interest or convenience." Basil Hall reports Scott's having told him on the
last evening of the year 1824, when they were talking over this subject, that "having once
arrived at a country inn, he was told there was no bed for him. 'No place to lie down at all?'
said he. 'No,' said the people of the house; 'none, except a room in which there is a corpse
lying.' 'Well,' said he, 'did the person die of any contagious disorder?' 'Oh, no; not at all,'
said they. 'Well, then,' continued he, 'let me have the other bed. So,' said Sir Walter, 'I
laid me down, and never had a better night's sleep in my life.'" He was, indeed, a man of iron
nerve, whose truest artistic enjoyment was in noting the forms of character seen in full daylight
by the light of the most ordinary experience. Perhaps for that reason he can on occasion relate
a preternatural incident, such as the appearance of old Alice at the fountain, at the very
moment of her death, to the Master of Ravenswood, in The Bride of Lammermoor, with great effect.
It was probably the vivacity with which he realized the violence which such incidents do to
the terrestrial common sense of our ordinary nature, and at the same time the sedulous accuracy
of detail with which he narrated them, rather than any, even the smallest, special susceptibility
of his own brain to thrills of the preternatural kind, which gave him rather a unique pleasure
in dealing with such preternatural elements. Sometimes, however, his ghosts are a little too
muscular to produce their due effect as ghosts. In translating Bürger's ballad his great success
lay in the vividness of the spectre's horsemanship. On the whole, Scott was too sunny and healthy-minded
for a ghost-seer; and the skull and cross-bones with which he ornamented his "den" in his father's
house, did not succeed in tempting him into the world of twilight and cobwebs wherein he made
his first literary excursion. His William and Helen, the name he gave to his translation of
Bürger's Lenore, made in 1795, was effective, after all, more for its rapid movement, than
for the weirdness of its effects.

If, however, it was the raw preternaturalism of such ballads as Bürger's which first led Scott
to test his own powers, his genius soon turned to more appropriate and natural subjects. Ever
since his earliest college days he had been collecting, in those excursions of his into Liddesdale
and elsewhere, materials for a book on The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border; and the publication
of this work, in January, 1802 (in two volumes at first), was his first great literary success.
The whole edition of eight hundred copies was sold within the year, while the skill and care
which Scott had devoted to the historical illustration of the ballads, and the force and spirit
of his own new ballads, written in imitation of the old, gained him at once a very high literary
name. And the name was well deserved. The Border Minstrelsy was more commensurate in range
with the genius of Scott, than even the romantic poems by which it was soon followed, and which
were received with such universal and almost unparalleled delight. For Scott's Border Minstrelsy
gives more than a glimpse of all his many great powers--his historical industry and knowledge,
his masculine humour, his delight in restoring the vision of the "old, simple, violent world"
of rugged activity and excitement, as well as that power to kindle men's hearts, as by a trumpet-call,
which was the chief secret of the charm of his own greatest poems. It is much easier to discern
the great novelist of subsequent years in the Border Minstrelsy than even in The Lay of the
Last Minstrel, Marmion, and The Lady of the Lake taken together. From those romantic poems
you would never guess that Scott entered more eagerly and heartily into the common incidents
and common cares of every-day human life than into the most romantic fortunes; from them you
would never know how completely he had mastered the leading features of quite different periods
of our history; from them you would never infer that you had before you one of the best plodders,
as well as one of the most enthusiastic dreamers, in British literature. But all this might
have been gathered from the various introductions and notes to the Border Minstrelsy, which
are full of skilful illustrations, of comments teeming with humour, and of historic weight.
The general introduction gives us a general survey of the graphic pictures of Border quarrels,
their simple violence and simple cunning. It enters, for instance, with grave humour into the
strong distinction taken in the debatable land between a "freebooter" and a "thief," and the
difficulty which the inland counties had in grasping it, and paints for us, with great vivacity,
the various Border superstitions. Another commentary on a very amusing ballad, commemorating
the manner in which a blind harper stole a horse and got paid for a mare he had not lost, gives
an account of the curious tenure of land, called that of the "king's rentallers," or "kindly
tenants;" and a third describes, in language as vivid as the historical romance of Kenilworth,
written years after, the manner in which Queen Elizabeth received the news of a check to her
policy, and vented her spleen on the King of Scotland.

So much as to the breadth of the literary area which this first book of Scott's covered. As
regards the poetic power which his own new ballads, in imitation of the old ones, evinced,
I cannot say that those of the first issue of the Border Minstrelsy indicated anything like
the force which might have been expected from one who was so soon to be the author of Marmion,
though many of Scott's warmest admirers, including Sir Francis Doyle, seem to place Glenfinlas
among his finest productions. But in the third volume of the Border Minstrelsy, which did not
appear till 1803, is contained a ballad on the assassination of the Regent Murray, the story
being told by his assassin, which seems to me a specimen of his very highest poetical powers.
In Cadyow Castle you have not only that rousing trumpet-note which you hear in Marmion, but
the pomp and glitter of a grand martial scene is painted with all Scott's peculiar terseness
and vigour. The opening is singularly happy in preparing the reader for the description of
a violent deed. The Earl of Arran, chief of the clan of Hamiltons, is chasing among the old
oaks of Cadyow Castle,--oaks which belonged to the ancient Caledonian forest,--the fierce,
wild bulls, milk-white, with black muzzles, which were not extirpated till shortly before Scott's
own birth:--

    "Through the huge oaks of Evandale,
      Whose limbs a thousand years have worn,
    What sullen roar comes down the gale,
      And drowns the hunter's pealing horn?

    "Mightiest of all the beasts of chase
      That roam in woody Caledon,
    Crashing the forest in his race,
      The mountain bull comes thundering on.

    "Fierce on the hunter's quiver'd band
      He rolls his eyes of swarthy glow,
    Spurns, with black hoof and horn, the sand,
      And tosses high his mane of snow.

    "Aim'd well, the chieftain's lance has flown;
      Struggling in blood the savage lies;
    His roar is sunk in hollow groan,--
      Sound, merry huntsman! sound the pryse!"

It is while the hunters are resting after this feat, that Bothwellhaugh dashes among them headlong,
spurring his jaded steed with poniard instead of spur:--

    "From gory selle and reeling steed,
      Sprang the fierce horseman with a bound,
    And reeking from the recent deed,
      He dash'd his carbine on the ground."

And then Bothwellhaugh tells his tale of blood, describing the procession from which he had
singled out his prey:--

    "'Dark Morton, girt with many a spear,
      Murder's foul minion, led the van;
    And clash'd their broadswords in the rear
      The wild Macfarlanes' plaided clan.

    "'Glencairn and stout Parkhead were nigh,
      Obsequious at their Regent's rein,
    And haggard Lindsay's iron eye,
      That saw fair Mary weep in vain.

    "''Mid pennon'd spears, a steely grove,
      Proud Murray's plumage floated high;
    Scarce could his trampling charger move,
      So close the minions crowded nigh.

    "'From the raised vizor's shade, his eye,
      Dark rolling, glanced the ranks along,
    And his steel truncheon waved on high,
      Seem'd marshalling the iron throng.

    "'But yet his sadden'd brow confess'd
      A passing shade of doubt and awe;
    Some fiend was whispering in his breast,
      "Beware of injured Bothwellhaugh!"

    "'The death-shot parts,--the charger springs,--
      Wild rises tumult's startling roar!
    And Murray's plumy helmet rings--
      Rings on the ground to rise no more.'"

This was the ballad which made so strong an impression on Thomas Campbell, the poet. Referring
to some of the lines I have quoted, Campbell said,--"I have repeated them so often on the North
Bridge that the whole fraternity of coachmen know me by tongue as I pass. To be sure, to a
mind in sober, serious, street-walking humour, it must bear an appearance of lunacy when one
stamps with the hurried pace and fervent shake of the head which strong, pithy poetry excites."[10]
I suppose anecdotes of this kind have been oftener told of Scott than of any other English
poet. I have heard of two old men--complete strangers--passing each other on a dark London
night, when one of them happened to be repeating to himself, just as Campbell did to the hackney
coachmen of the North Bridge of Edinburgh, the last lines of the account of Flodden Field in
Marmion, "Charge, Chester, charge," when suddenly a reply came out of the darkness, "On, Stanley,
on," whereupon they finished the death of Marmion between them, took off their hats to each
other, and parted, laughing. Scott's is almost the only poetry in the English language that
not only runs thus in the head of average men, but heats the head in which it runs by the mere
force of its hurried frankness of style, to use Scott's own terms, or by that of its strong
and pithy eloquence, as Campbell phrased it. And in Cadyow Castle this style is at its culminating
point.

CHAPTER V.

SCOTT'S MATURER POEMS.

Scott's genius flowered late. Cadyow Castle, the first of his poems, I think, that has indisputable
genius plainly stamped on its terse and fiery lines, was composed in 1802, when he was already
thirty-one years of age. It was in the same year that he wrote the first canto of his first
great romance in verse, The Lay of the Last Minstrel, a poem which did not appear till 1805,
when he was thirty-four. The first canto (not including the framework, of which the aged harper
is the principal figure) was written in the lodgings to which he was confined for a fortnight
in 1802, by a kick received from a horse on Portobello sands, during a charge of the Volunteer
Cavalry in which Scott was cornet. The poem was originally intended to be included in the Border
Minstrelsy, as one of the studies in the antique style, but soon outgrew the limits of such
a study both in length and in the freedom of its manner. Both the poorest and the best parts
of The Lay were in a special manner due to Lady Dalkeith (afterwards Duchess of Buccleugh),
who suggested it, and in whose honour the poem was written. It was she who requested Scott
to write a poem on the legend of the goblin page, Gilpin Horner, and this Scott attempted,--and,
so far as the goblin himself was concerned, conspicuously failed. He himself clearly saw that
the story of this unmanageable imp was both confused and uninteresting, and that in fact he
had to extricate himself from the original groundwork of the tale, as from a regular literary
scrape, in the best way he could. In a letter to Miss Seward, Scott says,--"At length the story
appeared so uncouth that I was fain to put it into the mouth of my old minstrel, lest the nature
of it should be misunderstood, and I should be suspected of setting up a new school of poetry,
instead of a feeble attempt to imitate the old. In the process of the romance, the page, intended
to be a principal person in the work, contrived (from the baseness of his natural propensities,
I suppose) to slink down stairs into the kitchen, and now he must e'en abide there."[12] And
I venture to say that no reader of the poem ever has distinctly understood what the goblin
page did or did not do, what it was that was "lost" throughout the poem and "found" at the
conclusion, what was the object of his personating the young heir of the house of Scott, and
whether or not that object was answered;--what use, if any, the magic book of Michael Scott
was to the Lady of Branksome, or whether it was only harm to her; and I doubt moreover whether
any one ever cared an iota what answer, or whether any answer, might be given to any of these
questions. All this, as Scott himself clearly perceived, was left confused, and not simply
vague. The goblin imp had been more certainly an imp of mischief to him than even to his boyish
ancestor. But if Lady Dalkeith suggested the poorest part of the poem, she certainly inspired
its best part. Scott says, as we have seen, that he brought in the aged harper to save himself
from the imputation of "setting-up a new school of poetry" instead of humbly imitating an old
school. But I think that the chivalrous wish to do honour to Lady Dalkeith, both as a personal
friend and as the wife of his "chief,"--as he always called the head of the house of Scott,--had
more to do with the introduction of the aged harper, than the wish to guard himself against
the imputation of attempting a new poetic style. He clearly intended the Duchess of The Lay
to represent the Countess for whom he wrote it, and the aged harper, with his reverence and
gratitude and self-distrust, was only the disguise in which he felt that he could best pour
out his loyalty, and the romantic devotion with which both Lord and Lady Dalkeith, but especially
the latter, had inspired him. It was certainly this beautiful framework which assured the immediate
success and permanent charm of the poem; and the immediate success was for that day something
marvellous. The magnificent quarto edition of 750 copies was soon exhausted, and an octavo
edition of 1500 copies was sold out within the year. In the following year two editions, containing
together 4250 copies, were disposed of, and before twenty-five years had elapsed, that is,
before 1830, 44,000 copies of the poem had been bought by the public in this country, taking
account of the legitimate trade alone. Scott gained in all by The Lay 769l., an unprecedented
sum in those times for an author to obtain from any poem. Little more than half a century before,
Johnson received but fifteen guineas for his stately poem on The Vanity of Human Wishes, and
but ten guineas for his London. I do not say that Scott's poem had not much more in it of true
poetic fire, though Scott himself, I believe, preferred these poems of Johnson's to anything
that he himself ever wrote. But the disproportion in the reward was certainly enormous, and
yet what Scott gained by his Lay was of course much less than he gained by any of his subsequent
poems of equal, or anything like equal, length. Thus for Marmion he received 1000 guineas long
before the poem was published, and for one half of the copyright of The Lord of the Isles Constable
paid Scott 1500 guineas. If we ask ourselves to what this vast popularity of Scott's poems,
and especially of the earlier of them (for, as often happens, he was better remunerated for
his later and much inferior poems than for his earlier and more brilliant productions) is due,
I think the answer must be for the most part, the high romantic glow and extraordinary romantic
simplicity of the poetical elements they contained. Take the old harper of The Lay, a figure
which arrested the attention of Pitt during even that last most anxious year of his anxious
life, the year of Ulm and Austerlitz. The lines in which Scott describes the old man's embarrassment
when first urged to play, produced on Pitt, according to his own account, "an effect which
I might have expected in painting, but could never have fancied capable of being given in poetry."[13]

Every one knows the lines to which Pitt refers:--

    "The humble boon was soon obtain'd;
    The aged minstrel audience gain'd.
    But, when he reach'd the room of state,
    Where she with all her ladies sate,
    Perchance he wish'd his boon denied;
    For, when to tune the harp he tried,
    His trembling hand had lost the ease
    Which marks security to please;
    And scenes long past, of joy and pain,
    Came wildering o'er his aged brain,--
    He tried to tune his harp in vain!
    The pitying Duchess praised its chime,
    And gave him heart, and gave him time,
    Till every string's according glee
    Was blended into harmony.
    And then, he said, he would full fain
    He could recall an ancient strain
    He never thought to sing again.
    It was not framed for village churls,
    But for high dames and mighty earls;
    He'd play'd it to King Charles the Good,
    When he kept Court at Holyrood;
    And much he wish'd, yet fear'd, to try
    The long-forgotten melody.
    Amid the strings his fingers stray'd,
    And an uncertain warbling made,
    And oft he shook his hoary head.
    But when he caught the measure wild
    The old man raised his face, and smiled;
    And lighten'd up his faded eye,
    With all a poet's ecstasy!

       *       *       *       *       *

    Here paused the harp; and with its swell
    The master's fire and courage fell;
    Dejectedly and low he bow'd,
    And, gazing timid on the crowd,
    He seem'd to seek in every eye
    If they approved his minstrelsy;
    And, diffident of present praise,
    Somewhat he spoke of former days,
    And how old age, and wandering long,
    Had done his hand and harp some wrong."

These lines hardly illustrate, I think, the particular form of Mr. Pitt's criticism, for a
quick succession of fine shades of feeling of this kind could never have been delineated in
a painting, or indeed in a series of paintings, at all, while they are so given in the poem.
But the praise itself, if not its exact form, is amply deserved. The singular depth of the
romantic glow in this passage, and its equally singular simplicity,--a simplicity which makes
it intelligible to every one,--are conspicuous to every reader. It is not what is called classical
poetry, for there is no severe outline,--no sculptured completeness and repose,--no satisfying
wholeness of effect to the eye of the mind,--no embodiment of a great action. The poet gives
us a breath, a ripple of alternating fear and hope in the heart of an old man, and that is
all. He catches an emotion that had its roots deep in the past, and that is striving onward
towards something in the future;--he traces the wistfulness and self-distrust with which age
seeks to recover the feelings of youth,--the delight with which it greets them when they come,--the
hesitation and diffidence with which it recalls them as they pass away, and questions the triumph
it has just won,--and he paints all this without subtlety, without complexity, but with a swiftness
such as few poets ever surpassed. Generally, however, Scott prefers action itself for his subject,
to any feeling, however active in its bent. The cases in which he makes a study of any mood
of feeling, as he does of this harper's feeling, are comparatively rare. Deloraine's night-ride
to Melrose is a good deal more in Scott's ordinary way, than this study of the old harper's
wistful mood. But whatever his subject, his treatment of it is the same. His lines are always
strongly drawn; his handling is always simple; and his subject always romantic. But though
romantic, it is simple almost to bareness,--one of the great causes both of his popularity,
and of that deficiency in his poetry of which so many of his admirers become conscious when
they compare him with other and richer poets. Scott used to say that in poetry Byron "bet"
him; and no doubt that in which chiefly as a poet he "bet" him, was in the variety, the richness,
the lustre of his effects. A certain ruggedness and bareness was of the essence of Scott's
idealism and romance. It was so in relation to scenery. He told Washington Irving that he loved
the very nakedness of the Border country. "It has something," he said, "bold and stern and
solitary about it. When I have been for some time in the rich scenery about Edinburgh, which
is like ornamented garden-land, I begin to wish myself back again among my honest grey hills,
and if I did not see the heather at least once a year, I think I should die."[14] Now, the
bareness which Scott so loved in his native scenery, there is in all his romantic elements
of feeling. It is while he is bold and stern, that he is at his highest ideal point. Directly
he begins to attempt rich or pretty subjects, as in parts of The Lady of the Lake, and a good
deal of The Lord of the Isles, and still more in The Bridal of Triermain, his charm disappears.
It is in painting those moods and exploits, in relation to which Scott shares most completely
the feelings of ordinary men, but experiences them with far greater strength and purity than
ordinary men, that he triumphs as a poet. Mr. Lockhart tells us that some of Scott's senses
were decidedly "blunt," and one seems to recognize this in the simplicity of his romantic effects.
"It is a fact," he says, "which some philosophers may think worth setting down, that Scott's
organization, as to more than one of the senses, was the reverse of exquisite. He had very
little of what musicians call an ear; his smell was hardly more delicate. I have seen him stare
about, quite unconscious of the cause, when his whole company betrayed their uneasiness at
the approach of an overkept haunch of venison; and neither by the nose nor the palate could
he distinguish corked wine from sound. He could never tell Madeira from sherry,--nay, an Oriental
friend having sent him a butt of sheeraz, when he remembered the circumstance some time afterwards
and called for a bottle to have Sir John Malcolm's opinion of its quality, it turned out that
his butler, mistaking the label, had already served up half the bin as sherry. Port he considered
as physic ... in truth he liked no wines except sparkling champagne and claret; but even as
to the last he was no connoisseur, and sincerely preferred a tumbler of whisky-toddy to the
most precious 'liquid-ruby' that ever flowed in the cup of a prince."[15]

However, Scott's eye was very keen:--"It was commonly him," as his little son once said, "that
saw the hare sitting." And his perception of colour was very delicate as well as his mere sight.
As Mr. Ruskin has pointed out, his landscape painting is almost all done by the lucid use of
colour. Nevertheless this bluntness of organization in relation to the less important senses,
no doubt contributed something to the singleness and simplicity of the deeper and more vital
of Scott's romantic impressions; at least there is good reason to suppose that delicate and
complicated susceptibilities do at least diminish the chance of living a strong and concentrated
life--do risk the frittering away of feeling on the mere backwaters of sensations, even if
they do not directly tend towards artificial and indirect forms of character. Scott's romance
is like his native scenery,--bold, bare and rugged, with a swift deep stream of strong pure
feeling running through it. There is plenty of colour in his pictures, as there is on the Scotch
hills when the heather is out. And so too there is plenty of intensity in his romantic situations;
but it is the intensity of simple, natural, unsophisticated, hardy, and manly characters. But
as for subtleties and fine shades of feeling in his poems, or anything like the manifold harmonies
of the richer arts, they are not to be found, or, if such complicated shading is to be found--and
it is perhaps attempted in some faint measure in The Bridal of Triermain, the poem in which
Scott tried to pass himself off for Erskine,--it is only at the expense of the higher qualities
of his romantic poetry, that even in this small measure it is supplied. Again, there is no
rich music in his verse. It is its rapid onset, its hurrying strength, which so fixes it in
the mind.

It was not till 1808, three years after the publication of The Lay, that Marmion, Scott's greatest
poem, was published. But I may as well say what seems necessary of that and his other poems,
while I am on the subject of his poetry. Marmion has all the advantage over The Lay of the
Last Minstrel that a coherent story told with force and fulness, and concerned with the same
class of subjects as The Lay, must have over a confused and ill-managed legend, the only original
purpose of which was to serve as the opportunity for a picture of Border life and strife. Scott's
poems have sometimes been depreciated as mere novelettes in verse, and I think that some of
them may be more or less liable to this criticism. For instance, The Lady of the Lake, with
the exception of two or three brilliant passages, has always seemed to me more of a versified
novelette,--without the higher and broader characteristics of Scott's prose novels--than of
a poem. I suppose what one expects from a poem as distinguished from a romance--even though
the poem incorporates a story--is that it should not rest for its chief interest on the mere
development of the story; but rather that the narrative should be quite subordinate to that
insight into the deeper side of life and manners, in expressing which poetry has so great an
advantage over prose. Of The Lay and Marmion this is true; less true of The Lady of the Lake,
and still less of Rokeby, or The Lord of the Isles, and this is why The Lay and Marmion seem
so much superior as poems to the others. They lean less on the interest of mere incident, more
on that of romantic feeling and the great social and historic features of the day. Marmion
was composed in great part in the saddle, and the stir of a charge of cavalry seems to be at
the very core of it. "For myself," said Scott, writing to a lady correspondent at a time when
he was in active service as a volunteer, "I must own that to one who has, like myself, la tête
un peu exaltée, the pomp and circumstance of war gives, for a time, a very poignant and pleasing
sensation."[16] And you feel this all through Marmion even more than in The Lay. Mr. Darwin
would probably say that Auld Wat of Harden had about as much responsibility for Marmion as
Sir Walter himself. "You will expect," he wrote to the same lady, who was personally unknown
to him at that time, "to see a person who had dedicated himself to literary pursuits, and you
will find me a rattle-skulled, half-lawyer, half-sportsman, through whose head a regiment of
horse has been exercising since he was five years old."[17] And what Scott himself felt in
relation to the martial elements of his poetry, soldiers in the field felt with equal force.
"In the course of the day when The Lady of the Lake first reached Sir Adam Fergusson, he was
posted with his company on a point of ground exposed to the enemy's artillery, somewhere no
doubt on the lines of Torres Vedras. The men were ordered to lie prostrate on the ground; while
they kept that attitude, the captain, kneeling at the head, read aloud the description of the
battle in Canto VI., and the listening soldiers only interrupted him by a joyous huzza when
the French shot struck the bank close above them."[18] It is not often that martial poetry
has been put to such a test; but we can well understand with what rapture a Scotch force lying
on the ground to shelter from the French fire, would enter into such passages as the following:--

    "Their light-arm'd archers far and near
      Survey'd the tangled ground,
    Their centre ranks, with pike and spear,
      A twilight forest frown'd,
    Their barbèd horsemen, in the rear,
      The stern battalia crown'd.
    No cymbal clash'd, no clarion rang,
      Still were the pipe and drum;
    Save heavy tread, and armour's clang,
      The sullen march was dumb.
    There breathed no wind their crests to shake,
      Or wave their flags abroad;
    Scarce the frail aspen seem'd to quake,
     That shadow'd o'er their road.
    Their vanward scouts no tidings bring,
      Can rouse no lurking foe,
    Nor spy a trace of living thing
      Save when they stirr'd the roe;
    The host moves like a deep-sea wave,
    Where rise no rocks its power to brave,
      High-swelling, dark, and slow.
    The lake is pass'd, and now they gain
    A narrow and a broken plain,
    Before the Trosach's rugged jaws,
    And here the horse and spearmen pause,
    While, to explore the dangerous glen,
    Dive through the pass the archer-men.

    "At once there rose so wild a yell
    Within that dark and narrow dell,
    As all the fiends from heaven that fell
    Had peal'd the banner-cry of Hell!
      Forth from the pass, in tumult driven,
      Like chaff before the wind of heaven,
        The archery appear;
      For life! for life! their plight they ply,
      And shriek, and shout, and battle-cry,
      And plaids and bonnets waving high,
      And broadswords flashing to the sky,
        Are maddening in the rear.
    Onward they drive, in dreadful race,
      Pursuers and pursued;
    Before that tide of flight and chase,
    How shall it keep its rooted place,
      The spearmen's twilight wood?
    Down, down, cried Mar, 'your lances down
      Bear back both friend and foe!'
    Like reeds before the tempest's frown,
    That serried grove of lances brown
      At once lay levell'd low;
    And, closely shouldering side to side,
    The bristling ranks the onset bide,--
    'We'll quell the savage mountaineer,
      As their Tinchel cows the game!
    They came as fleet as forest deer,
      We'll drive them back as tame.'"

But admirable in its stern and deep excitement as that is, the battle of Flodden in Marmion
passes it in vigour, and constitutes perhaps the most perfect description of war by one who
was--almost--both poet and warrior, which the English language contains.

And Marmion registers the high-water mark of Scott's poetical power, not only in relation to
the painting of war, but in relation to the painting of nature. Critics from the beginning
onwards have complained of the six introductory epistles, as breaking the unity of the story.
But I cannot see that the remark has weight. No poem is written for those who read it as they
do a novel--merely to follow the interest of the story; or if any poem be written for such
readers, it deserves to die. On such a principle--which treats a poem as a mere novel and nothing
else,--you might object to Homer that he interrupts the battle so often to dwell on the origin
of the heroes who are waging it; or to Byron that he deserts Childe Harold to meditate on the
rapture of solitude. To my mind the ease and frankness of these confessions of the author's
recollections give a picture of his life and character while writing Marmion, which adds greatly
to its attraction as a poem. You have a picture at once not only of the scenery, but of the
mind in which that scenery is mirrored, and are brought back frankly, at fit intervals, from
the one to the other, in the mode best adapted to help you to appreciate the relation of the
poet to the poem. At least if Milton's various interruptions of a much more ambitious theme,
to muse upon his own qualifications or disqualifications for the task he had attempted, be
not artistic mistakes--and I never heard of any one who thought them so--I cannot see any reason
why Scott's periodic recurrence to his own personal history should be artistic mistakes either.
If Scott's reverie was less lofty than Milton's, so also was his story. It seems to me as fitting
to describe the relation between the poet and his theme in the one case as in the other. What
can be more truly a part of Marmion, as a poem, though not as a story, than that introduction
to the first canto in which Scott expresses his passionate sympathy with the high national
feeling of the moment, in his tribute to Pitt and Fox, and then reproaches himself for attempting
so great a subject and returns to what he calls his "rude legend," the very essence of which
was, however, a passionate appeal to the spirit of national independence? What can be more
germane to the poem than the delineation of the strength the poet had derived from musing in
the bare and rugged solitudes of St. Mary's Lake, in the introduction to the second canto?
Or than the striking autobiographical study of his own infancy which I have before extracted
from the introduction to the third? It seems to me that Marmion without these introductions
would be like the hills which border Yarrow, without the stream and lake in which they are
reflected.

Never at all events in any later poem was Scott's touch as a mere painter so terse and strong.
What a picture of a Scotch winter is given in these few lines:--

    "The sheep before the pinching heaven
    To shelter'd dale and down are driven,
    Where yet some faded herbage pines,
    And yet a watery sunbeam shines:
    In meek despondency they eye
    The wither'd sward and wintry sky,
    And from beneath their summer hill
    Stray sadly by Glenkinnon's rill."

Again, if Scott is ever Homeric (which I cannot think he often is), in spite of Sir Francis
Doyle's able criticism,--(he is too short, too sharp, and too eagerly bent on his rugged way,
for a poet who is always delighting to find loopholes, even in battle, from which to look out
upon the great story of human nature), he is certainly nearest to it in such a passage as this:--

    "The Isles-men carried at their backs
    The ancient Danish battle-axe.
    They raised a wild and wondering cry
    As with his guide rode Marmion by.
    Loud were their clamouring tongues, as when
    The clanging sea-fowl leave the fen,
    And, with their cries discordant mix'd,
    Grumbled and yell'd the pipes betwixt."

In hardly any of Scott's poetry do we find much of what is called the curiosa felicitas of
expression,--the magic use of words, as distinguished from the mere general effect of vigour,
purity, and concentration of purpose. But in Marmion occasionally we do find such a use. Take
this description, for instance, of the Scotch tents near Edinburgh:--

    "A thousand did I say? I ween
    Thousands on thousands there were seen,
    That chequer'd all the heath between
      The streamlet and the town;
    In crossing ranks extending far,
    Forming a camp irregular;
    Oft giving way where still there stood
    Some relics of the old oak wood,
    That darkly huge did intervene,
    And tamed the glaring white with green;
    In these extended lines there lay
    A martial kingdom's vast array."

The line I have italicized seems to me to have more of the poet's special magic of expression
than is at all usual with Scott. The conception of the peaceful green oak wood taming the glaring
white of the tented field, is as fine in idea as it is in relation to the effect of the mere
colour on the eye. Judge Scott's poetry by whatever test you will--whether it be a test of
that which is peculiar to it, its glow of national feeling, its martial ardour, its swift and
rugged simplicity, or whether it be a test of that which is common to it with most other poetry,
its attraction for all romantic excitements, its special feeling for the pomp and circumstance
of war, its love of light and colour--and tested either way, Marmion will remain his finest
poem. The battle of Flodden Field touches his highest point in its expression of stern patriotic
feeling, in its passionate love of daring, and in the force and swiftness of its movement,
no less than in the brilliancy of its romantic interests, the charm of its picturesque detail,
and the glow of its scenic colouring. No poet ever equalled Scott in the description of wild
and simple scenes and the expression of wild and simple feelings. But I have said enough now
of his poetry, in which, good as it is, Scott's genius did not reach its highest point. The
hurried tramp of his somewhat monotonous metre, is apt to weary the ears of men who do not
find their sufficient happiness, as he did, in dreaming of the wild and daring enterprises
of his loved Border-land. The very quality in his verse which makes it seize so powerfully
on the imaginations of plain, bold, adventurous men, often makes it hammer fatiguingly against
the brain of those who need the relief of a wider horizon and a richer world.

CHAPTER VI.

COMPANIONS AND FRIENDS.

I have anticipated in some degree, in speaking of Scott's later poetical works, what, in point
of time at least, should follow some slight sketch of his chosen companions, and of his occupations
in the first period of his married life. Scott's most intimate friend for some time after he
went to college, probably the one who most stimulated his imagination in his youth, and certainly
one of his most intimate friends to the very last, was William Clerk, who was called to the
bar on the same day as Scott. He was the son of John Clerk of Eldin, the author of a book of
some celebrity in its time on Naval Tactics. Even in the earliest days of this intimacy, the
lads who had been Scott's fellow-apprentices in his father's office, saw with some jealousy
his growing friendship with William Clerk, and remonstrated with Scott on the decline of his
regard for them, but only succeeded in eliciting from him one of those outbursts of peremptory
frankness which anything that he regarded as an attempt to encroach on his own interior liberty
of choice always provoked. "I will never cut any man," he said, "unless I detect him in scoundrelism,
but I know not what right any of you have to interfere with my choice of my company. As it
is, I fairly own that though I like many of you very much, and have long done so, I think William
Clerk well worth you all put together."[19] Scott never lost the friendship which began with
this eager enthusiasm, but his chief intimacy with Clerk was during his younger days. Whether
for the reason suggested, or for some other, Clerk never actually gained any other distinction
so great as his friendship with Scott conferred upon him. Probably Scott had discerned the
true secret of his friend's comparative obscurity. Even while preparing for the bar, when they
had agreed to go on alternate mornings to each other's lodgings to read together, Scott found
it necessary to modify the arrangement by always visiting his friend, whom he usually found
in bed. It was William Clerk who sat for the picture of Darsie Latimer, the hero of Redgauntlet,--whence
we should suppose him to have been a lively, generous, susceptible, contentious, and rather
helter-skelter young man, much alive to the ludicrous in all situations, very eager to see
life in all its phases, and somewhat vain of his power of adapting himself equally to all these
phases. "Sir," replied the inscrutable stranger, "can you say anything clever about 'bend-leather'?"[20]
No doubt this superficial familiarity with a vast number of subjects was a great fascination
to Scott, and a great stimulus to his own imagination. To the last he held the same opinion
of his friend's latent powers. "To my thinking," he wrote in his diary in 1825, "I never met
a man of greater powers, of more complete information on all desirable subjects." But in youth
at least Clerk seems to have had what Sir Walter calls a characteristic Edinburgh complaint,
the "itch for disputation," and though he softened this down in later life, he had always that
slight contentiousness of bias which enthusiastic men do not often heartily like, and which
may have prevented Scott from continuing to the full the close intimacy of those earlier years.
Yet almost his last record of a really delightful evening, refers to a bachelor's dinner given
by Mr. Clerk, who remained unmarried, as late as 1827, after all Sir Walter's worst troubles
had come upon him. "In short," says the diary, "we really laughed, and real laughter is as
rare as real tears. I must say, too, there was a heart, a kindly feeling prevailed over the
party. Can London give such a dinner?"[21] It is clear, then, that Clerk's charm for his friend
survived to the last, and that it was not the mere inexperience of boyhood, which made Scott
esteem him so highly in his early days.

If Clerk pricked, stimulated, and sometimes badgered Scott, another of his friends who became
more and more intimate with him, as life went on, and who died before him, always soothed him,
partly by his gentleness, partly by his almost feminine dependence. This was William Erskine,
also a barrister, and son of an Episcopalian clergyman in Perthshire,--to whose influence it
is probably due that Scott himself always read the English Church service in his own country
house, and does not appear to have retained the Presbyterianism into which he was born. Erskine,
who was afterwards raised to the Bench as Lord Kinnedder--a distinction which he did not survive
for many months--was a good classic, a man of fine, or, as some of his companions thought,
of almost superfine taste. The style apparently for which he had credit must have been a somewhat
mimini-pimini style, if we may judge by Scott's attempt in The Bridal of Triermain, to write
in a manner which he intended to be attributed to his friend. Erskine was left a widower in
middle life, and Scott used to accuse him of philandering with pretty women,--- a mode of love-making
which Scott certainly contrived to render into verse, in painting Arthur's love-making to Lucy
in that poem. It seems that some absolutely false accusation brought against Lord Kinnedder,
of an intrigue with a lady with whom he had been thus philandering, broke poor Erskine's heart,
during his first year as a Judge. "The Counsellor (as Scott always called him) was," says Mr.
Lockhart, "a little man of feeble make, who seemed unhappy when his pony got beyond a footpace,
and had never, I should suppose, addicted himself to any out of door's sports whatever. He
would, I fancy, as soon have thought of slaying his own mutton as of handling a fowling-piece;
he used to shudder when he saw a party equipped for coursing, as if murder was in the wind;
but the cool, meditative angler was in his eyes the abomination of abominations. His small
elegant features, hectic cheek and soft hazel eyes, were the index of the quick, sensitive,
gentle spirit within." "He would dismount to lead his horse down what his friend hardly perceived
to be a descent at all; grew pale at a precipice; and, unlike the white lady of Avenel, would
go a long way round for a bridge." He shrank from general society, and lived in closer intimacies,
and his intimacy with Scott was of the closest. He was Scott's confidant in all literary matters,
and his advice was oftener followed on questions of style and form, and of literary enterprise,
than that of any other of Scott's friends. It is into Erskine's mouth that Scott puts the supposed
exhortation to himself to choose more classical subjects for his poems:--

    "'Approach those masters o'er whose tomb
    Immortal laurels ever bloom;
    Instructive of the feebler bard,
    Still from the grave their voice is heard;
    From them, and from the paths they show'd,
    Choose honour'd guide and practised road;
    Nor ramble on through brake and maze,
    With harpers rude of barbarous days."

And it is to Erskine that Scott replies,--

    "For me, thus nurtured, dost thou ask
    The classic poet's well-conn'd task?
    Nay, Erskine, nay,--on the wild hill
    Let the wild heath-bell flourish still;
    Cherish the tulip, prune the vine,
    But freely let the woodbine twine,
    And leave untrimm'd the eglantine:
    Nay, my friend, nay,--since oft thy praise
    Hath given fresh vigour to my lays;
    Since oft thy judgment could refine
    My flatten'd thought or cumbrous line,
    Still kind, as is thy wont, attend,
    And in the minstrel spare the friend!" There can, however, be no doubt at
all that Scott copied out his friend's MS., in order to increase the
mystification which he so much enjoyed as to the authorship of his
variously named series of tales. Possibly enough, too, he may have
drawn Erskine's attention to the evidence which justified his sketch
of the Puritans in Old Mortality, evidence which he certainly
intended at one time to embody in a reply of his own to the adverse
criticism on that book. But though Erskine was Scott's alter ego for
literary purposes, it is certain that Erskine, with his fastidious,
not to say finical, sense of honour, would never have lent his name to
cover a puff written by Scott of his own works. A man who, in Scott's
own words, died "a victim to a hellishly false story, or rather, I
should say, to the sensibility of his own nature, which could not
endure even the shadow of reproach,--like the ermine, which is said to
pine if its fur is soiled," was not the man to father a puff, even by
his dearest friend, on that friend's own creations. Erskine was indeed
almost feminine in his love of Scott; but he was feminine with all the
irritable and scrupulous delicacy of a man who could not derogate from
his own ideal of right, even to serve a friend.

Another friend of Scott's earlier days was John Leyden, Scott's most efficient coadjutor in
the collection of the Border Minstrelsy,--that eccentric genius, marvellous linguist, and good-natured
bear, who, bred a shepherd in one of the wildest valleys of Roxburghshire, had accumulated
before the age of nineteen an amount of learning which confounded the Edinburgh Professors,
and who, without any previous knowledge of medicine, prepared himself to pass an examination
for the medical profession, at six months' notice of the offer of an assistant-surgeoncy in
the East India Company. It was Leyden who once walked between forty and fifty miles and back,
for the sole purpose of visiting an old person who possessed a copy of a border ballad that
was wanting for the Minstrelsy. Scott was sitting at dinner one day with company, when he heard
a sound at a distance, "like that of the whistling of a tempest through the torn rigging of
a vessel which scuds before it. The sounds increased as they approached more near; and Leyden
(to the great astonishment of such of the guests as did not know him) burst into the room chanting
the desiderated ballad with the most enthusiastic gesture, and all the energy of what he used
to call the saw-tones of his voice."[22] Leyden's great antipathy was Ritson, an ill-conditioned
antiquarian, of vegetarian principles, whom Scott alone of all the antiquarians of that day
could manage to tame and tolerate. In Scott's absence one day, during his early married life
at Lasswade, Mrs. Scott inadvertently offered Ritson a slice of beef, when that strange man
burst out in such outrageous tones at what he chose to suppose an insult, that Leyden threatened
to "thraw his neck" if he were not silent, a threat which frightened Ritson out of the cottage.
On another occasion, simply in order to tease Ritson, Leyden complained that the meat was overdone,
and sent to the kitchen for a plate of literally raw beef, and ate it up solely for the purpose
of shocking his crazy rival in antiquarian research. Poor Leyden did not long survive his experience
of the Indian climate. And with him died a passion for knowledge of a very high order, combined
with no inconsiderable poetical gifts. It was in the study of such eccentric beings as Leyden
that Scott doubtless acquired his taste for painting the humours of Scotch character.

Another wild shepherd, and wilder genius among Scott's associates, not only in those earlier
days, but to the end, was that famous Ettrick Shepherd, James Hogg, who was always quarrelling
with his brother poet, as far as Scott permitted it, and making it up again when his better
feelings returned. In a shepherd's dress, and with hands fresh from sheep-shearing, he came
to dine for the first time with Scott in Castle Street, and finding Mrs. Scott lying on the
sofa, immediately stretched himself at full length on another sofa; for, as he explained afterwards,
"I thought I could not do better than to imitate the lady of the house." At dinner, as the
wine passed, he advanced from "Mr. Scott," to "Shirra" (Sheriff), "Scott," "Walter," and finally
"Wattie," till at supper he convulsed every one by addressing Mrs. Scott familiarly as "Charlotte."[23]
Hogg wrote certain short poems, the beauty of which in their kind Sir Walter himself never
approached; but he was a man almost without self-restraint or self-knowledge, though he had
a great deal of self-importance, and hardly knew how much he owed to Scott's magnanimous and
ever-forbearing kindness, or if he did, felt the weight of gratitude a burden on his heart.
Very different was William Laidlaw, a farmer on the banks of the Yarrow, always Scott's friend,
and afterwards his manager at Abbotsford, through whose hand he dictated many of his novels.
Mr. Laidlaw was one of Scott's humbler friends,--a class of friends with whom he seems always
to have felt more completely at his ease than any others--who gave at least as much as he received,
one of those wise, loyal, and thoughtful men in a comparatively modest position of life, whom
Scott delighted to trust, and never trusted without finding his trust justified. In addition
to these Scotch friends, Scott had made, even before the publication of his Border Minstrelsy,
not a few in London or its neighbourhood,--of whom the most important at this time was the
grey-eyed, hatchet-faced, courteous George Ellis, as Leyden described him, the author of various
works on ancient English poetry and romance, who combined with a shrewd, satirical vein, and
a great knowledge of the world, political as well as literary, an exquisite taste in poetry,
and a warm heart. Certainly Ellis's criticism on his poems was the truest and best that Scott
ever received; and had he lived to read his novels,--only one of which was published before
Ellis's death,--he might have given Scott more useful help than either Ballantyne or even Erskine.

CHAPTER VII.

FIRST COUNTRY HOMES.

So completely was Scott by nature an out-of-doors man that he cannot be adequately known either
through his poems or through his friends, without also knowing his external surroundings and
occupations. His first country home was the cottage at Lasswade, on the Esk, about six miles
from Edinburgh, which he took in 1798, a few months after his marriage, and retained till 1804.
It was a pretty little cottage, in the beautification of which Scott felt great pride, and
where he exercised himself in the small beginnings of those tastes for altering and planting
which grew so rapidly upon him, and at last enticed him into castle-building and tree-culture
on a dangerous, not to say, ruinous scale. One of Scott's intimate friends, the master of Rokeby,
by whose house and neighbourhood the poem of that name was suggested, Mr. Morritt, walked along
the Esk in 1808 with Scott four years after he had left it, and was taken out of his way to
see it. "I have been bringing you," he said, "where there is little enough to be seen, only
that Scotch cottage, but though not worth looking at, I could not pass it. It was our first
country house when newly married, and many a contrivance it had to make it comfortable. I made
a dining-table for it with my own hands. Look at these two miserable willow-trees on either
side the gate into the enclosure; they are tied together at the top to be an arch, and a cross
made of two sticks over them is not yet decayed. To be sure it is not much of a lion to show
a stranger; but I wanted to see it again myself, for I assure you that after I had constructed
it, mamma (Mrs. Scott) and I both of us thought it so fine, we turned out to see it by moonlight,
and walked backwards from it to the cottage-door, in admiration of our own magnificence and
its picturesque effect." It was here at Lasswade that he bought the phaeton, which was the
first wheeled carriage that ever penetrated to Liddesdale, a feat which it accomplished in
the first August of this century.

When Scott left the cottage at Lasswade in 1804, it was to take up his country residence in
Selkirkshire, of which he had now been made sheriff, in a beautiful little house belonging
to his cousin, Major-General Sir James Russell, and known to all the readers of Scott's poetry
as the Ashestiel of the Marmion introductions. The Glenkinnon brook dashes in a deep ravine
through the grounds to join the Tweed; behind the house rise the hills which divide the Tweed
from the Yarrow; and an easy ride took Scott into the scenery of the Yarrow. The description
of Ashestiel, and the brook which runs through it, in the introduction to the first canto of
Marmion is indeed one of the finest specimens of Scott's descriptive poetry:--

    "November's sky is chill and drear,
    November's leaf is red and sear;
    Late, gazing down the steepy linn,
    That hems our little garden in,
    Low in its dark and narrow glen,
    You scarce the rivulet might ken,
    So thick the tangled greenwood grew,
    So feeble trill'd the streamlet through;
    Now, murmuring hoarse, and frequent seen,
    Through bush and briar no longer green,
    An angry brook, it sweeps the glade,
    Brawls over rock and wild cascade,
    And, foaming brown with doubled speed,
    Hurries its waters to the Tweed."

Selkirk was his nearest town, and that was seven miles from Ashestiel; and even his nearest
neighbour was at Yair, a few miles off lower down the Tweed,--Yair of which he wrote in another
of the introductions to Marmion:--

    "From Yair, which hills so closely bind
    Scarce can the Tweed his passage find,
    Though much he fret, and chafe, and toil,
    Till all his eddying currents boil."

At Ashestiel it was one of his greatest delights to look after his relative's woods, and to
dream of planting and thinning woods of his own, a dream only too amply realized. It was here
that a new kitchen-range was sunk for some time in the ford, which was so swollen by a storm
in 1805 that the horse and cart that brought it were themselves with difficulty rescued from
the waters. And it was here that Scott first entered on that active life of literary labour
in close conjunction with an equally active life of rural sport, which gained him a well-justified
reputation as the hardest worker and the heartiest player in the kingdom. At Lasswade Scott's
work had been done at night; but serious headaches made him change his habit at Ashestiel,
and rise steadily at five, lighting his own fire in winter. "Arrayed in his shooting-jacket,
or whatever dress he meant to use till dinner-time, he was seated at his desk by six o'clock,
all his papers arranged before him in the most accurate order, and his books of reference marshalled
around him on the floor, while at least one favourite dog lay watching his eye, just beyond
the line of circumvallation. Thus, by the time the family assembled for breakfast, between
nine and ten, he had done enough, in his own language, 'to break the neck of the day's work.'
After breakfast a couple of hours more were given to his solitary tasks, and by noon he was,
as he used to say, his 'own man.' When the weather was bad, he would labour incessantly all
the morning; but the general rule was to be out and on horseback by one o'clock at the latest;
while, if any more distant excursion had been proposed overnight, he was ready to start on
it by ten; his occasional rainy days of unintermitted study, forming, as he said, a fund in
his favour, out of which he was entitled to draw for accommodation whenever the sun shone with
special brightness." In his earlier days none of his horses liked to be fed except by their
master. When Brown Adam was saddled, and the stable-door opened, the horse would trot round
to the leaping-on stone of his own accord, to be mounted, and was quite intractable under any
one but Scott. Scott's life might well be fairly divided--just as history is divided into reigns--by
the succession of his horses and dogs. The reigns of Captain, Lieutenant, Brown Adam, Daisy,
divide at least the period up to Waterloo; while the reigns of Sybil Grey, and the Covenanter,
or Douce Davie, divide the period of Scott's declining years. During the brilliant period of
the earlier novels we hear less of Scott's horses; but of his deerhounds there is an unbroken
succession. Camp, Maida (the "Bevis" of Woodstock), and Nimrod, reigned successively between
Sir Walter's marriage and his death. It was Camp on whose death he relinquished a dinner invitation
previously accepted, on the ground that the death of "an old friend" rendered him unwilling
to dine out; Maida to whom he erected a marble monument, and Nimrod of whom he spoke so affectingly
as too good a dog for his diminished fortunes during his absence in Italy on the last hopeless
journey.

Scott's amusements at Ashestiel, besides riding, in which he was fearless to rashness, and
coursing, which was the chief form of sporting in the neighbourhood, comprehended "burning
the water," as salmon-spearing by torchlight was called, in the course of which he got many
a ducking. Mr. Skene gives an amusing picture of their excursions together from Ashestiel among
the hills, he himself followed by a lanky Savoyard, and Scott by a portly Scotch butler--both
servants alike highly sensitive as to their personal dignity--on horses which neither of the
attendants could sit well. "Scott's heavy lumbering buffetier had provided himself against
the mountain storms with a huge cloak, which, when the cavalcade was at gallop, streamed at
full stretch from his shoulders, and kept flapping in the other's face, who, having more than
enough to do in preserving his own equilibrium, could not think of attempting at any time to
control the pace of his steed, and had no relief but fuming and pesting at the sacré manteau,
in language happily unintelligible to its wearer. Now and then some ditch or turf-fence rendered
it indispensable to adventure on a leap, and no farce could have been more amusing than the
display of politeness which then occurred between these worthy equestrians, each courteously
declining in favour of his friend the honour of the first experiment, the horses fretting impatient
beneath them, and the dogs clamouring encouragement."[24] Such was Scott's order of life at
Ashestiel, where he remained from 1804 to 1812. As to his literary work here, it was enormous.

Besides finishing The Lay of the Last Minstrel, writing Marmion, The Lady of the Lake, part
of The Bridal of Triermain, and part of Rokeby, and writing reviews, he wrote a Life of Dryden,
and edited his works anew with some care, in eighteen volumes, edited Somers's Collection of
Tracts, in thirteen volumes, quarto, Sir Ralph Sadler's Life, Letters, and State Papers, in
three volumes, quarto, Miss Seward's Life and Poetical Works, The Secret History of the Court
of James I., in two volumes, Strutt's Queenhoo Hall, in four volumes, 12mo., and various other
single volumes, and began his heavy work on the edition of Swift. This was the literary work
of eight years, during which he had the duties of his Sheriffship, and, after he gave up his
practice as a barrister, the duties of his Deputy Clerkship of Session to discharge regularly.
The editing of Dryden alone would have seemed to most men of leisure a pretty full occupation
for these eight years, and though I do not know that Scott edited with the anxious care with
which that sort of work is often now prepared, that he went into all the arguments for a doubtful
reading with the pains that Mr. Dyce spent on the various readings of Shakespeare, or that
Mr. Spedding spent on a various reading of Bacon, yet Scott did his work in a steady, workmanlike
manner, which satisfied the most fastidious critics of that day, and he was never, I believe,
charged with hurrying or scamping it. His biographies of Swift and Dryden are plain solid pieces
of work--not exactly the works of art which biographies have been made in our day--not comparable
to Carlyle's studies of Cromwell or Frederick, or, in point of art, even to the life of John
Sterling, but still sensible and interesting, sound in judgment, and animated in style.

CHAPTER VIII.

REMOVAL TO ABBOTSFORD, AND LIFE THERE.

In May, 1812, Scott having now at last obtained the salary of the Clerkship of Session, the
work of which he had for more than five years discharged without pay, indulged himself in realizing
his favourite dream of buying a "mountain farm" at Abbotsford,--five miles lower down the Tweed
than his cottage at Ashestiel, which was now again claimed by the family of Russell,--and migrated
thither with his household goods. The children long remembered the leave-taking as one of pure
grief, for the villagers were much attached both to Scott and to his wife, who had made herself
greatly beloved by her untiring goodness to the sick among her poor neighbours. But Scott himself
describes the migration as a scene in which their neighbours found no small share of amusement.
"Our flitting and removal from Ashestiel baffled all description; we had twenty-five cartloads
of the veriest trash in nature, besides dogs, pigs, ponies, poultry, cows, calves, bare-headed
wenches, and bare-breeched boys."[25]

To another friend Scott wrote that the neighbours had "been much delighted with the procession
of my furniture, in which old swords, bows, targets, and lances, made a very conspicuous show.
A family of turkeys was accommodated within the helmet of some preux chevalier of ancient border
fame; and the very cows, for aught I know, were bearing banners and muskets. I assure your
ladyship that this caravan attended by a dozen of ragged rosy peasant children, carrying fishing-rods
and spears, and leading ponies, greyhounds, and spaniels, would, as it crossed the Tweed, have
furnished no bad subject for the pencil, and really reminded me of one of the gipsy groups
of Callot upon their march."[26]

The place thus bought for 4000l.,--half of which, according to Scott's bad and sanguine habit,
was borrowed from his brother, and half raised on the security of a poem at the moment of sale
wholly unwritten, and not completed even when he removed to Abbotsford--"Rokeby"--became only
too much of an idol for the rest of Scott's life. Mr. Lockhart admits that before the crash
came he had invested 29,000l. in the purchase of land alone. But at this time only the kernel
of the subsequent estate was bought, in the shape of a hundred acres or rather more, part of
which ran along the shores of the Tweed--"a beautiful river flowing broad and bright over a
bed of milk-white pebbles, unless here and there where it darkened into a deep pool, overhung
as yet only by birches and alders." There was also a poor farm-house, a staring barn, and a
pond so dirty that it had hitherto given the name of "Clarty Hole" to the place itself. Scott
renamed the place from the adjoining ford which was just above the confluence of the Gala with
the Tweed. He chose the name of Abbotsford because the land had formerly all belonged to the
Abbots of Melrose,--the ruin of whose beautiful abbey was visible from many parts of the little
property. On the other side of the river the old British barrier called "the Catrail" was full
in view. As yet the place was not planted,--the only effort made in this direction by its former
owner, Dr. Douglas, having been a long narrow stripe of firs, which Scott used to compare to
a black hair-comb, and which gave the name of "The Doctor's Redding-Kame" to the stretch of
woods of which it is still the central line. Such was the place which he made it the too great
delight of the remainder of his life to increase and beautify, by spending on it a good deal
more than he had earned, and that too in times when he should have earned a good deal more
than he ought to have thought even for a moment of spending. The cottage grew to a mansion,
and the mansion to a castle. The farm by the Tweed made him long for a farm by the Cauldshiel's
loch, and the farm by the Cauldshiel's loch for Thomas the Rhymer's Glen; and as, at every
step in the ladder, his means of buying were really increasing--though they were so cruelly
discounted and forestalled by this growing land-hunger,--Scott never realized into what troubles
he was carefully running himself.

Of his life at Abbotsford at a later period when his building was greatly enlarged, and his
children grown up, we have a brilliant picture from the pen of Mr. Lockhart. And though it
does not belong to his first years at Abbotsford, I cannot do better than include it here as
conveying probably better than anything I could elsewhere find, the charm of that ideal life
which lured Scott on from one project to another in that scheme of castle-building, in relation
to which he confused so dangerously the world of dreams with the harder world of wages, capital,
interest, and rent.

     "I remember saying to William Allan one morning, as the
     whole party mustered before the porch after breakfast, 'A
     faithful sketch of what you at this moment see would be more
     interesting a hundred years hence than the grandest
     so-called historical picture that you will ever exhibit in
     Somerset House;' and my friend agreed with me so cordially
     that I often wondered afterwards he had not attempted to
     realize the suggestion. The subject ought, however, to have
     been treated conjointly by him (or Wilkie) and Edwin
     Landseer.

     "It was a clear, bright September morning, with a sharpness
     in the air that doubled the animating influence of the
     sunshine, and all was in readiness for a grand coursing
     match on Newark Hill. The only guest who had chalked out
     other sport for himself was the staunchest of anglers, Mr.
     Rose; but he too was there on his shelty, armed with his
     salmon-rod and landing-net, and attended by his humorous
     squire, Hinves, and Charlie Purdie, a brother of Tom, in
     those days the most celebrated fisherman of the district.
     This little group of Waltonians, bound for Lord Somerville's
     preserve, remained lounging about to witness the start of
     the main cavalcade. Sir Walter, mounted on Sybil, was
     marshalling the order of procession with a huge
     hunting-whip; and among a dozen frolicsome youths and
     maidens, who seemed disposed to laugh at all discipline,
     appeared, each on horseback, each as eager as the youngest
     sportsman in the troop, Sir Humphry Davy, Dr. Wollaston, and
     the patriarch of Scottish belles lettres, Henry Mackenzie.
     The Man of Feeling, however, was persuaded with some
     difficulty to resign his steed for the present to his
     faithful negro follower, and to join Lady Scott in the
     sociable, until we should reach the ground of our battue.
     Laidlaw, on a long-tailed, wiry Highlander, yclept Hoddin
     Grey, which carried him nimbly and stoutly, although his
     feet almost touched the ground as he sat, was the adjutant.
     But the most picturesque figure was the illustrious inventor
     of the safety-lamp. He had come for his favourite sport of
     angling, and had been practising it successfully with Rose,
     his travelling-companion, for two or three days preceding
     this, but he had not prepared for coursing fields, and had
     left Charlie Purdie's troop for Sir Walter's on a sudden
     thought; and his fisherman's costume--a brown hat with
     flexible brim, surrounded with line upon line, and
     innumerable fly-hooks, jack-boots worthy of a Dutch
     smuggler, and a fustian surtout dabbled with the blood of
     salmon,--made a fine contrast with the smart jackets, white
     cord breeches, and well-polished jockey-boots of the less
     distinguished cavaliers about him. Dr. Wollaston was in
     black, and, with his noble, serene dignity of countenance,
     might have passed for a sporting archbishop. Mr. Mackenzie,
     at this time in the seventy-sixth year of his age, with a
     white hat turned up with green, green spectacles, green
     jacket, and long brown leather gaiters buttoned upon his
     nether anatomy, wore a dog-whistle round his neck, and had
     all over the air of as resolute a devotee as the gay captain
     of Huntly Burn. Tom Purdie and his subalterns had preceded
     us by a few hours with all the greyhounds that could be
     collected at Abbotsford, Darnick, and Melrose; but the giant
     Maida had remained as his master's orderly, and now
     gambolled about Sibyl Grey, barking for mere joy, like a
     spaniel puppy.

     "The order of march had been all settled, and the sociable
     was just getting under weigh, when the Lady Anne broke
     from the line, screaming with laughter, and exclaimed,
     'Papa! papa! I know you could never think of going without
     your pet.' Scott looked round, and I rather think there was
     a blush as well as a smile upon his face, when he perceived
     a little black pig frisking about his pony, and evidently a
     self-elected addition to the party of the day. He tried to
     look stern, and cracked his whip at the creature, but was in
     a moment obliged to join in the general cheers. Poor piggy
     soon found a strap round his neck, and was dragged into the
     background. Scott, watching the retreat, repeated with mock
     pathos the first verse of an old pastoral song:--

         "What will I do gin my hoggie die?
            My joy, my pride, my hoggie!
          My only beast, I had nae mae,
            And wow! but I was vogie!"

     The cheers were redoubled, and the squadron moved on. This
     pig had taken, nobody could tell how, a most sentimental
     attachment to Scott, and was constantly urging its
     pretension to be admitted a regular member of his tail,
     along with the greyhounds and terriers; but indeed I
     remember him suffering another summer under the same sort of
     pertinacity on the part of an affectionate hen. I leave the
     explanation for philosophers; but such were the facts. I
     have too much respect for the vulgarly calumniated donkey to
     name him in the same category of pets with the pig and the
     hen; but a year or two after this time, my wife used to
     drive a couple of these animals in a little garden chair,
     and whenever her father appeared at the door of our cottage,
     we were sure to see Hannah More and Lady Morgan (as Anne
     Scott had wickedly christened them) trotting from their
     pasture to lay their noses over the paling, and, as
     Washington Irving says of the old white-haired hedger with
     the Parisian snuff-box, 'to have a pleasant crack wi' the
     laird.'"[27]

Carlyle, in his criticism on Scott--a criticism which will hardly, I think, stand the test
of criticism in its turn, so greatly does he overdo the reaction against the first excessive
appreciation of his genius--adds a contribution of his own to this charming idyll, in reference
to the natural fascination which Scott seemed to exert over almost all dumb creatures. A little
Blenheim cocker, "one of the smallest, beautifullest, and tiniest of lapdogs," with which Carlyle
was well acquainted, and which was also one of the shyest of dogs, that would crouch towards
his mistress and draw back "with angry timidity" if any one did but look at him admiringly,
once met in the street "a tall, singular, busy-looking man," who halted by. The dog ran towards
him and began "fawning, frisking, licking at his feet;" and every time he saw Sir Walter afterwards,
in Edinburgh, he repeated his demonstration of delight. Thus discriminating was this fastidious
Blenheim cocker even in the busy streets of Edinburgh.

And Scott's attraction for dumb animals was only a lesser form of his attraction for all who
were in any way dependent on him, especially his own servants and labourers. The story of his
demeanour towards them is one of the most touching ever written. "Sir Walter speaks to every
man as if they were blood-relations" was the common formula in which this demeanour was described.
Take this illustration. There was a little hunchbacked tailor, named William Goodfellow, living
on his property (but who at Abbotsford was termed Robin Goodfellow). This tailor was employed
to make the curtains for the new library, and had been very proud of his work, but fell ill
soon afterwards, and Sir Walter was unremitting in his attention to him. "I can never forget,"
says Mr. Lockhart, "the evening on which the poor tailor died. When Scott entered the hovel,
he found everything silent, and inferred from the looks of the good women in attendance that
the patient had fallen asleep, and that they feared his sleep was the final one. He murmured
some syllables of kind regret: at the sound of his voice the dying tailor unclosed his eyes,
and eagerly and wistfully sat up, clasping his hands with an expression of rapturous gratefulness
and devotion that, in the midst of deformity, disease, pain, and wretchedness, was at once
beautiful and sublime. He cried with a loud voice, 'The Lord bless and reward you!' and expired
with the effort."[28] Still more striking is the account of his relation with Tom Purdie, the
wide-mouthed, under-sized, broad-shouldered, square-made, thin-flanked woodsman, so well known
afterwards by all Scott's friends as he waited for his master in his green shooting-jacket,
white hat, and drab trousers. Scott first made Tom Purdie's acquaintance in his capacity as
judge, the man being brought before him for poaching, at the time that Scott was living at
Ashestiel. Tom gave so touching an account of his circumstances--work scarce--wife and children
in want--grouse abundant--and his account of himself was so fresh and even humorous, that Scott
let him off the penalty, and made him his shepherd. He discharged these duties so faithfully
that he came to be his master's forester and factotum, and indeed one of his best friends,
though a little disposed to tyrannize over Scott in his own fashion. A visitor describes him
as unpacking a box of new importations for his master "as if he had been sorting some toys
for a restless child." But after Sir Walter had lost the bodily strength requisite for riding,
and was too melancholy for ordinary conversation, Tom Purdie's shoulder was his great stay
in wandering through his woods, for with him he felt that he might either speak or be silent
at his pleasure. "What a blessing there is," Scott wrote in his diary at that time, "in a fellow
like Tom, whom no familiarity can spoil, whom you may scold and praise and joke with, knowing
the quality of the man is unalterable in his love and reverence to his master." After Scott's
failure, Mr. Lockhart writes: "Before I leave this period, I must note how greatly I admired
the manner in which all his dependents appeared to have met the reverse of his fortunes--a
reverse which inferred very considerable alteration in the circumstances of every one of them.
The butler, instead of being the easy chief of a large establishment, was now doing half the
work of the house at probably half his former wages. Old Peter, who had been for five and twenty
years a dignified coachman, was now ploughman in ordinary, only putting his horses to the carriage
upon high and rare occasions; and so on with all the rest that remained of the ancient train.
And all, to my view, seemed happier than they had ever done before."[29] The illustration of
this true confidence between Scott and his servants and labourers might be extended to almost
any length.

CHAPTER IX.

SCOTT'S PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE BALLANTYNES.

Before I make mention of Scott's greatest works, his novels, I must say a few words of his
relation to the Ballantyne Brothers, who involved him, and were involved by him, in so many
troubles, and with whose name the story of his broken fortunes is inextricably bound up. James
Ballantyne, the elder brother, was a schoolfellow of Scott's at Kelso, and was the editor and
manager of the Kelso Mail, an anti-democratic journal, which had a fair circulation. Ballantyne
was something of an artist as regarded "type," and Scott got him therefore to print his Minstrelsy
of the Border, the excellent workmanship of which attracted much attention in London. In 1802,
on Scott's suggestion, Ballantyne moved to Edinburgh; and to help him to move, Scott, who was
already meditating some investment of his little capital in business other than literary, lent
him 500l. Between this and 1805, when Scott first became a partner of Ballantyne's in the printing
business, he used every exertion to get legal and literary printing offered to James Ballantyne,
and, according to Mr. Lockhart, the concern "grew and prospered." At Whitsuntide, 1805, when
The Lay had been published, but before Scott had the least idea of the prospects of gain which
mere literature would open to him, he formally, though secretly, joined Ballantyne as a partner
in the printing business. He explains his motives for this step, so far at least as he then
recalled them, in a letter written after his misfortunes, in 1826. "It is easy," he said, "no
doubt for any friend to blame me for entering into connexion with commercial matters at all.
But I wish to know what I could have done better--excluded from the bar, and then from all
profits for six years, by my colleague's prolonged life. Literature was not in those days what
poor Constable has made it; and with my little capital I was too glad to make commercially
the means of supporting my family. I got but 600l. for The Lay of the Last Minstrel, and--it
was a price that made men's hair stand on end--1000l. for Marmion. I have been far from suffering
by James Ballantyne. I owe it to him to say, that his difficulties, as well as his advantages,
are owing to me."

This, though a true, was probably a very imperfect account of Scott's motives. He ceased practising
at the bar, I do not doubt, in great degree from a kind of hurt pride at his ill-success, at
a time when he felt during every month more and more confidence in his own powers. He believed,
with some justice, that he understood some of the secrets of popularity in literature, but
he had always, till towards the end of his life, the greatest horror of resting on literature
alone as his main resource; and he was not a man, nor was Lady Scott a woman, to pinch and
live narrowly. Were it only for his lavish generosity, that kind of life would have been intolerable
to him. Hence, he reflected, that if he could but use his literary instinct to feed some commercial
undertaking, managed by a man he could trust, he might gain a considerable percentage on his
little capital, without so embarking in commerce as to oblige him either to give up his status
as a sheriff, or his official duties as a clerk of session, or his literary undertakings. In
his old schoolfellow, James Ballantyne, he believed he had found just such an agent as he wanted,
the requisite link between literary genius like his own, and the world which reads and buys
books; and he thought that, by feeling his way a little, he might secure, through this partnership,
besides the then very bare rewards of authorship, at least a share in those more liberal rewards
which commercial men managed to squeeze for themselves out of successful authors. And, further,
he felt--and this was probably the greatest unconscious attraction for him in this scheme--that
with James Ballantyne for his partner he should be the real leader and chief, and rather in
the position of a patron and benefactor of his colleague, than of one in any degree dependent
on the generosity or approval of others. "If I have a very strong passion in the world," he
once wrote of himself--and the whole story of his life seems to confirm it--"it is pride."[30]
In James Ballantyne he had a faithful, but almost humble friend, with whom he could deal much
as he chose, and fear no wound to his pride. He had himself helped Ballantyne to a higher line
of business than any hitherto aspired to by him. It was his own book which first got the Ballantyne
press its public credit. And if he could but create a great commercial success upon this foundation,
he felt that he should be fairly entitled to share in the gains, which not merely his loan
of capital, but his foresight and courage had opened to Ballantyne.

And it is quite possible that Scott might have succeeded--or at all events not seriously failed--if
he had been content to stick to the printing firm of James Ballantyne and Co., and had not
launched also into the bookselling and publishing firm of John Ballantyne and Co., or had never
begun the wild and dangerous practice of forestalling his gains, and spending wealth which
he had not earned. But when by way of feeding the printing press of James Ballantyne and Co.,
he started in 1809 the bookselling and publishing firm of John Ballantyne and Co., using as
his agent a man as inferior in sterling worth to James, as James was inferior in general ability
to himself, he carefully dug a mine under his own feet, of which we can only say, that nothing
except his genius could have prevented it from exploding long before it did. The truth was
evidently that James Ballantyne's respectful homage, and John's humorous appreciation, all
but blinded Scott's eyes to the utter inadequacy of either of these men, especially the latter,
to supply the deficiencies of his own character for conducting business of this kind with proper
discretion. James Ballantyne, who was pompous and indolent, though thoroughly honest, and not
without some intellectual insight, Scott used to call Aldiborontiphoscophornio. John, who was
clever but frivolous, dissipated, and tricksy, he termed Rigdumfunnidos, or his "little Picaroon."
It is clear from Mr. Lockhart's account of the latter that Scott not only did not respect,
but despised him, though he cordially liked him, and that he passed over, in judging him, vices
which in a brother or son of his own he would severely have rebuked. I believe myself that
his liking for co-operation with both, was greatly founded on his feeling that they were simply
creatures of his, to whom he could pretty well dictate what he wanted,--colleagues whose inferiority
to himself unconsciously flattered his pride. He was evidently inclined to resent bitterly
the patronage of publishers. He sent word to Blackwood once with great hauteur, after some
suggestion from that house had been made to him which appeared to him to interfere with his
independence as an author, that he was one of "the Black Hussars" of literature, who would
not endure that sort of treatment. Constable, who was really very liberal, hurt his sensitive
pride through the Edinburgh Review, of which Jeffrey was editor. Thus the Ballantynes' great
deficiency--that neither of them had any independent capacity for the publishing business,
which would in any way hamper his discretion--though this is just what commercial partners
ought to have had, or they were not worth their salt,--was, I believe, precisely what induced
this Black Hussar of literature, in spite of his otherwise considerable sagacity and knowledge
of human nature, to select them for partners.

And yet it is strange that he not only chose them, but chose the inferior and lighter-headed
of the two for far the most important and difficult of the two businesses. In the printing
concern there was at least this to be said, that of part of the business--the selection of
type and the superintendence of the executive part,--James Ballantyne was a good judge. He
was never apparently a good man of business, for he kept no strong hand over the expenditure
and accounts, which is the core of success in every concern. But he understood types; and his
customers were publishers, a wealthy and judicious class, who were not likely all to fail together.
But to select a "Rigdumfunnidos,"--a dissipated comic-song singer and horse-fancier,--for the
head of a publishing concern, was indeed a kind of insanity. It is told of John Ballantyne,
that after the successful negotiation with Constable for Rob Roy, and while "hopping up and
down in his glee," he exclaimed, "'Is Rob's gun here, Mr. Scott? Would you object to my trying
the old barrel with a few de joy?' 'Nay, Mr. Puff,' said Scott, 'it would burst and blow you
to the devil before your time.' 'Johnny, my man,' said Constable, 'what the mischief puts drawing
at sight into your head?' Scott laughed heartily at this innuendo; and then observing that
the little man felt somewhat sore, called attention to the notes of a bird in the adjoining
shrubbery. 'And by-the-bye,' said he, as they continued listening, ''tis a long time, Johnny,
since we have had "The Cobbler of Kelso."' Mr. Puff forthwith jumped up on a mass of stone,
and seating himself in the proper attitude of one working with an awl, began a favourite interlude,
mimicking a certain son of Crispin, at whose stall Scott and he had often lingered when they
were schoolboys, and a blackbird, the only companion of his cell, that used to sing to him
while he talked and whistled to it all day long. With this performance Scott was always delighted.
Nothing could be richer than the contrast of the bird's wild, sweet notes, some of which he
imitated with wonderful skill, and the accompaniment of the cobbler's hoarse, cracked voice,
uttering all manner of endearing epithets, which Johnny multiplied and varied in a style worthy
of the old women in Rabelais at the birth of Pantagruel."[31] That passage gives precisely
the kind of estimation in which John Ballantyne was held both by Scott and Constable. And yet
it was to him that Scott entrusted the dangerous and difficult duty of setting up a new publishing
house as a rival to the best publishers of the day. No doubt Scott really relied on his own
judgment for working the publishing house. But except where his own books were concerned, no
judgment could have been worse. In the first place he was always wanting to do literary jobs
for a friend, and so advised the publishing of all sorts of unsaleable books, because his friends
desired to write them. In the next place, he was a genuine historian, and one of the antiquarian
kind himself; he was himself really interested in all sorts of historical and antiquarian issues,--and
very mistakenly gave the public credit for wishing to know what he himself wished to know.
I should add that Scott's good nature and kindness of heart not only led him to help on many
books which he knew in himself could never answer, and some which, as he well knew, would be
altogether worthless, but that it greatly biassed his own intellectual judgment. Nothing can
be plainer than that he really held his intimate friend, Joanna Baillie, a very great dramatic
poet, a much greater poet than himself, for instance; one fit to be even mentioned as following--at
a distance--in the track of Shakespeare. He supposes Erskine to exhort him thus:--

    "Or, if to touch such chord be thine,
    Restore the ancient tragic line,
    And emulate the notes that rung
    From the wild harp which silent hung
    By silver Avon's holy shore,
    Till twice a hundred years roll'd o'er,--
    When she, the bold enchantress, came
    With fearless hand and heart on flame,
    From the pale willow snatch'd the treasure,
    And swept it with a kindred measure,
    Till Avon's swans, while rung the grove
    With Montfort's hate and Basil's love,
    Awakening at the inspired strain,
    Deem'd their own Shakespeare lived again."

Avon's swans must have been Avon's geese, I think, if they had deemed anything of the kind.
Joanna Baillie's dramas are "nice," and rather dull; now and then she can write a song with
the ease and sweetness that suggest Shakespearian echoes. But Scott's judgment was obviously
blinded by his just and warm regard for Joanna Baillie herself.

Of course with such interfering causes to bring unsaleable books to the house--of course I
do not mean that John Ballantyne and Co. published for Joanna Baillie, or that they would have
lost by it if they had--the new firm published all sorts of books which did not sell at all;
while John Ballantyne himself indulged in a great many expenses and dissipations, for which
John Ballantyne and Co. had to pay. Nor was it very easy for a partner who himself drew bills
on the future--even though he were the well-spring of all the paying business the company had--to
be very severe on a fellow-partner who supplied his pecuniary needs in the same way. At all
events, there is no question that all through 1813 and 1814 Scott was kept in constant suspense
and fear of bankruptcy, by the ill-success of John Ballantyne and Co., and the utter want of
straightforwardness in John Ballantyne himself as to the bills out, and which had to be provided
against. It was the publication of Waverley, and the consequent opening up of the richest vein
not only in Scott's own genius, but in his popularity with the public, which alone ended these
alarms; and the many unsaleable works of John Ballantyne and Co. were then gradually disposed
of to Constable and others, to their own great loss, as part of the conditions on which they
received a share in the copyright of the wonderful novels which sold like wildfire. But though
in this way the publishing business of John Ballantyne and Co. was saved, and its affairs pretty
decently wound up, the printing firm remained saddled with some of their obligations; while
Constable's business, on which Scott depended for the means with which he was buying his estate,
building his castle, and settling money on his daughter-in-law, was seriously injured by the
purchase of all this unsaleable stock.

I do not think that any one who looks into the complicated controversy between the representatives
of the Ballantynes and Mr. Lockhart, concerning these matters, can be content with Mr. Lockhart's--no
doubt perfectly sincere--judgment on the case. It is obvious that amidst these intricate accounts,
he fell into one or two serious blunders--blunders very unjust to James Ballantyne. And without
pretending to have myself formed any minute judgment on the details, I think the following
points clear:--(1.) That James Ballantyne was very severely judged by Mr. Lockhart, on grounds
which were never alleged by Scott against him at all,--indeed on grounds on which he was expressly
exempted from all blame by Sir Walter. (2.) That Sir Walter Scott was very severely judged
by the representatives of the Ballantynes, on grounds on which James Ballantyne himself never
brought any charge against him; on the contrary, he declared that he had no charge to bring.
(3.) That both Scott and his partners invited ruin by freely spending gains which they only
expected to earn, and that in this Scott certainly set an example which he could hardly expect
feebler men not to follow. On the whole, I think the troubles with the Ballantyne brothers
brought to light not only that eager gambling spirit in him, which his grandfather indulged
with better success and more moderation when he bought the hunter with money destined for a
flock of sheep, and then gave up gambling for ever, but a tendency still more dangerous, and
in some respects involving an even greater moral defect,--I mean a tendency, chiefly due, I
think, to a very deep-seated pride,--to prefer inferior men as working colleagues in business.
And yet it is clear that if Scott were to dabble in publishing at all, he really needed the
check of men of larger experience, and less literary turn of mind. The great majority of consumers
of popular literature are not, and indeed will hardly ever be, literary men; and that is precisely
why a publisher who is not, in the main, literary,--who looks on authors' MSS. for the most
part with distrust and suspicion, much as a rich man looks at a begging-letter, or a sober
and judicious fish at an angler's fly,--is so much less likely to run aground than such a man
as Scott. The untried author should be regarded by a wise publisher as a natural enemy,--an
enemy indeed of a class, rare specimens whereof will always be his best friends, and who, therefore,
should not be needlessly affronted--but also as one of a class of whom nineteen out of every
twenty will dangle before the publisher's eyes wiles and hopes and expectations of the most
dangerous and illusory character,--which constitute indeed the very perils that it is his true
function in life skilfully to evade. The Ballantynes were quite unfit for this function; first,
they had not the experience requisite for it; next, they were altogether too much under Scott's
influence. No wonder that the partnership came to no good, and left behind it the germs of
calamity even more serious still.

CHAPTER X.

THE WAVERLEY NOVELS.

In the summer of 1814, Scott took up again and completed--almost at a single heat,--a fragment
of a Jacobite story, begun in 1805 and then laid aside. It was published anonymously, and its
astonishing success turned back again the scales of Scott's fortunes, already inclining ominously
towards a catastrophe. This story was Waverley. Mr. Carlyle has praised Waverley above its
fellows. "On the whole, contrasting Waverley, which was carefully written, with most of its
followers which were written extempore, one may regret the extempore method." This is, however,
a very unfortunate judgment. Not one of the whole series of novels appears to have been written
more completely extempore than the great bulk of Waverley, including almost everything that
made it either popular with the million or fascinating to the fastidious; and it is even likely
that this is one of the causes of its excellence.

"The last two volumes," says Scott, in a letter to Mr. Morritt, "were written in three weeks."
And here is Mr. Lockhart's description of the effect which Scott's incessant toil during the
composition, produced on a friend whose window happened to command the novelist's study:--

     "Happening to pass through Edinburgh in June, 1814, I dined
     one day with the gentleman in question (now the Honourable
     William Menzies, one of the Supreme Judges at the Cape of
     Good Hope), whose residence was then in George Street,
     situated very near to, and at right angles with, North
     Castle Street. It was a party of very young persons, most of
     them, like Menzies and myself, destined for the Bar of
     Scotland, all gay and thoughtless, enjoying the first flush
     of manhood, with little remembrance of the yesterday, or
     care of the morrow. When my companion's worthy father and
     uncle, after seeing two or three bottles go round, left the
     juveniles to themselves, the weather being hot, we adjourned
     to a library which had one large window looking northwards.
     After carousing here for an hour or more, I observed that a
     shade had come over the aspect of my friend, who happened to
     be placed immediately opposite to myself, and said something
     that intimated a fear of his being unwell. 'No,' said he, 'I
     shall be well enough presently, if you will only let me sit
     where you are, and take my chair; for there is a confounded
     hand in sight of me here, which has often bothered me
     before, and now it won't let me fill my glass with a good
     will.' I rose to change places with him accordingly, and he
     pointed out to me this hand, which, like the writing on
     Belshazzar's wall, disturbed his hour of hilarity. 'Since we
     sat down,' he said, 'I have been watching it--it fascinates
     my eye--it never stops--page after page is finished, and
     thrown on that heap of MS., and still it goes on unwearied;
     and so it will be till candles are brought in, and God knows
     how long after that. It is the same every night--I can't
     stand a sight of it when I am not at my books.' 'Some
     stupid, dogged engrossing clerk, probably,' exclaimed
     myself, 'or some other giddy youth in our society.' 'No,
     boys,' said our host; 'I well know what hand it is--'tis
     Walter Scott's.'"[32]

If that is not extempore writing, it is difficult to say what extempore writing is. But in
truth, there is no evidence that any one of the novels was laboured, or even so much as carefully
composed. Scott's method of composition was always the same; and, when writing an imaginative
work, the rate of progress seems to have been pretty even, depending much more on the absence
of disturbing engagements, than on any mental irregularity. The morning was always his brightest
time; but morning or evening, in country or in town, well or ill, writing with his own pen
or dictating to an amanuensis in the intervals of screaming-fits due to the torture of cramp
in the stomach, Scott spun away at his imaginative web almost as evenly as a silkworm spins
at its golden cocoon. Nor can I detect the slightest trace of any difference in quality between
the stories, such as can be reasonably ascribed to comparative care or haste. There are differences,
and even great differences, of course, ascribable to the less or greater suitability of the
subject chosen to Scott's genius, but I can find no trace of the sort of cause to which Mr.
Carlyle refers. Thus, few, I suppose, would hesitate to say that while Old Mortality is very
near, if not quite, the finest of Scott's works, The Black Dwarf is not far from the other
end of the scale. Yet the two were written in immediate succession (The Black Dwarf being the
first of the two), and were published together, as the first series of Tales of my Landlord,
in 1816. Nor do I think that any competent critic would find any clear deterioration of quality
in the novels of the later years,--excepting of course the two written after the stroke of
paralysis. It is true, of course, that some of the subjects which most powerfully stirred his
imagination were among his earlier themes, and that he could not effectually use the same subject
twice, though he now and then tried it. But making allowance for this consideration, the imaginative
power of the novels is as astonishingly even as the rate of composition itself. For my own
part, I greatly prefer The Fortunes of Nigel (which was written in 1822) to Waverley which
was begun in 1805, and finished in 1814, and though very many better critics would probably
decidedly disagree, I do not think that any of them would consider this preference grotesque
or purely capricious. Indeed, though Anne of Geierstein,--the last composed before Scott's
stroke,--would hardly seem to any careful judge the equal of Waverley, I do not much doubt
that if it had appeared in place of Waverley, it would have excited very nearly as much interest
and admiration; nor that had Waverley appeared in 1829, in place of Anne of Geierstein, it
would have failed to excite very much more. In these fourteen most effective years of Scott's
literary life, during which he wrote twenty-three novels besides shorter tales, the best stories
appear to have been on the whole the most rapidly written, probably because they took the strongest
hold of the author's imagination.

Till near the close of his career as an author, Scott never avowed his responsibility for any
of these series of novels, and even took some pains to mystify the public as to the identity
between the author of Waverley and the author of Tales of my Landlord. The care with which
the secret was kept is imputed by Mr. Lockhart in some degree to the habit of mystery which
had grown upon Scott during his secret partnership with the Ballantynes; but in this he seems
to be confounding two very different phases of Scott's character. No doubt he was, as a professional
man, a little ashamed of his commercial speculation, and unwilling to betray it. But he was
far from ashamed of his literary enterprise, though it seems that he was at first very anxious
lest a comparative failure, or even a mere moderate success, in a less ambitious sphere than
that of poetry, should endanger the great reputation he had gained as a poet. That was apparently
the first reason for secrecy. But, over and above this, it is clear that the mystery stimulated
Scott's imagination and saved him trouble as well. He was obviously more free under the veil--free
from the liability of having to answer for the views of life or history suggested in his stories;
but besides this, what was of more importance to him, the slight disguise stimulated his sense
of humour, and gratified the whimsical, boyish pleasure which he always had in acting an imaginary
character. He used to talk of himself as a sort of Abou Hassan--a private man one day, and
acting the part of a monarch the next--with the kind of glee which indicated a real delight
in the change of parts, and I have little doubt that he threw himself with the more gusto into
characters very different from his own, in consequence of the pleasure it gave him to conceive
his friends hopelessly misled by this display of traits, with which he supposed that they could
not have credited him even in imagination. Thus besides relieving him of a host of compliments
which he did not enjoy, and enabling him the better to evade an ill-bred curiosity, the disguise
no doubt was the same sort of fillip to the fancy which a mask and domino or a fancy dress
are to that of their wearers. Even in a disguise a man cannot cease to be himself; but he can
get rid of his improperly "imputed" righteousness--often the greatest burden he has to bear--and
of all the expectations formed on the strength, as Mr. Clough says,--

                    "Of having been what one has been,
    What one thinks one is, or thinks that others suppose one."

To some men the freedom of this disguise is a real danger and temptation. It never could have
been so to Scott, who was in the main one of the simplest as well as the boldest and proudest
of men. And as most men perhaps would admit that a good deal of even the best part of their
nature is rather suppressed than expressed by the name by which they are known in the world,
Scott must have felt this in a far higher degree, and probably regarded the manifold characters
under which he was known to society, as representing him in some respects more justly than
any individual name could have done. His mind ranged hither and thither over a wide field--far
beyond that of his actual experience,--and probably ranged over it all the more easily for
not being absolutely tethered to a single class of associations by any public confession of
his authorship. After all, when it became universally known that Scott was the only author
of all these tales, it may be doubted whether the public thought as adequately of the imaginative
efforts which had created them, as they did while they remained in some doubt whether there
was a multiplicity of agencies at work, or only one. The uncertainty helped them to realize
the many lives which were really led by the author of all these tales, more completely than
any confession of the individual authorship could have done. The shrinking of activity in public
curiosity and wonder which follows the final determination of such ambiguities, is very apt
to result rather in a dwindling of the imaginative effort to enter into the genius which gave
rise to them, than in an increase of respect for so manifold a creative power.

When Scott wrote, such fertility as his in the production of novels was regarded with amazement
approaching to absolute incredulity. Yet he was in this respect only the advanced-guard of
a not inconsiderable class of men and women who have a special gift for pouring out story after
story, containing a great variety of figures, while retaining a certain even level of merit.
There is more than one novelist of the present day who has far surpassed Scott in the number
of his tales, and one at least of very high repute, who has, I believe, produced more even
within the same time. But though to our larger experience, Scott's achievement, in respect
of mere fertility, is by no means the miracle which it once seemed, I do not think one of his
successors can compare with him for a moment in the ease and truth with which he painted, not
merely the life of his own time and country--seldom indeed that of precisely his own time--but
that of days long past, and often too of scenes far distant. The most powerful of all his stories,
Old Mortality, was the story of a period more than a century and a quarter before he wrote;
and others,--which though inferior to this in force, are nevertheless, when compared with the
so-called historical romances of any other English writer, what sunlight is to moonlight, if
you can say as much for the latter as to admit even that comparison,--go back to the period
of the Tudors, that is, two centuries and a half. Quentin Durward, which is all but amongst
the best, runs back farther still, far into the previous century, while Ivanhoe and The Talisman,
though not among the greatest of Scott's works, carry us back more than five hundred years.
The new class of extempore novel writers, though more considerable than, sixty years ago, any
one could have expected ever to see it, is still limited, and on any high level of merit will
probably always be limited, to the delineation of the times of which the narrator has personal
experience. Scott seemed to have had something very like personal experience of a few centuries
at least, judging by the ease and freshness with which he poured out his stories of these centuries,
and though no one can pretend that even he could describe the period of the Tudors as Miss
Austen described the country parsons and squires of George the Third's reign, or as Mr. Trollope
describes the politicians and hunting-men of Queen Victoria's, it is nevertheless the evidence
of a greater imagination to make us live so familiarly as Scott does amidst the political and
religious controversies of two or three centuries' duration, to be the actual witnesses, as
it were, of Margaret of Anjou's throes of vain ambition, and Mary Stuart's fascinating remorse,
and Elizabeth's domineering and jealous balancings of noble against noble, of James the First's
shrewd pedantries, and the Regent Murray's large forethought, of the politic craft of Argyle,
the courtly ruthlessness of Claverhouse, and the high-bred clemency of Monmouth, than to reflect
in countless modifications the freaks, figures, and fashions of our own time.

The most striking feature of Scott's romances is that, for the most part, they are pivoted
on public rather than mere private interests and passions. With but few exceptions--(The Antiquary,
St. Ronan's Well, and Guy Mannering are the most important)--Scott's novels give us an imaginative
view, not of mere individuals, but of individuals as they are affected by the public strifes
and social divisions of the age. And this it is which gives his books so large an interest
for old and young, soldiers and statesmen, the world of society and the recluse, alike. You
can hardly read any novel of Scott's and not become better aware what public life and political
issues mean. And yet there is no artificiality, no elaborate attitudinizing before the antique
mirrors of the past, like Bulwer's, no dressing out of clothes-horses like G. P. R. James.
The boldness and freshness of the present are carried back into the past, and you see Papists
and Puritans, Cavaliers and Roundheads, Jews, Jacobites, and freebooters, preachers, schoolmasters,
mercenary soldiers, gipsies, and beggars, all living the sort of life which the reader feels
that in their circumstances and under the same conditions of time and place and parentage,
he might have lived too. Indeed, no man can read Scott without being more of a public man,
whereas the ordinary novel tends to make its readers rather less of one than before.

Next, though most of these stories are rightly called romances, no one can avoid observing
that they give that side of life which is unromantic, quite as vigorously as the romantic side.
This was not true of Scott's poems, which only expressed one-half of his nature, and were almost
pure romances. But in the novels the business of life is even better portrayed than its sentiments.
Mr. Bagehot, one of the ablest of Scott's critics, has pointed out this admirably in his essay
on The Waverley Novels. "Many historical novelists," he says, "especially those who with care
and pains have read up the detail, are often evidently in a strait how to pass from their history
to their sentiment. The fancy of Sir Walter could not help connecting the two. If he had given
us the English side of the race to Derby, he would have described the Bank of England paying
in sixpences, and also the loves of the cashier." No one who knows the novels well can question
this. Fergus MacIvor's ways and means, his careful arrangements for receiving subsidies in
black mail, are as carefully recorded as his lavish highland hospitalities; and when he sends
his silver cup to the Gaelic bard who chaunts his greatness, the faithful historian does not
forget to let us know that the cup is his last, and that he is hard-pressed for the generosities
of the future. So too the habitual thievishness of the highlanders is pressed upon us quite
as vividly as their gallantry and superstitions. And so careful is Sir Walter to paint the
petty pedantries of the Scotch traditional conservatism, that he will not spare even Charles
Edward--of whom he draws so graceful a picture--the humiliation of submitting to old Bradwardine's
"solemn act of homage," but makes him go through the absurd ceremony of placing his foot on
a cushion to have its brogue unlatched by the dry old enthusiast of heraldic lore. Indeed it
was because Scott so much enjoyed the contrast between the high sentiment of life and its dry
and often absurd detail, that his imagination found so much freer a vent in the historical
romance, than it ever found in the romantic poem. Yet he clearly needed the romantic excitement
of picturesque scenes and historical interests, too. I do not think he would ever have gained
any brilliant success in the narrower region of the domestic novel. Indeed he tried it to some
extent in St. Ronan's Well, and so far as he tried it, I think he failed. Scott needed a certain
largeness of type, a strongly-marked class-life, and, where it was possible, a free, out-of-doors
life, for his delineations. No one could paint beggars and gipsies, and wandering fiddlers,
and mercenary soldiers, and peasants and farmers and lawyers, and magistrates, and preachers,
and courtiers, and statesmen, and best of all perhaps queens and kings, with anything like
his ability. But when it came to describing the small differences of manner, differences not
due to external habits, so much as to internal sentiment or education, or mere domestic circumstance,
he was beyond his proper field. In the sketch of the St. Ronan's Spa and the company at the
table-d'hôte, he is of course somewhere near the mark,--he was too able a man to fall far short
of success in anything he really gave to the world; but it is not interesting. Miss Austen
would have made Lady Penelope Penfeather a hundred times as amusing. We turn to Meg Dods and
Touchwood, and Cargill, and Captain Jekyl, and Sir Bingo Binks, and to Clara Mowbray,--i. e.
to the lives really moulded by large and specific causes, for enjoyment, and leave the small
gossip of the company at the Wells as, relatively at least, a failure. And it is well for all
the world that it was so. The domestic novel, when really of the highest kind, is no doubt
a perfect work of art, and an unfailing source of amusement; but it has nothing of the tonic
influence, the large instructiveness, the stimulating intellectual air, of Scott's historic
tales. Even when Scott is farthest from reality--as in Ivanhoe or The Monastery--he makes you
open your eyes to all sorts of historical conditions to which you would otherwise be blind.
The domestic novel, even when its art is perfect, gives little but pleasure at the best; at
the worst it is simply scandal idealized.

Scott often confessed his contempt for his own heroes. He said of Edward Waverley, for instance,
that he was "a sneaking piece of imbecility," and that "if he had married Flora, she would
have set him up upon the chimney-piece as Count Borowlaski's wife used to do with him. I am
a bad hand at depicting a hero, properly so called, and have an unfortunate propensity for
the dubious characters of borderers, buccaneers, highland robbers, and all others of a Robin-Hood
description."[33] In another letter he says, "My rogue always, in despite of me, turns out
my hero."[34] And it seems very likely that in most of the situations Scott describes so well,
his own course would have been that of his wilder impulses, and not that of his reason. Assuredly
he would never have stopped hesitating on the line between opposite courses as his Waverleys,
his Mortons, his Osbaldistones do. Whenever he was really involved in a party strife, he flung
prudence and impartiality to the winds, and went in like the hearty partisan which his strong
impulses made of him. But granting this, I do not agree with his condemnation of all his own
colourless heroes. However much they differed in nature from Scott himself, the even balance
of their reason against their sympathies is certainly well conceived, is in itself natural,
and is an admirable expedient for effecting that which was probably its real use to Scott,--the
affording an opportunity for the delineation of all the pros and cons of the case, so that
the characters on both sides of the struggle should be properly understood. Scott's imagination
was clearly far wider--was far more permeated with the fixed air of sound judgment--than his
practical impulses. He needed a machinery for displaying his insight into both sides of a public
quarrel, and his colourless heroes gave him the instrument he needed. Both in Morton's case
(in Old Mortality), and in Waverley's, the hesitation is certainly well described. Indeed in
relation to the controversy between Covenanters and Royalists, while his political and martial
prepossessions went with Claverhouse, his reason and educated moral feeling certainly were
clearly identified with Morton.

It is, however, obviously true that Scott's heroes are mostly created for the sake of the facility
they give in delineating the other characters, and not the other characters for the sake of
the heroes. They are the imaginative neutral ground, as it were, on which opposing influences
are brought to play; and what Scott best loved to paint was those who, whether by nature, by
inheritance, or by choice, had become unique and characteristic types of one-sided feeling,
not those who were merely in process of growth, and had not ranged themselves at all. Mr. Carlyle,
who, as I have said before, places Scott's romances far below their real level, maintains that
these great types of his are drawn from the outside, and not made actually to live. "His Bailie
Jarvies, Dinmonts, Dalgettys (for their name is legion), do look and talk like what they give
themselves out for; they are, if not created and made poetically alive, yet deceptively enacted
as a good player might do them. What more is wanted, then? For the reader lying on a sofa,
nothing more; yet for another sort of reader much. It were a long chapter to unfold the difference
in drawing a character between a Scott and a Shakespeare or Goethe. Yet it is a difference
literally immense; they are of a different species; the value of the one is not to be counted
in the coin of the other. We might say in a short word, which covers a long matter, that your
Shakespeare fashions his characters from the heart outwards; your Scott fashions them from
the skin inwards, never getting near the heart of them. The one set become living men and women;
the other amount to little more than mechanical cases, deceptively painted automatons."[35]
And then he goes on to contrast Fenella in Peveril of the Peak with Goethe's Mignon. Mr. Carlyle
could hardly have chosen a less fair comparison. If Goethe is to be judged by his women, let
Scott be judged by his men. So judged, I think Scott will, as a painter of character--of course,
I am not now speaking of him as a poet,--come out far above Goethe. Excepting the hero of his
first drama (Götz of the iron hand), which by the way was so much in Scott's line that his
first essay in poetry was to translate it--not very well--I doubt if Goethe was ever successful
with his pictures of men. Wilhelm Meister is, as Niebuhr truly said, "a ménagerie of tame animals."
Doubtless Goethe's women--certainly his women of culture--are more truly and inwardly conceived
and created than Scott's. Except Jeanie Deans and Madge Wildfire, and perhaps Lucy Ashton,
Scott's women are apt to be uninteresting, either pink and white toys, or hardish women of
the world. But then no one can compare the men of the two writers, and not see Scott's vast
pre-eminence on that side.

I think the deficiency of his pictures of women, odd as it seems to say so, should be greatly
attributed to his natural chivalry. His conception of women of his own or a higher class was
always too romantic. He hardly ventured, as it were, in his tenderness for them, to look deeply
into their little weaknesses and intricacies of character. With women of an inferior class,
he had not this feeling. Nothing can be more perfect than the manner in which he blends the
dairy-woman and woman of business in Jeanie Deans, with the lover and the sister. But once
make a woman beautiful, or in any way an object of homage to him, and Scott bowed so low before
the image of her, that he could not go deep into her heart. He could no more have analysed
such a woman, as Thackeray analyzed Lady Castlewood, or Amelia, or Becky, or as George Eliot
analysed Rosamond Vincy, than he could have vivisected Camp or Maida. To some extent, therefore,
Scott's pictures of women remain something in the style of the miniatures of the last age--bright
and beautiful beings without any special character in them. He was dazzled by a fair heroine.
He could not take them up into his imagination as real beings as he did men. But then how living
are his men, whether coarse or noble! What a picture, for instance, is that in A Legend of
Montrose of the conceited, pragmatic, but prompt and dauntless soldier of fortune, rejecting
Argyle's attempts to tamper with him, in the dungeon at Inverary, suddenly throwing himself
on the disguised Duke so soon as he detects him by his voice, and wresting from him the means
of his own liberation! Who could read that scene and say for a moment that Dalgetty is painted
"from the skin inwards"? It was just Scott himself breathing his own life through the habits
of a good specimen of the mercenary soldier--realizing where the spirit of hire would end,
and the sense of honour would begin--and preferring, even in a dungeon, the audacious policy
of a sudden attack to that of crafty negotiation. Or, to take a third instance, as different
as possible from either, how powerfully conceived is the situation in Old Mortality, where
Balfour of Burley, in his fanatic fury at the defeat of his plan for a new rebellion, pushes
the oak-tree, which connects his wild retreat with the outer world, into the stream, and tries
to slay Morton for opposing him. In such scenes and a hundred others--for these are mere random
examples--Scott undoubtedly painted his masculine figures from as deep and inward a conception
of the character of the situation as Goethe ever attained, even in drawing Mignon, or Klärchen,
or Gretchen. The distinction has no real existence. Goethe's pictures of women were no doubt
the intuitions of genius; and so are Scott's of men--and here and there of his women too. Professional
women he can always paint with power. Meg Dods, the innkeeper, Meg Merrilies, the gipsy, Mause
Headrigg, the Covenanter, Elspeth, the old fishwife in The Antiquary, and the old crones employed
to nurse and watch, and lay out the corpse, in The Bride of Lammermoor, are all in their way
impressive figures.

And even in relation to women of a rank more fascinating to Scott, and whose inner character
was perhaps on that account, less familiar to his imagination, grant him but a few hints from
history, and he draws a picture which, for vividness and brilliancy, may almost compare with
Shakespeare's own studies in English history. Had Shakespeare painted the scene in The Abbot,
in which Mary Stuart commands one of her Mary's in waiting to tell her at what bridal she last
danced, and Mary Fleming blurts out the reference to the marriage of Sebastian at Holyrood,
would any one hesitate to regard it as a stroke of genius worthy of the great dramatist? This
picture of the Queen's mind suddenly thrown off its balance, and betraying, in the agony of
the moment, the fear and remorse which every association with Darnley conjured up, is painted
"from the heart outwards," not "from the skin inwards," if ever there were such a painting
in the world. Scott hardly ever failed in painting kings or peasants, queens or peasant-women.
There was something in the well-marked type of both to catch his imagination, which can always
hit off the grander features of royalty, and the homelier features of laborious humility. Is
there any sketch traced in lines of more sweeping grandeur and more impressive force than the
following of Mary Stuart's lucid interval of remorse--lucid compared with her ordinary mood,
though it was of a remorse that was almost delirious--which breaks in upon her hour of fascinating
condescension?--

     "'Are they not a lovely couple, my Fleming? and is it not
     heart-rending to think that I must be their ruin?'

     "'Not so,' said Roland Græme, 'it is we, gracious sovereign,
     who will be your deliverers.' 'Ex oribus parvulorum!' said
     the queen, looking upward; 'if it is by the mouth of these
     children that heaven calls me to resume the stately thoughts
     which become my birth and my rights, thou wilt grant them
     thy protection, and to me the power of rewarding their
     zeal.' Then turning to Fleming, she instantly added, 'Thou
     knowest, my friend, whether to make those who have served me
     happy, was not ever Mary's favourite pastime. When I have
     been rebuked by the stern preachers of the Calvinistic
     heresy--when I have seen the fierce countenances of my
     nobles averted from me, has it not been because I mixed in
     the harmless pleasures of the young and gay, and rather for
     the sake of their happiness than my own, have mingled in the
     masque, the song or the dance, with the youth of my
     household? Well, I repent not of it--though Knox termed it
     sin, and Morton degradation--I was happy because I saw
     happiness around me: and woe betide the wretched jealousy
     that can extract guilt out of the overflowings of an
     unguarded gaiety!--Fleming, if we are restored to our
     throne, shall we not have one blithesome day at a blithesome
     bridal, of which we must now name neither the bride nor the
     bridegroom? But that bridegroom shall have the barony of
     Blairgowrie, a fair gift even for a queen to give, and that
     bride's chaplet shall be twined with the fairest pearls that
     ever were found in the depths of Lochlomond; and thou
     thyself, Mary Fleming, the best dresser of tires that ever
     busked the tresses of a queen, and who would scorn to touch
     those of any woman of lower rank--thou thyself shalt for my
     love twine them into the bride's tresses.--Look, my Fleming,
     suppose then such clustered locks as these of our Catherine,
     they would not put shame upon thy skill.' So saying she
     passed her hand fondly over the head of her youthful
     favourite, while her more aged attendant replied
     despondently, 'Alas, madam, your thoughts stray far from
     home.' 'They do, my Fleming,' said the queen, 'but is it
     well or kind in you to call them back?--God knows they have
     kept the perch this night but too closely.--Come, I will
     recall the gay vision, were it but to punish them. Yes, at
     that blithesome bridal, Mary herself shall forget the weight
     of sorrows, and the toil of state, and herself once more
     lead a measure.--At whose wedding was it that we last
     danced, my Fleming? I think care has troubled my memory--yet
     something of it I should remember, canst thou not aid me? I
     know thou canst.' 'Alas, madam,' replied the lady. 'What,'
     said Mary, 'wilt thou not help us so far? this is a peevish
     adherence to thine own graver opinion which holds our talk
     as folly. But thou art court-bred and wilt well understand
     me when I say the queen commands Lady Fleming to tell her
     when she led the last branle.' With a face deadly pale and
     a mien as if she were about to sink into the earth, the
     court-bred dame, no longer daring to refuse obedience,
     faltered out, 'Gracious lady--if my memory err not--it was
     at a masque in Holyrood--at the marriage of Sebastian.' The
     unhappy queen, who had hitherto listened with a melancholy
     smile, provoked by the reluctance with which the Lady
     Fleming brought out her story, at this ill-fated word
     interrupted her with a shriek so wild and loud that the
     vaulted apartment rang, and both Roland and Catherine sprung
     to their feet in the utmost terror and alarm. Meantime, Mary
     seemed, by the train of horrible ideas thus suddenly
     excited, surprised not only beyond self-command, but for the
     moment beyond the verge of reason. 'Traitress,' she said to
     the Lady Fleming, 'thou wouldst slay thy sovereign. Call my
     French guards--à moi! à moi! mes Français!--I am beset
     with traitors in mine own palace--they have murdered my
     husband--Rescue! Rescue! for the Queen of Scotland!' She
     started up from her chair--her features late so exquisitely
     lovely in their paleness, now inflamed with the fury of
     frenzy, and resembling those of a Bellona. 'We will take the
     field ourself,' she said; 'warn the city--warn Lothian and
     Fife--saddle our Spanish barb, and bid French Paris see our
     petronel be charged. Better to die at the head of our brave
     Scotsmen, like our grandfather at Flodden, than of a broken
     heart like our ill-starred father.' 'Be patient--be
     composed, dearest sovereign,' said Catherine; and then
     addressing Lady Fleming angrily, she added, 'How could you
     say aught that reminded her of her husband?' The word
     reached the ear of the unhappy princess who caught it up,
     speaking with great rapidity, 'Husband!--what husband? Not
     his most Christian Majesty--he is ill at ease--he cannot
     mount on horseback--not him of the Lennox--but it was the
     Duke of Orkney thou wouldst say?' 'For God's love, madam, be
     patient!' said the Lady Fleming. But the queen's excited
     imagination could by no entreaty be diverted from its
     course. 'Bid him come hither to our aid,' she said, 'and
     bring with him his lambs, as he calls them--Bowton, Hay of
     Talla, Black Ormiston and his kinsman Hob--Fie, how swart
     they are, and how they smell of sulphur! What! closeted with
     Morton? Nay, if the Douglas and the Hepburn hatch the
     complot together, the bird when it breaks the shell will
     scare Scotland, will it not, my Fleming?' 'She grows wilder
     and wilder,' said Fleming. 'We have too many hearers for
     these strange words.' 'Roland,' said Catherine, 'in the name
     of God begone!--you cannot aid us here--leave us to deal
     with her alone--away--away!"

And equally fine is the scene in Kenilworth in which Elizabeth undertakes the reconciliation
of the haughty rivals, Sussex and Leicester, unaware that in the course of the audience she
herself will have to bear a great strain on her self-command, both in her feelings as a queen
and her feelings as a lover. Her grand rebukes to both, her ill-concealed preference for Leicester,
her whispered ridicule of Sussex, the impulses of tenderness which she stifles, the flashes
of resentment to which she gives way, the triumph of policy over private feeling, her imperious
impatience when she is baffled, her jealousy as she grows suspicious of a personal rival, her
gratified pride and vanity when the suspicion is exchanged for the clear evidence, as she supposes,
of Leicester's love, and her peremptory conclusion of the audience, bring before the mind a
series of pictures far more vivid and impressive than the greatest of historical painters could
fix on canvas, even at the cost of the labour of years. Even more brilliant, though not so
sustained and difficult an effort of genius, is the later scene in the same story, in which
Elizabeth drags the unhappy Countess of Leicester from her concealment in one of the grottoes
of Kenilworth Castle, and strides off with her, in a fit of vindictive humiliation and Amazonian
fury, to confront her with her husband. But this last scene no doubt is more in Scott's way.
He can always paint women in their more masculine moods. Where he frequently fails is in the
attempt to indicate the finer shades of women's nature. In Amy Robsart herself, for example,
he is by no means generally successful, though in an early scene her childish delight in the
various orders and decorations of her husband is painted with much freshness and delicacy.
But wherever, as in the case of queens, Scott can get a telling hint from actual history, he
can always so use it as to make history itself seem dim to the equivalent for it which he gives us.

And yet, as every one knows, Scott was excessively free in his manipulations of history for
the purposes of romance. In Kenilworth he represents Shakespeare's plays as already in the
mouths of courtiers and statesmen, though he lays the scene in the eighteenth year of Elizabeth,
when Shakespeare was hardly old enough to rob an orchard. In Woodstock, on the contrary, he
insists, if you compare Sir Henry Lee's dates with the facts, that Shakespeare died twenty
years at least before he actually died. The historical basis, again, of Woodstock and of Redgauntlet
is thoroughly untrustworthy, and about all the minuter details of history,--unless so far as
they were characteristic of the age,--I do not suppose that Scott in his romances ever troubled
himself at all. And yet few historians--not even Scott himself when he exchanged romance for
history--ever drew the great figures of history with so powerful a hand. In writing history
and biography Scott has little or no advantage over very inferior men. His pictures of Swift,
of Dryden, of Napoleon, are in no way very vivid. It is only where he is working from the pure
imagination,--though imagination stirred by historic study,--that he paints a picture which
follows us about, as if with living eyes, instead of creating for us a mere series of lines
and colours. Indeed, whether Scott draws truly or falsely, he draws with such genius that his
pictures of Richard and Saladin, of Louis XI. and Charles the Bold, of Margaret of Anjou and
René of Provence, of Mary Stuart and Elizabeth Tudor, of Sussex and of Leicester, of James
and Charles and Buckingham, of the two Dukes of Argyle--the Argyle of the time of the revolution,
and the Argyle of George II., of Queen Caroline, of Claverhouse, and Monmouth, and of Rob Roy,
will live in English literature beside Shakespeare's pictures--probably less faithful if more
imaginative--of John and Richard and the later Henries, and all the great figures by whom they
were surrounded. No historical portrait that we possess will take precedence--as a mere portrait--of
Scott's brilliant study of James I. in The Fortunes of Nigel. Take this illustration for instance,
where George Heriot the goldsmith (Jingling Geordie, as the king familiarly calls him) has
just been speaking of Lord Huntinglen, as "a man of the old rough world that will drink and
swear:"--

     "'O Geordie!' exclaimed the king, 'these are auld-warld
     frailties, of whilk we dare not pronounce even ourselves
     absolutely free. But the warld grows worse from day to day,
     Geordie. The juveniles of this age may weel say with the
     poet,--

         "Ætas parentum pejor avis tulit
          Nos nequiores--"

     This Dalgarno does not drink so much; aye or swear so much,
     as his father, but he wenches, Geordie, and he breaks his
     word and oath baith. As to what ye say of the leddy and the
     ministers, we are all fallible creatures, Geordie, priests
     and kings as weel as others; and wha kens but what that may
     account for the difference between this Dalgarno and his
     father? The earl is the vera soul of honour, and cares nae
     mair for warld's gear than a noble hound for the quest of a
     foulmart; but as for his son, he was like to brazen us all
     out--ourselves, Steenie, Baby Charles, and our Council, till
     he heard of the tocher, and then by my kingly crown he lap
     like a cock at a grossart! These are discrepancies betwixt
     parent and son not to be accounted for naturally, according
     to Baptista Porta, Michael Scott de secretis, and others.
     Ah, Jingling Geordie, if your clouting the caldron, and
     jingling on pots, pans, and veshels of all manner of metal,
     hadna jingled a' your grammar out of your head, I could have
     touched on that matter to you at mair length.' ... Heriot
     inquired whether Lord Dalgarno had consented to do the Lady
     Hermione justice. 'Troth, man, I have small doubt that he
     will,' quoth the king, 'I gave him the schedule of her
     worldly substance, which you delivered to us in the council,
     and we allowed him half an hour to chew the cud upon that.
     It is rare reading for bringing him to reason. I left Baby
     Charles and Steenie laying his duty before him, and if he
     can resist doing what they desire him, why I wish he would
     teach me the gate of it. O Geordie, Jingling Geordie, it
     was grand to hear Baby Charles laying down the guilt of
     dissimulation, and Steenie lecturing on the turpitude of
     incontinence.' 'I am afraid,' said George Heriot, more
     hastily than prudently, 'I might have thought of the old
     proverb of Satan reproving sin.' 'Deil hae our saul,
     neighbour,' said the king, reddening, 'but ye are not blate!
     I gie ye licence to speak freely, and by our saul, ye do not
     let the privilege become lost, non utendo--it will suffer
     no negative prescription in your hands. Is it fit, think ye,
     that Baby Charles should let his thoughts be publicly seen?
     No, no, princes' thoughts are arcana imperii: qui nescit
     dissimulare, nescit regnare. Every liege subject is bound
     to speak the whole truth to the king, but there is nae
     reciprocity of obligation--and for Steenie having been
     whiles a dike-louper at a time, is it for you, who are his
     goldsmith, and to whom, I doubt, he awes an uncomatable sum,
     to cast that up to him?"

Assuredly there is no undue favouring of Stuarts in such a picture as that.

Scott's humour is, I think, of very different qualities in relation to different subjects.
Certainly he was at times capable of considerable heaviness of hand,--of the Scotch "wut" which
has been so irreverently treated by English critics. His rather elaborate jocular introductions,
under the name of Jedediah Cleishbotham, are clearly laborious at times. And even his own letters
to his daughter-in-law, which Mr. Lockhart seems to regard as models of tender playfulness
and pleasantry, seem to me decidedly elephantine. Not unfrequently, too, his stereotyped jokes
weary. Dalgetty bores you almost as much as he would do in real life,--which is a great fault
in art. Bradwardine becomes a nuisance, and as for Sir Piercie Shafton, he is beyond endurance.
Like some other Scotchmen of genius, Scott twanged away at any effective chord till it more
than lost its expressiveness. But in dry humour, and in that higher humour which skilfully
blends the ludicrous and the pathetic, so that it is hardly possible to separate between smiles
and tears, Scott is a master. His canny innkeeper, who, having sent away all the peasemeal
to the camp of the Covenanters, and all the oatmeal (with deep professions of duty) to the
castle and its cavaliers, in compliance with the requisitions sent to him on each side, admits
with a sigh to his daughter that "they maun gar wheat flour serve themsels for a blink,"--his
firm of solicitors, Greenhorn and Grinderson, whose senior partner writes respectfully to clients
in prosperity, and whose junior partner writes familiarly to those in adversity,--his arbitrary
nabob who asks how the devil any one should be able to mix spices so well "as one who has been
where they grow;"--his little ragamuffin who indignantly denies that he has broken his promise
not to gamble away his sixpences at pitch-and-toss because he has gambled them away at "neevie-neevie-nick-nack,"--and
similar figures abound in his tales,--are all creations which make one laugh inwardly as we
read. But he has a much higher humour still, that inimitable power of shading off ignorance
into knowledge and simplicity into wisdom, which makes his picture of Jeanie Deans, for instance,
so humorous as well as so affecting. When Jeanie reunites her father to her husband by reminding
the former how it would sometimes happen that "twa precious saints might pu' sundrywise like
twa cows riving at the same hayband," she gives us an admirable instance of Scott's higher
humour. Or take Jeanie Deans's letter to her father communicating to him the pardon of his
daughter and her own interview with the Queen:--

     "DEAREST AND TRULY HONOURED FATHER.--This comes
     with my duty to inform you, that it has pleased God to
     redeem that captivitie of my poor sister, in respect the
     Queen's blessed Majesty, for whom we are ever bound to pray,
     hath redeemed her soul from the slayer, granting the ransom
     of her, whilk is ane pardon or reprieve. And I spoke with
     the Queen face to face, and yet live; for she is not muckle
     differing from other grand leddies, saving that she has a
     stately presence, and een like a blue huntin' hawk's, whilk
     gaed throu' and throu' me like a Highland durk--And all this
     good was, alway under the Great Giver, to whom all are but
     instruments, wrought for us by the Duk of Argile, wha is ane
     native true-hearted Scotsman, and not pridefu', like other
     folk we ken of--and likewise skeely enow in bestial, whereof
     he has promised to gie me twa Devonshire kye, of which he is
     enamoured, although I do still haud by the real hawkit
     Airshire breed--and I have promised him a cheese; and I wad
     wuss ye, if Gowans, the brockit cow, has a quey, that she
     suld suck her fill of milk, as I am given to understand he
     has none of that breed, and is not scornfu' but will take a
     thing frae a puir body, that it may lighten their heart of
     the loading of debt that they awe him. Also his honour the
     Duke will accept ane of our Dunlop cheeses, and it sall be
     my faut if a better was ever yearned in Lowden."--[Here
     follow some observations respecting the breed of cattle, and
     the produce of the dairy, which it is our intention to
     forward to the Board of Agriculture.]--"Nevertheless, these
     are but matters of the after-harvest, in respect of the
     great good which Providence hath gifted us with--and, in
     especial, poor Effie's life. And oh, my dear father, since
     it hath pleased God to be merciful to her, let her not want
     your free pardon, whilk will make her meet to be ane vessel
     of grace, and also a comfort to your ain graie hairs. Dear
     Father, will ye let the Laird ken that we have had friends
     strangely raised up to us, and that the talent whilk he lent
     me will be thankfully repaid. I hae some of it to the fore;
     and the rest of it is not knotted up in ane purse or napkin,
     but in ane wee bit paper, as is the fashion heir, whilk I am
     assured is gude for the siller. And, dear father, through
     Mr. Butler's means I hae gude friendship with the Duke, for
     there had been kindness between their forbears in the auld
     troublesome time byepast. And Mrs. Glass has been kind like
     my very mother. She has a braw house here, and lives bien
     and warm, wi' twa servant lasses, and a man and a callant in
     the shop. And she is to send you doun a pound of her
     hie-dried, and some other tobaka, and we maun think of some
     propine for her, since her kindness hath been great. And the
     Duk is to send the pardon doun by an express messenger, in
     respect that I canna travel sae fast; and I am to come doun
     wi' twa of his Honour's servants--that is, John Archibald, a
     decent elderly gentleman, that says he has seen you lang
     syne, when ye were buying beasts in the west frae the Laird
     of Aughtermuggitie--but maybe ye winna mind him--ony way,
     he's a civil man--and Mrs. Dolly Dutton, that is to be
     dairy-maid at Inverara: and they bring me on as far as
     Glasgo', whilk will make it nae pinch to win hame, whilk I
     desire of all things. May the Giver of all good things keep
     ye in your outgauns and incomings, whereof devoutly prayeth
     your loving dauter,

     "JEAN DEANS."

This contains an example of Scott's rather heavy jocularity as well as giving us a fine illustration
of his highest and deepest and sunniest humour. Coming where it does, the joke inserted about
the Board of Agriculture is rather like the gambol of a rhinoceros trying to imitate the curvettings
of a thoroughbred horse.

Some of the finest touches of his humour are no doubt much heightened by his perfect command
of the genius as well as the dialect of a peasantry, in whom a true culture of mind and sometimes
also of heart is found in the closest possible contact with the humblest pursuits and the quaintest
enthusiasm for them. But Scott, with all his turn for irony--and Mr. Lockhart says that even
on his death-bed he used towards his children the same sort of good-humoured irony to which
he had always accustomed them in his life--certainly never gives us any example of that highest
irony which is found so frequently in Shakespeare, which touches the paradoxes of the spiritual
life of the children of earth, and which reached its highest point in Isaiah. Now and then
in his latest diaries--the diaries written in his deep affliction--he comes near the edge of
it. Once, for instance, he says, "What a strange scene if the surge of conversation could suddenly
ebb like the tide, and show us the state of people's real minds!

    'No eyes the rocks discover
    Which lurk beneath the deep.'

Life could not be endured were it seen in reality." But this is not irony, only the sort of
meditation which, in a mind inclined to thrust deep into the secrets of life's paradoxes, is
apt to lead to irony. Scott, however, does not thrust deep in this direction. He met the cold
steel which inflicts the deepest interior wounds, like a soldier, and never seems to have meditated
on the higher paradoxes of life till reason reeled. The irony of Hamlet is far from Scott.
His imagination was essentially one of distinct embodiment. He never even seemed so much as
to contemplate that sundering of substance and form, that rending away of outward garments,
that unclothing of the soul, in order that it might be more effectually clothed upon, which
is at the heart of anything that may be called spiritual irony. The constant abiding of his
mind within the well-defined forms of some one or other of the conditions of outward life and
manners, among the scores of different spheres of human habit, was, no doubt, one of the secrets
of his genius; but it was also its greatest limitation.

CHAPTER XI.

MORALITY AND RELIGION.

The very same causes which limited Scott's humour and irony to the commoner fields of experience,
and prevented him from ever introducing into his stories characters of the highest type of
moral thoughtfulness, gave to his own morality and religion, which were, I think, true to the
core so far as they went, a shade of distinct conventionality. It is no doubt quite true, as
he himself tells us, that he took more interest in his mercenaries and moss-troopers, outlaws,
gipsies, and beggars, than he did in the fine ladies and gentlemen under a cloud whom he adopted
as heroines and heroes. But that was the very sign of his conventionalism. Though he interested
himself more in these irregular persons, he hardly ever ventured to paint their inner life
so as to show how little there was to choose between the sins of those who are at war with
society and the sins of those who bend to the yoke of society. He widened rather than narrowed
the chasm between the outlaw and the respectable citizen, even while he did not disguise his
own romantic interest in the former. He extenuated, no doubt, the sins of all brave and violent
defiers of the law, as distinguished from the sins of crafty and cunning abusers of the law.
But the leaning he had to the former was, as he was willing to admit, what he regarded as a
"naughty" leaning. He did not attempt for a moment to balance accounts between them and society.
He paid his tribute as a matter of course to the established morality, and only put in a word
or two by way of attempt to diminish the severity of the sentence on the bold transgressor.
And then, where what is called the "law of honour" comes in to traverse the law of religion,
he had no scruple in setting aside the latter in favour of the customs of gentlemen, without
any attempt to justify that course. Yet it is evident from various passages in his writings
that he held Christian duty inconsistent with duelling, and that he held himself a sincere
Christian. In spite of this, when he was fifty-six, and under no conceivable hurry or perturbation
of feeling, but only concerned to defend his own conduct--which was indeed plainly right--as
to a political disclosure which he had made in his life of Napoleon, he asked his old friend
William Clerk to be his second, if the expected challenge from General Gourgaud should come,
and declared his firm intention of accepting it. On the strength of official evidence he had
exposed some conduct of General Gourgaud's at St. Helena, which appeared to be far from honourable,
and he thought it his duty on that account to submit to be shot at by General Gourgaud, if
General Gourgaud had wished it. In writing to William Clerk to ask him to be his second, he
says, "Like a man who finds himself in a scrape, General Gourgaud may wish to fight himself
out of it, and if the quarrel should be thrust on me, why, I will not baulk him, Jackie. He
shall not dishonour the country through my sides, I can assure him." In other words, Scott
acted just as he had made Waverley and others of his heroes act, on a code of honour which
he knew to be false, and he must have felt in this case to be something worse. He thought himself
at that time under the most stringent obligations both to his creditors and his children, to
do all in his power to redeem himself and his estate from debt. Nay, more, he held that his
life was a trust from his Creator, which he had no right to throw away merely because a man
whom he had not really injured, was indulging a strong wish to injure him; but he could so
little brook the imputation of physical cowardice, that he was moral coward enough to resolve
to meet General Gourgaud, if General Gourgaud lusted after a shot at him. Nor is there any
trace preserved of so much as a moral scruple in his own mind on the subject, and this though
there are clear traces in his other writings as to what he thought Christian morality required.
But the Border chivalry was so strong in Scott that, on subjects of this kind at least, his
morality was the conventional morality of a day rapidly passing away.

He showed the same conventional feeling in his severity towards one of his own brothers who
had been guilty of cowardice. Daniel Scott was the black sheep of the family. He got into difficulties
in business, formed a bad connexion with an artful woman, and was sent to try his fortunes
in the West Indies. There he was employed in some service against a body of refractory negroes--we
do not know its exact nature--and apparently showed the white feather. Mr. Lockhart says that
"he returned to Scotland a dishonoured man; and though he found shelter and compassion from
his mother, his brother would never see him again. Nay, when, soon after, his health, shattered
by dissolute indulgence, ... gave way altogether, and he died, as yet a young man, the poet
refused either to attend his funeral or to wear mourning for him, like the rest of his family."[36]
Indeed he always spoke of him as his "relative," not as his brother. Here again Scott's severity
was due to his brother's failure as a "man of honour," i. e. in courage. He was forbearing
enough with vices of a different kind; made John Ballantyne's dissipation the object rather
of his jokes than of his indignation; and not only mourned for him, but really grieved for
him when he died. It is only fair to say, however, that for this conventional scorn of a weakness
rather than a sin, Scott sorrowed sincerely later in life, and that in sketching the physical
cowardice of Connochar in The Fair Maid of Perth, he deliberately made an attempt to atone
for this hardness towards his brother by showing how frequently the foundation of cowardice
may be laid in perfectly involuntary physical temperament, and pointing out with what noble
elements of disposition it may be combined. But till reflection on many forms of human character
had enlarged Scott's charity, and perhaps also the range of his speculative ethics, he remained
a conventional moralist, and one, moreover, the type of whose conventional code was borrowed
more from that of honour than from that of religious principle. There is one curious passage
in his diary, written very near the end of his life, in which Scott even seems to declare that
conventional standards of conduct are better, or at least safer, than religious standards of
conduct. He says in his diary for the 15th April, 1828,--"Dined with Sir Robert Inglis, and
met Sir Thomas Acland, my old and kind friend. I was happy to see him. He may be considered
now as the head of the religious party in the House of Commons--a powerful body which Wilberforce
long commanded. It is a difficult situation, for the adaptation of religious motives to earthly
policy is apt--among the infinite delusions of the human heart--to be a snare."[37] His letters
to his eldest son, the young cavalry officer, on his first start in life, are much admired
by Mr. Lockhart, but to me they read a little hard, a little worldly, and extremely conventional.
Conventionality was certainly to his mind almost a virtue.

Of enthusiasm in religion Scott always spoke very severely; both in his novels and in his letters
and private diary. In writing to Lord Montague, he speaks of such enthusiasm as was then prevalent
at Oxford, and which makes, he says, "religion a motive and a pretext for particular lines
of thinking in politics and in temporal affairs" [as if it could help doing that!] as "teaching
a new way of going to the devil for God's sake," and this expressly, because when the young
are infected with it, it disunites families, and sets "children in opposition to their parents."[38]
He gives us, however, one reason for his dread of anything like enthusiasm, which is not conventional;--that
it interferes with the submissive and tranquil mood which is the only true religious mood.
Speaking in his diary of a weakness and fluttering at the heart, from which he had suffered,
he says, "It is an awful sensation, and would have made an enthusiast of me, had I indulged
my imagination on religious subjects. I have been always careful to place my mind in the most
tranquil posture which it can assume, during my private exercises of devotion."[39] And in
this avoidance of indulging the imagination on religious, or even spiritual subjects, Scott
goes far beyond Shakespeare. I do not think there is a single study in all his romances of
what may be fairly called a pre-eminently spiritual character as such, though Jeanie Deans
approaches nearest to it. The same may be said of Shakespeare. But Shakespeare, though he has
never drawn a pre-eminently spiritual character, often enough indulged his imagination while
meditating on spiritual themes.

CHAPTER XII.

DISTRACTIONS AND AMUSEMENTS AT ABBOTSFORD.

Between 1814 and the end of 1825, Scott's literary labour was interrupted only by one serious
illness, and hardly interrupted by that,--by a few journeys,--one to Paris after the battle
of Waterloo, and several to London,--and by the worry of a constant stream of intrusive visitors.
Of his journeys he has left some records; but I cannot say that I think Scott would ever have
reached, as a mere observer and recorder, at all the high point which he reached directly his
imagination went to work to create a story. That imagination was, indeed, far less subservient
to his mere perceptions than to his constructive powers. Paul's Letters to his Kinsfolk--the
records of his Paris journey after Waterloo--for instance, are not at all above the mark of
a good special correspondent. His imagination was less the imagination of insight, than the
imagination of one whose mind was a great kaleidoscope of human life and fortunes. But far
more interrupting than either illness or travel, was the lion-hunting of which Scott became
the object, directly after the publication of the earlier novels. In great measure, no doubt,
on account of the mystery as to his authorship, his fame became something oppressive. At one
time as many as sixteen parties of visitors applied to see Abbotsford in a single day. Strangers,--especially
the American travellers of that day, who were much less reticent and more irrepressible than
the American travellers of this,--would come to him without introductions, facetiously cry
out "Prodigious!" in imitation of Dominie Sampson, whatever they were shown, inquire whether
the new house was called Tullyveolan or Tillytudlem, cross-examine, with open note-books, as
to Scott's age, and the age of his wife, and appear to be taken quite by surprise when they
were bowed out without being asked to dine.[40] In those days of high postage Scott's bill
for letters "seldom came under 150l. a year," and "as to coach parcels, they were a perfect
ruination." On one occasion a mighty package came by post from the United States, for which
Scott had to pay five pounds sterling. It contained a MS. play called The Cherokee Lovers,
by a young lady of New York, who begged Scott to read and correct it, write a prologue and
epilogue, get it put on the stage at Drury Lane, and negotiate with Constable or Murray for
the copyright. In about a fortnight another packet not less formidable arrived, charged with
a similar postage, which Scott, not grown cautious through experience, recklessly opened; out
jumped a duplicate copy of The Cherokee Lovers, with a second letter from the authoress, stating
that as the weather had been stormy, and she feared that something might have happened to her
former MS., she had thought it prudent to send him a duplicate.[41] Of course, when fame reached
such a point as this, it became both a worry and a serious waste of money, and what was far
more valuable than money, of time, privacy, and tranquillity of mind. And though no man ever
bore such worries with the equanimity of Scott, no man ever received less pleasure from the
adulation of unknown and often vulgar and ignorant admirers. His real amusements were his trees
and his friends. "Planting and pruning trees," he said, "I could work at from morning to night.
There is a sort of self-congratulation, a little tickling self-flattery, in the idea that while
you are pleasing and amusing yourself, you are seriously contributing to the future welfare
of the country, and that your very acorn may send its future ribs of oak to future victories
like Trafalgar,"[42]--for the day of iron ships was not yet. And again, at a later stage of
his planting:--"You can have no idea of the exquisite delight of a planter,--he is like a painter
laying on his colours,--at every moment he sees his effects coming out. There is no art or
occupation comparable to this; it is full of past, present, and future enjoyment. I look back
to the time when there was not a tree here, only bare heath; I look round and see thousands
of trees growing up, all of which, I may say almost each of which, have received my personal
attention. I remember, five years ago, looking forward with the most delighted expectation
to this very hour, and as each year has passed, the expectation has gone on increasing. I do
the same now. I anticipate what this plantation and that one will presently be, if only taken
care of, and there is not a spot of which I do not watch the progress. Unlike building, or
even painting, or indeed any other kind of pursuit, this has no end, and is never interrupted;
but goes on from day to day, and from year to year, with a perpetually augmenting interest.
Farming I hate. What have I to do with fattening and killing beasts, or raising corn, only
to cut it down, and to wrangle with farmers about prices, and to be constantly at the mercy
of the seasons? There can be no such disappointments or annoyances in planting trees."[43]
Scott indeed regarded planting as a mode of so moulding the form and colour of the outward
world, that nature herself became indebted to him for finer outlines, richer masses of colour,
and deeper shadows, as well as for more fertile and sheltered soils. And he was as skilful
in producing the last result, as he was in the artistic effects of his planting. In the essay
on the planting of waste lands, he mentions a story,--drawn from his own experience,--of a
planter, who having scooped out the lowest part of his land for enclosures, and "planted the
wood round them in masses enlarged or contracted as the natural lying of the ground seemed
to dictate," met, six years after these changes, his former tenant on the ground, and said
to him, "I suppose, Mr. R----, you will say I have ruined your farm by laying half of it into
woodland?" "I should have expected it, sir," answered Mr. R----, "if you had told me beforehand
what you were going to do; but I am now of a very different opinion; and as I am looking for
land at present, if you are inclined to take for the remaining sixty acres the same rent which
I formerly gave for a hundred and twenty, I will give you an offer to that amount. I consider
the benefit of the enclosing, and the complete shelter afforded to the fields, as an advantage
which fairly counterbalances the loss of one-half of the land."[44]

And Scott was not only thoughtful in his own planting, but induced his neighbours to become
so too. So great was their regard for him, that many of them planted their estates as much
with reference to the effect which their plantations would have on the view from Abbotsford,
as with reference to the effect they would have on the view from their own grounds. Many was
the consultation which he and his neighbours, Scott of Gala, for instance, and Mr. Henderson
of Eildon Hall, had together on the effect which would be produced on the view from their respective
houses, of the planting going on upon the lands of each. The reciprocity of feeling was such
that the various proprietors acted more like brothers in this matter, than like the jealous
and exclusive creatures which landowners, as such, so often are.

Next to his interest in the management and growth of his own little estate was Scott's interest
in the management and growth of the Duke of Buccleuch's. To the Duke he looked up as the head
of his clan, with something almost more than a feudal attachment, greatly enhanced of course
by the personal friendship which he had formed for him in early life as the Earl of Dalkeith.
This mixture of feudal and personal feeling towards the Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch continued
during their lives. Scott was away on a yachting tour to the Shetlands and Orkneys in July
and August, 1814, and it was during this absence that the Duchess of Buccleuch died. Scott,
who was in no anxiety about her, employed himself in writing an amusing descriptive epistle
to the Duke in rough verse, chronicling his voyage, and containing expressions of the profoundest
reverence for the goodness and charity of the Duchess, a letter which did not reach its destination
till after the Duchess's death. Scott himself heard of her death by chance when they landed
for a few hours on the coast of Ireland; he was quite overpowered by the news, and went to
bed only to drop into short nightmare sleeps, and to wake with the dim memory of some heavy
weight at his heart. The Duke himself died five years later, leaving a son only thirteen years
of age (the present Duke), over whose interests, both as regarded his education and his estates,
Scott watched as jealously as if they had been those of his own son. Many were the anxious
letters he wrote to Lord Montague as to his "young chief's" affairs, as he called them, and
great his pride in watching the promise of his youth. Nothing can be clearer than that to Scott
the feudal principle was something far beyond a name; that he had at least as much pride in
his devotion to his chief, as he had in founding a house which he believed would increase the
influence--both territorial and personal--of the clan of Scotts. The unaffected reverence which
he felt for the Duke, though mingled with warm personal affection, showed that Scott's feudal
feeling had something real and substantial in it, which did not vanish even when it came into
close contact with strong personal feelings. This reverence is curiously marked in his letters.
He speaks of "the distinction of rank" being ignored by both sides, as of something quite exceptional,
but it was never really ignored by him, for though he continued to write to the Duke as an
intimate friend, it was with a mingling of awe, very different indeed from that which he ever
adopted to Ellis or Erskine. It is necessary to remember this, not only in estimating the strength
of the feeling which made him so anxious to become himself the founder of a house within a
house,--of a new branch of the clan of Scotts,--but in estimating the loyalty which Scott always
displayed to one of the least respectable of English sovereigns, George IV.,--a matter of which
I must now say a few words, not only because it led to Scott's receiving the baronetcy, but
because it forms to my mind the most grotesque of all the threads in the lot of this strong
and proud man.

CHAPTER XIII.

SCOTT AND GEORGE IV.

The first relations of Scott with the Court were, oddly enough, formed with the Princess, not
with the Prince of Wales. In 1806 Scott dined with the Princess of Wales at Blackheath, and
spoke of his invitation as a great honour. He wrote a tribute to her father, the Duke of Brunswick,
in the introduction to one of the cantos of Marmion, and received from the Princess a silver
vase in acknowledgment of this passage in the poem. Scott's relations with the Prince Regent
seem to have begun in an offer to Scott of the Laureateship in the summer of 1813, an offer
which Scott would have found it very difficult to accept, so strongly did his pride revolt
at the idea of having to commemorate in verse, as an official duty, all conspicuous incidents
affecting the throne. But he was at the time of the offer in the thick of his first difficulties
on account of Messrs. John Ballantyne and Co., and it was only the Duke of Buccleuch's guarantee
of 4000l.--a guarantee subsequently cancelled by Scott's paying the sum for which it was a
security--that enabled him at this time to decline what, after Southey had accepted it, he
compared in a letter to Southey to the herring for which the poor Scotch clergyman gave thanks
in a grace wherein he described it as "even this, the very least of Providence's mercies."
In March, 1815, Scott being then in London, the Prince Regent asked him to dinner, addressed
him uniformly as Walter, and struck up a friendship with him which seems to have lasted their
lives, and which certainly did much more honour to George than to Sir Walter Scott. It is impossible
not to think rather better of George IV. for thus valuing, and doing his best in every way
to show his value for, Scott. It is equally impossible not to think rather worse of Scott for
thus valuing, and in every way doing his best to express his value for, this very worthless,
though by no means incapable king. The consequences were soon seen in the indignation with
which Scott began to speak of the Princess of Wales's sins. In 1806, in the squib he wrote
on Lord Melville's acquittal, when impeached for corruption by the Liberal Government, he had
written thus of the Princess Caroline:--

    "Our King, too--our Princess,--I dare not say more, sir,--
      May Providence watch them with mercy and might!
    While there's one Scottish hand that can wag a claymore, sir,
      They shall ne'er want a friend to stand up for their right.
            Be damn'd he that dare not--
            For my part I'll spare not
        To beauty afflicted a tribute to give;
            Fill it up steadily,
            Drink it off readily,
        Here's to the Princess, and long may she live."

But whoever "stood up" for the Princess's right, certainly Scott did not do so after his intimacy
with the Prince Regent began. He mentioned her only with severity, and in one letter at least,
written to his brother, with something much coarser than severity;[45] but the king's similar
vices did not at all alienate him from what at least had all the appearance of a deep personal
devotion to his sovereign. The first baronet whom George IV. made on succeeding to the throne,
after his long Regency, was Scott, who not only accepted the honour gratefully, but dwelt with
extreme pride on the fact that it was offered to him by the king himself, and was in no way
due to the prompting of any minister's advice. He wrote to Joanna Baillie on hearing of the
Regent's intention--for the offer was made by the Regent at the end of 1818, though it was
not actually conferred till after George's accession, namely, on the 30th March, 1820,--"The
Duke of Buccleuch and Scott of Harden, who, as the heads of my clan and the sources of my gentry,
are good judges of what I ought to do, have both given me their earnest opinion to accept of
an honour directly derived from the source of honour, and neither begged nor bought, as is
the usual fashion. Several of my ancestors bore the title in the seventeenth century, and,
were it of consequence, I have no reason to be ashamed of the decent and respectable persons
who connect me with that period when they carried into the field, like Madoc,

    "The Crescent at whose gleam the Cambrian oft,
    Cursing his perilous tenure, wound his horn,"

so that, as a gentleman, I may stand on as good a footing as other new creations."[46] Why
the honour was any greater for coming from such a king as George, than it would have been if
it had been suggested by Lord Sidmouth, or even Lord Liverpool,--or half as great as if Mr.
Canning had proposed it, it is not easy to conceive. George was a fair judge of literary merit,
but not one to be compared for a moment with that great orator and wit; and as to his being
the fountain of honour, there was so much dishonour of which the king was certainly the fountain
too, that I do not think it was very easy for two fountains both springing from such a person
to have flowed quite unmingled. George justly prided himself on Sir Walter Scott's having been
the first creation of his reign, and I think the event showed that the poet was the fountain
of much more honour for the king, than the king was for the poet.

When George came to Edinburgh in 1822, it was Sir Walter who acted virtually as the master
of the ceremonies, and to whom it was chiefly due that the visit was so successful. It was
then that George clad his substantial person for the first time in the Highland costume--to
wit, in the Steuart Tartans--and was so much annoyed to find himself outvied by a wealthy alderman,
Sir William Curtis, who had gone and done likewise, and, in his equally grand Steuart Tartans,
seemed a kind of parody of the king. The day on which the king arrived, Tuesday, 14th of August,
1822, was also the day on which Scott's most intimate friend, William Erskine, then Lord Kinnedder,
died. Yet Scott went on board the royal yacht, was most graciously received by George, had
his health drunk by the king in a bottle of Highland whiskey, and with a proper show of devoted
loyalty entreated to be allowed to retain the glass out of which his Majesty had just drunk
his health. The request was graciously acceded to, but let it be pleaded on Scott's behalf,
that on reaching home and finding there his friend Crabbe the poet, he sat down on the royal
gift, and crushed it to atoms. One would hope that he was really thinking more even of Crabbe,
and much more of Erskine, than of the royal favour for which he had appeared, and doubtless
had really believed himself, so grateful. Sir Walter retained his regard for the king, such
as it was, to the last, and even persuaded himself that George's death would be a great political
calamity for the nation. And really I cannot help thinking that Scott believed more in the
king, than he did in his friend George Canning. Assuredly, greatly as he admired Canning, he
condemned him more and more as Canning grew more liberal, and sometimes speaks of his veerings
in that direction with positive asperity. George, on the other hand, who believed more in number
one than in any other number, however large, became much more conservative after he became
Regent than he was before, and as he grew more conservative Scott grew more conservative likewise,
till he came to think this particular king almost a pillar of the Constitution. I suppose we
ought to explain this little bit of fetish-worship in Scott much as we should the quaint practical
adhesion to duelling which he gave as an old man, who had had all his life much more to do
with the pen than the sword--that is, as an evidence of the tendency of an improved type to
recur to that of the old wild stock on which it had been grafted. But certainly no feudal devotion
of his ancestors to their chief was ever less justified by moral qualities than Scott's loyal
devotion to the fountain of honour as embodied in "our fat friend." The whole relation to George
was a grotesque thread in Scott's life; and I cannot quite forgive him for the utterly conventional
severity with which he threw over his first patron, the Queen, for sins which were certainly
not grosser, if they were not much less gross, than those of his second patron, the husband
who had set her the example which she faithfully, though at a distance, followed.

CHAPTER XIV.

SCOTT AS A POLITICIAN.

Scott usually professed great ignorance of politics, and did what he could to hold aloof from
a world in which his feelings were very easily heated, while his knowledge was apt to be very
imperfect. But now and again, and notably towards the close of his life, he got himself mixed
up in politics, and I need hardly say that it was always on the Tory, and generally on the
red-hot Tory, side. His first hasty intervention in politics was the song I have just referred
to on Lord Melville's acquittal, during the short Whig administration of 1806. In fact Scott's
comparative abstinence from politics was due, I believe, chiefly to the fact that during almost
the whole of his literary life, Tories and not Whigs were in power. No sooner was any reform
proposed, any abuse threatened, than Scott's eager Conservative spirit flashed up. Proposals
were made in 1806 for changes--and, as it was thought, reforms--in the Scotch Courts of Law,
and Scott immediately saw something like national calamity in the prospect. The mild proposals
in question were discussed at a meeting of the Faculty of Advocates, when Scott made a speech
longer than he had ever before delivered, and animated by a "flow and energy of eloquence"
for which those who were accustomed to hear his debating speeches were quite unprepared. He
walked home between two of the reformers, Mr. Jeffrey and another, when his companions began
to compliment him on his eloquence, and to speak playfully of its subject. But Scott was in
no mood for playfulness. "No, no," he exclaimed, "'tis no laughing matter; little by little,
whatever your wishes may be, you will destroy and undermine, until nothing of what makes Scotland
Scotland shall remain!" "And so saying," adds Mr. Lockhart, "he turned round to conceal his
agitation, but not until Mr. Jeffrey saw tears gushing down his cheek,--resting his head, until
he recovered himself, on the wall of the Mound."[47] It was the same strong feeling for old
Scotch institutions which broke out so quaintly in the midst of his own worst troubles in 1826,
on behalf of the Scotch banking-system, when he so eloquently defended, in the letters of Malachi
Malagrowther, what would now be called Home-Rule for Scotland, and indeed really defeated the
attempt of his friends the Tories, who were the innovators this time, to encroach on those
sacred institutions--the Scotch one-pound note, and the private-note circulation of the Scotch
banks. But when I speak of Scott as a Home-Ruler, I should add that had not Scotland been for
generations governed to a great extent, and, as he thought successfully, by Home-Rule, he was
far too good a Conservative to have apologized for it at all. The basis of his Conservatism
was always the danger of undermining a system which had answered so well. In the concluding
passages of the letters to which I have just referred, he contrasts "Theory, a scroll in her
hand, full of deep and mysterious combinations of figures, the least failure in any one of
which may alter the result entirely," with "a practical system successful for upwards of a
century." His vehement and unquailing opposition to Reform in almost the very last year of
his life, when he had already suffered more than one stroke of paralysis, was grounded on precisely
the same argument. At Jedburgh, on the 21st March, 1831, he appeared in the midst of an angry
population (who hooted and jeered at him till he turned round fiercely upon them with the defiance,
"I regard your gabble no more than the geese on the green,") to urge the very same protest.
"We in this district," he said, "are proud, and with reason, that the first chain-bridge was
the work of a Scotchman. It still hangs where he erected it a pretty long time ago. The French
heard of our invention, and determined to introduce it, but with great improvements and embellishments.
A friend of my own saw the thing tried. It was on the Seine at Marly. The French chain-bridge
looked lighter and airier than the prototype. Every Englishman present was disposed to confess
that we had been beaten at our own trade. But by-and-by the gates were opened, and the multitude
were to pass over. It began to swing rather formidably beneath the pressure of the good company;
and by the time the architect, who led the procession in great pomp and glory, reached the
middle, the whole gave way, and he--worthy, patriotic artist--was the first that got a ducking.
They had forgot the middle bolt,--or rather this ingenious person had conceived that to be
a clumsy-looking feature, which might safely be dispensed with, while he put some invisible
gimcrack of his own to supply its place."[48] It is strange that Sir Walter did not see that
this kind of criticism, so far as it applied at all to such an experiment as the Reform Bill,
was even more in point as a rebuke to the rashness of the Scotch reformer who hung the first
successful chain-bridge, than to the rashness of the French reformer of reform who devised
an unsuccessful variation on it. The audacity of the first experiment was much the greater,
though the competence of the person who made it was the greater also. And as a matter of fact,
the political structure against the supposed insecurity of which Sir Walter was protesting,
with all the courage of that dauntless though dying nature, was made by one who understood
his work at least as well as the Scotch architect. The tramp of the many multitudes who have
passed over it has never yet made it to "swing dangerously," and Lord Russell in the fulness
of his age was but yesterday rejoicing in what he had achieved, and even in what those have
achieved who have altered his work in the same spirit in which he designed it.

But though Sir Walter persuaded himself that his Conservatism was all founded in legitimate
distrust of reckless change, there is evidence, I think, that at times at least it was due
to elements less noble. The least creditable incident in the story of his political life--which
Mr. Lockhart, with his usual candour, did not conceal--was the bitterness with which he resented
a most natural and reasonable Parliamentary opposition to an appointment which he had secured
for his favourite brother, Tom. In 1810 Scott appointed his brother Tom, who had failed as
a Writer to the Signet, to a place vacant under himself as Clerk of Session. He had not given
him the best place vacant, because he thought it his duty to appoint an official who had grown
grey in the service, but he gave Tom Scott this man's place, which was worth about 250l. a
year. In the meantime Tom Scott's affairs did not render it convenient for him to be come-at-able,
and he absented himself, while they were being settled, in the Isle of Man. Further, the Commission
on the Scotch system of judicature almost immediately reported that his office was one of supererogation,
and ought to be abolished; but, to soften the blow, they proposed to allow him a pension of
130l. per annum. This proposal was discussed with some natural jealousy in the House of Lords.
Lord Lauderdale thought that when Tom Scott was appointed, it must have been pretty evident
that the Commission would propose to abolish his office, and that the appointment therefore
should not have been made. "Mr. Thomas Scott," he said, "would have 130l. for life as an indemnity
for an office the duties of which he never had performed, while those clerks who had laboured
for twenty years had no adequate remuneration." Lord Holland supported this very reasonable
and moderate view of the case; but of course the Ministry carried their way, and Tom Scott
got his unearned pension. Nevertheless, Scott was furious with Lord Holland. Writing soon after
to the happy recipient of this little pension, he says, "Lord Holland has been in Edinburgh,
and we met accidentally at a public party. He made up to me, but I remembered his part in your
affair, and cut him with as little remorse as an old pen." Mr. Lockhart says, on Lord Jeffrey's
authority, that the scene was a very painful one. Lord Jeffrey himself declared that it was
the only rudeness of which he ever saw Scott guilty in the course of a life-long familiarity.
And it is pleasant to know that he renewed his cordiality with Lord Holland in later years,
though there is no evidence that he ever admitted that he had been in the wrong. But the incident
shows how very doubtful Sir Walter ought to have felt as to the purity of his Conservatism.
It is quite certain that the proposal to abolish Tom Scott's office without compensation was
not a reckless experiment of a fundamental kind. It was a mere attempt at diminishing the heavy
burdens laid on the people for the advantage of a small portion of the middle class, and yet
Scott resented it with as much display of selfish passion--considering his genuine nobility
of breeding--as that with which the rude working men of Jedburgh afterwards resented his gallant
protest against the Reform Bill, and, later again, saluted the dauntless old man with the dastardly
cry of "Burk Sir Walter!" Judged truly, I think Sir Walter's conduct in cutting Lord Holland
"with as little remorse as an old pen," for simply doing his duty in the House of Lords, was
quite as ignoble in him as the bullying and insolence of the democratic party in 1831, when
the dying lion made his last dash at what he regarded as the foes of the Constitution. Doubtless
he held that the mob, or, as we more decorously say, the residuum, were in some sense the enemies
of true freedom. "I cannot read in history," he writes once to Mr. Laidlaw, "of any free State
which has been brought to slavery till the rascal and uninstructed populace had had their short
hour of anarchical government, which naturally leads to the stern repose of military despotism."
But he does not seem ever to have perceived that educated men identify themselves with "the
rascal and uninstructed populace," whenever they indulge on behalf of the selfish interests
of their own class, passions such as he had indulged in fighting for his brother's pension.
It is not the want of instruction, it is the rascaldom, i. e. the violent esprit de corps of
a selfish class, which "naturally leads" to violent remedies. Such rascaldom exists in all
classes, and not least in the class of the cultivated and refined. Generous and magnanimous
as Scott was, he was evidently by no means free from the germs of it.

One more illustration of Scott's political Conservatism, and I may leave his political life,
which was not indeed his strong side, though, as with all sides of Scott's nature, it had an
energy and spirit all his own. On the subject of Catholic Emancipation he took a peculiar view.
As he justly said, he hated bigotry, and would have left the Catholics quite alone, but for
the great claims of their creed to interfere with political life. And even so, when the penal
laws were once abolished, he would have abolished also the representative disabilities, as
quite useless, as well as very irritating when the iron system of effective repression had
ceased. But he disapproved of the abolition of the political parts of the penal laws. He thought
they would have stamped out Roman Catholicism; and whether that were just or unjust, he thought
it would have been a great national service. "As for Catholic Emancipation," he wrote to Southey
in 1807, "I am not, God knows, a bigot in religious matters, nor a friend to persecution; but
if a particular set of religionists are ipso facto connected with foreign politics, and placed
under the spiritual direction of a class of priests, whose unrivalled dexterity and activity
are increased by the rules which detach them from the rest of the world--I humbly think that
we may be excused from entrusting to them those places in the State where the influence of
such a clergy, who act under the direction of a passive tool of our worst foe, is likely to
be attended with the most fatal consequences. If a gentleman chooses to walk about with a couple
of pounds of gunpowder in his pocket, if I give him the shelter of my roof, I may at least
be permitted to exclude him from the seat next to the fire."[49] And in relation to the year
1825, when Scott visited Ireland, Mr. Lockhart writes, "He on all occasions expressed manfully
his belief that the best thing for Ireland would have been never to relax the strictly political
enactments of the penal laws, however harsh these might appear. Had they been kept in vigour
for another half-century, it was his conviction that Popery would have been all but extinguished
in Ireland. But he thought that after admitting Romanists to the elective franchise, it was
a vain notion that they could be permanently or advantageously deterred from using that franchise
in favour of those of their own persuasion."

In his diary in 1829 he puts the same view still more strongly:--"I cannot get myself to feel
at all anxious about the Catholic question. I cannot see the use of fighting about the platter,
when you have let them snatch the meat off it. I hold Popery to be such a mean and degrading
superstition, that I am not sure I could have found myself liberal enough for voting the repeal
of the penal laws as they existed before 1780. They must and would, in course of time, have
smothered Popery; and I confess that I should have seen the old lady of Babylon's mouth stopped
with pleasure. But now that you have taken the plaster off her mouth, and given her free respiration,
I cannot see the sense of keeping up the irritation about the claim to sit in Parliament. Unopposed,
the Catholic superstition may sink into dust, with all its absurd ritual and solemnities. Still
it is an awful risk. The world is in fact as silly as ever, and a good competence of nonsense
will always find believers."[50] That is the view of a strong and rather unscrupulous politician--a
moss-trooper in politics--which Scott certainly was. He was thinking evidently very little
of justice, almost entirely of the most effective means of keeping the Kingdom, the Kingdom
which he loved. Had he understood--what none of the politicians of that day understood--the
strength of the Church of Rome as the only consistent exponent of the principle of Authority
in religion, I believe his opposition to Catholic emancipation would have been as bitter as
his opposition to Parliamentary reform. But he took for granted that while only "silly" persons
believed in Rome, and only "infidels" rejected an authoritative creed altogether, it was quite
easy by the exercise of common sense, to find the true compromise between reason and religious
humility. Had Scott lived through the religious controversies of our own days, it seems not
unlikely that with his vivid imagination, his warm Conservatism, and his rather inadequate
critical powers, he might himself have become a Roman Catholic.

CHAPTER XV.

SCOTT IN ADVERSITY.

With the year 1825 came a financial crisis, and Constable began to tremble for his solvency.
From the date of his baronetcy Sir Walter had launched out into a considerable increase of
expenditure. He got plans on a rather large scale in 1821 for the increase of Abbotsford, which
were all carried out. To meet his expenses in this and other ways he received Constable's bills
for "four unnamed works of fiction," of which he had not written a line, but which came to
exist in time, and were called Peveril of the Peak, Quentin Durward, St. Ronan's Well, and
Redgauntlet. Again, in the very year before the crash, 1825, he married his eldest son, the
heir to the title, to a young lady who was herself an heiress, Miss Jobson of Lochore, when
Abbotsford and its estates were settled, with the reserve of 10,000l., which Sir Walter took
power to charge on the property for purposes of business. Immediately afterwards he purchased
a captaincy in the King's Hussars for his son, which cost him 3500l. Nor were the obligations
he incurred on his own account, or that of his family, the only ones by which he was burdened.
He was always incurring expenses, often heavy expenses, for other people. Thus, when Mr. Terry,
the actor, became joint lessee and manager of the Adelphi Theatre, London, Scott became his
surety for 1250l., while James Ballantyne became his surety for 500l. more, and both these
sums had to be paid by Sir Walter after Terry's failure in 1828. Such obligations as these,
however, would have been nothing when compared with Sir Walter's means, had all his bills on
Constable been duly honoured, and had not the printing firm of Ballantyne and Co. been so deeply
involved with Constable's house that it necessarily became insolvent when he stopped. Taken
altogether, I believe that Sir Walter earned during his own lifetime at least 140,000l. by
his literary work alone, probably more; while even on his land and building combined he did
not apparently spend more than half that sum. Then he had a certain income, about 1000l. a
year, from his own and Lady Scott's private property, as well as 1300l. a year as Clerk of
Session, and 300l. more as Sheriff of Selkirk. Thus even his loss of the price of several novels
by Constable's failure would not seriously have compromised Scott's position, but for his share
in the printing-house which fell with Constable, and the obligations of which amounted to 117,000l.

As Scott had always forestalled his income,--spending the purchase-money of his poems and novels
before they were written,--such a failure as this, at the age of fifty-five, when all the freshness
of his youth was gone out of him, when he saw his son's prospects blighted as well as his own,
and knew perfectly that James Ballantyne, unassisted by him, could never hope to pay any fraction
of the debt worth mentioning, would have been paralysing, had he not been a man of iron nerve,
and of a pride and courage hardly ever equalled. Domestic calamity, too, was not far off. For
two years he had been watching the failure of his wife's health with increasing anxiety, and
as calamities seldom come single, her illness took a most serious form at the very time when
the blow fell, and she died within four months of the failure. Nay, Scott was himself unwell
at the critical moment, and was taking sedatives which discomposed his brain. Twelve days before
the final failure,--which was announced to him on the 17th January, 1826,--he enters in his
diary, "Much alarmed. I had walked till twelve with Skene and Russell, and then sat down to
my work. To my horror and surprise I could neither write nor spell, but put down one word for
another, and wrote nonsense. I was much overpowered at the same time and could not conceive
the reason. I fell asleep, however, in my chair, and slept for two hours. On my waking my head
was clearer, and I began to recollect that last night I had taken the anodyne left for the
purpose by Clarkson, and being disturbed in the course of the night, I had not slept it off."
In fact the hyoscyamus had, combined with his anxieties, given him a slight attack of what
is now called aphasia, that brain disease the most striking symptom of which is that one word
is mistaken for another. And this was Scott's preparation for his failure, and the bold resolve
which followed it, to work for his creditors as he had worked for himself, and to pay off,
if possible, the whole 117,000l. by his own literary exertions.

There is nothing in its way in the whole of English biography more impressive than the stoical
extracts from Scott's diary which note the descent of this blow. Here is the anticipation of
the previous day: "Edinburgh, January 16th.--Came through cold roads to as cold news. Hurst
and Robinson have suffered a bill to come back upon Constable, which, I suppose, infers the
ruin of both houses. We shall soon see. Dined with the Skenes." And here is the record itself:
"January 17th.--James Ballantyne this morning, good honest fellow, with a visage as black as
the crook. He hopes no salvation; has, indeed, taken measures to stop. It is hard, after having
fought such a battle. I have apologized for not attending the Royal Society Club, who have
a gaudeamus on this day, and seemed to count much on my being the præses. My old acquaintance
Miss Elizabeth Clerk, sister of Willie, died suddenly. I cannot choose but wish it had been
Sir W. S., and yet the feeling is unmanly. I have Anne, my wife, and Charles to look after.
I felt rather sneaking as I came home from the Parliament-house--felt as if I were liable monstrari
digito in no very pleasant way. But this must be borne cum coeteris; and, thank God, however
uncomfortable, I do not feel despondent."[51] On the following day, the 18th January, the day
after the blow, he records a bad night, a wish that the next two days were over, but that "the
worst is over," and on the same day he set about making notes for the magnum opus, as he called
it--the complete edition of all the novels, with a new introduction and notes. On the 19th
January, two days after the failure, he calmly resumed the composition of Woodstock--the novel
on which he was then engaged--and completed, he says, "about twenty printed pages of it;" to
which he adds that he had "a painful scene after dinner and another after supper, endeavouring
to convince these poor creatures" [his wife and daughter] "that they must not look for miracles,
but consider the misfortune as certain, and only to be lessened by patience and labour." On
the 21st January, after a number of business details, he quotes from Job, "Naked we entered
the world and naked we leave it; blessed be the name of the Lord." Then Woodstock and Boney"
[his life of Napoleon] "may both go to the paper-maker, and I may take to smoking cigars and
drinking grog, or turn devotee and intoxicate the brain another way."[52] He adds that when
he sets to work doggedly, he is exactly the same man he ever was, "neither low-spirited nor
distrait," nay, that adversity is to him "a tonic and bracer."

The heaviest blow was, I think, the blow to his pride. He writes to Mr. Morritt with a proud
indifference, clearly to some extent simulated:--"My womenkind will be the greater sufferers,
yet even they look cheerily forward; and, for myself, the blowing off of my hat on a stormy
day has given me more uneasiness."[53] To Lady Davy he writes truly enough:--"I beg my humblest
compliments to Sir Humphrey, and tell him, Ill Luck, that direful chemist, never put into his
crucible a more indissoluble piece of stuff than your affectionate cousin and sincere well-wisher,
Walter Scott."[54] When his Letters of Malachi Malagrowther came out he writes:--"I am glad
of this bruilzie, as far as I am concerned; people will not dare talk of me as an object of
pity--no more 'poor-manning.' Who asks how many punds Scots the old champion had in his pocket when

    'He set a bugle to his mouth,
      And blew so loud and shrill,
    The trees in greenwood shook thereat,
      Sae loud rang every hill.'

This sounds conceited enough, yet is not far from truth."[55] His dread of pity is just the
same when his wife dies:--"Will it be better," he writes, "when left to my own feelings, I
see the whole world pipe and dance around me? I think it will. Their sympathy intrudes on my
present affliction." Again, on returning for the first time from Edinburgh to Abbotsford after
Lady Scott's funeral:--"I again took possession of the family bedroom and my widowed couch.
This was a sore trial, but it was necessary not to blink such a resolution. Indeed I do not
like to have it thought that there is any way in which I can be beaten." And again:--"I have
a secret pride--I fancy it will be so most truly termed--which impels me to mix with my distresses
strange snatches of mirth, 'which have no mirth in them.'"[56]

But though pride was part of Scott's strength, pride alone never enabled any man to struggle
so vigorously and so unremittingly as he did to meet the obligations he had incurred. When
he was in Ireland in the previous year, a poor woman who had offered to sell him gooseberries,
but whose offer had not been accepted, remarked, on seeing his daughter give some pence to
a beggar, that they might as well give her an alms too, as she was "an old struggler." Sir
Walter was struck with the expression, and said that it deserved to become classical, as a
name for those who take arms against a sea of troubles, instead of yielding to the waves. It
was certainly a name the full meaning of which he himself deserved. His house in Edinburgh
was sold, and he had to go into a certain Mrs. Brown's lodgings, when he was discharging his
duties as Clerk of Session. His wife was dead. His estate was conveyed to trustees for the
benefit of his creditors till such time as he should pay off Ballantyne and Co's. debt, which
of course in his lifetime he never did. Yet between January, 1826, and January, 1828, he earned
for his creditors very nearly 40,000l. Woodstock sold for 8228l., "a matchless sale," as Sir
Walter remarked, "for less than three months' work." The first two editions of The Life of
Napoleon Bonaparte, on which Mr. Lockhart says that Scott had spent the unremitting labour
of about two years--labour involving a far greater strain on eyes and brain than his imaginative
work ever caused him--sold for 18,000l. Had Sir Walter's health lasted, he would have redeemed
his obligations on behalf of Ballantyne and Co. within eight or nine years at most from the
time of his failure. But what is more remarkable still, is that after his health failed he
struggled on with little more than half a brain, but a whole will, to work while it was yet
day, though the evening was dropping fast. Count Robert of Paris and Castle Dangerous were
really the compositions of a paralytic patient.

It was in September, 1830, that the first of these tales was begun. As early as the 15th February
of that year he had had his first true paralytic seizure. He had been discharging his duties
as clerk of session as usual, and received in the afternoon a visit from a lady friend of his,
Miss Young, who was submitting to him some manuscript memoirs of her father, when the stroke
came. It was but slight. He struggled against it with his usual iron power of will, and actually
managed to stagger out of the room where the lady was sitting with him, into the drawing-room
where his daughter was, but there he fell his full length on the floor. He was cupped, and
fully recovered his speech during the course of the day, but Mr. Lockhart thinks that never,
after this attack, did his style recover its full lucidity and terseness. A cloudiness in words
and a cloudiness of arrangement began to be visible. In the course of the year he retired from
his duties of clerk of session, and his publishers hoped that, by engaging him on the new and
complete edition of his works, they might detach him from the attempt at imaginative creation
for which he was now so much less fit. But Sir Walter's will survived his judgment. When, in
the previous year, Ballantyne had been disabled from attending to business by his wife's illness
(which ended in her death), Scott had written in his diary, "It is his (Ballantyne's) nature
to indulge apprehensions of the worst which incapacitate him for labour. I cannot help regarding
this amiable weakness of the mind with something too nearly allied to contempt," and assuredly
he was guilty of no such weakness himself. Not only did he row much harder against the stream
of fortune than he had ever rowed with it, but, what required still more resolution, he fought
on against the growing conviction that his imagination would not kindle, as it used to do,
to its old heat.

When he dictated to Laidlaw,--for at this time he could hardly write himself for rheumatism
in the hand,--he would frequently pause and look round him, like a man "mocked with shadows."
Then he bestirred himself with a great effort, rallied his force, and the style again flowed
clear and bright, but not for long. The clouds would gather again, and the mental blank recur.
This soon became visible to his publishers, who wrote discouragingly of the new novel--to Scott's
own great distress and irritation. The oddest feature in the matter was that his letters to
them were full of the old terseness, and force, and caustic turns. On business he was as clear
and keen as in his best days. It was only at his highest task, the task of creative work, that
his cunning began to fail him. Here, for instance, are a few sentences written to Cadell, his
publisher, touching this very point--the discouragement which James Ballantyne had been pouring
on the new novel. Ballantyne, he says, finds fault with the subject, when what he really should
have found fault with was the failing power of the author:--"James is, with many other kindly
critics, perhaps in the predicament of an honest drunkard, when crop-sick the next morning,
who does not ascribe the malady to the wine he has drunk, but to having tasted some particular
dish at dinner which disagreed with his stomach.... I have lost, it is plain, the power of
interesting the country, and ought, injustice to all parties, to retire while I have some credit.
But this is an important step, and I will not be obstinate about it if it be necessary....
Frankly, I cannot think of flinging aside the half-finished volume, as if it were a corked
bottle of wine.... I may, perhaps, take a trip to the Continent for a year or two, if I find
Othello's occupation gone, or rather Othello's reputation."[57] And again, in a very able letter
written on the 12th of December, 1830, to Cadell, he takes a view of the situation with as
much calmness and imperturbability as if he were an outside spectator. "There were many circumstances
in the matter which you and J. B. (James Ballantyne) could not be aware of, and which, if you
were aware of, might have influenced your judgment, which had, and yet have, a most powerful
effect upon mine. The deaths of both my father and mother have been preceded by a paralytic
shock. My father survived it for nearly two years--a melancholy respite, and not to be desired.
I was alarmed with Miss Young's morning visit, when, as you know, I lost my speech. The medical
people said it was from the stomach, which might be, but while there is a doubt upon a point
so alarming, you will not wonder that the subject, or to use Hare's lingo, the shot, should
be a little anxious." He relates how he had followed all the strict medical régime prescribed
to him with scrupulous regularity, and then begun his work again with as much attention as
he could. "And having taken pains with my story, I find it is not relished, nor indeed tolerated,
by those who have no interest in condemning it, but a strong interest in putting even a face"
(? force) "upon their consciences. Was not this, in the circumstances, a damper to an invalid
already afraid that the sharp edge might be taken off his intellect, though he was not himself
sensible of that?" In fact, no more masterly discussion of the question whether his mind were
failing or not, and what he ought to do in the interval of doubt, can be conceived, than these
letters give us. At this time the debt of Ballantyne and Co. had been reduced by repeated dividends--all
the fruits of Scott's literary work--more than one half. On the 17th of December, 1830, the
liabilities stood at 54,000l., having been reduced 63,000l. within five years. And Sir Walter,
encouraged by this great result of his labour, resumed the suspended novel.

But with the beginning of 1831 came new alarms. On January 5th Sir Walter enters in his diary,--"Very
indifferent, with more awkward feelings than I can well bear up against. My voice sunk and
my head strangely confused." Still he struggled on. On the 31st January he went alone to Edinburgh
to sign his will, and stayed at his bookseller's (Cadell's) house in Athol Crescent. A great
snow-storm set in which kept him in Edinburgh and in Mr. Cadell's house till the 9th February.
One day while the snow was still falling heavily, Ballantyne reminded him that a motto was
wanting for one of the chapters of Count Robert of Paris.

Clearly this failing imagination of Sir Walter's was still a great deal more vivid than that
of most men, with brains as sound as it ever pleased Providence to make them. But his troubles
were not yet even numbered. The "storm increased," and it was, as he said, "no sunny shower."
His lame leg became so painful that he had to get a mechanical apparatus to relieve him of
some of the burden of supporting it. Then, on the 21st March, he was hissed at Jedburgh, as
I have before said, for his vehement opposition to Reform. In April he had another stroke of
paralysis which he now himself recognized as one. Still he struggled on at his novel. Under
the date of May 6, 7, 8, he makes this entry in his diary:--"Here is a precious job. I have
a formal remonstrance from those critical people, Ballantyne and Cadell, against the last volume
of Count Robert, which is within a sheet of being finished. I suspect their opinion will be
found to coincide with that of the public; at least it is not very different from my own. I
cannot conceive that I have tied a knot with my tongue which my teeth cannot untie. We shall
see. I have suffered terribly, that is the truth, rather in body than mind, and I often wish
I could lie down and sleep without waking. But I will fight it out if I can."[58] The medical
men with one accord tried to make him give up his novel-writing. But he smiled and put them
by. He took up Count Robert of Paris again, and tried to recast it. On the 18th May he insisted
on attending the election for Roxburghshire, to be held at Jedburgh, and in spite of the unmannerly
reception he had met with in March, no dissuasion would keep him at home. He was saluted in
the town with groans and blasphemies, and Sir Walter had to escape from Jedburgh by a back
way to avoid personal violence. The cries of "Burk Sir Walter," with which he was saluted on
this occasion, haunted him throughout his illness and on his dying bed. At the Selkirk election
it was Sir Walter's duty as Sheriff to preside, and his family therefore made no attempt to
dissuade him from his attendance. There he was so well known and loved, that in spite of his
Tory views, he was not insulted, and the only man who made any attempt to hustle the Tory electors,
was seized by Sir Walter with his own hand, as he got out of his carriage, and committed to
prison without resistance till the election day was over.

A seton which had been ordered for his head, gave him some relief, and of course the first
result was that he turned immediately to his novel-writing again, and began Castle Dangerous
in July, 1831,--the last July but one which he was to see at all. He even made a little journey
in company with Mr. Lockhart, in order to see the scene of the story he wished to tell, and
on his return set to work with all his old vigour to finish his tale, and put the concluding
touches to Count Robert of Paris. But his temper was no longer what it had been. He quarrelled
with Ballantyne, partly for his depreciatory criticism of Count Robert of Paris, partly for
his growing tendency to a mystic and strait-laced sort of dissent and his increasing Liberalism.
Even Mr. Laidlaw and Scott's children had much to bear. But he struggled on even to the end,
and did not consent to try the experiment of a voyage and visit to Italy till his immediate
work was done. Well might Lord Chief Baron Shepherd apply to Scott Cicero's description of
some contemporary of his own, who "had borne adversity wisely, who had not been broken by fortune,
and who, amidst the buffets of fate, had maintained his dignity." There was in Sir Walter,
I think, at least as much of the Stoic as the Christian. But Stoic or Christian, he was a hero
of the old, indomitable type. Even the last fragments of his imaginative power were all turned
to account by that unconquerable will, amidst the discouragement of friends, and the still
more disheartening doubts of his own mind. Like the headland stemming a rough sea, he was gradually
worn away, but never crushed.

CHAPTER XVI.

THE LAST YEAR.

In the month of September, 1831, the disease of the brain which had long been in existence
must have made a considerable step in advance. For the first time the illusion seemed to possess
Sir Walter that he had paid off all the debt for which he was liable, and that he was once
more free to give as his generosity prompted. Scott sent Mr. Lockhart 50l. to save his grandchildren
some slight inconvenience, and told another of his correspondents that he had "put his decayed
fortune into as good a condition as he could desire." It was well, therefore, that he had at
last consented to try the effect of travel on his health,--not that he could hope to arrest
by it such a disease as his, but that it diverted him from the most painful of all efforts,
that of trying anew the spell which had at last failed him, and perceiving in the disappointed
eyes of his old admirers that the magic of his imagination was a thing of the past. The last
day of real enjoyment at Abbotsford--for when Sir Walter returned to it to die, it was but
to catch once more the outlines of its walls, the rustle of its woods, and the gleam of its
waters, through senses already darkened to all less familiar and less fascinating visions--was
the 22nd September, 1831. On the 21st, Wordsworth had come to bid his old friend adieu, and
on the 22nd--the last day at home--they spent the morning together in a visit to Newark. It
was a day to deepen alike in Scott and in Wordsworth whatever of sympathy either of them had
with the very different genius of the other, and that it had this result in Wordsworth's case,
we know from the very beautiful poem,--"Yarrow Revisited,"--and the sonnet which the occasion
also produced. And even Scott, who was so little of a Wordsworthian, who enjoyed Johnson's
stately but formal verse, and Crabbe's vivid Dutch painting, more than he enjoyed the poetry
of the transcendental school, must have recurred that day with more than usual emotion to his
favourite Wordsworthian poem. Soon after his wife's death, he had remarked in his diary how
finely "the effect of grief upon persons who like myself are highly susceptible of humour"
had been "touched by Wordsworth in the character of the merry village teacher, Matthew, whom
Jeffrey profanely calls a half-crazy, sentimental person."[59] And long before this time, during
the brightest period of his life, Scott had made the old Antiquary of his novel quote the same
poem of Wordsworth's, in a passage where the period of life at which he had now arrived is
anticipated with singular pathos and force. "It is at such moments as these," says Mr. Oldbuck,
"that we feel the changes of time. The same objects are before us--those inanimate things which
we have gazed on in wayward infancy and impetuous youth, in anxious and scheming manhood--they
are permanent and the same; but when we look upon them in cold, unfeeling old age, can we,
changed in our temper, our pursuits, our feelings,--changed in our form, our limbs, and our
strength,--can we be ourselves called the same? or do we not rather look back with a sort of
wonder upon our former selves as beings separate and distinct from what we now are? The philosopher
who appealed from Philip inflamed with wine to Philip in his hours of sobriety, did not claim
a judge so different as if he had appealed from Philip in his youth to Philip in his old age.
I cannot but be touched with the feeling so beautifully expressed in a poem which I have heard
repeated:--

    'My eyes are dim with childish tears,
      My heart is idly stirr'd,
    For the same sound is in my ears
      Which in those days I heard. Whether Sir Walter recalled this poem of Wordsworth's on this
occasion or not--and if he recalled it, his delight in giving pleasure
would assuredly have led him to let Wordsworth know that he recalled
it--the mood it paints was unquestionably that in which his last day
at Abbotsford was passed. In the evening, referring to the journey
which was to begin the next day, he remarked that Fielding and
Smollett had been driven abroad by declining health, and that they had
never returned; while Wordsworth--willing perhaps to bring out a
brighter feature in the present picture--regretted that the last days
of those two great novelists had not been surrounded by due marks of
respect. With Sir Walter, as he well knew, it was different. The
Liberal Government that he had so bitterly opposed were pressing on
him signs of the honour in which he was held, and a ship of his
Majesty's navy had been placed at his disposal to take him to the
Mediterranean. And Wordsworth himself added his own more durable token
of reverence. As long as English poetry lives, Englishmen will know
something of that last day of the last Minstrel at Newark:--

    "Grave thoughts ruled wide on that sweet day,
      Their dignity installing
    In gentle bosoms, while sere leaves
      Were on the bough or falling;
    But breezes play'd, and sunshine gleam'd
      The forest to embolden,
    Redden'd the fiery hues, and shot
      Transparence through the golden.

    "For busy thoughts the stream flow'd on
      In foamy agitation;
    And slept in many a crystal pool
      For quiet contemplation:
    No public and no private care
      The free-born mind enthralling,
    We made a day of happy hours,
      Our happy days recalling.

       *       *       *       *       *

    "And if, as Yarrow through the woods
      And down the meadow ranging,
    Did meet us with unalter'd face,
      Though we were changed and changing;
    If then some natural shadow spread
      Our inward prospect over,
    The soul's deep valley was not slow
      Its brightness to recover.

    "Eternal blessings on the Muse
      And her divine employment,
    The blameless Muse who trains her sons
      For hope and calm enjoyment;
    Albeit sickness lingering yet
      Has o'er their pillow brooded,
    And care waylays their steps--a sprite
      Not easily eluded.

       *       *       *       *       *

    "Nor deem that localized Romance
      Plays false with our affections;
    Unsanctifies our tears--made sport
      For fanciful dejections:
    Ah, no! the visions of the past
      Sustain the heart in feeling
    Life as she is--our changeful Life
      With friends and kindred dealing.

    "Bear witness ye, whose thoughts that day
      In Yarrow's groves were centred,
    Who through the silent portal arch
      Of mouldering Newark enter'd;
    And clomb the winding stair that once
      Too timidly was mounted
    By the last Minstrel--not the last!--
      Ere he his tale recounted."

Thus did the meditative poetry, the day of which was not yet, do honour to itself in doing
homage to the Minstrel of romantic energy and martial enterprise, who, with the school of poetry
he loved, was passing away.

On the 23rd September Scott left Abbotsford, spending five days on his journey to London; nor
would he allow any of the old objects of interest to be passed without getting out of the carriage
to see them. He did not leave London for Portsmouth till the 23rd October, but spent the intervening
time in London, where he took medical advice, and with his old shrewdness wheeled his chair
into a dark corner during the physicians' absence from the room to consult, that he might read
their faces clearly on their return without their being able to read his. They recognized traces
of brain disease, but Sir Walter was relieved by their comparatively favourable opinion, for
he admitted that he had feared insanity, and therefore had "feared them." On the 29th October
he sailed for Malta, and on the 20th November Sir Walter insisted on being landed on a small
volcanic island which had appeared four months previously, and which disappeared again in a
few days, and on clambering about its crumbling lava, in spite of sinking at nearly every step
almost up to his knees, in order that he might send a description of it to his old friend Mr.
Skene. On the 22nd November he reached Malta, where he looked eagerly at the antiquities of
the place, for he still hoped to write a novel--and, indeed, actually wrote one at Naples,
which was never published, called The Siege of Malta--on the subject of the Knights of Malta,
who had interested him so much in his youth. From Malta Scott went to Naples, which he reached
on the 17th December, and where he found much pleasure in the society of Sir William Gell,
an invalid like himself, but not one who, like himself, struggled against the admission of
his infirmities, and refused to be carried when his own legs would not safely carry him. Sir
William Gell's dog delighted the old man; he would pat it and call it "Poor boy!" and confide
to Sir William how he had at home "two very fine favourite dogs, so large that I am always
afraid they look too large and too feudal for my diminished income." In all his letters home
he gave some injunction to Mr. Laidlaw about the poor people and the dogs.

On the 22nd of March, 1832, Goethe died, an event which made a great impression on Scott, who
had intended to visit Weimar on his way back, on purpose to see Goethe, and this much increased
his eager desire to return home. Accordingly on the 16th of April, the last day on which he
made any entry in his diary, he quitted Naples for Rome, where he stayed long enough only to
let his daughter see something of the place, and hurried off homewards on the 21st of May.
In Venice he was still strong enough to insist on scrambling down into the dungeons adjoining
the Bridge of Sighs; and at Frankfort he entered a bookseller's shop, when the man brought
out a lithograph of Abbotsford, and Scott remarking, "I know that already, sir," left the shop
unrecognized, more than ever craving for home. At Nimeguen, on the 9th of June, while in a
steamboat on the Rhine, he had his most serious attack of apoplexy, but would not discontinue
his journey, was lifted into an English steamboat at Rotterdam on the 11th of June, and arrived
in London on the 13th. There he recognized his children, and appeared to expect immediate death,
as he gave them repeatedly his most solemn blessing, but for the most part he lay at the St.
James's Hotel, in Jermyn Street, without any power to converse. There it was that Allan Cunningham,
on walking home one night, found a group of working men at the corner of the street, who stopped
him and asked, "as if there was but one death-bed in London, 'Do you know, sir, if this is
the street where he is lying?'" According to the usual irony of destiny, it was while the working
men were doing him this hearty and unconscious homage, that Sir Walter, whenever disturbed
by the noises of the street, imagined himself at the polling-booth of Jedburgh, where the people
had cried out, "Burk Sir Walter." And it was while lying here,--only now and then uttering
a few words,--that Mr. Lockhart says of him, "He expressed his will as determinedly as ever,
and expressed it with the same apt and good-natured irony that he was wont to use."

Sir Walter's great and urgent desire was to return to Abbotsford, and at last his physicians
yielded. On the 7th July he was lifted into his carriage, followed by his trembling and weeping
daughters, and so taken to a steamboat, where the captain gave up his private cabin--a cabin
on deck--for his use. He remained unconscious of any change till after his arrival in Edinburgh,
when, on the 11th July, he was placed again in his carriage, and remained in it quite unconscious
during the first two stages of the journey to Tweedside. But as the carriage entered the valley
of the Gala, he began to look about him. Presently he murmured a name or two, "Gala water,
surely,--Buckholm,--Torwoodlee." When the outline of the Eildon hills came in view, Scott's
excitement was great, and when his eye caught the towers of Abbotsford, he sprang up with a
cry of delight, and while the towers remained in sight it took his physician, his son-in-law,
and his servant, to keep him in the carriage. Mr. Laidlaw was waiting for him, and he met him
with a cry, "Ha! Willie Laidlaw! O, man, how often I have thought of you!" His dogs came round
his chair and began to fawn on him and lick his hands, while Sir Walter smiled or sobbed over
them. The next morning he was wheeled about his garden, and on the following morning was out
in this way for a couple of hours; within a day or two he fancied that he could write again,
but on taking the pen into his hand, his fingers could not clasp it, and he sank back with
tears rolling down his cheek. Later, when Laidlaw said in his hearing that Sir Walter had had
a little repose, he replied, "No, Willie; no repose for Sir Walter but in the grave." As the
tears rushed from his eyes, his old pride revived. "Friends," he said, "don't let me expose
myself--get me to bed,--that is the only place."

After this Sir Walter never left his room. Occasionally he dropped off into delirium, and the
old painful memory,--that cry of "Burk Sir Walter,"--might be again heard on his lips. He lingered,
however, till the 21st September,--more than two months from the day of his reaching home,
and a year from the day of Wordsworth's arrival at Abbotsford before his departure for the
Mediterranean, with only one clear interval of consciousness, on Monday, the 17th September.
On that day Mr. Lockhart was called to Sir Walter's bedside with the news that he had awakened
in a state of composure and consciousness, and wished to see him. Poor souls! I know they were
up all night. God bless you all!'" With this he sank into a very tranquil sleep, and, indeed,
he scarcely afterwards gave any sign of consciousness except for an instant on the arrival
of his sons. And so four days afterwards, on the day of the autumnal equinox in 1832, at half-past
one in the afternoon, on a glorious autumn day, with every window wide open, and the ripple
of the Tweed over its pebbles distinctly audible in his room, he passed away, and "his eldest
son kissed and closed his eyes." He died a month after completing his sixty-first year. Nearly
seven years earlier, on the 7th December, 1825, he had in his diary taken a survey of his own
health in relation to the age reached by his father and other members of his family, and had
stated as the result of his considerations, "Square the odds and good night, Sir Walter, about
sixty. I care not if I leave my name unstained and my family property settled. Sat est vixisse."
Thus he lived just a year--but a year of gradual death--beyond his own calculation.

CHAPTER XVII.

THE END OF THE STRUGGLE.

Sir Walter certainly left his "name unstained," unless the serious mistakes natural to a sanguine
temperament such as his, are to be counted as stains upon his name; and if they are, where
among the sons of men would you find many unstained names as noble as his with such a stain
upon it? He was not only sensitively honourable in motive, but, when he found what evil his
sanguine temper had worked, he used his gigantic powers to repair it, as Samson used his great
strength to repair the mischief he had inadvertently done to Israel. But with all his exertions
he had not, when death came upon him, cleared off much more than half his obligations. There
was still 54,000l. to pay. But of this, 22,000l. was secured in an insurance on his life, and
there were besides a thousand pounds or two in the hands of the trustees, which had not been
applied to the extinction of the debt. Mr. Cadell, his publisher, accordingly advanced the
remaining 30,000l. on the security of Sir Walter's copyrights, and on the 21st February, 1833,
the general creditors were paid in full, and Mr. Cadell remained the only creditor of the estate.
In February, 1847, Sir Walter's son, the second baronet, died childless; and in May, 1847,
Mr. Cadell gave a discharge in full of all claims, including the bond for 10,000l. executed
by Sir Walter during the struggles of Constable and Co. to prevent a failure, on the transfer
to him of all the copyrights of Sir Walter, including "the results of some literary exertions
of the sole surviving executor," which I conjecture to mean the copyright of the admirable
biography of Sir Walter Scott in ten volumes, to which I have made such a host of references--probably
the most perfect specimen of a biography rich in great materials, which our language contains.
And thus, nearly fifteen years after Sir Walter's death, the debt which, within six years,
he had more than half discharged, was at last, through the value of the copyrights he had left
behind him, finally extinguished, and the small estate of Abbotsford left cleared.

Sir Walter's effort to found a new house was even less successful than the effort to endow
it. His eldest son died childless. In 1839 he went to Madras, as Lieutenant-Colonel of the
15th Hussars, and subsequently commanded that regiment. He was as much beloved by the officers
of his regiment as his father had been by his own friends, and was in every sense an accomplished
soldier, and one whose greatest anxiety it was to promote the welfare of the privates as well
as of the officers of his regiment. He took great pains in founding a library for the soldiers
of his corps, and his only legacy out of his own family was one of 100l. to this library. The
cause of his death was his having exposed himself rashly to the sun in a tiger-hunt, in August,
1846; he never recovered from the fever which was the immediate consequence. Ordered home for
his health, he died near the Cape of Good Hope, on the 8th of February, 1847. His brother Charles
died before him. He was rising rapidly in the diplomatic service, and was taken to Persia by
Sir John MacNeill, on a diplomatic mission, as attaché and private secretary. But the climate
struck him down, and he died at Teheran, almost immediately on his arrival, on the 28th October,
1841. Both the sisters had died previously. Anne Scott, the younger of the two, whose health
had suffered greatly during the prolonged anxiety of her father's illness, died on the Midsummer-day
of the year following her father's death; and Sophia, Mrs. Lockhart, died on the 17th May,
1837. Sir Walter's eldest grandchild, John Hugh Lockhart, for whom the Tales of a Grandfather
were written, died before his grandfather; indeed Sir Walter heard of the child's death at
Naples. The second son, Walter Scott Lockhart Scott, a lieutenant in the army, died at Versailles,
on the 10th January, 1853. Charlotte Harriet Jane Lockhart, who was married in 1847 to James
Robert Hope-Scott, and succeeded to the Abbotsford estate, died at Edinburgh, on the 26th October,
1858, leaving three children, of whom only one survives. Walter Michael and Margaret Anne Hope-Scott
both died in infancy. The only direct descendant, therefore, of Sir Walter Scott, is now Mary
Monica Hope-Scott who was born on the 2nd October, 1852, the grandchild of Mrs. Lockhart, and
the great-grandchild of the founder of Abbotsford.

There is something of irony in such a result of the Herculean labours of Scott to found and
endow a new branch of the clan of Scott. When fifteen years after his death the estate was
at length freed from debt, all his own children and the eldest of his grandchildren were dead;
and now forty-six years have elapsed, and there only remains one girl of his descendants to
borrow his name and live in the halls of which he was so proud. And yet this, and this only,
was wanting to give something of the grandeur of tragedy to the end of Scott's great enterprise.
He valued his works little compared with the house and lands which they were to be the means
of gaining for his descendants; yet every end for which he struggled so gallantly is all but
lost, while his works have gained more of added lustre from the losing battle which he fought
so long, than they could ever have gained from his success.

What there was in him of true grandeur could never have been seen, had the fifth act of his
life been less tragic than it was. Generous, large-hearted, and magnanimous as Scott was, there
was something in the days of his prosperity that fell short of what men need for their highest
ideal of a strong man. Unbroken success, unrivalled popularity, imaginative effort flowing
almost as steadily as the current of a stream,--these are characteristics, which, even when
enhanced as they were in his case, by the power to defy physical pain, and to live in his imaginative
world when his body was writhing in torture, fail to touch the heroic point. And there was
nothing in Scott, while he remained prosperous, to relieve adequately the glare of triumphant
prosperity. His religious and moral feeling, though strong and sound, was purely regulative,
and not always even regulative, where his inward principle was not reflected in the opinions
of the society in which he lived. The finer spiritual element in Scott was relatively deficient,
and so the strength of the natural man was almost too equal, complete, and glaring. Something
that should "tame the glaring white" of that broad sunshine, was needed; and in the years of
reverse, when one gift after another was taken away, till at length what he called even his
"magic wand" was broken, and the old man struggled on to the last, without bitterness, without
defiance, without murmuring, but not without such sudden flashes of subduing sweetness as melted
away the anger of the teacher of his childhood,--that something seemed to be supplied. Till
calamity came, Scott appeared to be a nearly complete natural man, and no more. Then first
was perceived in him something above nature, something which could endure though every end
in life for which he had fought so boldly should be defeated,--something which could endure
and more than endure, which could shoot a soft transparence of its own through his years of
darkness and decay. That there was nothing very elevated in Scott's personal or moral, or political
or literary ends,--that he never for a moment thought of himself as one who was bound to leave
the earth better than he found it,--that he never seems to have so much as contemplated a social
or political reform for which he ought to contend,--that he lived to some extent like a child
blowing soap-bubbles, the brightest and most gorgeous of which--the Abbotsford bubble--vanished
before his eyes, is not a take-off from the charm of his career, but adds to it the very speciality
of its fascination. For it was his entire unconsciousness of moral or spiritual efforts, the
simple straightforward way in which he laboured for ends of the most ordinary kind, which made
it clear how much greater the man was than his ends, how great was the mind and character which
prosperity failed to display, but which became visible at once so soon as the storm came down
and the night fell. Few men who battle avowedly for the right, battle for it with the calm
fortitude, the cheerful equanimity, with which Scott battled to fulfil his engagements and
to save his family from ruin.

And it was because the man was so much greater than the ends for which he strove, that there
is a sort of grandeur in the tragic fate which denied them to him, and yet exhibited to all
the world the infinite superiority of the striver himself to the toy he was thus passionately
craving.

THE END.
