3 Thomas Proby was Chirurgeon-General in Ireland from 1699 until his death in 1761. In his
Short Character of Thomas, Earl of Wharton, Swift speaks of him as "a person universally esteemed,"
who had been badly treated by Lord Wharton. In 1724 Proby's son, a captain in the army, was
accused of popery, and Swift wrote to Lord Carteret that the charge was generally believed
to be false: "The father is the most universally beloved of any man I ever knew in his station....
You cannot do any personal thing more acceptable to the people of Ireland than in inclining
towards lenity to Mr. Proby and his family." Proby was probably a near relative of Sir Thomas
Proby, Bart., M.P., of Elton, Hunts, at whose death in 1689 the baronetcy expired. Mrs. Proby
seems to have been a Miss Spencer.

4 Meliora, daughter of Thomas Coningsby, Baron of Clanbrassil and Earl of Coningsby, and wife
of Sir Thomas Southwell, afterwards Baron Southwell, one of the Commissioners of Revenue in
Ireland, and a member of the Irish Privy Council. Lady Southwell died in 1736.

5 Lady Betty Rochfort was the daughter of Henry Moore, third Earl of Drogheda. Her husband,
George Rochfort, M.P. for Westmeath, was son of Robert Rochfort, an Irish judge, and brother
of Robert Rochford, M.P., to whose wife Swift addressed his Advice to a very Young Lady on
her Marriage. Lady Betty's son Robert was created Earl of Belvedere in 1757.

9 The word "trangram" or "tangram" ordinarily means a toy or gimcrack, or trumpery article.

which thou hast stolen or purloined." Apparently "trangum" here means a tally.
