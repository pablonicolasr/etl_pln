THE LITTLE LAME PRINCE

CHAPTER I

Yes, he was the most beautiful Prince that ever was born.

Of course, being a prince, people said this; but it was true besides. When he looked at the
candle, his eyes had an expression of earnest inquiry quite startling in a new born baby. His
nose--there was not much of it certainly, but what there was seemed an aquiline shape; his
complexion was a charming, healthy purple; he was round and fat, straight-limbed and long--in
fact, a splendid baby, and everybody was exceedingly proud of him, especially his father and
mother, the King and Queen of Nomansland, who had waited for him during their happy reign of
ten years--now made happier than ever, to themselves and their subjects, by the appearance
of a son and heir.

The only person who was not quite happy was the King's brother, the heir presumptive, who would
have been king one day had the baby not been born. But as his majesty was very kind to him,
and even rather sorry for him--insomuch that at the Queen's request he gave him a dukedom almost
as big as a county--the Crown-Prince, as he was called, tried to seem pleased also; and let
us hope he succeeded.

The Prince's christening was to be a grand affair. According to the custom of the country,
there were chosen for him four-and-twenty god-fathers and godmothers, who each had to give
him a name, and promise to do their utmost for him. When he came of age, he himself had to
choose the name--and the godfather or god-mother--that he liked the best, for the rest of his days.

Meantime all was rejoicing. Subscriptions were made among the rich to give pleasure to the
poor; dinners in town-halls for the workingmen; tea-parties in the streets for their wives;
and milk-and-bun feasts for the children in the schoolrooms. For Nomansland, though I cannot
point it out in any map, or read of it in any history, was, I believe, much like our own or
many another country.

As for the palace--which was no different from other palaces--it was clean "turned out of the
windows," as people say, with the preparations going on. The only quiet place in it was the
room which, though the Prince was six weeks old, his mother the Queen had never quitted. Nobody
said she was ill, however--it would have been so inconvenient; and as she said nothing about
it herself, but lay pale and placid, giving no trouble to anybody, nobody thought much about
her. All the world was absorbed in admiring the baby.

The christening-day came at last, and it was as lovely as the Prince himself. All the people
in the palace were lovely too--or thought themselves so--in the elegant new clothes which the
Queen, who thought of everybody, had taken care to give them, from the ladies-in-waiting down
to the poor little kitchen-maid, who looked at herself in her pink cotton gown, and thought,
doubtless, that there never was such a pretty girl as she.

By six in the morning all the royal household had dressed itself in its very best; and then
the little Prince was dressed in his best--his magnificent christening robe; which proceeding
his Royal Highness did not like at all, but kicked and screamed like any common baby. When
he had a little calmed down, they carried him to be looked at by the Queen his mother, who,
though her royal robes had been brought and laid upon the bed, was, as everybody well knew,
quite unable to rise and put them on.

She admired her baby very much; kissed and blessed him, and lay looking at him, as she did
for hours sometimes, when he was placed beside her fast asleep; then she gave him up with a
gentle smile, and, saying she hoped he would be very good, that it would be a very nice christening,
and all the guests would enjoy themselves, turned peacefully over on her bed, saying nothing
more to anybody. She was a very uncomplaining person, the Queen--and her name was Dolorez.

Everything went on exactly as if she had been present. All, even the king himself, had grown
used to her absence; for she was not strong, and for years had not joined in any gayeties.
She always did her royal duties, but as to pleasures, they could go on quite well without her,
or it seemed so. The company arrived: great and notable persons in this and neighboring countries;
also the four-and-twenty godfathers and godmothers, who had been chosen with care, as the people
who would be most useful to his royal highness should he ever want friends, which did not seem
likely. What such want could possibly happen to the heir of the powerful monarch of Nomansland?

They came, walking two and two, with their coronets on their heads--being dukes and duchesses,
princes and princesses, or the like; they all kissed the child and pronounced the name each
had given him. Then the four-and-twenty names were shouted out with great energy by six heralds,
one after the other, and afterward written down, to be preserved in the state records, in readiness
for the next time they were wanted, which would be either on his Royal Highness' coronation
or his funeral.

Soon the ceremony was over, and everybody satisfied; except, perhaps, the little Prince himself,
who moaned faintly under his christening robes, which nearly smothered him.

In truth, though very few knew, the Prince in coming to the chapel had met with a slight disaster.
His nurse,--not his ordinary one, but the state nurse-maid,--an elegant and fashionable young
lady of rank, whose duty it was to carry him to and from the chapel, had been so occupied in
arranging her train with one hand, while she held the baby with the other, that she stumbled
and let him fall, just at the foot of the marble staircase.

To be sure, she contrived to pick him up again the next minute; and the accident was so slight
it seemed hardly worth speaking of. Consequently nobody did speak of it. The baby had turned
deadly pale, but did not cry, so no person a step or two behind could discover anything wrong;
afterward, even if he had moaned, the silver trumpets were loud enough to drown his voice.
It would have been a pity to let anything trouble such a day of felicity.

So, after a minute's pause, the procession had moved on. Such a procession t Heralds in blue
and silver; pages in crimson and gold; and a troop of little girls in dazzling white, carrying
baskets of flowers, which they strewed all the way before the nurse and child--finally the
four-and-twenty godfathers and godmothers, as proud as possible, and so splendid to look at
that they would have quite extinguished their small godson--merely a heap of lace and muslin
with a baby face inside--had it not been for a canopy of white satin and ostrich feathers which
was held over him wherever he was carried.

Thus, with the sun shining on them through the painted windows, they stood; the king and his
train on one side, the Prince and his attendants on the other, as pretty a sight as ever was
seen out of fairyland.

"It's just like fairyland," whispered the eldest little girl to the next eldest, as she shook
the last rose out of her basket; "and I think the only thing the Prince wants now is a fairy
god-mother."

"Does he?" said a shrill but soft and not unpleasant voice behind; and there was seen among
the group of children somebody,--not a child, yet no bigger than a child,--somebody whom nobody
had seen before, and who certainly had not been invited, for she had no christening clothes on.

She was a little old woman dressed all in gray: gray gown; gray hooded cloak, of a material
excessively fine, and a tint that seemed perpetually changing, like the gray of an evening
sky. Her hair was gray, and her eyes also--even her complexion had a soft gray shadow over
it. But there was nothing unpleasantly old about her, and her smile was as sweet and childlike
as the Prince's own, which stole over his pale little face the instant she came near enough
to touch him.

"Take care! Don't let the baby fall again."

The grand young lady nurse started, flushing angrily.

"Who spoke to me? How did anybody know?--I mean, what business has anybody----" Then frightened,
but still speaking in a much sharper tone than I hope young ladies of rank are in the habit
of speaking--"Old woman, you will be kind enough not to say 'the baby,' but 'the Prince.' Keep
away; his Royal Highness is just going to sleep."

"Nevertheless I must kiss him. I am his god-mother."

"You!" cried the elegant lady nurse.

"You!" repeated all the gentlemen and ladies-in-waiting.

"You!" echoed the heralds and pages--and they began to blow the silver trumpets in order to
stop all further conversation.

The Prince's procession formed itself for returning,--the King and his train having already
moved off toward the palace,--but on the top-most step of the marble stairs stood, right in
front of all, the little old woman clothed in gray.

She stretched herself on tiptoe by the help of her stick, and gave the little Prince three kisses.

"This is intolerable!" cried the young lady nurse, wiping the kisses off rapidly with her lace
handkerchief. "Such an insult to his Royal Highness! Take yourself out of the way, old woman,
or the King shall be informed immediately."

"The King knows nothing of me, more's the pity," replied the old woman, with an indifferent
air, as if she thought the loss was more on his Majesty's side than hers. "My friend in the
palace is the King's wife."

"King's have not wives, but queens," said the lady nurse, with a contemptuous air.

"You are right," replied the old woman. "Nevertheless I know her Majesty well, and I love her
and her child. And--since you dropped him on the marble stairs (this she said in a mysterious
whisper, which made the young lady tremble in spite of her anger)--I choose to take him for
my own, and be his godmother, ready to help him whenever he wants me."

"You help him!" cried all the group breaking into shouts of laughter, to which the little old
woman paid not the slightest attention. Her soft gray eyes were fixed on the Prince, who seemed
to answer to the look, smiling again and again in the causeless, aimless fashion that babies
do smile.

"His Majesty must hear of this," said a gentleman-in-waiting.

"His Majesty will hear quite enough news in a minute or two," said the old woman sadly. And
again stretching up to the little Prince, she kissed him on the forehead solemnly.

"Be called by a new name which nobody has ever thought of. Be Prince Dolor, in memory of your
mother Dolorez."

"In memory of!" Everybody started at the ominous phrase, and also at a most terrible breach
of etiquette which the old woman had committed. In Nomansland, neither the king nor the queen
was supposed to have any Christian name at all. They dropped it on their coronation day, and
it never was mentioned again till it was engraved on their coffins when they died.

"Old woman, you are exceedingly ill-bred," cried the eldest lady-in-waiting, much horrified.
"How you could know the fact passes my comprehension. But even if you did know it, how dared
you presume to hint that her most gracious Majesty is called Dolorez?"

"WAS called Dolorez," said the old woman, with a tender solemnity.

The first gentleman, called the Gold-stick-in-waiting, raised it to strike her, and all the
rest stretched out their hands to seize her; but the gray mantle melted from between their
fingers like air; and, before anybody had time to do anything more, there came a heavy, muffled,
startling sound.

The great bell of the palace the bell which was only heard on the death of some one of the
royal family, and for as many times as he or she was years old--began to toll. They listened,
mute and horror-stricken. Some one counted: one--two--three--four--up to nine-and-twenty--just
the Queen's age.

It was, indeed, the Queen. Her Majesty was dead! In the midst of the festivities she had slipped
away out of her new happiness and her old sufferings, not few nor small. Sending away all her
women to see the grand sight,--at least they said afterward, in excuse, that she had done so,
and it was very like her to do it,--she had turned with her face to the window, whence one
could just see the tops of the distant mountains--the Beautiful Mountains, as they were called--where
she was born. So gazing, she had quietly died.

When the little Prince was carried back to his mother's room, there was no mother to kiss him.
And, though he did not know it, there would be for him no mother's kiss any more. As for his
godmother,--the little old woman in gray who called herself so,--whether she melted into air,
like her gown when they touched it, or whether she flew out of the chapel window, or slipped
through the doorway among the bewildered crowd, nobody knew--nobody ever thought about her.

Only the nurse, the ordinary homely one, coming out of the Prince's nursery in the middle of
the night in search of a cordial to quiet his continual moans, saw, sitting in the doorway,
something which she would have thought a mere shadow, had she not seen shining out of it two
eyes, gray and soft and sweet. She put her hand before her own, screaming loudly. When she
took them away the old woman was gone.

CHAPTER II

Everybody was very kind to the poor little prince. I think people generally are kind to motherless
children, whether princes or peasants. He had a magnificent nursery and a regular suite of
attendants, and was treated with the greatest respect and state. Nobody was allowed to talk
to him in silly baby language, or dandle him, or, above all to kiss him, though perhaps some
people did it surreptitiously, for he was such a sweet baby that it was difficult to help it.

It could not be said that the Prince missed his mother--children of his age cannot do that;
but somehow after she died everything seemed to go wrong with him. From a beautiful baby he
became sickly and pale, seeming to have almost ceased growing, especially in his legs, which
had been so fat and strong. 

Were he to go, should he be jovial before the wedding party or should he be sober and saturnine?
Should he appear to have forgotten his love, or should he go about lovelorn among the wedding
guests?

It was impossible,--at any rate impossible as yet,--that he should fall into that state of almost
brotherly regard which it was so natural that she should desire.

But as he had determined to forgive her, he went across that afternoon to the house and was the
bearer of his own answer. He asked Mrs. Hopkins who came to the door whether she were alone, and
was then shown into an empty room where he waited for her. She came to him as quickly as she could,
leaving Lady Ushant in the middle of the page she was reading, and feeling as she tripped downstairs
that the colour was rushing to her face. "You will come, Larry," she said.

"No, Miss Masters."

"Let me be Mary till I am Mrs. Morton," she said, trying to smile.

"I was always Mary." And then she burst into tears. "Why,--why won't you come?"

"I should only stalk about like a ghost. I couldn't be merry as a man should be at a wedding. I don't
see how a man is to do such a thing." She looked up into his face imploring him,--not to come,
for that she felt now to be impossible, but imploring him to express in some way forgiveness of
the sin she had committed against him. "But I shall think of you and shall wish you well."

"And
after that we shall be friends?"

"By and bye,--if he pleases."

"He will please;--he does please.

Of course he saw what I wrote to you. And now, Larry, if I have ever treated you badly, say
that you pardon me."

"If I had known it--" he said.

"How could I tell you,--till he had spoken? And yet I knew it myself!

It has been so,--oh,--ever so long! What could I do? You will say that you will forgive me."

"Yes;
I will say that."

"And you will not go away from Chowton?"

"Oh, no! They tell me I ought to stay here, and I suppose I shall
stay.

I thought I'd just come over and say a word.

I'm going away to-morrow for a month. There is a fellow has got some
fishing in Ireland.

Good-bye."

"Good-bye, Larry."

"And I thought perhaps you'd take this now."

Then he brought out from his pocket at little ruby ring which he had carried often in his pocket
to the attorney's house, thinking that perhaps then might come the
happy hour in which he could get her to accept it.

But the hour had never come as yet, and the ring had remained in the little drawer beneath
his looking-glass. It need hardly be said that she now accepted the gift.

CHAPTER XXVI

Conclusion
The Senator for Mickewa, whose name we have taken for a book which
might perhaps have been better called "The Chronicle of a Winter at
Dillsborough"--did not stay long in London after the unfortunate close
of his lecture. He was a man not very pervious to criticism, nor afraid
of it, but he did not like the treatment he had received at St. James's
Hall, nor the remarks which his lecture produced in the newspapers.
He was angry because people were unreasonable with him, which was
surely unreasonable in him who accused Englishmen generally of want
of reason. One ought to take it as a matter of course that a bull
should use his horns, and a wolf his teeth. The Senator read everything
that was said of him, and then wrote numerous letters to the different
journals which had condemned him. Had any one accused him of an untruth?
Or had his inaccuracies been glaring? Had he not always expressed
his readiness to acknowledge his own mistake if convicted of ignorance?
But when he was told that he had persistently trodden upon all the
corns of his English cousins, he declared that corns were evil things
which should be abolished, and that with corns such as these there
was no mode of abolition so efficacious as treading on them.

"I am
sorry that you should have encountered anything so unpleasant," Lord
Drummond said to him when he went to bid adieu to his friend at the
Foreign Office.

"And I am sorry too, my Lord;--for your sake rather
than my own. A man is in a bad case who cannot endure to hear of his
faults."

"Perhaps you take our national sins a little too much for
granted."

"I don't think so, my Lord. If you knew me to be wrong
you would not be so sore with me. For which unluckily good memory all the others scolded her so
severely that she had no peace of her life, and soon after, by the influence of the young lady
nurse who had carried the baby that fatal day, and who was a sort of connection of the Crown-Prince--being
his wife's second cousin once removed--the poor woman was pensioned off and sent to the Beautiful
Mountains from whence she came, with orders to remain there for the rest of her days.

But of all this the King knew nothing, for, indeed, after the first shock of finding out that
his son could not walk, and seemed never likely to he interfered very little concerning him.
The whole thing was too painful, and his Majesty never liked painful things. Sometimes he inquired
after Prince Dolor, and they told him his Royal Highness was going on as well as could be expected,
which really was the case. For, after worrying the poor child and perplexing themselves with
one remedy after another, the Crown-Prince, not wishing to offend any of the differing doctors,
had proposed leaving him to Nature; and Nature, the safest doctor of all, had come to his help
and done her best.

He could not walk, it is true; his limbs were mere useless appendages to his body; but the
body itself was strong and sound. And his face was the same as ever--just his mother's face,
one of the sweetest in the world.

Even the King, indifferent as he was, sometimes looked at the little fellow with sad tenderness,
noticing how cleverly he learned to crawl and swing himself about by his arms, so that in his
own awkward way he was as active in motion as most children of his age.

"Poor little man! he does his best, and he is not unhappy--not half so unhappy as I, brother,"
addressing the Crown-Prince, who was more constant than ever in his attendance upon the sick
monarch. "If anything should befall me, I have appointed you Regent. In case of my death, you
will take care of my poor little boy?"

"Certainly, certainly; but do not let us imagine any such misfortune. I assure your Majesty--everybody
will assure you--that it is not in the least likely."

He knew, however, and everybody knew, that it was likely, and soon after it actually did happen.
The King died as suddenly and quietly as the Queen had done--indeed, in her very room and bed;
and Prince Dolor was left without either father or mother--as sad a thing as could happen,
even to a prince.

He was more than that now, though. He was a king. In Nomansland, as in other countries, the
people were struck with grief one day and revived the next. "The king is dead--long live the
king!" was the cry that rang through the nation, and almost before his late Majesty had been
laid beside the Queen in their splendid mausoleum, crowds came thronging from all parts to
the royal palace, eager to see the new monarch.

They did see him,--the Prince Regent took care they should,--sitting on the floor of the council
chamber, sucking his thumb! And when one of the gentlemen-in-waiting lifted him up and carried
him--fancy carrying a king!--to the chair of state, and put the crown on his head, he shook
it off again, it was so heavy and uncomfortable. Sliding down to the foot of the throne he
began playing with the golden lions that supported it, stroking their paws and putting his
tiny fingers into their eyes, and laughing--laughing as if he had at last found something to
amuse him.

"There's a fine king for you!" said the first lord-in-waiting, a friend of the Prince Regent's
(the Crown-Prince that used to be, who, in the deepest mourning, stood silently beside the
throne of his young nephew. He was a handsome man, very grand and clever-looking). "What a
king! who can never stand to receive his subjects, never walk in processions, who to the last
day of his life will have to be carried about like a baby. Very unfortunate!"

"Exceedingly unfortunate," repeated the second lord. "It is always bad for a nation when its
king is a child; but such a child--a permanent cripple, if not worse."

"Let us hope not worse," said the first lord in a very hopeless tone, and looking toward the
Regent, who stood erect and pretended to hear nothing. "I have heard that these sort of children
with very large heads, and great broad fore-heads and staring eyes, are--well, well, let us
hope for the best and be prepared for the worst. In the meantime----"

"I swear," said the Crown-Prince, coming forward and kissing the hilt of his sword--"I swear
to perform my duties as Regent, to take all care of his Royal Highness--his Majesty, I mean,"
with a grand bow to the little child, who laughed innocently back again. "And I will do my
humble best to govern the country. Still, if the country has the slightest objection----"

But the Crown-Prince being generalissimo, having the whole army at his beck and call, so that
he could have begun a civil war in no time, the country had, of course, not the slightest objection.

So the King and Queen slept together in peace, and Prince Dolor reigned over the land--that
is, his uncle did; and everybody said what a fortunate thing it was for the poor little Prince
to have such a clever uncle to take care of him.

All things went on as usual; indeed, after the Regent had brought his wife and her seven sons,
and established them in the palace, rather better than usual. For they gave such splendid entertainments
and made the capital so lively that trade revived, and the country was said to be more flourishing
than it had been for a century. Whenever the Regent and his sons appeared, they were received
with shouts: "Long live the Crown-Prince!" "Long live the royal family!" And, in truth, they
were very fine children, the whole seven of them, and made a great show when they rode out
together on seven beautiful horses, one height above another, down to the youngest, on his
tiny black pony, no bigger than a large dog.

As for the other child, his Royal Highness Prince Dolor,--for somehow people soon ceased to
call him his Majesty, which seemed such a ridiculous title for a poor little fellow, a helpless
cripple,--with only head and trunk, and no legs to speak of,--he was seen very seldom by anybody.

Sometimes people daring enough to peer over the high wall of the palace garden noticed there,
carried in a footman's arms, or drawn in a chair, or left to play on the grass, often with
nobody to mind him, a pretty little boy, with a bright, intelligent face and large, melancholy
eyes--no, not exactly melancholy, for they were his mother's, and she was by no means sad-minded,
but thoughtful and dreamy. They rather perplexed people, those childish eyes; they were so
exceedingly innocent and yet so penetrating. If anybody did a wrong thing--told a lie, for
instance they would turn round with such a grave, silent surprise the child never talked much--that
every naughty person in the palace was rather afraid of Prince Dolor.

He could not help it, and perhaps he did not even know it, being no better a child than many
other children, but there was something about him which made bad people sorry, and grumbling
people ashamed of themselves, and ill-natured people gentle and kind.

I suppose because they were touched to see a poor little fellow who did not in the least know
what had befallen him or what lay before him, living his baby life as happy as the day is long.
Thus, whether or not he was good himself, the sight of him and his affliction made other people
good, and, above all, made everybody love him--so much so, that his uncle the Regent began
to feel a little uncomfortable.

Now, I have nothing to say against uncles in general. They are usually very excellent people,
and very convenient to little boys and girls. Even the "cruel uncle" of the "Babes in the Wood"
I believe to be quite an exceptional character. And this "cruel uncle" of whom I am telling
was, I hope, an exception, too.

He did not mean to be cruel. If anybody had called him so, he would have resented it extremely:
he would have said that what he did was done entirely for the good of the country. But he was
a man who had always been accustomed to consider himself first and foremost, believing that
whatever he wanted was sure to be right, and therefore he ought to have it. So he tried to
get it, and got it too, as people like him very often do. Whether they enjoy it when they have
it is another question.

Therefore he went one day to the council chamber, determined on making a speech, and informing
the ministers and the country at large that the young King was in failing health, and that
it would be advisable to send him for a time to the Beautiful Mountains. Whether he really
meant to do this, or whether it occurred to him afterward that there would be an easier way
of attaining his great desire, the crown of Nomansland, is a point which I cannot decide.

But soon after, when he had obtained an order in council to send the King away, which was done
in great state, with a guard of honor composed of two whole regiments of soldiers,--the nation
learned, without much surprise, that the poor little Prince--nobody ever called him king now--had
gone a much longer journey than to the Beautiful Mountains.

He had fallen ill on the road and died within a few hours; at least so declared the physician
in attendance and the nurse who had been sent to take care of him. They brought his coffin
back in great state, and buried it in the mausoleum with his parents.

So Prince Dolor was seen no more. The country went into deep mourning for him, and then forgot
him, and his uncle reigned in his stead. That illustrious personage accepted his crown with
great decorum, and wore it with great dignity to the last. But whether he enjoyed it or not
there is no evidence to show.

CHAPTER III

And what of the little lame Prince, whom everybody seemed so easily to have forgotten?

Not everybody. There were a few kind souls, mothers of families, who had heard his sad story,
and some servants about the palace, who had been familiar with his sweet ways--these many a
time sighed and said, "Poor Prince Dolor!" Or, looking at the Beautiful Mountains, which were
visible all over Nomansland, though few people ever visited them, "Well, perhaps his Royal
Highness is better where he is than even there."

They did not know--indeed, hardly anybody did know--that beyond the mountains, between them
and the sea, lay a tract of country, barren, level, bare, except for short, stunted grass,
and here and there a patch of tiny flowers. Not a bush--not a tree not a resting place for
bird or beast was in that dreary plain. In summer the sunshine fell upon it hour after hour
with a blinding glare; in winter the winds and rains swept over it unhindered, and the snow
came down steadily, noiselessly, covering it from end to end in one great white sheet, which
lay for days and weeks unmarked by a single footprint.

Not a pleasant place to live in--and nobody did live there, apparently. The only sign that
human creatures had ever been near the spot was one large round tower which rose up in the
center of the plain, and might be seen all over it--if there had been anybody to see, which
there never was. Rose right up out of the ground, as if it had grown of itself, like a mushroom.
But it was not at all mushroom-like; on the contrary, it was very solidly built. In form it
resembled the Irish round towers, which have puzzled people for so long, nobody being able
to find out when, or by whom, or for what purpose they were made; seemingly for no use at all,
like this tower. It was circular, of very firm brickwork, with neither doors nor windows, until
near the top, when you could perceive some slits in the wall through which one might possibly
creep in or look out. Its height was nearly a hundred feet, and it had a battlemented parapet
showing sharp against the sky.

As the plain was quite desolate--almost like a desert, only without sand, and led to nowhere
except the still more desolate seacoast--nobody ever crossed it. Whatever mystery there was
about the tower, it and the sky and the plain kept their secret to themselves.

It was a very great secret indeed,--a state secret,--which none but so clever a man as the
present King of Nomansland would ever have thought of. How he carried it out, undiscovered,
I cannot tell. People said, long afterward, that it was by means of a gang of condemned criminals,
who were set to work, and executed immediately after they had done, so that nobody knew anything,
or in the least suspected the real fact.

And what was the fact? Why, that this tower, which seemed a mere mass of masonry, utterly forsaken
and uninhabited, was not so at all. Within twenty feet of the top some ingenious architect
had planned a perfect little house, divided into four rooms--as by drawing a cross within a
circle you will see might easily be done. By making skylights, and a few slits in the walls
for windows, and raising a peaked roof which was hidden by the parapet, here was a dwelling
complete, eighty feet from the ground, and as inaccessible as a rook's nest on the top of a tree.

A charming place to live in! if you once got up there,--and never wanted to come down again.

Inside--though nobody could have looked inside except a bird, and hardly even a bird flew past
that lonely tower--inside it was furnished with all the comfort and elegance imaginable; with
lots of books and toys, and everything that the heart of a child could desire. For its only
inhabitant, except a nurse of course, was a poor solitary child.

One winter night, when all the plain was white with moonlight, there was seen crossing it a
great tall black horse, ridden by a man also big and equally black, carrying before him on
the saddle a woman and a child. The woman--she had a sad, fierce look, and no wonder, for she
was a criminal under sentence of death, but her sentence had been changed to almost as severe
a punishment. She was to inhabit the lonely tower with the child, and was allowed to live as
long as the child lived--no longer. This in order that she might take the utmost care of him;
for those who put him there were equally afraid of his dying and of his living.

Yet he was only a little gentle boy, with a sweet, sleepy smile--he had been very tired with
his long journey--and clinging arms, which held tight to the man's neck, for he was rather
frightened, and the face, black as it was, looked kindly at him. And he was very helpless,
with his poor, small shriveled legs, which could neither stand nor run away--for the little
forlorn boy was Prince Dolor.

He had not been dead at all--or buried either. His grand funeral had been a mere pretense:
a wax figure having been put in his place, while he himself was spirited away under charge
of these two, the condemned woman and the black man. The latter was deaf and dumb, so could
neither tell nor repeat anything.

When they reached the foot of the tower, there was light enough to see a huge chain dangling
from the parapet, but dangling only halfway. The deaf-mute took from his saddle-wallet a sort
of ladder, arranged in pieces like a puzzle, fitted it together, and lifted it up to meet the
chain. Then he mounted to the top of the tower, and slung from it a sort of chair, in which
the woman and the child placed themselves and were drawn up, never to come down again as long
as they lived. Leaving them there, the man descended the ladder, took it to pieces again and
packed it in his pack, mounted the horse and disappeared across the plain.

Every month they used to watch for him, appearing like a speck in the distance. He fastened
his horse to the foot of the tower, and climbed it, as before, laden with provisions and many
other things. He always saw the Prince, so as to make sure that the child was alive and well,
and then went away until the following month.

While his first childhood lasted Prince Dolor was happy enough. He had every luxury that even
a prince could need, and the one thing wanting,--love,--never having known, he did not miss.
His nurse was very kind to him though she was a wicked woman. But either she had not been quite
so wicked as people said, or she grew better through being shut up continually with a little
innocent child who was dependent upon her for every comfort and pleasure of his life.

It was not an unhappy life. There was nobody to tease or ill-use him, and he was never ill.
He played about from room to room--there were four rooms, parlor, kitchen, his nurse's bedroom,
and his own; learned to crawl like a fly, and to jump like a frog, and to run about on all-fours
almost as fast as a puppy. In fact, he was very much like a puppy or a kitten, as thoughtless
and as merry--scarcely ever cross, though sometimes a little weary.

As he grew older, he occasionally liked to be quiet for a while, and then he would sit at the
slits of windows--which were, however, much bigger than they looked from the bottom of the
tower--and watch the sky above and the ground below, with the storms sweeping over and the
sunshine coming and going, and the shadows of the clouds running races across the blank plain.

By and by he began to learn lessons--not that his nurse had been ordered to teach him, but
she did it partly to amuse herself. She was not a stupid woman, and Prince Dolor was by no
means a stupid boy; so they got on very well, and his continual entreaty, "What can I do? what
can you find me to do?" was stopped, at least for an hour or two in the day.

It was a dull life, but he had never known any other; anyhow, he remembered no other, and he
did not pity himself at all. Not for a long time, till he grew quite a big little boy, and
could read quite easily. Then he suddenly took to books, which the deaf-mute brought him from
time to time--books which, not being acquainted with the literature of Nomansland, I cannot
describe, but no doubt they were very interesting; and they informed him of everything in the
outside world, and filled him with an intense longing to see it.

From this time a change came over the boy. He began to look sad and thin, and to shut himself
up for hours without speaking. For his nurse hardly spoke, and whatever questions he asked
beyond their ordinary daily life she never answered. She had, indeed, been forbidden, on pain
of death, to tell him anything about himself, who he was, or what he might have been.

He knew he was Prince Dolor, because she always addressed him as "My Prince" and "Your Royal
Highness," but what a prince was he had not the least idea. He had no idea of anything in the
world, except what he found in his books.

He sat one day surrounded by them, having built them up round him like a little castle wall.
He had been reading them half the day, but feeling all the while that to read about things
which you never can see is like hearing about a beautiful dinner while you are starving. For
almost the first time in his life he grew melancholy; his hands fell on his lap; he sat gazing
out of the window-slit upon the view outside--the view he had looked at every day of his life,
and might look at for endless days more.

Not a very cheerful view,--just the plain and the sky,--but he liked it. He used to think,
if he could only fly out of that window, up to the sky or down to the plain, how nice it would
be! Perhaps when he died--his nurse had told him once in anger that he would never leave the
tower till he died--he might be able to do this. Not that he understood much what dying meant,
but it must be a change, and any change seemed to him a blessing.

"And I wish I had somebody to tell me all about it--about that and many other things; somebody
that would be fond of me, like my poor white kitten."

Here the tears came into his eyes, for the boy's one friend, the one interest of his life,
had been a little white kitten, which the deaf-mute, kindly smiling, once took out of his pocket
and gave him--the only living creature Prince Dolor had ever seen.

For four weeks it was his constant plaything and companion, till one moonlight night it took
a fancy for wandering, climbed on to the parapet of the tower, dropped over and disappeared.
It was not killed, he hoped, for cats have nine lives; indeed, he almost fancied he saw it
pick itself up and scamper away; but he never caught sight of it more.

"Yes, I wish I had something better than a kitten--a person, a real live person, who would
be fond of me and kind to me. Oh, I want somebody--dreadfully, dreadfully!"

As he spoke, there sounded behind him a slight tap-tap-tap, as of a stick or a cane, and twisting
himself round, he saw--what do you think he saw?

Nothing either frightening or ugly, but still exceedingly curious. A little woman, no bigger
than he might himself have been had his legs grown like those of other children; but she was
not a child--she was an old woman. Her hair was gray, and her dress was gray, and there was
a gray shadow over her wherever she moved. But she had the sweetest smile, the prettiest hands,
and when she spoke it was in the softest voice imaginable.

"My dear little boy,"--and dropping her cane, the only bright and rich thing about her, she
laid those two tiny hands on his shoulders,--"my own little boy, I could not come to you until
you had said you wanted me; but now you do want me, here I am."

"And you are very welcome, madam," replied the Prince, trying to speak politely, as princes
always did in books; "and I am exceedingly obliged to you. May I ask who you are? Perhaps my
mother?" For he knew that little boys usually had a mother, and had occasionally wondered what
had become of his own.

"No," said the visitor, with a tender, half-sad smile, putting back the hair from his forehead,
and looking right into his eyes--"no, I am not your mother, though she was a dear friend of
mine; and you are as like her as ever you can be."

"Will you tell her to come and see me, then?"

"She cannot; but I dare say she knows all about you. And she loves you very much--and so do
I; and I want to help you all I can, my poor little boy."

"Why do you call me poor?" asked Prince Dolor, in surprise.

The little old woman glanced down on his legs and feet, which he did not know were different
from those of other children, and then at his sweet, bright face, which, though he knew not
that either, was exceedingly different from many children's faces, which are often so fretful,
cross, sullen. Looking at him, instead of sighing, she smiled. "I beg your pardon, my Prince,"
said she.

"Yes, I am a prince, and my name is Dolor; will you tell me yours, madam?"

The little old woman laughed like a chime of silver bells.

"I have not got a name--or, rather, I have so many names that I don't know which to choose.
However, it was I who gave you yours, and you will belong to me all your days. I am your godmother."

"Hurrah!" cried the little Prince; "I am glad I belong to you, for I like you very much. Will
you come and play with me?"

So they sat down together and played. By and by they began to talk.

"Are you very dull here?" asked the little old woman.

"Not particularly, thank you, godmother. I have plenty to eat and drink, and my lessons to
do, and my books to read--lots of books."

"And you want nothing?"

"Nothing. Yes--perhaps----If you please, godmother, could you bring me just one more thing?"

"What sort of thing!"

"A little boy to play with."

The old woman looked very sad. "Just the thing, alas I which I cannot give you. My child, I
cannot alter your lot in any way, but I can help you to bear it."

"Thank you. But why do you talk of bearing it? I have nothing to bear."

"My poor little man!" said the old woman in the very tenderest tone of her tender voice. "Kiss me!"

"What is kissing?" asked the wondering child.

His godmother took him in her arms and embraced him many times. By and by he kissed her back
again--at first awkwardly and shyly, then with all the strength of his warm little heart.

"You are better to cuddle than even my white kitten, I think. Promise me that you will never
go away."

"I must; but I will leave a present behind me,--something as good as myself to amuse you,--something
that will take you wherever you want to go, and show you all that you wish to see."

"What is it?"

"A traveling-cloak."

The Prince's countenance fell. "I don't want a cloak, for I never go out. Sometimes nurse hoists
me on to the roof, and carries me round by the parapet; but that is all. I can't walk, you
know, as she does."

"The more reason why you should ride; and besides, this traveling-cloak----"

"Hush!--she's coming."

There sounded outside the room door a heavy step and a grumpy voice, and a rattle of plates
and dishes.

"It's my nurse, and she is bringing my dinner; but I don't want dinner at all--I only want
you. Will her coming drive you away, godmother?"

"Perhaps; but only for a little while. Never mind; all the bolts and bars in the world couldn't
keep me out. I'd fly in at the window, or down through the chimney. Only wish for me, and I come."

"Thank you," said Prince Dolor, but almost in a whisper, for he was very uneasy at what might
happen next. His nurse and his godmother--what would they say to one another? how would they
look at one another?--two such different faces: one harsh-lined, sullen, cross, and sad; the
other sweet and bright and calm as a summer evening before the dark begins.

When the door was flung open, Prince Dolor shut his eyes, trembling all over; opening them
again, he saw he need fear nothing--his lovely old godmother had melted away just like the
rainbow out of the sky, as he had watched it many a time. Nobody but his nurse was in the room.

"What a muddle your Royal Highness is sitting in," said she sharply. "Such a heap of untidy
books; and what's this rubbish?" knocking a little bundle that lay beside them.

"Oh, nothing, nothing--give it me!" cried the Prince, and, darting after it, he hid it under
his pinafore, and then pushed it quickly into his pocket. Rubbish as it was, it was left in
the place where she sat, and might be something belonging to her--his dear, kind godmother,
whom already he loved with all his lonely, tender, passionate heart.

It was, though he did not know this, his wonderful traveling-cloak.

CHAPTER IV

And what of the traveling-cloak? What sort of cloak was it, and what A good did it do the Prince?

Stay, and I'll tell you all about it. Outside it was the commonest-looking bundle imaginable--shabby
and small; and the instant Prince Dolor touched it, it grew smaller still, dwindling down till
he could put it in his trousers pocket, like a handkerchief rolled up into a ball. He did this
at once, for fear his nurse should see it, and kept it there all day--all night, too. Till
after his next morning's lessons he had no opportunity of examining his treasure.

When he did, it seemed no treasure at all; but a mere piece of cloth--circular in form, dark
green in color--that is, if it had any color at all, being so worn and shabby, though not dirty.
It had a split cut to the center, forming a round hole for the neck--and that was all its shape;
the shape, in fact, of those cloaks which in South America are called ponchos--very simple,
but most graceful and convenient.

Prince Dolor had never seen anything like it. In spite of his disappointment, he examined it
curiously; spread it out on the door, then arranged it on his shoulders. It felt very warm
and comfortable; but it was so exceedingly shabby--the only shabby thing that the Prince had
ever seen in his life.

"And what use will it be to me?" said he sadly. "I have no need of outdoor clothes, as I never
go out. Why was this given me, I wonder? and what in the world am I to do with it? She must
be a rather funny person, this dear godmother of mine."

Nevertheless, because she was his godmother, and had given him the cloak, he folded it carefully
and put it away, poor and shabby as it was, hiding it in a safe corner of his top cupboard,
which his nurse never meddled with. He did not want her to find it, or to laugh at it or at
his godmother--as he felt sure she would, if she knew all.

There it lay, and by and by he forgot all about it; nay, I am sorry to say that, being but
a child, and not seeing her again, he almost forgot his sweet old godmother, or thought of
her only as he did of the angels or fairies that he read of in his books, and of her visit
as if it had been a mere dream of the night.

There were times, certainly, when he recalled her: of early mornings, like that morning when
she appeared beside him, and late evenings, when the gray twilight reminded him of the color
of her hair and her pretty soft garments; above all, when, waking in the middle of the night,
with the stars peering in at his window, or the moonlight shining across his little bed, he
would not have been surprised to see her standing beside it, looking at him with those beautiful
tender eyes, which seemed to have a pleasantness and comfort in them different from anything
he had ever known.

But she never came, and gradually she slipped out of his memory--only a boy's memory, after
all; until something happened which made him remember her, and want her as he had never wanted
anything before.

Prince Dolor fell ill. He caught--his nurse could not tell how--a complaint common to the people
of Nomansland, called the doldrums, as unpleasant as measles or any other of our complaints;
and it made him restless, cross, and disagreeable. Even when a little better, he was too weak
to enjoy anything, but lay all day long on his sofa, fidgeting his nurse extremely--while,
in her intense terror lest he might die, she fidgeted him still more. At last, seeing he really
was getting well, she left him to himself--which he was most glad of, in spite of his dullness
and dreariness. There he lay, alone, quite alone.

Now and then an irritable fit came over him, in which he longed to get up and do something,
or to go somewhere--would have liked to imitate his white kitten--jump down from the tower
and run away, taking the chance of whatever might happen.

Only one thing, alas! was likely to happen; for the kitten, he remembered, had four active
legs, while he----

"I wonder what my godmother meant when she looked at my legs and sighed so bitterly? I wonder
why I can't walk straight and steady like my nurse only I wouldn't like to have her great,
noisy, clumping shoes. Still it would be very nice to move about quickly--perhaps to fly, like
a bird, like that string of birds I saw the other day skimming across the sky, one after the
other."

These were the passage-birds--the only living creatures that ever crossed the lonely plain;
and he had been much interested in them, wonder-ing whence they came and whither they were going.

"How nice it must be to be a bird! If legs are no good, why cannot one have wings? People have
wings when they die--perhaps; I wish I were dead, that I do. I am so tired, so tired; and nobody
cares for me. Nobody ever did care for me, except perhaps my godmother. Godmother, dear, have
you quite forsaken me?"

He stretched himself wearily, gathered himself up, and dropped his head upon his hands; as
he did so, he felt somebody kiss him at the back of his neck, and, turning, found that he was
resting, not on the sofa pillows, but on a warm shoulder--that of the little old woman clothed
in gray.

How glad he was to see her! How he looked into her kind eyes and felt her hands, to see if
she were all real and alive! then put both his arms round her neck, and kissed her as if he
would never have done kissing.

"Stop, stop!" cried she, pretending to be smothered. "I see you have not forgotten my teachings.
Kissing is a good thing--in moderation. Only just let me have breath to speak one word."

"A dozen!" he said.

"Well, then, tell me all that has happened to you since I saw you--or, rather, since you saw
me, which is quite a different thing."

"Nothing has happened--nothing ever does happen to me," answered the Prince dolefully.

"And are you very dull, my boy?"

"So dull that I was just thinking whether I could not jump down to the bottom of the tower,
like my white kitten."

"Don't do that, not being a white kitten."

"I wish I were--I wish I were anything but what I am."

"And you can't make yourself any different, nor can I do it either. You must be content to
stay just what you are."

The little old woman said this--very firmly, but gently, too--with her arms round his neck
and her lips on his forehead. It was the first time the boy had ever heard any one talk like
this, and he looked up in surprise--but not in pain, for her sweet manner softened the hardness
of her words.

"Now, my Prince,--for you are a prince, and must behave as such,--let us see what we can do;
how much I can do for you, or show you how to do for yourself. Where is your traveling-cloak?"

Prince Dolor blushed extremely. "I--I put it away in the cupboard; I suppose it is there still."

"You have never used it; you dislike it?"

He hesitated, no; wishing to be impolite. "Don't you think it's--just a little old and shabby
for a prince?"

The old woman laughed--long and loud, though very sweetly.

"Prince, indeed! Why, if all the princes in the world craved for it, they couldn't get it,
unless I gave it them. Old and shabby! It's the most valuable thing imaginable! Very few ever
have it; but I thought I would give it to you, because--because you are different from other
people."

"Am I?" said the Prince, and looked first with curiosity, then with a sort of anxiety, into
his godmother's face, which was sad and grave, with slow tears beginning to steal down.

She touched his poor little legs. "These are not like those of other little boys."

"Indeed!--my nurse never told me that."

"Very likely not. But it is time you were told; and I tell you, because I love you."

"Tell me what, dear godmother?"

"That you will never be able to walk or run or jump or play--that your life will be quite different
from most people's lives; but it may be a very happy life for all that. Do not be afraid."

"I am not afraid," said the boy; but he turned very pale, and his lips began to quiver, though
he did not actually cry--he was too old for that, and, perhaps, too proud.

Though not wholly comprehending, he began dimly to guess what his godmother meant. He had never
seen any real live boys, but he had seen pictures of them running and jumping; which he had
admired and tried hard to imitate but always failed. Now he began to understand why he failed,
and that he always should fail--that, in fact, he was not like other little boys; and it was
of no use his wishing to do as they did, and play as they played, even if he had had them to
play with. His was a separate life, in which he must find out new work and new pleasures for
himself.

The sense of THE INEVITABLE, as grown-up people call it--that we cannot have things as we want
them to be, but as they are, and that we must learn to bear them and make the best of them--this
lesson, which everybody has to learn soon or late--came, alas! sadly soon, to the poor boy.
He fought against it for a while, and then, quite overcome, turned and sobbed bitterly in his
godmother's arms.

She comforted him--I do not know how, except that love always comforts; and then she whispered
to him, in her sweet, strong, cheerful voice: "Never mind!"

"No, I don't think I do mind--that is, I WON'T mind," replied he, catching the courage of her
tone and speaking like a man, though he was still such a mere boy.

"That is right, my Prince!--that is being like a prince. Now we know exactly where we are;
let us put our shoulders to the wheel and----"

"We are in Hopeless Tower" (this was its name, if it had a name), "and there is no wheel to
put our shoulders to," said the child sadly.

"You little matter-of-fact goose! Well for you that you have a godmother called----"

"What?" he eagerly asked.

"Stuff-and-nonsense."

"Stuff-and-nonsense! What a funny name!"

"Some people give it me, but they are not my most intimate friends. These call me--never mind
what," added the old woman, with a soft twinkle in her eyes. "So as you know me, and know me
well, you may give me any name you please; it doesn't matter. But I am your godmother, child.
I have few godchildren; those I have love me dearly, and find me the greatest blessing in all
the world."

"I can well believe it," cried the little lame Prince, and forgot his troubles in looking at
her--as her figure dilated, her eyes grew lustrous as stars, her very raiment brightened, and
the whole room seemed filled with her beautiful and beneficent presence like light.

He could have looked at her forever--half in love, half in awe; but she suddenly dwindled down
into the little old woman all in gray, and, with a malicious twinkle in her eyes, asked for
the traveling-cloak.

"Bring it out of the rubbish cupboard, and shake the dust off it, quick!" said she to Prince
Dolor, who hung his head, rather ashamed. "Spread it out on the floor, and wait till the split
closes and the edges turn up like a rim all round. Then go and open the skylight,--mind, I
say OPEN THE SKYLIGHT,--set yourself down in the middle of it, like a frog on a water-lily
leaf; say 'Abracadabra, dum dum dum,' and--see what will happen!"

The Prince burst into a fit of laughing. It all seemed so exceedingly silly; he wondered that
a wise old woman like his godmother should talk such nonsense.

"Stuff-and-nonsense, you mean," said she, answering, to his great alarm, his unspoken thoughts.
"Did I not tell you some people called me by that name? Never mind; it doesn't harm me."

And she laughed--her merry laugh--as child-like as if she were the Prince's age instead of
her own, whatever that might be. She certainly was a most extraordinary old woman.

"Believe me or not, it doesn't matter," said she. "Here is the cloak: when you want to go traveling
on it, say 'Abracadabra, dum, dum, dum'; when you want to come back again, say 'Abracadabra,
tum tum ti.' That's all; good-by."

A puff of most pleasant air passing by him, and making him feel for the moment quite strong
and well, was all the Prince was conscious of. His most extraordinary godmother was gone.

"Really now, how rosy your Royal Highness' cheeks have grown! You seem to have got well already,"
said the nurse, entering the room.

"I think I have," replied the Prince very gently--he felt gently and kindly even to his grim
nurse. "And now let me have my dinner, and go you to your sewing as usual."

The instant she was gone, however, taking with her the plates and dishes, which for the first
time since his illness he had satisfactorily cleared, Prince Dolor sprang down from his sofa,
and with one or two of his frog-like jumps reached the cupboard where he kept his toys, and
looked everywhere for his traveling-cloak.

Alas! it was not there.

While he was ill of the doldrums, his nurse, thinking it a good opportunity for putting things
to rights, had made a grand clearance of all his "rubbish"--as she considered it: his beloved
headless horses, broken carts, sheep without feet, and birds without wings--all the treasures
of his baby days, which he could not bear to part with. Though he seldom played with them now,
he liked just to feel they were there.

They were all gone and with them the traveling-cloak. He sat down on the floor, looking at
the empty shelves, so beautifully clean and tidy, then burst out sobbing as if his heart would
break.

But quietly--always quietly. He never let his nurse hear him cry. She only laughed at him,
as he felt she would laugh now.

"And it is all my own fault!" he cried. "I ought to have taken better care of my godmother's
gift. Oh, godmother, forgive me! I'll never be so careless again. I don't know what the cloak
is exactly, but I am sure it is something precious. Help me to find it again. Oh, don't let
it be stolen from me--don't, please!"

"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed a silvery voice. "Why, that traveling-cloak is the one thing in the world
which nobody can steal. It is of no use to anybody except the owner. Open your eyes, my Prince,
and see what you shall see."

His dear old godmother, he thought, and turned eagerly round. But no; he only beheld, lying
in a corner of the room, all dust and cobwebs, his precious traveling-cloak.

Prince Dolor darted toward it, tumbling several times on the way, as he often did tumble, poor
boy! and pick himself up again, never complaining. Snatching it to his breast, he hugged and
kissed it, cobwebs and all, as if it had been something alive. Then he began unrolling it,
wondering each minute what would happen. What did happen was so curious that I must leave it
for another chapter.

CHAPTER V

If any reader, big or little, should wonder whether there is a meaning in this story deeper
than that of an ordinary fairy tale, I will own that there is. But I have hidden it so carefully
that the smaller people, and many larger folk, will never find it out, and meantime the book
may be read straight on, like "Cinderella," or "Blue-Beard," or "Hop-o'my-Thumb," for what
interest it has, or what amusement it may bring.

Having said this, I return to Prince Dolor, that little lame boy whom many may think so exceedingly
to be pitied. But if you had seen him as he sat patiently untying his wonderful cloak, which
was done up in a very tight and perplexing parcel, using skillfully his deft little hands,
and knitting his brows with firm determination, while his eyes glistened with pleasure and
energy and eager anticipation--if you had beheld him thus, you might have changed your opinion.

When we see people suffering or unfortunate, we feel very sorry for them; but when we see them
bravely bearing their sufferings and making the best of their misfortunes, it is quite a different
feeling. We respect, we admire them. One can respect and admire even a little child.

When Prince Dolor had patiently untied all the knots, a remarkable thing happened. The cloak
began to undo itself. Slowly unfolding, it laid itself down on the carpet, as flat as if it
had been ironed; the split joined with a little sharp crick-crack, and the rim turned up all
round till it was breast-high; for meantime the cloak had grown and grown, and become quite
large enough for one person to sit in it as comfortable as if in a boat.

The Prince watched it rather anxiously; it was such an extraordinary, not to say a frightening,
thing. However, he was no coward, but a thorough boy, who, if he had been like other boys,
would doubtless have grown up daring and adventurous--a soldier, a sailor, or the like. As
it was, he could only show his courage morally, not physically, by being afraid of nothing,
and by doing boldly all that it was in his narrow powers to do. And I am not sure but that
in this way he showed more real valor than if he had had six pairs of proper legs.

He said to himself: "What a goose I am! As if my dear godmother would ever have given me anything
to hurt me. Here goes!"

So, with one of his active leaps, he sprang right into the middle of the cloak, where he squatted
down, wrapping his arms tight round his knees, for they shook a little and his heart beat fast.
But there he sat, steady and silent, waiting for what might happen next.

Nothing did happen, and he began to think nothing would, and to feel rather disappointed, when
he recollected the words he had been told to repeat--"Abracadabra, dum dum dum!"

He repeated them, laughing all the while, they seemed such nonsense. And then--and then----

Now I don't expect anybody to believe what I am going to relate, though a good many wise people
have believed a good many sillier things. And as seeing's believing, and I never saw it, I
cannot be expected implicitly to believe it myself, except in a sort of a way; and yet there
is truth in it--for some people.

The cloak rose, slowly and steadily, at first only a few inches, then gradually higher and
higher, till it nearly touched the skylight. Prince Dolor's head actually bumped against the
glass, or would have done so had he not crouched down, crying "Oh, please don't hurt me!" in
a most melancholy voice.

Then he suddenly remembered his godmother's express command--"Open the skylight!"

Regaining his courage at once, without a moment's delay he lifted up his head and began searching
for the bolt--the cloak meanwhile remaining perfectly still, balanced in the air. But the minute
the window was opened, out it sailed--right out into the clear, fresh air, with nothing between
it and the cloudless blue.

Prince Dolor had never felt any such delicious sensation before. I can understand it. Cannot
you? Did you never think, in watching the rooks going home singly or in pairs, soaring their
way across the calm evening sky till they vanish like black dots in the misty gray, how pleasant
it must feel to be up there, quite out of the noise and din of the world, able to hear and
see everything down below, yet troubled by nothing and teased by no one--all alone, but perfectly
content?

Something like this was the happiness of the little lame Prince when he got out of Hopeless
Tower, and found himself for the first time in the pure open air, with the sky above him and
the earth below.

True, there was nothing but earth and sky; no houses, no trees, no rivers, mountains, seas--not
a beast on the ground, or a bird in the air. But to him even the level plain looked beautiful;
and then there was the glorious arch of the sky, with a little young moon sitting in the west
like a baby queen. And the evening breeze was so sweet and fresh--it kissed him like his godmother's
kisses; and by and by a few stars came out--first two or three, and then quantities--quantities!
so that when he began to count them he was utterly bewildered.

By this time, however, the cool breeze had become cold; the mist gathered; and as he had, as
he said, no outdoor clothes, poor Prince Dolor was not very comfortable. The dews fell damp
on his curls--he began to shiver.

"Perhaps I had better go home," thought he.

But how? For in his excitement the other words which his godmother had told him to use had
slipped his memory. They were only a little different from the first, but in that slight difference
all the importance lay. As he repeated his "Abracadabra," trying ever so many other syllables
after it, the cloak only went faster and faster, skimming on through the dusky, empty air.

The poor little Prince began to feel frightened. What if his wonderful traveling-cloak should
keep on thus traveling, perhaps to the world's end, carrying with it a poor, tired, hungry
boy, who, after all, was beginning to think there was something very pleasant in supper and bed!

"Dear godmother," he cried pitifully, "do help me! Tell me just this once and I'll never forget
again."

Instantly the words came rushing into his head--"Abracadabra, tum tum ti!" Was that it? Ah!
yes--for the cloak began to turn slowly. He repeated the charm again, more distinctly and firmly,
when it gave a gentle dip, like a nod of satisfaction, and immediately started back, as fast
as ever, in the direction of the tower.

He reached the skylight, which he found exactly as he had left it, and slipped in, cloak and
all, as easily as he had got out. He had scarcely reached the floor, and was still sitting
in the middle of his traveling-cloak,--like a frog on a water-lily leaf, as his godmother had
expressed it,--when he heard his nurse's voice outside.

"Bless us! what has become of your Royal Highness all this time? To sit stupidly here at the
window till it is quite dark, and leave the skylight open, too. Prince! what can you be thinking
of? You are the silliest boy I ever knew."

"Am I?" said he absently, and never heeding her crossness; for his only anxiety was lest she
might find out anything.

She would have been a very clever person to have done so. The instant Prince Dolor got off
it, the cloak folded itself up into the tiniest possible parcel, tied all its own knots, and
rolled itself of its own accord into the farthest and darkest corner of the room. If the nurse
had seen it, which she didn't, she would have taken it for a mere bundle of rubbish not worth
noticing.

Shutting the skylight with an angry bang, she brought in the supper and lit the candles with
her usual unhappy expression of countenance. But Prince Dolor hardly saw it; he only saw, hid
in the corner where nobody else would see it, his wonderful traveling-cloak. And though his
supper was not particularly nice, he ate it heartily, scarcely hearing a word of his nurse's
grumbling, which to-night seemed to have taken the place of her sullen silence.

"Poor woman!" he thought, when he paused a minute to listen and look at her with those quiet,
happy eyes, so like his mother's. "Poor woman! she hasn't got a traveling-cloak!"

And when he was left alone at last, and crept into his little bed, where he lay awake a good
while, watching what he called his "sky-garden," all planted with stars, like flowers, his
chief thought was--"I must be up very early to-morrow morning, and get my lessons done, and
then I'll go traveling all over the world on my beautiful cloak."

So next day he opened his eyes with the sun, and went with a good heart to his lessons. They
had hitherto been the chief amusement of his dull life; now, I am afraid, he found them also
a little dull. But he tried to be good,--I don't say Prince Dolor always was good, but he generally
tried to be,--and when his mind went wandering after the dark, dusty corner where lay his precious
treasure, he resolutely called it back again.

"For," he said, "how ashamed my godmother would be of me if I grew up a stupid boy!"

But the instant lessons were done, and he was alone in the empty room, he crept across the
floor, undid the shabby little bundle, his fingers trembling with eagerness, climbed on the
chair, and thence to the table, so as to unbar the skylight,--he forgot nothing now,--said
his magic charm, and was away out of the window, as children say, "in a few minutes less than
no time."

Nobody missed him. He was accustomed to sit so quietly always that his nurse, though only in
the next room, perceived no difference. And besides, she might have gone in and out a dozen
times, and it would have been just the same; she never could have found out his absence.

For what do you think the clever godmother did? She took a quantity of moonshine, or some equally
convenient material, and made an image, which she set on the window-sill reading, or by the
table drawing, where it looked so like Prince Dolor that any common observer would never have
guessed the deception; and even the boy would have been puzzled to know which was the image
and which was himself.

And all this while the happy little fellow was away, floating in the air on his magic cloak,
and seeing all sorts of wonderful things--or they seemed wonderful to him, who had hitherto
seen nothing at all.

First, there were the flowers that grew on the plain, which, whenever the cloak came near enough,
he strained his eyes to look at; they were very tiny, but very beautiful--white saxifrage,
and yellow lotus, and ground-thistles, purple and bright, with many others the names of which
I do not know. No more did Prince Dolor, though he tried to find them out by recalling any
pictures he had seen of them. But he was too far off; and though it was pleasant enough to
admire them as brilliant patches of color, still he would have liked to examine them all. He
was, as a little girl I know once said of a playfellow, "a very examining boy."

"I wonder," he thought, "whether I could see better through a pair of glasses like those my
nurse reads with, and takes such care of. How I would take care of them, too, if I only had
a pair!"

Immediately he felt something queer and hard fixing itself to the bridge of his nose. It was
a pair of the prettiest gold spectacles ever seen; and looking downward, he found that, though
ever so high above the ground, he could see every minute blade of grass, every tiny bud and
flower--nay, even the insects that walked over them.

"Thank you, thank you!" he cried, in a gush of gratitude--to anybody or everybody, but especially
to his dear godmother, who he felt sure had given him this new present. He amused himself with
it for ever so long, with his chin pressed on the rim of the cloak, gazing down upon the grass,
every square foot of which was a mine of wonders.

Then, just to rest his eyes, he turned them up to the sky--the blue, bright, empty sky, which
he had looked at so often and seen nothing.

Now surely there was something. A long, black, wavy line, moving on in the distance, not by
chance, as the clouds move apparently, but deliberately, as if it were alive. He might have
seen it before--he almost thought he had; but then he could not tell what it was. Looking at
it through his spectacles, he discovered that it really was alive; being a long string of birds,
flying one after the other, their wings moving steadily and their heads pointed in one direction,
as steadily as if each were a little ship, guided invisibly by an unerring helm.

"They must be the passage-birds flying seaward!" cried the boy, who had read a little about
them, and had a great talent for putting two and two together and finding out all he could.
"Oh, how I should like to see them quite close, and to know where they come from and whither
they are going! How I wish I knew everything in all the world!"

A silly speech for even an "examining" little boy to make; because, as we grow older, the more
we know the more we find out there is to know. And Prince Dolor blushed when he had said it,
and hoped nobody had heard him.

Apparently somebody had, however; for the cloak gave a sudden bound forward, and presently
he found himself high in the air, in the very middle of that band of aerial travelers, who
had mo magic cloak to travel on--nothing except their wings. Yet there they were, making their
fearless way through the sky.

Prince Dolor looked at them as one after the other they glided past him; and they looked at
him--those pretty swallows, with their changing necks and bright eyes--as if wondering to meet
in mid-air such an extraordinary sort of bird.

"Oh, I wish I were going with you, you lovely creatures! I'm getting so tired of this dull
plain, and the dreary and lonely tower. I do so want to see the world! Pretty swallows, dear
swallows! tell me what it looks like--the beautiful, wonderful world!"

But the swallows flew past him--steadily, slowly pursuing their course as if inside each little
head had been a mariner's compass, to guide them safe over land and sea, direct to the place
where they wished to go.

The boy looked after them with envy. For a long time he followed with his eyes the faint, wavy
black line as it floated away, sometimes changing its curves a little, but never deviating
from its settled course, till it vanished entirely out of sight.

Then he settled himself down in the center of the cloak, feeling quite sad and lonely.

"I think I'll go home," said he, and repeated his "Abracadabra, tum tum ti!" with a rather
heavy heart. The more he had, the more he wanted; and it is not always one can have everything
one wants--at least, at the exact minute one craves for it; not even though one is a prince,
and has a powerful and beneficent godmother.

He did not like to vex her by calling for her and telling her how unhappy he was, in spite
of all her goodness; so he just kept his trouble to himself, went back to his lonely tower,
and spent three days in silent melancholy, without even attempting another journey on his traveling-cloak.

CHAPTER VI

The fourth day it happened that the deaf-mute paid his accustomed visit, after which Prince
Dolor's spirits rose. They always did when he got the new books which, just to relieve his
conscience, the King of Nomansland regularly sent to his nephew; with many new toys also, though
the latter were disregarded now.

"Toys, indeed! when I'm a big boy," said the Prince, with disdain, and would scarcely condescend
to mount a rocking-horse which had come, somehow or other,--I can't be expected to explain
things very exactly,--packed on the back of the other, the great black horse, which stood and
fed contentedly at the bottom of the tower.

Prince Dolor leaned over and looked at it, and thought how grand it must be to get upon its
back--this grand live steed--and ride away, like the pictures of knights.

"Suppose I was a knight," he said to himself; "then I should be obliged to ride out and see
the world."

But he kept all these thoughts to himself, and just sat still, devouring his new books till
he had come to the end of them all. It was a repast not unlike the Barmecide's feast which
you read of in the "Arabian Nights," which consisted of very elegant but empty dishes, or that
supper of Sancho Panza in "Don Quixote," where, the minute the smoking dishes came on the table,
the physician waved his hand and they were all taken away.

Thus almost all the ordinary delights of boy-life had been taken away from, or rather never
given to this poor little prince.

"I wonder," he would sometimes think--"I wonder what it feels like to be on the back of a horse,
galloping away, or holding the reins in a carriage, and tearing across the country, or jumping
a ditch, or running a race, such as I read of or see in pictures. What a lot of things there
are that I should like to do! But first I should like to go and see the world. I'll try."

Apparently it was his godmother's plan always to let him try, and try hard, before he gained
anything. This day the knots that tied up his traveling-cloak were more than usually troublesome,
and he was a full half-hour before he got out into the open air, and found himself floating
merrily over the top of the tower.

Hitherto, in all his journeys, he had never let himself go out of sight of home, for the dreary
building, after all, was home--he remembered no other; but now he felt sick of the very look
of his tower, with its round smooth walls and level battlements.

"Off we go!" cried he, when the cloak stirred itself with a slight, slow motion, as if waiting
his orders. "Anywhere anywhere, so that I am away from here, and out into the world."

As he spoke, the cloak, as if seized suddenly with a new idea, bounded forward and went skimming
through the air, faster than the very fastest railway train.

"Gee-up! gee-up!" cried Prince Dolor in great excitement. "This is as good as riding a race."

And he patted the cloak as if it had been a horse--that is, in the way he supposed horses ought
to be patted--and tossed his head back to meet the fresh breeze, and pulled his coat collar
up and his hat down as he felt the wind grow keener and colder--colder than anything he had
ever known.

"What does it matter, though?" said he. "I'm a boy, and boys ought not to mind anything."

Still, for all his good-will, by and by, he began to shiver exceedingly; also, he had come
away without his dinner, and he grew frightfully hungry. And to add to everything, the sunshiny
day changed into rain, and being high up, in the very midst of the clouds, he got soaked through
and through in a very few minutes.

"Shall I turn back?" meditated he. "Suppose I say 'Abracadabra?'"

Here he stopped, for already the cloak gave an obedient lurch, as if it were expecting to be
sent home immediately.

"No--I can't--I can't go back! I must go forward and see the world. But oh! if I had but the
shabbiest old rug to shelter me from the rain, or the driest morsel of bread and cheese, just
to keep me from starving! Still, I don't much mind; I'm a prince, and ought to be able to stand
anything. Hold on, cloak, we'll make the best of it."

It was a most curious circumstance, but no sooner had he said this than he felt stealing over
his knees something warm and soft; in fact, a most beautiful bearskin, which folded itself
round him quite naturally, and cuddled him up as closely as if he had been the cub of the kind
old mother-bear that once owned it. Then feeling in his pocket, which suddenly stuck out in
a marvelous way, he found, not exactly bread and cheese, nor even sandwiches, but a packet
of the most delicious food he had ever tasted. It was not meat, nor pudding, but a combination
of both, and it served him excellently for both. He ate his dinner with the greatest gusto
imaginable, till he grew so thirsty he did not know what to do.

"Couldn't I have just one drop of water, if it didn't trouble you too much, kindest of godmothers?"

For he really thought this want was beyond her power to supply. All the water which supplied
Hopeless Tower was pumped up with difficulty from a deep artesian well--there were such things
known in Nomansland--which had been made at the foot of it. But around, for miles upon miles,
the desolate plain was perfectly dry. And above it, high in the air, how could he expect to
find a well, or to get even a drop of water?

He forgot one thing--the rain. While he spoke, it came on in another wild burst, as if the
clouds had poured themselves out in a passion of crying, wetting him certainly, but leaving
behind, in a large glass vessel which he had never noticed before, enough water to quench the
thirst of two or three boys at least. And it was so fresh, so pure--as water from the clouds
always is when it does not catch the soot from city chimneys and other defilements--that he
drank it, every drop, with the greatest delight and content.

Also, as soon as it was empty the rain filled it again, so that he was able to wash his face
and hands and refresh himself exceedingly. Then the sun came out and dried him in no time.
After that he curled himself up under the bear-skin rug, and though he determined to be the
most wide-awake boy imaginable, being so exceedingly snug and warm and comfortable, Prince
Dolor condescended to shut his eyes just for one minute. The next minute he was sound asleep.

When he awoke, he found himself floating over a country quite unlike anything he had ever seen
before.

Yet it was nothing but what most of you children see every day and never notice it--a pretty
country landscape, like England, Scotland, France, or any other land you choose to name. It
had no particular features--nothing in it grand or lovely--was simply pretty, nothing more;
yet to Prince Dolor, who had never gone beyond his lonely tower and level plain, it appeared
the most charming sight imaginable.

First, there was a river. It came tumbling down the hillside, frothing and foaming, playing
at hide-and-seek among the rocks, then bursting out in noisy fun like a child, to bury itself
in deep, still pools. Afterward it went steadily on for a while, like a good grown-up person,
till it came to another big rock, where it misbehaved itself extremely. It turned into a cataract,
and went tumbling over and over, after a fashion that made the prince--who had never seen water
before, except in his bath or his drinking-cup--clap his hands with delight.

"It is so active, so alive! I like things active and alive!" cried he, and watched it shimmering
and dancing, whirling and leaping, till, after a few windings and vagaries, it settled into
a respectable stream. After that it went along, deep and quiet, but flowing steadily on, till
it reached a large lake, into which it slipped and so ended its course.

All this the boy saw, either with his own naked eye or through his gold spectacles. He saw
also as in a picture, beautiful but silent, many other things which struck him with wonder,
especially a grove of trees.

Only think, to have lived to his age (which he himself did not know, as he did not know his
own birthday) and never to have seen trees! As he floated over these oaks, they seemed to him--trunk,
branches, and leaves--the most curious sight imaginable.

"If I could only get nearer, so as to touch them," said he, and immediately the obedient cloak
ducked down; Prince Dolor made a snatch at the topmost twig of the tallest tree, and caught
a bunch of leaves in his hand.

Just a bunch of green leaves--such as we see in myriads; watching them bud, grow, fall, and
then kicking them along on the ground as if they were worth nothing. Yet how wonderful they
are--every one of them a little different. I don't suppose you could ever find two leaves exactly
alike in form, color, and size--no more than you could find two faces alike, or two characters
exactly the same. The plan of this world is infinite similarity and yet infinite variety.

Prince Dolor examined his leaves with the greatest curiosity--and also a little caterpillar
that he found walking over one of them. He coaxed it to take an additional walk over his finger,
which it did with the greatest dignity and decorum, as if it, Mr. Caterpillar, were the most
important individual in existence. It amused him for a long time; and when a sudden gust of
wind blew it overboard, leaves and all, he felt quite disconsolate.

"Still there must be many live creatures in the world besides caterpillars. I should like to
see a few of them."

The cloak gave a little dip down, as if to say "All right, my Prince," and bore him across
the oak forest to a long fertile valley--called in Scotland a strath and in England a weald,
but what they call it in the tongue of Nomansland I do not know. It was made up of cornfields,
pasturefields, lanes, hedges, brooks, and ponds. Also, in it were what the prince desired to
see--a quantity of living creatures, wild and tame. Cows and horses, lambs and sheep, fed in
the meadows; pigs and fowls walked about the farm-yards; and in lonelier places hares scudded,
rabbits burrowed, and pheasants and partridges, with many other smaller birds, inhabited the
fields and woods.

Through his wonderful spectacles the Prince could see everything; but, as I said, it was a
silent picture; he was too high up to catch anything except a faint murmur, which only aroused
his anxiety to hear more.

"I have as good as two pairs of eyes," he thought. "I wonder if my godmother would give me
a second pair of ears."

Scarcely had he spoken than he found lying on his lap the most curious little parcel, all done
up in silvery paper. And it contained--what do you think? Actually a pair of silver ears, which,
when he tried them on, fitted so exactly over his own that he hardly felt them, except for
the difference they made in his hearing.

There is something which we listen to daily and never notice. I mean the sounds of the visible
world, animate and inanimate. Winds blowing, waters flowing, trees stirring, insects whirring
(dear me! I am quite unconsciously writing rhyme), with the various cries of birds and beasts,--lowing
cattle, bleating sheep, grunting pigs, and cackling hens,--all the infinite discords that somehow
or other make a beautiful harmony.

We hear this, and are so accustomed to it that we think nothing of it; but Prince Dolor, who
had lived all his days in the dead silence of Hopeless Tower, heard it for the first time.
And oh! if you had seen his face.

He listened, listened, as if he could never have done listening. And he looked and looked,
as if he could not gaze enough. Above all, the motion of the animals delighted him: cows walking,
horses galloping, little lambs and calves running races across the meadows, were such a treat
for him to watch--he that was always so quiet. But, these creatures having four legs, and he
only two, the difference did not strike him painfully.

Still, by and by, after the fashion of children,--and I fear, of many big people too,--he began
to want something more than he had, something fresh and new.

"Godmother," he said, having now begun to believe that, whether he saw her or not, he could
always speak to her with full confidence that she would hear him--"Godmother, all these creatures
I like exceedingly; but I should like better to see a creature like myself. Couldn't you show
me just one little boy?"

There was a sigh behind him,--it might have been only the wind,--and the cloak remained so
long balanced motionless in air that he was half afraid his godmother had forgotten him, or
was offended with him for asking too much. Suddenly a shrill whistle startled him, even through
his silver ears, and looking downward, he saw start up from behind a bush on a common, something----

Neither a sheep nor a horse nor a cow--nothing upon four legs. This creature had only two;
but they were long, straight, and strong. And it had a lithe, active body, and a curly head
of black hair set upon its shoulders. It was a boy, a shepherd-boy, about the Prince's own
age--but, oh! so different.

Not that he was an ugly boy--though his face was almost as red as his hands, and his shaggy
hair matted like the backs of his own sheep. He was rather a nice-looking lad; and seemed so
bright and healthy and good-tempered--"jolly" would be the word, only I am not sure if they
have such a one in the elegant language of Nomansland--that the little Prince watched him with
great admiration.

"Might he come and play with me? I would drop down to the ground to him, or fetch him up to
me here. Oh, how nice it would be if I only had a little boy to play with me."

But the cloak, usually so obedient to his wishes, disobeyed him now. There were evidently some
things which his godmother either could not or would not give. The cloak hung stationary, high
in air, never attempting to descend. The shepherd-lad evidently took it for a large bird, and,
shading his eyes, looked up at it, making the Prince's heart beat fast.

However, nothing ensued. The boy turned round, with a long, loud whistle--seemingly his usual
and only way of expressing his feelings. He could not make the thing out exactly--it was a
rather mysterious affair, but it did not trouble him much--he was not an "examining" boy.

Then, stretching himself, for he had been evidently half asleep, he began flopping his shoulders
with his arms to wake and warm himself; while his dog, a rough collie, who had been guarding
the sheep meanwhile, began to jump upon him, barking with delight.

"Down, Snap, down: Stop that, or I'll thrash you," the Prince heard him say; though with such
a rough, hard voice and queer pronunciation that it was difficult to make the words out. "Hollo!
Let's warm ourselves by a race."

They started off together, boy and dog--barking and shouting, till it was doubtful which made
the more noise or ran the faster. A regular steeplechase it was: first across the level common,
greatly disturbing the quiet sheep; and then tearing away across country, scrambling through
hedges and leaping ditches, and tumbling up and down over plowed fields. They did not seem
to have anything to run for--but as if they did it, both of them, for the mere pleasure of motion.

And what a pleasure that seemed! To the dog of course, but scarcely less so to the boy. How
he skimmed along over the ground--his cheeks glowing, and his hair flying, and his legs--oh,
what a pair of legs he had!

Prince Dolor watched him with great intentness, and in a state of excitement almost equal to
that of the runner himself--for a while. Then the sweet, pale face grew a trifle paler, the
lips began to quiver, and the eyes to fill.

"How nice it must be to run like that!" he said softly, thinking that never--no, never in this
world--would he be able to do the same.

Now he understood what his godmother had meant when she gave him his traveling-cloak, and why
he had heard that sigh--he was sure it was hers--when he had asked to see "just one little boy."

"I think I had rather not look at him again," said the poor little Prince, drawing himself
back into the center of his cloak, and resuming his favorite posture, sitting like a Turk,
with his arms wrapped round his feeble, useless legs.

"You're no good to me," he said, patting them mournfully. "You never will be any good to me.
I wonder why I had you at all. I wonder why I was born at all, since I was not to grow up like
other boys. Why not?"

A question so strange, so sad, yet so often occurring in some form or other in this world--as
you will find, my children, when you are older--that even if he had put it to his mother she
could only have answered it, as we have to answer many as difficult things, by simply saying,
"I don't know." There is much that we do not know and cannot understand--we big folks no more
than you little ones. We have to accept it all just as you have to accept anything which your
parents may tell you, even though you don't as yet see the reason of it. You may sometime,
if you do exactly as they tell you, and are content to wait.

Prince Dolor sat a good while thus, or it appeared to him a good while, so many thoughts came
and went through his poor young mind--thoughts of great bitterness, which, little though he
was, seemed to make him grow years older in a few minutes.

Then he fancied the cloak began to rock gently to and fro, with a soothing kind of motion,
as if he were in somebody's arms: somebody who did not speak, but loved him and comforted him
without need of words; not by deceiving him with false encouragement or hope, but by making
him see the plain, hard truth in all its hardness, and thus letting him quietly face it, till
it grew softened down, and did not seem nearly so dreadful after all.

Through the dreary silence and blankness, for he had placed himself so that he could see nothing
but the sky, and had taken off his silver ears as well as his gold spectacles--what was the
use of either when he had no legs with which to walk or run?--up from below there rose a delicious
sound.

You have heard it hundreds of times, my children, and so have I. When I was a child I thought
there was nothing so sweet; and I think so still. It was just the song of a skylark, mounting
higher and higher from the ground, till it came so close that Prince Dolor could distinguish
his quivering wings and tiny body, almost too tiny to contain such a gush of music.

"Oh, you beautiful, beautiful bird!" cried he; "I should dearly like to take you in and cuddle
you. That is, if I could--if I dared."

But he hesitated. The little brown creature with its loud heavenly voice almost made him afraid.
Nevertheless, it also made him happy; and he watched and listened--so absorbed that he forgot
all regret and pain, forgot everything in the world except the little lark.

It soared and soared, and he was just wondering if it would soar out of sight, and what in
the world he should do when it was gone, when it suddenly closed its wings, as larks do when
they mean to drop to the ground. But, instead of dropping to the ground, it dropped right into
the little boy's breast.

What felicity! If it would only stay! A tiny, soft thing to fondle and kiss, to sing to him
all day long, and be his playfellow and companion, tame and tender, while to the rest of the
world it was a wild bird of the air. What a pride, what a delight! To have something that nobody
else had--something all his own. As the traveling-cloak traveled on, he little heeded where,
and the lark still stayed, nestled down in his bosom, hopped from his hand to his shoulder,
and kissed him with its dainty beak, as if it loved him, Prince Dolor forgot all his grief,
and was entirely happy.

But when he got in sight of Hopeless Tower a painful thought struck him.

"My pretty bird, what am I to do with you? If I take you into my room and shut you up there,
you, a wild skylark of the air, what will become of you? I am used to this, but you are not.
You will be so miserable; and suppose my nurse should find you--she who can't bear the sound
of singing? Besides, I remember her once telling me that the nicest thing she ever ate in her
life was lark pie!"

The little boy shivered all over at the thought. And, though the merry lark immediately broke
into the loudest carol, as if saying derisively that he defied anybody to eat him, still, Prince
Dolor was very uneasy. In another minute he had made up his mind.

"No, my bird, nothing so dreadful shall happen to you if I can help it; I would rather do without
you altogether. Yes, I'll try. Fly away, my darling, my beautiful! Good-by, my merry, merry bird."

Opening his two caressing hands, in which, as if for protection, he had folded it, he let the
lark go. It lingered a minute, perching on the rim of the cloak, and looking at him with eyes
of almost human tenderness; then away it flew, far up into the blue sky. It was only a bird.

But some time after, when Prince Dolor had eaten his supper--somewhat drearily, except for
the thought that he could not possibly sup off lark pie now--and gone quietly to bed, the old
familiar little bed, where he was accustomed to sleep, or lie awake contentedly thinking--suddenly
he heard outside the window a little faint carol--faint but cheerful--cheerful even though
it was the middle of the night.

The dear little lark! it had not flown away, after all. And it was truly the most extraordinary
bird, for, unlike ordinary larks, it kept hovering about the tower in the silence and darkness
of the night, outside the window or over the roof. Whenever he listened for a moment, he heard
it singing still.

He went to sleep as happy as a king.

CHAPTER VII

"Happy as a king." How far kings are happy I cannot say, no more than could Prince Dolor, though
he had once been a king himself. But he remembered nothing about it, and there was nobody to
tell him, except his nurse, who had been forbidden upon pain of death to let him know anything
about his dead parents, or the king his uncle, or indeed any part of his own history.

Sometimes he speculated about himself, whether he had had a father and mother as other little
boys had what they had been like, and why he had never seen them. But, knowing nothing about
them, he did not miss them--only once or twice, reading pretty stories about little children
and their mothers, who helped them when they were in difficulty and comforted them when they
were sick, he feeling ill and dull and lonely, wondered what had become of his mother and why
she never came to see him.

Then, in his history lessons, of course he read about kings and princes, and the governments
of different countries, and the events that happened there. And though he but faintly took
in all this, still he did take it in a little, and worried his young brain about it, and perplexed
his nurse with questions, to which she returned sharp and mysterious answers, which only set
him thinking the more.

He had plenty of time for thinking. After his last journey in the traveling-cloak, the journey
which had given him so much pain, his desire to see the world somehow faded away. Postal messengers,
on receipt of telephonic orders, bring truckfuls to any address within ten minutes.

THREE ACRES AND AN EGG.

The following pleasing announcement appears in the advertisement columns of the East of Fife
Record.--

WANTED, COTTAGERS and others to HATCH EGGS. Liberal Terms. Apply, &c.

We are glad to see the men of Fife thus taking the lead in creating new openings for the agricultural
labourer.

Of course the weather will have much influence upon the success of the new avocation. To sit
out hatching eggs in one of such blizzards as we have had since Christmas would be exceedingly
inconvenient, upon whatever "Liberal terms." But, given a fair summer day or a quiet autumn evening,
there seems something quite idyllic in the picture of the agricultural labourer sitting out
in his own Three Acres hatching eggs,--probably laid by the Cow.

THE FRIEND OF LABOUR.

How doth the provident M.P. Improve each shining hour, And in the "Labour Question" see Hopes of
return to power!

How skilfully he shapes his "sell," How neatly spreads his "fakes"! On Labour's ear they sound
right well, The promises he makes.

Skilled Labour, Labour without skill, He would have busy, too; Nay, he would find some Labour
still For idle "hands" to do.

Yet, Labour, whatsoe'er he say, To trust him be not fast; Or you'll
discover, some fine day, He'll diddle you at last!

QUEER
QUERIES.--COMBUSTIBLES.--I have five hundred barrels of Kerosene Oil,
and three hundred of Paraffin, stored in a large room in the basement
of my premises. Upstairs, on the top floor, there are about two hundred
assistants at work. I now want to use part of the same room for the
manufacture of fireworks. The place I don't think is too dark, as
I have it constantly lighted by naked gas-jets. Would there be any
need to take out a licence? The surrounding property, although very
crowded, is only of a poor description.--INSURED.

The same Room--except
that the sofa has been slightly moved, and one of the Japanese cotton-wool
frogs has fallen into the fireplace. Mrs. LINDEN sits and reads a
book--but without understanding a single line.

Mrs. Linden (laying
down book, as a light tread is heard outside). Here he is at last!
(KROGSTAD comes in, and stands in the doorway.) Mr. KROGSTAD, I have
given you a secret rendezvous in this room, because it belongs to
my employer, Mr. HELMER, who has lately discharged you. The etiquette
of Norway permits these slight freedoms on the part of a female Cashier.

Krogs.
It does. Are we alone? (NORA is heard overhead dancing the Tarantella.)
Yes, I hear Mrs. HELMER's fairy footfall above. She dances the Tarantella
now--by-and-by she will dance to another tune! (Changing his tone.)
I don't exactly know why you should wish to have this interview--after
jilting me as you did, long ago, though?

Mrs. L. Don't you? I do.
I am a widow--a Norwegian widow. And it has occurred to me that there
may be a nobler side to your nature somewhere--though you have not
precisely the best of reputations. And then, terribly frightened all the
while,--people who have done wrong always are frightened,--she wrote down in a few hurried
sentences his history. How his parents had died--his uncle had usurped his throne, and sent
him to end his days in this lonely tower.

"I, too," added she, bursting into tears. "Unless, indeed, you could get out into the world,
and fight for your rights like a man. And fight for me also, my Prince, that I may not die
in this desolate place."

"Poor old nurse!" said the boy compassionately. For somehow, boy as he was, when he heard he
was born to be a king, he felt like a man--like a king--who could afford to be tender because
he was strong.

He scarcely slept that night, and even though he heard his little lark singing in the sunrise,
he barely listened to it. Things more serious and important had taken possession of his mind.

"Suppose," thought he, "I were to do as she says, and go out in the world, no matter how it
hurts me--the world of people, active people, as that boy I saw. They might only laugh at me--poor
helpless creature that I am; but still I might show them I could do something. At any rate,
I might go and see if there were anything for me to do. Godmother, help me!"

It was so long since he had asked her help that he was hardly surprised when he got no answer--only
the little lark outside the window sang louder and louder, and the sun rose, flooding the room
with light.

Prince Dolor sprang out of bed, and began dressing himself, which was hard work, for he was
not used to it--he had always been accustomed to depend upon his nurse for everything.

"But I must now learn to be independent," thought he. "Fancy a king being dressed like a baby!"

So he did the best he could,--awkwardly but cheerily,--and then he leaped to the corner where
lay his traveling-cloak, untied it as before, and watched it unrolling itself--which it did
rapidly, with a hearty good-will, as if quite tired of idleness. So was Prince Dolor--or felt
as if he were. He jumped into the middle of it, said his charm, and was out through the skylight
immediately.

"Good-by, pretty lark!" he shouted, as he passed it on the wing, still warbling its carol to
the newly risen sun. "You have been my pleasure, my delight; now I must go and work. Sing to
old nurse till I come back again. Perhaps she'll hear you--perhaps she won't--but it will do
her good all the same. Good-by!"

But, as the cloak hung irresolute in air, he suddenly remembered that he had not determined
where to go--indeed, he did not know, and there was nobody to tell him.

"Godmother," he cried, in much perplexity, "you know what I want,--at least, I hope you do,
for I hardly do myself--take me where I ought to go; show me whatever I ought to see--never
mind what I like to see," as a sudden idea came into his mind that he might see many painful
and disagreeable things. But this journey was not for pleasure as before. He was not a baby
now, to do nothing but play--big boys do not always play. Nor men neither--they work. Thus
much Prince Dolor knew--though very little more.

As the cloak started off, traveling faster than he had ever known it to do,--through sky-land
and cloud land, over freezing mountain-tops, and desolate stretches of forest, and smiling
cultivated plains, and great lakes that seemed to him almost as shoreless as the sea,--he was
often rather frightened. But he crouched down, silent and quiet; what was the use of making
a fuss? and, wrapping himself up in his bear-skin, waited for what was to happen.

After some time he heard a murmur in the distance, increasing more and more till it grew like
the hum of a gigantic hive of bees. And, stretching his chin over the rim of his cloak, Prince
Dolor saw--far, far below him, yet, with his gold spectacles and silver ears on, he could distinctly
hear and see--what?

Most of us have some time or other visited a great metropolis--have wandered through its network
of streets--lost ourselves in its crowds of people--looked up at its tall rows of houses, its
grand public buildings, churches, and squares. Also, perhaps, we have peeped into its miserable
little back alleys, where dirty children play in gutters all day and half the night--even young
boys go about picking pockets, with nobody to tell them it is wrong except the policeman, and
he simply takes them off to prison. And all this wretchedness is close behind the grandeur--like
the two sides of the leaf of a book.

An awful sight is a large city, seen any how from any where. But, suppose you were to see it
from the upper air, where, with your eyes and ears open, you could take in everything at once?
What would it look like? How would you feel about it? I hardly know myself. Do you?

Prince Dolor had need to be a king--that is, a boy with a kingly nature--to be able to stand
such a sight without being utterly overcome. But he was very much bewildered--as bewildered
as a blind person who is suddenly made to see.

He gazed down on the city below him, and then put his hand over his eyes.

"I can't bear to look at it, it is so beautiful--so dreadful. And I don't understand it--not
one bit. There is nobody to tell me about it. I wish I had somebody to speak to."

"Do you? Then pray speak to me. I was always considered good at conversation."

The voice that squeaked out this reply was an excellent imitation of the human one, though
it came only from a bird. No lark this time, however, but a great black and white creature
that flew into the cloak, and began walking round and round on the edge of it with a dignified
stride, one foot before the other, like any unfeathered biped you could name.

"I haven't the honor of your acquaintance, sir," said the boy politely.

"Ma'am, if you please. I am a mother bird, and my name is Mag, and I shall be happy to tell
you everything you want to know. For I know a great deal; and I enjoy talking. My family is
of great antiquity; we have built in this palace for hundreds--that is to say, dozens of years.
I am intimately acquainted with the king, the queen, and the little princes and princesses--also
the maids of honor, and all the inhabitants of the city. I talk a good deal, but I always talk
sense, and I daresay I should be exceedingly useful to a poor little ignorant boy like you."

"I am a prince," said the other gently.

"All right. And I am a magpie. You will find me a most respectable bird."

"I have no doubt of it," was the polite answer--though he thought in his own mind that Mag
must have a very good opinion of herself. But she was a lady and a stranger, so of course he
was civil to her.

She settled herself at his elbow, and began to chatter away, pointing out with one skinny claw,
while she balanced herself on the other, every object of interest, evidently believing, as
no doubt all its inhabitants did, that there was no capital in the world like the great metropolis
of Nomansland.

I have not seen it, and therefore cannot describe it, so we will just take it upon trust, and
suppose it to be, like every other fine city, the finest city that ever was built. Mag said
so--and of course she knew.

Nevertheless, there were a few things in it which surprised Prince Dolor--and, as he had said,
he could not understand them at all. One half the people seemed so happy and busy--hurrying
up and down the full streets, or driving lazily along the parks in their grand carriages, while
the other half were so wretched and miserable.

"Can't the world be made a little more level? I would try to do it if I were a king."

"But you're not the king: only a little goose of a boy," returned the magpie loftily. "And
I'm here not to explain things, only to show them. Shall I show you the royal palace?"

It was a very magnificent palace. It had terraces and gardens, battlements and towers. It extended
over acres of ground, and had in it rooms enough to accommodate half the city. Its windows
looked in all directions, but none of them had any particular view--except a small one, high
up toward the roof, which looked out on the Beautiful Mountains. But since the queen died there
it had been closed, boarded up, indeed, the magpie said. It was so little and inconvenient
that nobody cared to live in it. Besides, the lower apartments, which had no view, were magnificent--worthy
of being inhabited by the king.

"I should like to see the king," said Prince Dolor.

CHAPTER VIII

What, I wonder, would be people's idea of a king? What was Prince Dolor's?

Perhaps a very splendid personage, with a crown on his head and a scepter in his hand, sitting
on a throne and judging the people. Always doing right, and never wrong--"The king can do no
wrong" was a law laid down in olden times. Never cross, or tired, or sick, or suffering; perfectly
handsome and well dressed, calm and good-tempered, ready to see and hear everybody, and discourteous
to nobody; all things always going well with him, and nothing unpleasant ever happening.

This, probably, was what Prince Dolor expected to see. And what did he see? But I must tell
you how he saw it.

"Ah," said the magpie, "no levee to-day. The King is ill, though his Majesty does not wish
it to be generally known--it would be so very inconvenient. He can't see you, but perhaps you
might like to go and take a look at him in a way I often do? It is so very amusing."

Amusing, indeed!

The prince was just now too much excited to talk much. I, Sir, hither I fared on account of the
cant-armed Sportsmen, Pledged to the combat; they unto me have in no wise a harm done, Never
have they, of a truth, come putting my Hares and my Rabbits, Never in deep-soiled Hampshire,
the nurser of heroes and H-RC-RTS, Ravaged; but if I found them among my trampled Carnations,
Hares or Rabbits, or gun-bearing Tories, by Jingo, I'd pot 'em!

O hugely shameless! Thee shall we follow to do an injustice Unto the farmers, seeing the Hares
a-munching their crops up? I do not sit at the feet of the blatant Bordesley Gamaliel, Or of
the unregenerate Agricultural Minister.

Close time? Fudge! The Hares were intended at last to perish Either by sounding gun or the gaping
jaws of the greyhound. She pecked at the
tiles with her beak--truly she was a wonderful bird--and immediately a little hole opened,
a sort of door, through which could be seen distinctly the chamber below.

"Now look in, my Prince. Make haste, for I must soon shut it up again."

But the boy hesitated. "Isn't it rude?--won't they think us intruding?"

"Oh, dear no! there's a hole like this in every palace; dozens of holes, indeed. Everybody
knows it, but nobody speaks of it. Intrusion! Why, though the royal family are supposed to
live shut up behind stone walls ever so thick, all the world knows that they live in a glass
house where everybody can see them and throw a stone at them. Now pop down on your knees, and
take a peep at his Majesty."

His Majesty!

The Prince gazed eagerly down into a large room, the largest room he had ever beheld, with
furniture and hangings grander than anything he could have ever imagined. A stray sunbeam,
coming through a crevice of the darkened windows, struck across the carpet, and it was the
loveliest carpet ever woven--just like a bed of flowers to walk over; only nobody walked over
it, the room being perfectly empty and silent.

"Where is the King?" asked the puzzled boy.

"There," said Mag, pointing with one wrinkled claw to a magnificent bed, large enough to contain
six people. In the center of it, just visible under the silken counterpane,--quite straight
and still,--with its head on the lace pillow, lay a small figure, something like wax-work,
fast asleep--very fast asleep! There was a number of sparkling rings on the tiny yellow hands,
that were curled a little, helplessly, like a baby's, outside the coverlet; the eyes were shut,
the nose looked sharp and thin, and the long gray beard hid the mouth and lay over the breast.
A sight not ugly nor frightening, only solemn and quiet. And so very silent--two little flies
buzzing about the curtains of the bed being the only audible sound.

"Is that the King?" whispered Prince Dolor.

"Yes," replied the bird.

He had been angry--furiously angry--ever since he knew how his uncle had taken the crown, and
sent him, a poor little helpless child, to be shut up for life, just as if he had been dead.
Many times the boy had felt as if, king as he was, he should like to strike him, this great,
strong, wicked man.

Why, you might as well have struck a baby! How helpless he lay, with his eyes shut, and his
idle hands folded: they had no more work to do, bad or good.

"What is the matter with him?" asked the Prince.

"He is dead," said the Magpie, with a croak.

No, there was not the least use in being angry with him now. On the contrary, the Prince felt
almost sorry for him, except that he looked so peaceful with all his cares at rest. And this
was being dead? So even kings died?

"Well, well, he hadn't an easy life, folk say, for all his grandeur. Perhaps he is glad it
is over. Good-by, your Majesty."

With another cheerful tap of her beak, Mistress Mag shut down the little door in the tiles,
and Prince Dolor's first and last sight of his uncle was ended.

He sat in the center of his traveling-cloak, silent and thoughtful.

"What shall we do now?" said the magpie. "There's nothing much more to be done with his majesty,
except a fine funeral, which I shall certainly go and see. All the world will. He interested
the world exceedingly when he was alive, and he ought to do it now he's dead--just once more.
And since he can't hear me, I may as well say that, on the whole, his majesty is much better
dead than alive--if we can only get somebody in his place. There'll be such a row in the city
presently. Suppose we float up again and see it all--at a safe distance, though. It will be
such fun!"

"What will be fun?"

"A revolution."

Whether anybody except a magpie would have called it "fun" I don't know, but it certainly was
a remarkable scene.

As soon as the cathedral bell began to toll and the minute-guns to fire, announcing to the
kingdom that it was without a king, the people gathered in crowds, stopping at street corners
to talk together. The murmur now and then rose into a shout, and the shout into a roar. When
Prince Dolor, quietly floating in upper air, caught the sound of their different and opposite
cries, it seemed to him as if the whole city had gone mad together.

"Long live the king!" "The king is dead--down with the king!" "Down with the crown, and the
king too!" "Hurrah for the republic!" "Hurrah for no government at all!"

Such were the shouts which traveled up to the traveling-cloak. And then began--oh, what a scene!

When you children are grown men and women--or before--you will hear and read in books about
what are called revolutions--earnestly I trust that neither I nor you may ever see one. But
they have happened, and may happen again, in other countries besides Nomansland, when wicked
kings have helped to make their people wicked too, or out of an unrighteous nation have sprung
rulers equally bad; or, without either of these causes, when a restless country has fancied
any change better than no change at all.

For me, I don't like changes, unless pretty sure that they are for good. And how good can come
out of absolute evil--the horrible evil that went on this night under Prince Dolor's very eyes--soldiers
shooting down people by hundreds in the streets, scaffolds erected, and heads dropping off--houses
burned, and women and children murdered--this is more than I can understand.

But all these things you will find in history, my children, and must by and by judge for yourselves
the right and wrong of them, as far as anybody ever can judge.

Prince Dolor saw it all. Things happened so fast one after another that they quite confused
his faculties.

"Oh, let me go home," he cried at last, stopping his ears and shutting his eyes; "only let
me go home!" for even his lonely tower seemed home, and its dreariness and silence absolute
paradise after all this.

"Good-by, then," said the magpie, flapping her wings. She had been chatting incessantly all
day and all night, for it was actually thus long that Prince Dolor had been hovering over the
city, neither eating nor sleeping, with all these terrible things happening under his very
eyes. "You've had enough, I suppose, of seeing the world?"

"Oh, I have--I have!" cried the prince, with a shudder.

"That is, till next time. All right, your royal highness. You don't know me, but I know you.
We may meet again some time."

She looked at him with her clear, piercing eyes, sharp enough to see through everything, and
it seemed as if they changed from bird's eyes to human eyes--the very eyes of his godmother,
whom he had not seen for ever so long. But the minute afterward she became only a bird, and
with a screech and a chatter, spread her wings and flew away.

Prince Dolor fell into a kind of swoon of utter misery, bewilderment, and exhaustion, and when
he awoke he found himself in his own room--alone and quiet--with the dawn just breaking, and
the long rim of yellow light in the horizon glimmering through the window-panes.

CHAPTER IX

When Prince Dolor sat up in bed, trying to remember where he was, whither he had been, and
what he had seen the day before, he perceived that his room was empty.

Generally his nurse rather worried him by breaking his slumbers, coming in and "setting things
to rights," as she called it. Now the dust lay thick upon chairs and tables; there was no harsh
voice heard to scold him for not getting up immediately, which, I am sorry to say, this boy
did not always do. For he so enjoyed lying still, and thinking lazily about everything or nothing,
that, if he had not tried hard against it, he would certainly have become like those celebrated

     "Two little men
     Who lay in their bed till the clock struck ten."

It was striking ten now, and still no nurse was to be seen. He was rather relieved at first,
for he felt so tired; and besides, when he stretched out his arm, he found to his dismay that
he had gone to bed in his clothes.

Very uncomfortable he felt, of course; and just a little frightened. Especially when he began
to call and call again, but nobody answered. Often he used to think how nice it would be to
get rid of his nurse and live in this tower all by himself--like a sort of monarch able to
do everything he liked, and leave undone all that he did not want to do; but now that this
seemed really to have happened, he did not like it at all.

"Nurse,--dear nurse,--please come back!" he called out. "Come back, and I will be the best
boy in all the land."

And when she did not come back, and nothing but silence answered his lamentable call, he very
nearly began to cry.

"This won't do," he said at last, dashing the tears from his eyes. "It's just like a baby,
and I'm a big boy--shall be a man some day. What has happened, I wonder? I'll go and see."

He sprang out of bed,--not to his feet, alas! but to his poor little weak knees, and crawled
on them from room to room. All the four chambers were deserted--not forlorn or untidy, for
everything seemed to have been done for his comfort--the breakfast and dinner things were laid,
the food spread in order. He might live "like a prince," as the proverb is, for several days.
But the place was entirely forsaken--there was evidently not a creature but himself in the
solitary tower.

A great fear came upon the poor boy. Lonely as his life had been, he had never known what it
was to be absolutely alone. A kind of despair seized him--no violent anger or terror, but a
sort of patient desolation.

"What in the world am I to do?" thought he, and sat down in the middle of the floor, half inclined
to believe that it would be better to give up entirely, lay himself down, and die.

This feeling, however, did not last long, for he was young and strong, and, I said before,
by nature a very courageous boy. There came into his head, somehow or other, a proverb that
his nurse had taught him--the people of Nomansland were very fond of proverbs:

     "For every evil under the sun
     There is a remedy, or there's none;
     If there is one, try to find it--
     If there isn't, never mind it."

"I wonder is there a remedy now, and could I find it?" cried the Prince, jumping up and looking
out of the window.

No help there. He only saw the broad, bleak, sunshiny plain--that is, at first. But by and
by, in the circle of mud that surrounded the base of the tower, he perceived distinctly the
marks of a horse's feet, and just in the spot where the deaf-mute was accustomed to tie up
his great black charger, while he himself ascended, there lay the remains of a bundle of hay
and a feed of corn.

"Yes, that's it. He has come and gone, taking nurse away with him. Poor nurse! how glad she
would be to go!"

That was Prince Dolor's first thought. His second--wasn't it natural?--was a passionate indignation
at her cruelty--at the cruelty of all the world toward him, a poor little helpless boy. Then
he determined, forsaken as he was, to try and hold on to the last, and not to die as long as
he could possibly help it.

Anyhow, it would be easier to die here than out in the world, among the terrible doings which
he had just beheld--from the midst of which, it suddenly struck him, the deaf-mute had come,
contriving somehow to make the nurse understand that the king was dead, and she need have no
fear in going back to the capital, where there was a grand revolution, and everything turned
upside down. So, of course, she had gone. "I hope she'll enjoy it, miserable woman--if they
don't cut off her head too."

And then a kind of remorse smote him for feeling so bitterly toward her, after all the years
she had taken care of him--grudgingly, perhaps, and coldly; still she had taken care of him,
and that even to the last: for, as I have said, all his four rooms were as tidy as possible,
and his meals laid out, that he might have no more trouble than could be helped.

"Possibly she did not mean to be cruel. I won't judge her," said he. And afterward he was very
glad that he had so determined.

For the second time he tried to dress himself, and then to do everything he could for himself--even
to sweeping up the hearth and putting on more coals. "It's a funny thing for a prince to have
to do," said he, laughing. "But my godmother once said princes need never mind doing anything."

And then he thought a little of his godmother. Not of summoning her, or asking her to help
him,--she had evidently left him to help himself, and he was determined to try his best to
do it, being a very proud and independent boy,--but he remembered her tenderly and regret-fully,
as if even she had been a little hard upon him--poor, forlorn boy that he was. But he seemed
to have seen and learned so much within the last few days that he scarcely felt like a boy,
but a man--until he went to bed at night.

When I was a child, I used often to think how nice it would be to live in a little house all
by my own self--a house built high up in a tree, or far away in a forest, or halfway up a hillside
so deliciously alone and independent. Not a lesson to learn--but no! I always liked learning
my lessons. Anyhow, to choose the lessons I liked best, to have as many books to read and dolls
to play with as ever I wanted: above all, to be free and at rest, with nobody to tease or trouble
or scold me, would be charming. For I was a lonely little thing, who liked quietness--as many
children do; which other children, and sometimes grown-up people even, cannot understand. And
so I can understand Prince Dolor.

After his first despair, he was not merely comfortable, but actually happy in his solitude,
doing everything for himself, and enjoying everything by himself--until bedtime. Then he did
not like it at all. No more, I suppose, than other children would have liked my imaginary house
in a tree when they had had sufficient of their own company.

But the Prince had to bear it--and he did bear it, like a prince--for fully five days. All
that time he got up in the morning and went to bed at night without having spoken to a creature,
or, indeed, heard a single sound. For even his little lark was silent; and as for his traveling-cloak,
either he never thought about it, or else it had been spirited away--for he made no use of
it, nor attempted to do so.

A very strange existence it was, those five lonely days. He never entirely forgot it. It threw
him back upon himself, and into himself--in a way that all of us have to learn when we grow
up, and are the better for it; but it is somewhat hard learning.

On the sixth day Prince Dolor had a strange composure in his look, but he was very grave and
thin and white. He had nearly come to the end of his provisions--and what was to happen next?
Get out of the tower he could not: the ladder the deaf-mute used was always carried away again;
and if it had not been, how could the poor boy have used it? And even if he slung or flung
himself down, and by miraculous chance came alive to the foot of the tower, how could he run away?

Fate had been very hard to him, or so it seemed.

He made up his mind to die. Not that he wished to die; on the contrary, there was a great deal
that he wished to live to do; but if he must die, he must. Dying did not seem so very dreadful;
not even to lie quiet like his uncle, whom he had entirely forgiven now, and neither be miserable
nor naughty any more, and escape all those horrible things that he had seen going on outside
the palace, in that awful place which was called "the world."

"It's a great deal nicer here," said the poor little Prince, and collected all his pretty things
round him: his favorite pictures, which he thought he should like to have near him when he
died; his books and toys--no, he had ceased to care for toys now; he only liked them because
he had done so as a child. And there he sat very calm and patient, like a king in his castle,
waiting for the end.

"Still, I wish I had done something first--something worth doing, that somebody might remember
me by," thought he. "Suppose I had grown a man, and had had work to do, and people to care
for, and was so useful and busy that they liked me, and perhaps even forgot I was lame? Then
it would have been nice to live, I think."

A tear came into the little fellow's eyes, and he listened intently through the dead silence
for some hopeful sound.

Was there one?--was it his little lark, whom he had almost forgotten? No, nothing half so sweet.
But it really was something--something which came nearer and nearer, so that there was no mistaking
it. It was the sound of a trumpet, one of the great silver trumpets so admired in Nomansland.
Not pleasant music, but very bold, grand, and inspiring.

As he listened to it the boy seemed to recall many things which had slipped his memory for
years, and to nerve himself for whatever might be going to happen.

What had happened was this.

The poor condemned woman had not been such a wicked woman after all. Perhaps her courage was
not wholly disinterested, but she had done a very heroic thing. As soon as she heard of the
death and burial of the King and of the changes that were taking place in the country, a daring
idea came into her head--to set upon the throne of Nomansland its rightful heir. A few weeks
afterwards he took his departure, and when we last heard of him was thundering in the Senate
against certain practices on the part of his own country which he thought to be unjust to other
nations. Don Quixote was not more just than the Senator, or more philanthropic,--nor perhaps more
apt to wage war against the windmills.

Having in this our last chapter given the place of honour to the Senator, we must now say a parting
word as to those countrymen of our own who have figured in our pages.

Lord Rufford married Miss Penge of course, and used the lady's fortune in buying the property of Sir
John Purefoy. We may probably be safe in saying that the acquisition added very little to his
happiness. What difference can it make to a man whether he has forty or fifty thousand pounds a
year,--or at any rate to such a man? Perhaps Miss Penge herself was an acquisition. He did
not hunt so often or shoot so much, and was seen in church once at least on every Sunday. In a
very short time his friends perceived that a very great change had
come over him.

He was growing fat, and soon disliked the trouble of getting up early to go to a distant meet;
and, before a year or two had passed away, it had become an understood thing that in country
houses he was not one of the men who went down at night into the smoking-room in a short dressing-coat
and a picturesque cap. Miss Penge had done all this. He had had his period of pleasure, and no
doubt the change was desirable;--but he sometimes thought with regret
of the promise Arabella Trefoil had made him, that she would never
interfere with his gratification.

At Dillsborough everything during the summer after the Squire's marriage
fell back into its usual routine. The greatest change made there was
in the residence of the attorney, who with his family went over to
live at Hoppet Hall, giving up his old house to a young man from Norrington,
who had become his partner, but keeping the old office for his business.


But when they hailed him as Prince and King, and explained to him how matters stood, and went
down on their knees before him, offering the crown (on a velvet cushion, with four golden tassels,
each nearly as big as his head),--small though he was and lame, which lameness the courtiers
pretended not to notice,--there came such a glow into his face, such a dignity into his demeanor,
that he became beautiful, king-like.

"Yes," he said, "if you desire it, I will be your king. And I will do my best to make my people
happy."

Then there arose, from inside and outside the tower, such a shout as never yet was heard across
the lonely plain.

Prince Dolor shrank a little from the deafening sound. "How shall I be able to rule all this
great people? You forget, my lords, that I am only a little boy still."

"Not so very little," was the respectful answer. "We have searched in the records, and found
that your Royal Highness--your Majesty, I mean--is fifteen years old."

"Am I?" said Prince Dolor; and his first thought was a thoroughly childish pleasure that he
should now have a birthday, with a whole nation to keep it. Then he remembered that his childish
days were done. He was a monarch now. Even his nurse, to whom, the moment he saw her, he had
held out his hand, kissed it reverently, and called him ceremoniously "his Majesty the King."

"A king must be always a king, I suppose," said he half-sadly, when, the ceremonies over, he
had been left to himself for just ten minutes, to put off his boy's clothes and be reattired
in magnificent robes, before he was conveyed away from his tower to the royal palace.

He could take nothing with him; indeed, he soon saw that, however politely they spoke, they
would not allow him to take anything. If he was to be their king, he must give up his old life
forever. So he looked with tender farewell on his old books, old toys, the furniture he knew
so well, and the familiar plain in all its levelness--ugly yet pleasant, simply because it
was familiar.

"It will be a new life in a new world," said he to himself; "but I'll remember the old things
still. And, oh! if before I go I could but once see my dear old godmother."

While he spoke he had laid himself down on the bed for a minute or two, rather tired with his
grandeur, and confused by the noise of the trumpets which kept playing incessantly down below.
He gazed, half sadly, up to the skylight, whence there came pouring a stream of sunrays, with
innumerable motes floating there, like a bridge thrown between heaven and earth. Sliding down
it, as if she had been made of air, came the little old woman in gray.

So beautiful looked she--old as she was--that Prince Dolor was at first quite startled by the
apparition. Then he held out his arms in eager delight.

"Oh, godmother, you have not forsaken me!"

"Not at all, my son. You may not have seen me, but I have seen you many a time."

"How?"

"Oh, never mind. I can turn into anything I please, you know. And I have been a bearskin rug,
and a crystal goblet--and sometimes I have changed from inanimate to animate nature, put on
feathers, and made myself very comfortable as a bird."

"Ha!" laughed the prince, a new light breaking in upon him as he caught the infection of her
tone, lively and mischievous. "Ha! ha! a lark, for instance?"

"Or a magpie," answered she, with a capital imitation of Mistress Mag's croaky voice. "Do you
suppose I am always sentimental, and never funny? If anything makes you happy, gay, or grave,
don't you think it is more than likely to come through your old godmother?"

"I believe that," said the boy tenderly, holding out his arms. They clasped one another in
a close embrace.

Suddenly Prince Dolor looked very anxious. "You will not leave me now that I am a king? Otherwise
I had rather not be a king at all. Promise never to forsake me!"

The little old woman laughed gayly. "Forsake you? that is impossible. But it is just possible
you may forsake me. Not probable though. Your mother never did, and she was a queen. The sweetest
queen in all the world was the Lady Dolorez."

"Tell me about her," said the boy eagerly. "As I get older I think I can understand more. Do
tell me."

"Not now. You couldn't hear me for the trumpets and the shouting. But when you are come to
the palace, ask for a long-closed upper room, which looks out upon the Beautiful Mountains;
open it and take it for your own. Whenever you go there you will always find me, and we will
talk together about all sorts of things."

"And about my mother?"

The little old woman nodded--and kept nodding and smiling to herself many times, as the boy
repeated over and over again the sweet words he had never known or understood--"my mother--my
mother."

"Now I must go," said she, as the trumpets blared louder and louder, and the shouts of the
people showed that they would not endure any delay. "Good-by, good-by! Open the window and
out I fly."

Prince Dolor repeated gayly the musical rhyme--but all the while tried to hold his godmother fast.

Vain, vain! for the moment that a knocking was heard at his door the sun went behind a cloud,
the bright stream of dancing motes vanished, and the little old woman with them--he knew not where.

So Prince Dolor quitted his tower--which he had entered so mournfully and ignominiously as
a little helpless baby carried in the deaf-mute's arms--quitted it as the great King of Nomansland.

The only thing he took away with him was something so insignificant that none of the lords,
gentlemen, and soldiers who escorted him with such triumphant splendor could possibly notice
it--a tiny bundle, which he had found lying on the floor just where the bridge of sunbeams
had rested. At once he had pounced upon it, and thrust it secretly into his bosom, where it
dwindled into such small proportions that it might have been taken for a mere chest-comforter,
a bit of flannel, or an old pocket-handkerchief. It was his traveling-cloak!

CHAPTER X

Did Prince Dolar become a great king? Was he, though little more than a boy, "the father of
his people," as all kings ought to be? Did his reign last long--long and happy? and what were
the principal events of it, as chronicled in the history of Nomansland?

Why, if I were to answer all these questions I should have to write another book. And I'm tired,
children, tired--as grown-up people sometimes are, though not always with play. (Besides, I
have a small person belonging to me, who, though she likes extremely to listen to the word-of-mouth
story of this book, grumbles much at the writing of it, and has run about the house clapping
her hands with joy when mamma told her that it was nearly finished. But that is neither here
nor there.)

I have related as well as I could the history of Prince Dolor, but with the history of Nomansland
I am as yet unacquainted. If anybody knows it, perhaps he or she will kindly write it all down
in another book. But mine is done.

However, of this I am sure, that Prince Dolor made an excellent king. Nobody ever does anything
less well, not even the commonest duty of common daily life, for having such a godmother as
the little old woman clothed in gray, whose name is--well, I leave you to guess. Nor, I think,
is anybody less good, less capable of both work and enjoyment in after-life, for having been
a little unhappy in his youth, as the prince had been.

I cannot take upon myself to say that he was always happy now--who is?--or that he had no cares;
just show me the person who is quite free from them! But whenever people worried and bothered
him--as they did sometimes, with state etiquette, state squabbles, and the like, setting up
themselves and pulling down their neighbors--he would take refuge in that upper room which
looked out on the Beautiful Mountains, and, laying his head on his godmother's shoulder, become
calmed and at rest.

Also, she helped him out of any difficulty which now and then occurred--for there never was
such a wise old woman. When the people of Nomansland raised the alarm--as sometimes they did--for
what people can exist without a little fault-finding?--and began to cry out, "Un-happy is the
nation whose king is a child," she would say to him gently, "You are a child. Accept the fact.
Be humble--be teachable. Lean upon the wisdom of others till you have gained your own."

He did so. He learned how to take advice before attempting to give it, to obey before he could
righteously command. He assembled round him all the good and wise of his kingdom--laid all
its affairs before them, and was guided by their opinions until he had maturely formed his own.

This he did sooner than anybody would have imagined who did not know of his godmother and his
traveling-cloak--two secret blessings, which, though many guessed at, nobody quite understood.
Nor did they understand why he loved so the little upper room, except that it had been his
mother's room, from the window of which, as people remembered now, she had used to sit for
hours watching the Beautiful Mountains.

Out of that window he used to fly--not very often; as he grew older, the labors of state prevented
the frequent use of his traveling-cloak; still he did use it sometimes. Only now it was less
for his own pleasure and amusement than to see something or investigate something for the good
of the country. But he prized his godmother's gift as dearly as ever. It was a comfort to him
in all his vexations, an enhancement of all his joys. It made him almost forget his lameness--which
was never cured.

However, the cruel things which had been once foreboded of him did not happen. His misfortune
was not such a heavy one, after all. It proved to be of much less inconvenience, even to himself,
than had been feared. A council of eminent surgeons and mechanicians invented for him a wonderful
pair of crutches, with the help of which, though he never walked easily or gracefully, he did
manage to walk so as to be quite independent. And such was the love his people bore him that
they never heard the sound of his crutches on the marble palace floors without a leap of the
heart, for they knew that good was coming to them whenever he approached.

Thus, though he never walked in processions, never reviewed his troops mounted on a magnificent
charger, nor did any of the things which make a show monarch so much appreciated, he was able
for all the duties and a great many of the pleasures of his rank. When he held his levees,
not standing, but seated on a throne ingeniously contrived to hide his infirmity, the people
thronged to greet him; when he drove out through the city streets, shouts followed him wherever
he went--every countenance brightened as he passed, and his own, perhaps, was the brightest of all.

First, because, accepting his affliction as inevitable, he took it patiently; second, because,
being a brave man, he bore it bravely, trying to forget himself, and live out of himself, and
in and for other people. Use of new Fuel made compulsory. Fuel shares go up from a nominal 2s. 6d.

His twenty-four other godfathers and godmothers, or as many of them as were still alive, crowded
round him as soon as he ascended the throne. He was very civil to them all, but adopted none
of the names they had given him, keeping to the one by which he had been always known, though
it had now almost lost its meaning; for King Dolor was one of the happiest and cheerfulest
men alive.

He did a good many things, however, unlike most men and most kings, which a little astonished
his subjects. First, he pardoned the condemned woman who had been his nurse, and ordained that
from henceforth there should be no such thing as the punishment of death in Nomansland. All
capital criminals were to be sent to perpetual imprisonment in Hopeless Tower and the plain
round about it, where they could do no harm to anybody, and might in time do a little good,
as the woman had done.

Another surprise he shortly afterward gave the nation. He recalled his uncle's family, who
had fled away in terror to another country, and restored them to all their honors in their
own. By and by he chose the eldest son of his eldest cousin (who had been dead a year), and
had him educated in the royal palace, as the heir to the throne. This little prince was a quiet,
unobtrusive boy, so that everybody wondered at the King's choosing him when there were so many
more; but as he grew into a fine young fellow, good and brave, they agreed that the King judged
more wisely than they.

"Not a lame prince, either," his Majesty observed one day, watching him affectionately; for
he was the best runner, the highest leaper, the keenest and most active sportsman in the country.
"One cannot make one's self, but one can sometimes help a little in the making of somebody
else. It is well."

This was said, not to any of his great lords and ladies, but to a good old woman--his first
homely nurse whom he had sought for far and wide, and at last found in her cottage among the
Beautiful Mountains. He sent for her to visit him once a year, and treated her with great honor
until she died. He was equally kind, though somewhat less tender, to his other nurse, who,
after receiving her pardon, returned to her native town and grew into a great lady, and I hope
a good one. But as she was so grand a personage now, any little faults she had did not show.

Thus King Dolor's reign passed year after year, long and prosperous. Whether he were happy--"as
happy as a king"--is a question no human being can decide. But I think he was, because he had
the power of making everybody about him happy, and did it too; also because he was his godmother's
godson, and could shut himself up with her whenever he liked, in that quiet little room in
view of the Beautiful Mountains, which nobody else ever saw or cared to see. They were too
far off, and the city lay so low. But there they were, all the time. No change ever came to
them; and I think, at any day throughout his long reign, the King would sooner have lost his
crown than have lost sight of the Beautiful Mountains.

In course of time, when the little Prince, his cousin, was grown into a tall young man, capable
of all the duties of a man, his Majesty did one of the most extraordinary acts ever known in
a sovereign beloved by his people and prosperous in his reign. He announced that he wished
to invest his heir with the royal purple--at any rate, for a time--while he himself went away
on a distant journey, whither he had long desired to go.

Everybody marveled, but nobody opposed him. Who could oppose the good King, who was not a young
king now? And besides, the nation had a great admiration for the young regent--and possibly
a lurking pleasure in change.

So there was a fixed day when all the people whom it would hold assembled in the great square
of the capital, to see the young prince installed solemnly in his new duties, and undertaking
his new vows. He was a very fine young fellow; tall and straight as a poplar tree, with a frank,
handsome face--a great deal handsomer than the king, some people said, but others thought differently.
However, as his Majesty sat on his throne, with his gray hair falling from underneath his crown,
and a few wrinkles showing in spite of his smile, there was something about his countenance
which made his people, even while they shouted, regard him with a tenderness mixed with awe.

He lifted up his thin, slender hand, and there came a silence over the vast crowd immediately.
Then he spoke, in his own accustomed way, using no grand words, but saying what he had to say
in the simplest fashion, though with a clearness that struck their ears like the first song
of a bird in the dusk of the morning.

"My people, I am tired: I want to rest. I have had a long reign, and done much work--at least,
as much as I was able to do. Many might have done it better than I--but none with a better
will. Now I leave it to others; I am tired, very tired. Let me go home."

There arose a murmur--of content or discontent none could well tell; then it died down again,
and the assembly listened silently once more.

"I am not anxious about you, my people--my children," continued the King. "You are prosperous
and at peace. I leave you in good hands. The Prince Regent will be a fitter king for you than I."

"No, no, no!" rose the universal shout--and those who had sometimes found fault with him shouted
louder than anybody. But he seemed as if he heard them not. 

A few public-spirited householders insist on their cooks using it in the kitchen. Cooks of public-spirited
householders unanimously give warning. No quotation of Fuel Company's shares on Stock Exchange.

(Later).--Very reforming Parliament just returned.
"Yes, I must go. It is time for me to go. Remember me sometimes, my people, for I have loved
you well. And I am going a long way, and I do not think I shall come back any more."

He drew a little bundle out of his breast pocket--a bundle that nobody had ever seen before.
It was small and shabby-looking, and tied up with many knots, which untied themselves in an
instant. With a joyful countenance, he muttered over it a few half-intelligible words. Then,
so suddenly that even those nearest to his Majesty could not tell how it came about, the King
was away--away--floating right up in the air--upon something, they knew not what, except that
it appeared to be as safe and pleasant as the wings of a bird.

And after him sprang a bird--a dear little lark, rising from whence no one could say, since
larks do not usually build their nests in the pavement of city squares. But there it was, a
real lark, singing far over their heads, louder and clearer and more joyful as it vanished
further into the blue sky.

Shading their eyes, and straining their ears, the astonished people stood until the whole vision
disappeared like a speck in the clouds--the rosy clouds that overhung the Beautiful Mountains.

King Dolor was never again beheld or heard of in his own country. But the good he had done
there lasted for years and years; he was long missed and deeply mourned--at least, so far as
anybody could mourn one who was gone on such a happy journey.

Whither he went, or who went with him, it is impossible to say. But I myself believe that his
godmother took him on his traveling-cloak to the Beautiful Mountains. What he did there, or
where he is now, who can tell? I cannot. But one thing I am quite sure of, that, wherever he
is, he is perfectly happy.

"I should have hated all men," added she, "had I not seen him! Oh, madam, how charming he is!

"And these words--'She is better in my heart,'" said the princess; "must we burn them too?"
