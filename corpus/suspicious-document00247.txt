Johnson and Lord Heathfield are among his finest male portraits, Miss Bowles and Master Bunbury
are unsurpassed among his pictures of children, and the Strawberry Girl was the painter's own
favorite fancy picture. Penelope Boothby and Angels' Heads are popular favorites which could
not be omitted from any collection. In Lady Cockburn and Her Children, The Duchess of Devonshire
and Her Child, and Pickaback we have typical groups of mothers and children. Mrs. Siddons stands
apart as one of his most unique and remarkable productions. The other pictures add as much
as possible to the variety of the collection, and show something of the range of Reynolds's art.

INTRODUCTION

I. ON THE ART OF REYNOLDS

The name of Sir Joshua Reynolds holds a place of honor among the world's great portrait painters.
To appreciate fully his originative power one must understand the disadvantages under which
he worked. His technical training was of the meagrest kind, and all his life he was hampered
by ignorance of anatomy. But on the other hand he combined all those peculiar qualities of
the artist without which no amount of technical skill can produce great portrait work.

He had, in the first place, that indefinable quality of taste, which means so much in portraiture.
His was an unerring instinct for poise, drapery, color, and composition. Each of his figures
seems to assume naturally an attitude of perfect grace; the draperies fall of their own accord
in beautiful lines.

Reynolds knew, too, the secret of imparting an air of distinction to his sitters. The meanest
subject was elevated by his art to a position of dignity. His magic touch made every child
charming, every woman graceful, and every man dignified.

Finally, he possessed in no small degree, though curiously enough entirely disclaiming the
quality, the gift of presenting the essential personality of the sitter, that which a critic
has called the power of "realizing an individuality." This is seen most clearly in his portraits
of men, and naturally in the portraits of the men he knew best, as Johnson.

It is a matter of constant amazement in studying the works of Reynolds to observe his "inexhaustible
inventiveness in pose and attitude." For each new picture he seemed always to have ready some
new compositional motive. Claude Phillips goes so far as to say that in the whole range of
art Rembrandt alone is his equal in this respect. This versatility was due in a measure to
his story-telling instinct. His imagination seemed to weave some story about each sitter which
the picture was intended, as it were, to illustrate. From Lord Heathfield, refusing to yield
the keys of Gibraltar, to little Miss Bowles, dropping on the ground in the midst of her romp,
through the long range of mothers playing with their children, there seems no end to the variety
of lively incident which he could invent.

The pose of the sitter suggests some dramatic moment in the imaginary episode. Often the attitude
is full of action, as in the Miss Bowles, and at times there is a striking impression of motion,
as in Pickaback. So strong is the dramatic effect conveyed by these pictures that the figures
seem actually taken unaware in the very act of performance, as by a snapshot in modern photography.
This quality of "momentariness," as Phillips calls it, so dangerous in the hands of a commonplace
painter, lends a peculiar fascination to many of Reynolds's pictures. That he also appreciated
the beauty of repose we see in such portraits as Penelope Boothby and Anne Bingham.

Reynolds's inventiveness was so overtaxed by his enormous number of sitters that it is scarcely
to be wondered at that it sometimes failed him. Occasionally he resorted to such artificial
devices as were common among his contemporaries. Such fresh inspirations as the Strawberry
Girl and Master Bunbury could come but rarely in a lifetime. The spontaneity of Miss Bowles
is perhaps unexcelled in all his works.

Reynolds's compositional schemes are of an academic elegance reminiscent of Raphael. He knew
well how to accomplish the flow of line, the balance of masses, the symmetry of outline, which
produce a harmonious effect. A variety of designs were at his command, from the well-worn but
always effective pyramidal form illustrated in many single figures, to those more novel forms
he invented for groups such as Lady Cockburn and the Duchess of Devonshire.

Reynolds was frankly a borrower from many sources. In the Roman, the Bolognese, the Venetian,
Flemish, and Dutch schools, he found something to appropriate and make his own. From Rembrandt
he took suggestions of lighting, and such sombre color harmonies as are seen in the portrait
of Mrs. Siddons. Something of bloom and splendor he caught from the florid Rubens; something
of the decorative effectiveness of such pictures as Lady Cockburn may be traced to the influence
of Titian and the Venetians. Yet to all that he borrowed, Reynolds added his own individual
touch. As a critic has said, he was always Reynolds from first to last.

Much has been written of the evanescence of Reynolds's colors. His passion for color experiments
amounted to a mania, and cost the world many beautiful pictures. Precisely what was the nature
of these experiments, and what combination of pigments ruined his pictures, is of interest
only to the expert. Fortunately, enough pictures escaped to show us the original glory of those
which have faded. Among the best preserved canvases, "those in which his power and brilliancy
appear least impaired, those in which the typical Sir Joshua still most unmistakably shines
forth," are Lady Cockburn and her Children, Miss Bowles, Mrs. Siddons, and Angels' Heads.

The range of Reynolds's art is much wider than is commonly supposed. A very imperfect appreciation
of his gifts is gained by those who know only his portraits of women and children. These indeed
show a peculiar insight into childhood, and a rare delicacy in the interpretation of womanhood.
But Reynolds is at his strongest in the portrayal of men. It is by such portraits as the Johnson
and Heathfield that he is worthy a place among the immortals.

II. ON BOOKS OF REFERENCE

THE original biographical material on the subject of Reynolds was supplied by his own contemporaries.
His friend Malone wrote a valuable Memoir (1804), and his pupil Northcote furnished the first
biography of the painter, the Life of Reynolds in two volumes published in 1813. A half century
later (1865) was published the most comprehensive work on Reynolds in two large volumes by
C. R. Leslie and T. Taylor. At about the same time (1866) appeared a book by F. G. Stephens,
"English Children as painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds."

All these books have been long out of print, and there are now but two books of reference generally
available. "Sir Joshua Reynolds," by Claude Phillips (1894), is a small volume, but it gives
a fairly complete summary of the painter's works, with valuable critical comments. Sir Walter
Armstrong's large and richly illustrated work "Sir Joshua Reynolds" (1900) treats the subject
exhaustively, and contains a complete descriptive catalogue and directory of Reynolds's works--portraits
and subject pictures--arranged in alphabetical order.

There is an immense bibliography of memoirs of the period of George III., and such books throw
an interesting light upon the lives of many of Reynolds's sitters. Some of the most valuable
are Horace Walpole's "Letters," Fanny Burney's "Diary," Mrs. Piozzi's "Memoirs," and Wraxall's
"Memoirs."

In addition to these, Boswell's incomparable "Life of Johnson" presents a series of vivid pictures
of the life of the period, and contains many anecdotes of the friendship between Reynolds and
the great lexicographer.

Reynolds's lectures and writings fill two volumes of the Bohn Library. Of these the twelve
discourses delivered before the Royal Academy are the most valuable, and have been reprinted
in various editions. The most recent is that of 1891, with notes and a biographical introduction
by E. G. Johnson. Intended as means of instruction to beginners in painting, these lectures
deal with general principles rather than with practical technique, and are not to be taken
as expository in any measure of Reynolds's own art.

1. Penelope Boothby. Painted in July, 1788. In the possession of Mrs. Thwaites.

2. Master Crewe as Henry VIII. Painted in 1775 for John Crewe, Esq., and exhibited at the Royal
Academy, 1776. Size: 4 ft. 8 in. by 3 ft. 9 in. In the possession of the Earl of Crewe.

3. Lady Cockburn and her Children. Reynolds began the picture in 1773 and upon its completion
in 1774 received £183 15s. in payment. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1774, after
which it was dated 1775. Passed into the possession of Lady Hamilton, daughter of Sir James
Cockburn (7th baronet), and by her bequeathed to the English National Gallery, where it hung,
1892-1900, when it was learned that Lady Hamilton had no power to dispose of the picture. It
was then sold at auction to Mr. Beit, Park Lane, London. Size: 4 ft. 6 in. by 3 ft. 7-1/2 in.

4. Miss Bowles. Painted in 1775. Now in the Wallace Collection, Hertford House, London. Size:
2 ft. 11-1/2 in. by 2 ft. 3-3/4 in.

5. Master Bunbury. Exhibited at the Royal Academy, 1781; bequeathed by Reynolds to Mrs. Bunbury.
In the possession of Sir Henry Bunbury. Size: 2 ft. 5 in. by 2 ft.

6. Mrs. Siddons as the Tragic Muse. Painted in 1783 and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1784.
The original work was bought by M. de Calonne for 800 guineas, and finally came into the possession
of the Marquis of Westminster, in whose family it has since remained. It is in the gallery
of Grosvenor House, London.

7. Angels' Heads. Painted for Lord William Gordon (100 guineas) and exhibited at the Royal
Academy, 1787. Presented by Lady Gordon to the National Gallery, London, 1841. Size: 2 ft.
6 in. by 2 ft. 1 in.

8. The Duchess of Devonshire and her Child. Exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1786. The original
is at Chatsworth House, and there is a copy at Windsor Castle, from which our reproduction is made.

9. Hope. One of the figures of the window design, New College Chapel, Oxford. The original
design was painted in oil in 1778, and was purchased by the Earl of Normanton.

10. Lord Heathfield. Begun August 27, 1787, and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1788. Originally
painted for Alderman Boydell, and purchased by Parliament in 1824. Now in the National Gallery,
London. Size: 4 ft. 8 in. by 3 ft. 8 in.

11. Mrs. Payne-Gallwey and Child (Pickaback). Painted 1779. As late as 1886 it was in the possession
of Lord Monson, and is now owned by J. Pierpont Morgan, Esq.

12. Cupid as Link Boy. The date is not certainly fixed, but it is known that Reynolds was at
work in the spring of 1771 upon some subjects of this class, several of which were engraved
in the period 1771-1777. In the possession of Alexander Henderson, Esq. Size: 2 ft. 5 in. by 2 ft.

13. Hon. Anne Bingham. Painted in 1786. In the possession of Earl Spencer. Size: 2 ft. 5-1/2
in. by 2 ft. 1/2 in.

14. The Strawberry Girl. Painted for the Earl of Carysfort (50 guineas) and exhibited at the
Royal Academy, 1773. As Reynolds repeated the subject it is difficult to trace the history
of the original picture. The painting now in the Wallace Collection, Hertford House, came from
the Samuel Rogers Collection. Size: 2 ft. 5-3/4 in. by 2 ft. 3/4 in.

15. Samuel Johnson. Painted for Mr. Thrale for the Streatham Gallery, 1772. Now in the National
Gallery, London.

I

PENELOPE BOOTHBY

Somewhat over a century ago, at the time when our American colonies were struggling for liberty,
lived the great English portrait painter, Sir Joshua Reynolds. In those days photography had
not been invented, and portrait painting was a profession patronized by all classes of people.
There were many portrait studios in London, but none were so fashionable as that of Reynolds.

It is said that in his long life he painted as many as three thousand portraits. There was
scarcely a distinguished man or beautiful woman in the kingdom who did not sit to him, and
many were the children whose portraits he painted. If all his works could be brought together
they would form a complete historical gallery of the reign of George III. Here we should see
princes, statesmen, and warriors, actors and poets, court beauties and "blue stockings," the
petted children of the rich, and the picturesque waifs of the London streets. Among the faces
we should find those, like Fox and Burke, whose lives were intimately connected with the destinies
of our own nation, and those, like Goldsmith and Johnson, whose names are familiar in our schools
and homes. There is something about these portraits which makes them seem alive, something
too which gives to the plainest person a certain dignity and interest.

With all the variety of subjects which Reynolds treated he was never happier than when painting
children. He loved them dearly, delighted to play with them, and seemed to understand them
as few grown people do. In his great octagonal painting room were many things to amuse his
little friends, and a portrait sitting there usually meant a frolic.

Penelope Boothby is the name of the little girl in our illustration, and the old-fashioned
name is precisely suited to the quaint figure in cap and mitts. We are reminded of that Penelope
of the old Greek poem, the Odyssey, who waited so faithfully through the years for the return
of her husband Odysseus from the Trojan war. The story runs that, believing Odysseus to be
dead, many suitors begged her hand, but she always replied that before marrying she must first
complete the shroud she was making for her aged father-in-law. Every day she busied herself
with the task, but when night came she secretly undid all that she had wrought through the
day, so that it might never reach completion. Thus she prolonged the time of waiting until
at last Odysseus returned to claim his wife.

Whether or not the little Penelope of our picture knew this story we cannot say, but it was
the fashion of the times to revive the names and legends of mythology, and Penelope was a name
which had come to stand for all the domestic virtues.

As we look at the picture for the first time the quaint costume of the little girl suggests
the idea that she is dressed for a tableau. Children the world over love to don the clothes
of a past generation and play at men and women. Miss Penelope, we fancy, has been ransacking
some old chest of faded finery, and has arrayed herself in the character of "Martha Washington,"
as painted by Gilbert Stuart. The snowy kerchief folded across her bosom and the big mob cap
on her head are precisely like those in the portraits of the colonial lady. The child purses
her lips together primly and folds her hands in a demure attitude in her lap, as if to play
her part well, but she is far too shy to look us directly in the face, and glances aside with
downcast eyes.

All this illusion is dispelled when we come to study the customs of the period. It appears
that children then, both in England and America, dressed precisely like their elders, and Penelope's
costume here is doubtless such as she wore every day. A little Boston girl, Anna Green Winslow,
wrote in her diary in 1771 of wearing a cap and black mitts which we fancy were not unlike
these. There are portraits, too, of other little girls of the time, wearing the same huge headdress,
as we may see in the family group of the Copleys in the Boston Art Museum.

Penelope was the only child of Sir Brooke Boothby, and, as we may well believe from her winsome
face, the darling of the household. Her home was a fine mansion buried among trees in the beautiful
English country. She was, we fancy, a quiet little girl, preferring a corner with her dolls
to any boisterous romp, but not without a bit of fun in her nature. She was an affectionate
little creature, and very fond of her father, watching at the gate for his return home, and
sitting on his knee in the evening. On Sunday mornings she went to the quaint old church of
Ashbourne and knelt beside her mother in the service.

All this and much more we learn from a book written by her father which bears the pathetic
title of "Sorrows." For little Penelope died at the age of seven, and the stricken parent solaced
himself in his loneliness by writing the memories of his darling.

The portrait by Reynolds was made when the child was four years old. After her death, Fuseli
painted a picture representing her borne to heaven by an angel. There is also a lovely marble
monument to Penelope, by Banks, in the Ashbourne church.[3]

the Painter of Little Penelope."]

II

MASTER CREWE AS HENRY VIII

There was once on the throne of England a king named Henry VIII. He was a man of extraordinary
character, with qualities both good and bad. His conduct was sometimes unscrupulous and tyrannical,
and he let nothing interfere with his own pleasure. Nevertheless his reign brought many benefits
to England, and his memory is respected by English people.

In his early manhood, Henry was accounted the handsomest prince of his time, but allowance
must be made for the flattery of his subjects. He was a big, rather coarse-looking man, with
small eyes, and a large face and double chin. For his noisy ways and rough manners he has been
familiarly called "Bluff King Hal" and "Burly King Harry." He was fond of the hunt and the
tournament and all kinds of manly exercise. He was also much given to show and display, and
loved rich dresses.

He employed as his court painter the celebrated Dutch artist Holbein, who made various portraits
of the members of the royal family. There was one particularly fine group which was unfortunately
destroyed by fire, but as a copy had previously been made we still know what the picture was like.

Henry VIII. had been dead some two hundred years before the Master Crewe of our picture was
born, but English kings are not allowed to be forgotten. Successive generations of children
were shown Holbein's portraits of the bluff old ruler, and were taught something about his reign.

It happened one time that the children of Master Crewe's acquaintance had a fancy dress party.
The Crewes were people of fashion who entered constantly into social affairs. Naturally there
was much discussion over their son's part and costume. It was a happy thought which fixed upon
the character of Henry VIII., for the boy's round face, square shoulders, and sturdy frame
were well fitted for the rôle.

Evidently no pains were spared to make the costume historically correct. Holbein's portrait
was the costumer's model, and every detail was faithfully followed. The boy is dressed in the
fashion of the sixteenth century in "doublet and hose." This consists first of a richly embroidered
waistcoat, the most effective part of the dress. The sleeves are made of the same material
and are gathered at the wrists in a ruffle. The lower part of the doublet is a skirt falling
just above the knees.

Over all is flung a handsome mantle; but this is drawn apart in front to display the smart
waistcoat to full advantage. A broad-brimmed hat set jauntily on one side, and trimmed with
a long feather, completes the costume. By way of ornament is worn a big jewelled collar and
a long chain with locket. A short sword swings from the girdle, and on the left leg is the
garter, which is the badge of membership in the ancient Order of the Garter, of which Henry
VIII. was the tenth sovereign member. This is of dark blue ribbon edged with gold, and bearing
in gold letters the motto "Honi soit qui mal y pense".[4]

[Footnote 4: Evil to him who evil thinks.]

It is one thing to have a perfect costume, and another to understand the rôle. Master Crewe
not only looks his part, but he acts it as well. He has not failed to take in all the points
of the portrait, and imitates the pompous attitude to perfection. He stands with feet wide
apart, grasping his gloves in the right hand and supporting the other on the sash.

He is a bright boy, who enters into the spirit of the game, and it tickles him hugely to play
the part of a despot. But while he is Henry VIII. in miniature, he is Henry VIII. without the
king's coarseness, and in the place is a child's innocent pleasure. It was no wonder that his
parents, delighted with the success of the costume, wished to have a portrait made.

The boy is painted as he appeared when posing for his admiring friends. In his effort to assume
a lordly air his boyish glee gets the better of him, and he belies the character by a broad
grin. Perhaps he has caught the twinkle in his father's eye, or his mother's suppressed smile,
and he can keep serious no longer. "Bravo!" cries the audience, and he smiles in innocent delight
at his success.

His pet dogs are in the room, and one of them is rather suspicious of this strange young prince.
He sniffs cautiously at his legs, for though his eyes deceive him, his sense of smell cannot
be mistaken.

Through a window in the rear we get a glimpse of the park beyond, which adds much to the beauty
of the picture. As we shall see in other pictures of this collection[5] an interior gives a
sense of imprisonment unless it contains some opening. The mass of bright color which the landscape
makes in the upper right corner is balanced in the lower left corner by a cloak thrown over
a chair.

[Footnote 5: See Lady Cockburn and her Children, and the Duchess of Devonshire and her Child.]

Reynolds painted so many fine portraits of boys that it is hard to say that this or that one
is best, though some have preferred Master Crewe to all others.[6] We shall see by-and-by in
Master Bunbury, and the Cupid, that the painter understood boy nature pretty thoroughly. This
rollicking Master Crewe is not so serious as Master Bunbury, nor so sly as the Cupid boy; he
is in fact a typical English lad, sturdy, masterful, frank, and good-natured.

[Footnote 6: Leslie and Taylor say that "none of his many admirable boy pictures is so consummate."]

III

LADY COCKBURN AND HER CHILDREN

A pretty story is told of a Roman matron named Cornelia, who was one day entertaining a visitor,
when the conversation led to the subject of jewels. "These are my jewels," said the hostess,
and turned to show the stranger her beautiful children. The story comes readily to mind as
one looks at this portrait of Lady Cockburn and her Children. Indeed, the picture was once
engraved[7] under the fanciful title of "Cornelia and her Children." Like the Roman matron
of old, the English mother gathers her children about her as the choicest jewels of her possession.
Her stately beauty is of the classic sort, and the children are as charming as English children
are reputed to be.

[Footnote 7: By Tomkins, in 1792.]

All three are boys. The eldest is James, who kneels on his mother's lap, playfully grasping
the mantle about her neck, and supported in his precarious position by her hand placed firmly
on his back. He has the sweet expression which betokens a sunny nature, and his well-cut features
are such as make a handsome man. He was his father's heir and namesake, succeeding him as the
seventh baronet.

The rogue peeping over his mother's shoulder is George. Though his features are less regular
than his elder brother's, he is none the less attractive, for he is a jolly little fellow.
When he grew to manhood he entered the navy and became an admiral. It was on his ship, the
Northumberland, that Napoleon was conveyed to the island of St. Helena to end his days in exile.
In the course of time Admiral Cockburn became the eighth baronet of the name.

The baby lying on the mother's lap is William. In after years he entered the ministry, married
a daughter of Sir Robert Peel, and became Dean of York. It was fitting that one of Lady Cockburn's
sons should enter the Church, as her father, Dr. Ayscough, had been Dean of Bristol. Upon the
death of his elder brother, the Dean of York became the ninth baronet.

The picture shows the three children in a game of hide-and-seek. George, who is evidently the
leader of the fun, dodges up and down behind his mother, throwing little William into an ecstasy
of delight. As the round face appears again over the shoulder, the baby reaches up his fat
little hand to clutch his brother's arm, fairly doubling himself up in his pleasure, and grasping
one foot in his other hand.

James enjoys the play more quietly. It is quite likely that he has been hiding his face in
his mother's mantle, but now he pauses to watch his little brother's amusement, his lips parted
in a smile, his finger directing the baby where to look.

The mother turns her face towards that of her eldest son, scanning it closely.

The action in the picture is so delightfully natural that we do not at first realize how difficult
a problem is solved in the arrangement of the four figures. An amateur photographer places
his sitters in a stiff row and directs them all to look towards a single point. The master
artist conceives of some action which shall engage the attention of all, and form a natural
connection between them. Thus, in our picture, the interest of the game binds the figures together.
The baby lifts his face to that of the mother and brother; the mother turns to the child at
her right, and the latter looks down at the baby, thus completing the circle.

The lines of the composition are also so disposed as to bring the figures together in a close
unity. Follow the outer edge of the figure of James at the left; trace across the mother's
lap the line made by the border of her mantle, and continued along the baby's body. From the
mother's elbow move the pencil past the baby's head and along his out-stretched arm till the
line ends at the top of George's head, and from this point carry a somewhat irregular line
across to the head of James. We have thus traced the parallelogram which incloses the group.

The centre of the group is somewhat at the left of the centre of the canvas, and the picture
would seem one-sided were it not for the details of the background at the right. Here the painter
has represented a parapet supporting a marble pillar, at the base of which a large macaw perches.
Beyond is seen a beautiful landscape. This spot of color brings the composition into perfect
balance. More than this, the view thus opened relieves the crowded effect of the compact grouping.
The surrounding space would not seem large enough for the four figures were it not for this
added depth of space, which gives the eye a long distance to traverse.

The composition is as fine in color as it is in lines and masses. It is a "splendid tawny color
harmony, formed by the red of the curtain, the warm flesh tints, the rich orange yellow of
the outer robe of satin bordered with white fur, and the gaudy plumage of the macaw".[8]

[Footnote 8: Claude Phillips.]

With so many great artistic qualities, it is no wonder that the portrait has always been admired.
Upon its completion in 1774 it was sent to the Royal Academy to be exhibited, and when it was
first brought into the room, all the painters present, struck with admiration, burst into a
tumult of applause and handclapping. Even after this the painstaking painter probably added
some finishing touches and inscribed his name and the date, 1775, upon the ornamental border
of the lady's mantle.

IV

MISS BOWLES

A little girl and her dog are playing together in a wooded park. The place is a fine playground,
with its soft, grassy carpet, and noble old trees. It is the sort of park which adjoins country
houses of wealthy old English families, where years of training have brought to perfection
the trees planted by previous generations. Here and there, through spaces among the branches,
shafts of sunlight illumine the shady spot.

The child herself seems like some woodland sprite. She is bubbling over with fun, and is scarcely
still a minute. Her spaniel is a gay playfellow,--a beautiful creature, with long silky hair
and drooping ears. He is intelligent, too, and devoted to his mistress.

She leads him a merry chase, darting in and out among the big trees which hide her from him.
He bounds after her, loses her a moment, and then, as she reappears, leaps upon her with delight.

In the midst of the frolic the child's attention is attracted by a group of boys who have entered
the park, all unobserved, and have begun a game of cricket. On the instant she drops on her
knees on the grass, seizes the dog, and, lest he should interrupt the sport, clasps her arms
tight around his neck, to hold him fast. The poor spaniel is nearly choked, but patiently yields
to the caprice of his young mistress while she watches the game with dancing eyes. From her
gleeful expression one would fancy that the winner was her favorite.

Some such simple incident as this Sir Joshua Reynolds must have had in mind when painting the
portrait of Miss Bowles; for every picture of his seems to carry a story with it, each one
thought out to fit the circumstances and character of the sitter. The lively Miss Bowles, as
we see, is totally unlike the demure Miss Boothby. They are both charming children; but, while
Penelope would love to nestle in her mother's arms, Miss Bowles would dance coyly away. While
Penelope would sit in doors by the hour, contented with her sewing, Miss Bowles would be skipping
about the park like a little hoyden. The picture of Miss Bowles is, therefore, full of action;
both child and dog pause only an instant, caught, as it were, in the midst of their play. The
attitude of Penelope Boothby, on the other hand, is one of repose, as suits the tranquil nature
of the little girl. The background of each picture is likewise perfectly appropriate. Miss
Penelope's placid figure is seen against a leafy screen which nearly closes in the picture;
but Miss Bowles needs plenty of space for her romps, and has a whole park to herself.

The painter's acquaintance with little Miss Bowles began very pleasantly. Her parents, proud
of their lovely daughter, were planning to have her portrait made, and had chosen Romney for
the painter. A friend of theirs--Sir George Beaumont--induced them to change their minds and
engage Reynolds. Even if the portrait faded in time, as they were afraid it might, Sir Joshua's
pictures sometimes having that fault, it would still be more beautiful than if painted by any
other hand.

At Sir George's suggestion the painter was first invited to dinner, that he might see the child.
She appeared at dessert, and was placed beside the stranger at the table. It did not take long
for the two to become acquainted, for the painter immediately began to amuse the little girl
with stories and all sorts of tricks. Calling her attention to some object on the other side
of the room, he would steal her plate while she was looking away, and pretend to be greatly
surprised at its disappearance. They would then try to find it, but in vain, until, when she
was again off her guard, he would slip it into place, and there would be a great sensation
over its discovery. Was there ever a jollier man for a little girl to dine with!

The next day it was proposed that Miss Bowles should be taken to visit her new friend, and
she was of course delighted to go. When the party reached the studio, the child's face was
shining with expectancy as she greeted the painter. It was this expression which Reynolds has
caught so perfectly on his canvas, and which makes the little girl's face seem actually smiling
into ours.

He was equally successful in catching a natural pose, watching her closely as she danced about
the room. It was a theory of his that the unconscious movements of a child are always graceful,
and we may be sure that Miss Bowles's position here is one of her own invention. Her skirt
is spread out a little at one side, balancing, as it were, the figure of the dog opposite.
The lines inclosing the entire group form a pyramid.

The original painting is still beautiful in color, being among the best preserved of Reynolds's
works. Critics have pronounced it a "matchless work that would have immortalized Reynolds had
he never painted anything else."

V

MASTER BUNBURY

By a pleasant coincidence the year 1768 brought to Reynolds's studio for portrait sittings
two young people who began an acquaintance at this time which had a romantic ending. They were
Miss Catherine Horneck and Henry William Bunbury, who were married a few years later, and were
the parents of the little boy in our picture.

Miss Horneck was one of two pretty sisters who, upon their father's death, had become wards
of Sir Joshua, the family being old Devonshire acquaintances of his. They were now living in
London with their mother, and were great pets in society. Goldsmith, who knew them well, playfully
named Miss Catherine "Little Comedy" from the resemblance between her face and that of the
allegorical figure of Comedy in one of Reynolds's portraits of Garrick.

Mr. Bunbury was a gentleman of family and fortune, who had unusual artistic talent. His special
forte was in humorous subjects and caricatures, and his works were sought and praised by connoisseurs.

Reynolds must have followed with affectionate interest the lives of these young friends whose
attachment had been fostered in his studio. He always felt a fatherly regard for Mrs. Bunbury
and a generous admiration for her husband's artistic work. Their elder son, the boy of our
picture, was born in 1772, and was named Charles John. The painter visiting his friends saw
the child grow out of baby-hood and become a sturdy boy. He was a beautiful child, with large
eyes set wide apart in his round face. His expression was delightfully frank and honest. When
he was nine years old the portrait was painted which is reproduced in our illustration.

The boy sits under a tree in a pleasant landscape looking intently before him at some object.
Though he seems to have been carefully dressed for some special occasion he has been enjoying
himself in boy fashion in spite of that. His ringletted hair is blown about by the wind, and
the coat is unbuttoned at the throat, as he drops down to rest, hot and panting from some vigorous
exercise.

His chubby hands rest on his knees, and his eyes are fixed on something directly in front of
him. He does not seem to be a boy given to day-dreaming, and he is much too active to sit still
a long time. It must be something very interesting which awakens his curiosity. Perhaps a bumble-bee,
buzzing in and out the bell-shaped blossoms of some sweet wild flower, catches his eye, and
he almost holds his breath and watches it.

The boy's dress looks very quaint to our modern eyes. The trousers and waistcoat are made "in
one piece," and the velvet coat, with its wide skirt, seems a garment made for a middle-aged
man. As we have already seen, the children of this time dressed as miniature copies of their
elders. But while fashions in dress have changed, the child's nature is about the same in every
country and period. The eighteenth-century boy, in spite of his grown-up clothes, was fond
of all sorts of out-of-door games. Master Bunbury could doubtless match a boy of his age to-day
at marbles, tops, kites, battledore, and hop-scotch, and teach him besides many now-forgotten
sports, as "bally-cally," "chucks," "sinks," and the like.

The modern American schoolboy, studying the history of our own country, may be interested to
know that this portrait of an English boy, who was a subject of George III., was painted five
years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence. One of the signers had a son who
was of nearly the same age as Master Bunbury, a boy named William Henry Harrison, who afterwards
became the president of our republic. If we possessed a portrait of Harrison at the age of
nine, it would be interesting to compare the two boyish contemporaries of the old and the new
country. Master Bunbury, as the son of an English aristocrat, must needs have regarded our
colonists as troublesome rebels, while on his part young Harrison looked upon the English as
tyrants.

Bunbury finally entered the English army and became a general officer. He was sent to the Cape
of Good Hope while the British were holding possession there in behalf of the Dutch, and there
he died in the fullness of his early manhood in 1798.

The portrait of Master Bunbury was painted a few years after that of Miss Bowles, and Reynolds
here repeated the same arrangement which had been so successful before. It differs only in
that the entire figure of Master Bunbury is not seen, being cut off in what is called three
quarters length, just below the knees. In both pictures the lines of the composition follow
the same pyramidal form, and in both also the park-like surroundings extend into an indefinite
distance, so that the eye may follow with pleasure the long vista. Both pictures suggest the
same idea of a child pausing in play to look directly out of the canvas at some distant object.
Yet the painter has shown a perfect understanding of the difference in the temperament of the
two children, the girl, graceful, quick, mischievous, the boy, sturdy, rather serious, and
with a mind eager for information.

The portrait of Master Bunbury was evidently painted by Reynolds for his own pleasure, and
retained by him during his lifetime, after which it passed by bequest to the boy's mother.

VI

MRS. SIDDONS AS THE TRAGIC MUSE

The name of Mrs. Siddons is one of the most distinguished in the history of English dramatic
art. For thirty years she was unsurpassed in her impersonation of the tragic heroines of Shakespeare.
Her first great success was in the season of 1782, when she appeared for the second time on
the London stage. She was then about twenty-seven years of age, and had devoted years of arduous
study to her profession. Though gifted by nature with strong dramatic instincts inherited from
generations of players, her powers developed slowly. The rôles which she acted were of the
more serious sort, which required maturity and experience for interpretation. Her personal
appearance was eminently fitted for tragic parts. She had a queenly presence, a countenance
moulded in noble lines, a deep-toned measured voice, and an impressive enunciation. In private
as well as in public she commanded the highest admiration. Though all London was at her feet
flattery could not spoil her. Her children adored her, her friends found her the soul of sincerity,
and all the world honored her noble womanhood.

It was while she was still on the threshold of her great career that Reynolds painted her portrait
as the Tragic Muse.

In the old Greek mythology every art had a corresponding goddess or muse who inspired the artistic
instincts in human hearts. There was, for instance, a muse of tragedy, called Melpomene, a
muse of the dance, Terpsichore, and so on through the nine arts. The great sculptors used to
make statues of these muses, trying to express in each the highest ideal of the particular
art represented.

It was in imitation of this old custom that Reynolds conceived the idea that Mrs. Siddons,
as the greatest of tragediennes, would appropriately impersonate the muse of tragedy.[9] The
story is related that when she came to his studio for the first sitting the painter took her
by the hand and led her to the chair, saying in his courtly way: "Ascend your undisputed throne;
bestow on me some idea of the tragic muse." Whereupon she instantly assumed the attitude in
which she was painted. Among Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel there is a figure
of the prophet Isaiah, whose pose is quite similar, and may have suggested both to painter
and sitter the idea of the Tragic Muse. In any case the attitude which Mrs. Siddons assumes
is entirely characteristic.

[Footnote 9: Russell had already celebrated Mrs. Siddons as the Tragic Muse in his History
of Modern Europe, and Romney had previously painted Mrs. Yates in the same character.]

The expression of her face shows the stress of strong emotion--the struggle of a noble soul
in a conflict of forces which must end in tragedy. Her hair is brushed back from the face and
ornamented with a tiara like a royal diadem. A rich rope of pearls falls across her beautiful
neck and is gathered in a knot on her bodice. A mantle lies across her lap draped somewhat
like that in the portrait of Lady Cockburn, and, like it, inscribed with the name of the painter,
who gallantly said that "he could not resist the opportunity of going down to posterity on
the hem of her garment".[10]

[Footnote 10: The compliment has sometimes been referred to the portrait of Lady Cockburn,
but the incident is related by Northcote as told him by Mrs. Siddons herself in regard to her
own portrait.]

Behind her chair are two allegorical figures representing Crime and Remorse, the two primary
causes of tragedy. In the full face of the one at her left we can trace the features of Sir
Joshua himself, distorted though they are into the expression of a criminal.

The color of the original painting has a sombre magnificence which is in keeping with the seriousness
of the subject. The painting of the head and bust places it among the finest works of Reynolds.

The portrait shows a remarkable insight on the part of the painter into the character of Mrs.
Siddons. She had not at that time played any of her great Shakespearean rôles, but Reynolds
seemed to anticipate her power. He followed her career with unfailing interest and always made
a point of attending her first appearances and benefits, sitting among the musicians in the
orchestra. When she prepared for the character of Lady Macbeth he helped her plan the costumes
and sat rapt and breathless during her first performance. This was generally considered her
grandest effort, and she used herself to say that after playing it thirty years she never read
over the part without discovering in it something new. In this character she bade farewell
to her profession June 29, 1812. It was said by a contemporary critic that "there was not a
height of grandeur to which she could not soar, nor a darkness of misery to which she could
not descend; not a chord of feeling from the sternest to the most delicate which she could
not cause to vibrate at her will."

VII

ANGELS' HEADS

Our thoughts of angels are naturally connected with thoughts of children. Jesus once spoke
of the little ones as those whose angels always behold the face of the heavenly Father. Their
innocence is the best type we have on earth of the purity of beings of a higher sphere. Often
when we try to describe the beauty of some little child, we use the word angelic.

This explains why Sir Joshua Reynolds when called to paint the portrait of a little girl conceived
the pretty fancy of the picture of Angels' Heads.[11] The child's fair face suggested that
of an angel. She had golden hair and blue eyes, and a very sweet little mouth. It was a face
which was so charming from every point of view that he painted it in five positions. Grouping
the heads in a circle, he added wings after the manner of the cherubs of the old Italian masters,
surrounded them with clouds, and lighted the composition with a broad ray of light streaming
diagonally across the canvas.

[Footnote 11: Originally called A Cherub Head in Different Views.]

The child's hair falls about the face in straight dishevelled locks, and it is not easy to
tell at once whether it is a boy or a girl. In reality the original was little Miss Frances
Isabella Ker Gordon, only child of Lord William Gordon and his wife Frances.

In each position of the five heads the expression varies, and looking from one to another,
we may trace through the series the child's changing moods. Let each face tell its own story,
and perhaps we may learn something of the workings of the mind behind it.

Here at the lower left side the child suddenly sees some new object, a strange bird or flower,
and fixes her eyes upon it. She has a wide awake, inquiring mind, quick to notice all that
life has to offer, and she is now in an observing mood. The expression of the face just above
is very thoughtful and perhaps a little puzzled. Life brings many hard questions to the serious
child, and this is one of the little girl's pensive moods. The two upper faces at the right
show quite another expression. The lips of both are parted, and they seem to be singing. One
is reminded of the rapturous faces sometimes seen among choir boys when the music lifts them
out of their surroundings. All childish troubles and questions are forgotten, as the two faces,
flooded with light, seem to look into the glory of heaven.

And now the head is turned and the child gazes directly out of the picture with far-seeing
eyes. The expression is of perfect contentment. It will be noticed that the position of the
last head is precisely like that of Master Bunbury, and there are points of resemblance between
the two faces. The mood and expression are, however, quite unlike in the two children. The
boy's eyes are directed towards some actual object, but the eyes of the child here are those
of a dreamer fixed upon some vision of the imagination.

A portrait study like the Angels' Heads combines in a novel way the many-sided character of
the child. The mother watching a little daughter from day to day feels that she has half a
dozen little girls in one. A romp, a chatterbox, a living question mark, a philosopher, a dreamer,
a veritable angel, all these and many more change places rapidly in the child's mood. She is
taken to the photographer's for her portrait, and the negative shows only a sober little face
intently anxious to look pleasant. A more fortunate photographer may perhaps catch her expression
of eager interest as some curious new toy is shown her. But that innocent smile of happiness
that comes into her face when singing, or that far-away look of the dreamer which she wears
in the quiet twilight, is quite beyond the photographer's skill.

Reynolds knew the secret of representing these rarer and more delicate expressions. He was
by nature a true lover of children, and many years of experience had taught him to understand
their ways. Lady Gordon must have felt rich indeed to have instead of one commonplace picture
five of the dearest faces her little girl could show, preserved on a single canvas.

It is true that something of the child's individuality is lost by the sacrifice of the figure.
When we look at the other child portraits of our collection we notice how much is expressed
in the attitude and gesture of which we here have no indication. Yet the picture shows how
truly the face is "a mirror of the soul," and as an interpretation of the child's mind it is
unique among Reynolds's works.

The original picture is painted in very delicate colors, and is one of the best preserved of
Reynolds's canvases. Miss Frances died unmarried in 1831, and ten years later her mother presented
the picture to the English National Gallery.

VIII

THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE AND HER CHILD

Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire, was one of the most celebrated beauties of her time.
She was the daughter of the Earl of Spencer, and was married[12] at the age of seventeen to
William, Duke of Devonshire, "the first match in England".

[Footnote 12: March 28, 1774.]

The young duchess was as clever as she was beautiful. She was fond of history, music and drawing,
and she wrote verses both in French and English.[13] She was an ardent admirer of the great
Johnson, and in a circle of his listeners hung with breathless interest upon his conversation.
Her charming manners, her wit, wealth, and rank drew a host of admirers about her, and she
became the leader of English society. Whatever the Duchess of Devonshire did, or whatever the
Duchess of Devonshire wore, at once became the fashion. She opened the fashionable balls, she
was a leading spirit in the Ladies' Club, and she set the standard for the height of headdresses
and the length of feathers!

[Footnote 13: A long poem by the Duchess was "The Passage over Mt. Gothard," celebrated in
Coleridge's Ode to Georgiana.]

She was not content with merely social triumphs, but her influence reached even into politics.
Her most remarkable political exploit was to secure the reëlection of Charles James Fox to
Parliament (1784) from the borough of Westminster. For this she has sometimes been called "Fox's
Duchess," but she is usually known as "the beautiful Duchess."

Sir Joshua Reynolds was among the fortunate number upon whom the beautiful Duchess bestowed
her smiles. He had first painted her portrait in her girlhood and again as a young wife but
two years married (1776). He was afterwards often honored with invitations to her house and
enjoyed the hospitality of her brilliant entertainments.

At length (June, 1784) a daughter was born to the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, whom they
christened Georgiana Dorothy. The parents were so happy in their baby that the mother founded
a charitable school in her honor. The child was a winning little creature, round and rosy and
full of spirits. When she was about two years old the Duchess again called her former portrait
painter's services into use, desiring a picture of herself and daughter.

By this time, the girlish beauty of the Duchess had faded, and her slender figure had become
somewhat stout. But the new grace of motherhood was now added to her other charms. As she had
been the model of fashion for all the ladies of England in matter of dress, she now became
a model of motherhood for their imitation. Fashionable women usually gave over the care and
nourishment of their children to nurses, but the Duchess of Devonshire took upon herself these
tender maternal duties. Thus mother and child were constantly together and became boon companions.
The Duchess had a very lively nature, and a child could not wish a gayer playmate.

It is in one of their merry romps together that the painter has represented them. The mother
is sitting on a sofa with the child on her knee, and the two are playing the old game of Ride
a Cock Horse to Banbury Cross. To and fro on her imaginary steed swings the little rider, supported
by the encircling arm of the mother. It is rare sport, and the child kicks her bare feet and
throws up her chubby arms gleefully. We can fancy we hear the baby voice gurgling with delight,
and the mother smiles at the child's pleasure.

Some years afterward, the poet Coleridge, writing an ode to the beautiful Duchess, pays a tribute
to her motherhood which forms a fitting comment on our picture:--

    "You were a mother! at your bosom fed
    The babes that loved you.
    You, with laughing eyes,
    Each twilight thought,
    Each nascent feeling read
    Which you yourself created."

It is interesting to compare the picture with that of Lady Cockburn and her Children which
we have already studied. The lighting is managed in the same way, a curtain being drawn aside
at the right, that we may look beyond the parapet into the open.

It is an important principle in art that in representing any inclosed space like the interior
of a room, there should be some device for increasing the length of the perspective. The imagination
delights in distance, and feels imprisoned where there is no opening in an inclosure.

The principal lines of this composition run diagonally from corner to corner, intersecting
in the centre. Some of these are so clearly defined that we can easily trace them. One extends
from the uplifted right hand of the Duchess across the slanting line of her bodice and along
the lower edge of the child's frock. The lines of her left arm run parallel with this. In the
other direction the uplifted arms of the baby, as well as the edge of the curtain, indicate
the lines which cross these.

IX

HOPE

We have naturally come to think of Reynolds as chiefly a portrait painter. It was, indeed,
by his work in portraiture that his name ranks among the great masters. Yet he made various
interesting excursions into other fields. We may see what charming fancy pictures he sometimes
painted in Cupid as Link Boy and The Strawberry Girl. Historical pictures he also attempted,
but not so successfully. Religious and allegorical subjects he tried occasionally, and it is
to illustrate his work of this kind that our picture of Hope is chosen.

The figure is a part of a large decorative scheme for a stained window. The central compartment
is devoted to the subject of the Nativity, and shows a group of the Virgin mother with the
Christ child in the manger, Joseph and the angels. In imitation of Correggio's famous painting
of the same subject, called the Notte, the light of the picture proceeds from the Babe. Two
smaller compartments on either side are filled with shepherds coming to worship. Below is a
series of seven panels, containing the figures of Faith, Hope, and Charity, and the four cardinal
virtues--Temperance, Justice, Fortitude, and Prudence.

This plan of subjects was made by Reynolds early in 1778, to meet an order from New College,
Oxford, for a window design to be executed for their chapel. Hope was one of the first figures
that he painted, and in 1779 he was ready to exhibit, at the Royal Academy, the Nativity, with
Faith, Hope, and Charity.

The three fundamental elements of Christian character have been associated together ever since
the fifteenth chapter of first Corinthians was written. Artists and poets have had a fashion
of personifying them as allegorical figures. Certain symbols have even been invented to correspond
to each--the cross for faith, the anchor for hope, and the heart for charity. Thus the imagination
has been called to the aid of religion in impressing Christian teaching.

Reynolds tried to put into this figure the various qualities which make up our thought of hope.
A pretty young woman steps forth from a region of clouds and lifts her face and hands towards
the light. Through an opening in the sky a broad beam of sunshine falls upon her. Following
its direction, she seems to be looking through the opening into some glad vision beyond. Like
the figure of Hope in Swinburne's sonnet, she

    "Looks Godward, past the shades where blind men grope
    Round the dark door that prayers nor dreams can ope,
    And makes for joy the very darkness dear."

In the lower left-hand corner we may barely make out the portion of an anchor. The meaning
of the old symbol is that hope keeps the soul firm, as an anchor holds the ship. The face of
which we have a glimpse is girlish and innocent; the figure is full of buoyancy. The left arm
and the uplifted hands are very delicately modelled.

In a painting of this kind the artist is free to follow his own bent in the matter of dress,
no longer hampered, as in his portraits, by the follies of fashion. It is delightful to see
here the exquisite simplicity of the gown falling in long, beautiful lines. The only adornment
is a gauzy scarf, twisted about the bodice and falling on each side in spiral folds. One is
reminded of the swirling scarfs in our American Vedder's designs, having, as here, a purely
decorative purpose in the scheme. The hair is gathered up on the head in a loose knot, from
which the end escapes in a curl.

We are not looking here for any strong delineation of character, as in a portrait, and the
painter did not even think it worth while to show much of Hope's face. The panel is to be studied
as a work of decorative art, and its beauty lies in its scheme of color, the contrast of light
and shade, and the graceful patterns traced by the lines. These are drawn in long flowing curves.
The strongest are those which run from the upper left to the lower right corner, to emphasize
the motion of the figure towards the left. The outline of the cloud billows which separate
the light from the darkness are counter curves cutting across diagonally.

We could appreciate the lines of the panel even better if we could see it in its relation to
the entire plan. Each figure is drawn with reference to its place in the great design. Though
there are so many component parts, they unite to form a coherent whole, the main lines flowing
together in a harmonious unity.

Reynolds's design was executed by the glass painter Jervas; but when the window was set in
place it was a great disappointment. The colors are opaque, and can properly be seen only in
a darkened room; with the light falling through them they are at a great disadvantage. Nevertheless
the window is a matter of great pride to the fortunate college which possesses it. The original
designs, instead of being black and white cartoons, as another artist might have made them,
are finished paintings in oil.

X

LORD HEATHFIELD

Lord Heathfield, the original of this portrait by Reynolds, is famous in English history as
the hero of the siege of Gibraltar. Gibraltar, as is well known, is that great rock on the
coast of Spain, overlooking the narrow strait which forms the passage between the Atlantic
Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. In the affairs of nations this rock occupies a position of
great importance, forming, as it were, a "key to the Mediterranean." The Strait of Gibraltar
is the gateway through which all ships must pass to gain the ports of southern Europe, and
it is therefore a matter of moment to all the civilized world what nation holds possession
there. Nature has made the rock a fortress, and military inventions have been added, through
the centuries, to strengthen its defences. It has been the scene of some fearful conflicts.

Gibraltar once belonged to Spain; but, by the fortunes of war, it fell into the possession
of the English early in the eighteenth century. Various attempts were made to recover it, but
the most determined was that of 1779, when the combined land and sea forces of France and Spain
were brought to bear upon it. The struggle lasted over three years; but, in the end, the English
were victorious, and they have retained the fortress to this day.

The governor in command at that time was General Elliott, who was afterwards rewarded for his
services here by being raised to the peerage as Lord Heathfield. General Elliott was already
well known as a gallant officer. He had served in the war of Austrian succession, holding a
colonel's commission at Dettingen, where the English defeated the French in 1743. In the Seven
Years' War he had raised and disciplined a splendid corps of cavalry, known as the "Light Horse."

He was now over sixty years old, and his long military career fitted him admirably for the
command at Gibraltar. He showed his calibre in the beginning of the siege, in refusing the
keys of the fortress, which were demanded of him. With tremendous odds against him, his conduct
has not inappropriately been likened to that of the Greek hero Leonidas, at Thermopylæ, when
ordered by the Persian king to lay down his arms. Throughout the defence his intrepidity, resource,
and generalship, proved him a man of remarkable military genius.

The crisis in the siege was reached in September, 1782, when a fleet of ten enormous floating
batteries opened fire on the fortress, each one manned by a picked crew, and carrying from
ten to eighteen guns. These batteries were the invention of the most skilled French engineers,
and were believed to be impenetrable to shot. The cannonading began in the morning and continued
all day. Soon after midnight nine ships were on fire, and the hostile fleet was doomed.

General Elliott showed himself a generous victor, and the men saved from the enemy's ships
owed their lives to him. Five years later the returned hero, now become Lord Heathfield, sat
to Reynolds for his portrait, ordered by a wealthy admirer--the public-spirited Alderman Boydell.
The picture shows the brave old soldier as he took his stand in command of Gibraltar. Some
one has said that it tells the whole story of the siege.

The general grasps firmly the key of the fortress, the chain wound twice about his hand, to
emphasize the determination of the man to hold it against all odds. His sword swings at his
side, ready for instant use; a cannon in the rear is pointed downward towards the hostile fleet,
and the smoke of battle rolls in clouds behind him. Far away on the horizon a glimmer of light
shines on the distant sea.

The veteran stands as immovable as a Stonewall Jackson. His face is set in determined lines,
the lips firmly closed, the head thrown back a little, and the eyes steadily fixed on the battle.
Yet the face is not altogether stern; there is much that is kindly and noble in the expression.
One can fancy it in another moment softening into an expression of gentleness.

It was a remarkable feature of his success during these terrible months of siege, that he was
able to hold the love and loyalty of his men. When the spirits of the little garrison flagged,
under the combined influence of disease and impending famine, his genial presence animated
them with fresh hope. His chivalry was as unfailing as his bravery. It is said that "his military
skill and moral courage place him among the best soldiers and noblest men Europe produced in
the eighteenth century."

The portrait painter makes us feel all this in his picture. The attitude is so dignified, the
gesture so forcible, the countenance so expressive, that we are impressed at once with the
dignity of his character. Even if we knew nothing of his history we should still be sure that
this is a great man.

The last days of the hero of Gibraltar were spent at his home, Kalkofen, near Aix-la-Chapelle,
where he died, July 6, 1790, in the seventy-third year of his age.

MRS. PAYNE-GALLWEY AND HER CHILD (PICKABACK)

Pickaback is one of the old, old games which no one is so foolish as to try to trace to its
origin. We may well believe that there was never a time when mothers did not trot their children
on their knees and carry them on their backs. The very names we give these childish games were
used in England more than a century ago.

The picture of Mrs. Payne-Gallwey and her child has long been known as Pickaback, and will
always be so called by many who would not be at the pains to remember the lady's name. It is
one of those portraits in which the painter, impatient of the stiff conventional attitudes
which were in vogue in his day, drew his inspiration from a simple homely theme of daily life.

What an ingenious painter Reynolds was, we learn more and more as we examine one picture after
another and compare them with those of his predecessors. He liked to have his pictures tell
stories, and often, when he had a mother and child to paint, he represented them as playing
together just as they might have done every day in their own nursery or garden.[14] The Duchess
of Devonshire is seen in her boudoir trotting her baby to Banbury Cross, and the Cockburn children
are surprised in a game of hide-and-seek on their mother's lap.

[Footnote 14: Claude Phillips refers to Pickaback as "one of the most popular and representative"
of this class.]

Mrs. Payne-Gallwey seems to have just caught her little girl up on her back and to be starting
off to give her a ride. Her body is bent slightly forward in the attitude of one walking with
a burden, and we almost seem to see her move. It is as if in another moment they would pass
across the canvas and out of our sight.

The incident is so precisely like something which happens every day that we might think the
picture was painted yesterday instead of in 1779, were it not for the few signs which indicate
its date. For one thing, the lady's hair is arranged over a high cushion in the peculiar style
affected at this period in fashionable circles. The style was carried to absurd extremes, ladies
vying with one another in the height of the coiffure until in some cases it actually towered
a foot and a half in height. Over this structure were worn nodding plumes of feathers, increasing
the fantastic effect.

We may imagine how these unsightly erections vexed the artistic soul of Sir Joshua Reynolds.
He was, however, enough of an autocrat to take liberties with the fashions. When obliged to
paint the portrait of a lady with a "head" (for so the coiffure was called) he always managed
to modify its height and make its outlines harmonize with his composition.

A side view was of course much less objectionable than the full front, in which the face was
elongated to such strange proportions. In this case the face is turned in profile, and its
delicacy is enhanced rather than injured by the masses of hair which frame it. The hair, instead
of being drawn tightly back from the forehead in the ordinary way, waves in graceful curves,
which are quite beyond the art of any hairdresser. Finally, the massive effect of the hair
is broken by the narrow scarf bound about it and tied under the chin. The curve of this scarf
meets the curve of the profile to form a beautiful oval.

The quaintest touch in the picture is the child's big hat. The same shape is worn to-day by
men, and one might fancy that the baby had borrowed her papa's hat for the frolic. It is a
curious change in fashions which transfers any part of a little girl's wardrobe to that of
a grown man.

We may feel a little better acquainted with the mother and daughter to know their names. Mrs.
Payne-Gallwey was Philadelphia, the daughter of General De Lancey, Lieutenant Governor of New
York. The child was Charlotte, who afterwards married John Moseley. Mrs. Gallwey's beauty is
of a very fragile type, and her eyes have a languor hinting of invalidism. Only a few years
later she died, while still in her young motherhood. Little Charlotte has a round healthy face,
but it is a little sober. Indeed, both mother and child seem to be of a rather dreamy, poetic
temperament. Their mood is hardly merry enough for such a game, but they enjoy it in their
own way with quiet contentment. It is an idealized version of the ordinary romping game of
Pickaback.

The composition is based on lines which cut the canvas diagonally. In one direction is the
line running the length of the profile and continued along the bodice. Crossing this at right
angles is the shorter line made by the two arms. It is the first of these which gives character
to the picture and produces the impression of motion which is so striking. It is almost as
if a modern photographer had taken a snap shot of a figure in the act of walking. But in no
such photograph, it is safe to say, would the lines chance to flow in such perfect rhythm.

XII

CUPID AS LINK BOY

A familiar figure in classic mythology was that of the little god of love, Cupid. He was the
son of Venus, and, like her, was concerned in the affairs of the heart. Ancient art represented
him as a beautiful naked boy with wings, carrying a bow and quiver of arrows, and sometimes
a burning torch. The torch was to kindle the flame of love, and the arrows were to pierce the
heart with the tender passion. These missiles were made at the forge of Vulcan, where Venus
first imbued them with honey, after which Cupid, the mischievous fellow, tinged them with gall.
Thus it was that the wounds they inflicted were at once sweet and painful.[15]

[Footnote 15: Anacreon's Ode XXXIII. in Moore's translation.]

Now Cupid was always bent upon some of his naughty pranks. He was afraid of nothing, and we
read of his riding on the backs of lions and sporting with the monsters of the deep. He played
all sorts of tricks on the gods, stealing the arms of Hercules, and even breaking the thunderbolts
of Jove. His bow and arrows were a source of great amusement to him. He delighted in taking
aim at unsuspecting mortals, and his random shots often wrought sad havoc.

One of Anacreon's odes relates how the poet was awakened on a rainy midnight by the cry of
a child begging shelter. The little waif proved to be Cupid in disguise. After being warmed
and dried by the fire, the boy artfully craved permission to try his bow, to see if the rain
had injured its elasticity. The arrow flew straight at the poet's heart with a sweet pain,
and away flew Cupid laughing gayly at his exploit.[16]

[Footnote 16: Anacreon's Ode XXVIII. in Moore's translation.]

Cupid was naturally a very popular god, yet his tricksy ways caused him to be looked upon with
suspicion. Every one was anxious to stand well with him. In some of the cities of ancient Greece,
as Sparta and Athens, he was worshipped with great solemnity, and every five years festivals
were held in his honor.

In our picture the painter has represented the little torch-bearing god disguised as a link
boy. He is dressed in the clothes of a London street urchin, and behind him are the warehouses
of the great city.

The link bearer's occupation was abandoned so long ago that it needs a word of explanation.
In the old times, before there were stationary street lights of any kind, men and boys used
to run about by night, carrying torches or links, as they were called, to lighten the way for
passers-by.

They were like the newsboys of to-day, running up to each wayfarer to offer their services,
and always glad to pick up a few pennies. They accompanied parties home from the clubs, the
theatres, and all sorts of entertainments, running beside carriages, as well as foot passengers.
Nor was their occupation solely by night. There sometimes came suddenly in London a thick fog,
shutting out the sunlight as completely as if it had been night. People caught in the streets
at such times soon lost their way, and the services of the link boy were then very useful.

We may now understand what a capital chance for fun Cupid would have, playing the part of a
link boy. The strangers whom he guided on their way would little suspect that the link boy's
torch was kindling the flame of love within them. He might lead them whither he pleased, and
finally, disclosing his true identity, would draw his bow upon them and leave them to their fate.

It is perhaps after some such escapade as this that we see him in the picture, link in hand,
pausing to look back with a smile of suppressed amusement at some of his victims. It seems
very odd to find Cupid in such surroundings, and especially to see the little god hampered
by the clumsy garments of mortals. They are old and ragged, the cast-off finery such as is
picked up by street gamins. The child's hair is tossed about his head in unkempt locks, and
altogether he looks the part to perfection.

Yet there are unmistakable signs of his identity in the wings spread from his shoulders. If
you look closely, too, you can see through the rip in his sleeve the quiver of arrows which
the sly fellow thought to hide under his coat. The face and expression could belong alone to
Cupid. The mouth is shaped in a genuine Cupid's bow, and the pointed chin shows his astuteness.
Mischief lurks in the corners of the eyes and in the curve of his mouth.

The Cupid as Link Boy is one of a number of fancy pictures which Sir Joshua Reynolds painted
for his own pleasure. His portrait orders were nearly all from the wealthy and aristocratic
classes, and the artist would not have been content without a greater variety of subjects than
this work afforded. He had a fertile imagination for ideal or "fancy" subjects, particularly
for those of a humorous nature. Often when he chanced to be driving through the streets his
attention would be attracted by some little waif, and he would take the child back to his studio
for a model. Our picture is from one of these mischievous London street boys, whose face reappears
in several other works.

XIII

THE HON. ANNE BINGHAM

Miss Anne Bingham was one of the many aristocratic ladies whose portraits Reynolds painted,
and one of the most interesting of this class of sitters. Her vivacious face looking into ours
wins us at once, and we should be glad to know more of the charming original.

Anne Bingham was the youngest daughter of Sir Charles Bingham, who in 1776 was created Baron
Lucan. Her mother, Lady Lucan, was a remarkably talented woman, trying her hand with success
at modelling, painting, and poetry. She was ambitious to be an intellectual leader, and like
several other ladies of the time entertained after the fashion of the French salons, inviting
people of wit and learning to meet in her drawing-room for discussion. Her artistic work was
really remarkable. Encouraged by the advice and help of Horace Walpole, she became a skilful
copyist, and it is said imitated the works of some earlier painters with a genius that fairly
depreciated the originals!

It was thus in exceptionally artistic and intellectual surroundings that Anne grew out of girlhood.
Her oldest sister, Lavinia, who afterwards became Countess Spencer, inherited the mother's
artistic tastes, and was likewise a favorite with Horace Walpole.

The two daughters were both charming in appearance, and there was a certain sisterly resemblance
between them. If Lavinia's eyes were a bit more sparkling, judged by the portraits, Anne's
mouth was smaller and more daintily modelled. As a frequent guest in their mother's drawing-room,
Sir Joshua must have known both the young ladies. Of the elder he painted several portraits;
of the younger, but this one, executed in 1786.

It was a natural and appropriate idea that Miss Anne's portrait should be made in a style similar
to one of her sister, as a companion picture. Both were represented in half-length figure,
wearing white kerchiefs and broad-brimmed hats.

Those must have been pleasant sittings which gave the veteran portrait painter Miss Anne for
a subject.[17] Plainly there was a perfect sympathy between sitter and painter. The smile the
lady turns towards the easel is as naïve as that of Miss Bowles herself. She watches his clever
work with an artist's delight, and with the simple spirit of a child.

[Footnote 17: When her father was created an earl in 1795, she became Lady Anne.]

Nothing could be more distasteful to such a character than the affected pose of a woman of
fashion. She has dropped into a chair with a careless grace all her own, and tells the painter
she is ready. He takes up his brush, and lo, the very essence of her smile is transferred to
his canvas.

We praise the delicate rendering of the gauzy kerchief veiling her neck, but it is far less
wonderful than the delicate interpretation of her expression. The fine sensitiveness of her
nature, her lively fancy and sense of humor, her playfulness, her coquetry, her impulsiveness,
her volatile temperament--all this we read in the shining eyes and the smiling mouth, though
no one can say how they were made to tell so much. The signs of her birth and breeding are
in every line, yet she is something of a Bohemian too. There is a delightful sense of camaraderie
in her smile.

There is a certain portrait by Leonardo da Vinci known as the Mona Lisa, and famous for its
baffling smile. There is a tantalizing quality about it which makes one forever wonder what
the lady is thinking about and why she is smiling. Nothing could be more in contrast than this
smile of Miss Bingham. There is no mystery in it, but rather it takes us into her confidence
in the most winning way.

The costume interests us not only as a reminder of bygone fashions, but for its picturesqueness.
The bodice is ornamented only by the big buttons by which it is laced. A narrow belt finishes
it at the waist, with a small buckle in front.

The hair is frizzed in puffy masses about the face, escaping in a few curls which fall over
the shoulders. This was evidently the favorite coiffure in the year 1786, as the portrait of
the Duchess of Devonshire with her Child, painted in the same year, shows precisely the same
style. Both ladies also wear low-cut bodices with kerchiefs arranged in the same manner. The
finishing touch of Miss Bingham's costume is the big straw hat worn aslant on the back of the head.

It has been a favorite device of great portrait painters to dress their sitters in all sorts
of fanciful headwear. Rembrandt's portraits show an endless variety of caps, turbans, and hats.
Rubens was fond of painting broad-brimmed hats shading the face, one of his celebrated pictures
being a study of this kind called Le Chapeau de Paille (The Straw Hat).

Now Reynolds was to some extent an imitator of these two men, and it may be he learned something
from their pictures about hats. However that may be, we see how the hat here proves very effective
in bringing the head into harmonious relation with the whole composition. The brim describes
a diagonal line parallel with the line made by the kerchief over the left shoulder. The kerchief
on the right shoulder falls in a line parallel with the left arm.

A composition based on short diagonal lines like these is as different as possible in character
from one of long flowing curves like Hope. Each one is appropriate to its own subject.

XIV

THE STRAWBERRY GIRL

Village life in England before the time of railroads had a picturesque charm which it has since
lost except in remote districts. We learn something about it in Miss Mitford's sketches of
"Our Village" and in Miss Edgeworth's "Tales." From such books it is delightful to reconstruct
in imagination some of these rural scenes; the wide meadows where the cowslips grow, the brooks
running beneath the hawthorns and alders, the lanes winding between hedgerows, the green common
where the cricketers play, the low cottages covered to the roof with vines, and the trim gardens
gay with pinks and larkspur. These villages are connected with the outside world only by the
postcart and chapman. Here modest little girls like Miss Mitford's Hannah and Miss Edgeworth's
Simple Susan move about their daily tasks and run on their errands of mercy.

Now Sir Joshua Reynolds was a native of Devonshire, a beautiful English district which all
born Devons love with peculiar devotion, as we may see from Charles Kingsley's descriptions
in "Water-babies." From time to time in his busy life the painter returned to his home for
a breath of country air. On one of these visits he brought back to London with him his young
niece Theophila Palmer, whose father had just died. Offy, as she was called, soon became the
pet of her bachelor uncle's household, of which she long remained a member. As she flitted
about the house the little country-bred girl with her fresh healthy beauty was a constant reminder
to the painter of the woods and fields. Perhaps one day as he was looking at her with special
pleasure the picture suddenly flashed upon his fancy of Offy in the character of a village
maid. The idea developed into the Strawberry Girl, for which Offy sat as model.

A little girl has been sent on an errand along a lonely road leading out of the village. It
may be that like little Red Riding Hood in the nursery tale she is carrying some dainties to
her grandmother. A basket of strawberries hangs on her arm, and her apron also seems to be
filled with something, for it is gathered up in front like a bag, the corners dropping over
the arm.

Twilight begins to fall as she comes to a turn of the road overshadowed by a high rock. There
are all sorts of queer noises and shadows here, and she steals timidly past the eerie place,
peering forward with big eyes.

Yet she is a womanly child, who will not easily be turned back. She feels the importance of
her errand, and is worthy of the trust. The simple low-cut gown is that of a village maid.
An odd cap, something like a turban, covers her head and adds a trifle to her height and dignity.
Her round face and chubby neck would be the envy of the puny city child who knows not the luxury
of big porringers of bread and milk. If her hands are rather too delicately moulded for those
of a country child we must remember again that Reynolds was painting from his own little niece.

In imagination we follow the little maid about the simple round of her childish pursuits. Every
morning she goes demurely to school to fix her thoughts on "button holes and spelling books."
Perhaps it is a dame school like that in "Water Babies," with a "shining clean stone floor
and curious old prints on the wall and a cuckoo clock in the corner," Here some dozen children
sit on benches "gabbling Chris-cross," while a nice old woman in a red petticoat and white
cap hears them from the chimney corner.

Our little girl has duties at home as well, and is sometimes seen, a pitcher in one hand and
a mop in the other, making the house tidy. She can boil potatoes, shell the beans, feed the
hens, and make herself useful in many ways.

On rare occasions she has a holiday in the fields, and then what joy it is in spring and early
summer to find the haunts of the wild flowers which grow in such abundance in the English country.

A favorite game is making cowslip balls. The tufts of golden flowerets are first nipped off
with short stems, until a quantity are gathered. Then the ribbon is held ready and the clusters
are nicely balanced across it until a long garland is made, when they are pressed closely together
and tied into a sweet golden ball.

When we remember that the little Offy, who was the original Strawberry Girl, was transplanted
from her Devonshire home to the great city of London, we are interested to know something of
her after life. She grew to be as dear as a daughter to her uncle. In the dreary days when
he could not use his eyes she was his reader and amanuensis. The many distinguished guests
who enjoyed his hospitality were charmed with her sweet manners. In the course of time she
married Richard Lovell Gwatkin, a Cornish gentleman in every way worthy of her. "Her happiness
was as great as her uncle could wish. She lived to be ninety, to see her children's children,
and, intelligent, cheerful, and affectionate to the last, vividly remembered her happy girlhood
under her uncle's roof, and the brilliant society that found a centre there."

XV

DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON

The eccentric figure of Dr. Samuel Johnson was one of the familiar sights of London during
the middle of the eighteenth century. He was a man of great learning, a voluminous writer,
and an even more remarkable talker. He was born in 1709, and, the son of a poor bookseller,
he struggled against poverty for many years. Literary work was ill paid in those days, and
Johnson gained his reputation but slowly. He contributed articles to the magazines, and twice
he conducted short-lived periodicals of his own--the "Rambler" and the "Idler." He wrote, besides,
a drama, "Irene"; a tale, "Rasselas"; a book of travel, a "Journey to the Hebrides"; and many
biographies, including the "Lives of the Poets." His largest undertaking was an English dictionary,
upon which he spent eight years of labor.

At length his pecuniary troubles came to an end when, in 1762, the government awarded him a
pension of £300 a year. By this time his great intellectual gifts had begun to be appreciated,
and he was the first man of letters in England. In Thackeray's phrase, he "was revered as a
sort of oracle."

Johnson was now too old to acquire the graces of polite society, even had he wished them. His
huge, uncouth figure and rolling walk, his countenance disfigured by scrofula, his blinking
eyes, his convulsive movements, his slovenly dress and boorish manners made him a strange figure
in the circles which entertained him. He usually declined wine, but his capacity for tea was
unlimited. Many funny stories are told of the number of cups poured for him by obliging hostesses,
for, oddly enough, he was a great favorite with the ladies, and knew how to turn a pretty compliment.
His temper was at times very irritable and morbid, and he occasionally had violent fits of
rage. Yet, with all these peculiarities, he had a kind heart and was sincerely religious. His
devotion to his wife and his aged mother[18] was very touching, and the poor and infirm knew
his charities. In his own lodgings he provided a home for an oddly assorted family of dependents,
consisting of an old man, a blind woman, a negro boy, and a cat. All the details of his daily
life and habits are minutely described in a biography written by his admiring friend, Boswell,
who was intimately associated with him for many years. The book he wrote after Johnson's death
tells us not only all about the learned doctor, but much also about his friends.

[Footnote 18: His wife died in 1752, and his mother in 1759 at the age of ninety.]

Reynolds was one of his warm friends, and the two understood each other well. Often when they
were together in company, the painter's tact and courtesy smoothed over some breach of etiquette
on the part of his companion. At Reynolds's suggestion, the two founded together a small club
of congenial spirits, called the Literary Club.

Some other good friends of Johnson's were the Thrales. Mr. Thrale was a rich brewer, and a
man of parts, and his wife was one of the brightest women of her day. Johnson was a constant
visitor at their house, and became at last, practically, a member of the family. The Thrales's
drawing-room at their Streatham villa was the scene of many brilliant gatherings, where intellectual
people met for conversation and discussion. Johnson was the autocrat of this circle. He was
often rude, even insolent, in expressing his opinion, and wounded many by his sarcasm. But
his vast stores of information, his keen mind and ready wit, made his conversation an intellectual
feast.

It was an ambition of Mr. Thrale to ornament his house with a gallery of portraits of contemporary
celebrities, and it was for this collection that Reynolds painted the portrait of Johnson,
reproduced in our illustration. It was really a repetition of a portrait he had previously
painted for their common friend and club-fellow, Bennet Langton.

Here we see the sage at the age of sixty odd years, precisely as he appeared among his friends
at Streatham. The painter has straightened the wig, which was usually worn awry, but otherwise
it is the very Dr. Johnson of whom we read so much, with his shabby brown coat, his big shambling
shoulders, and coarse features.

A remarkable thing about the portrait is that Reynolds succeeded so well in showing us the
man himself under this rough exterior. The inferior artist paints only the outside of a face
just as it looks to a stranger who knows nothing of the character of the sitter. The master
paints the face as it looks to a friend who knows the soul within. Now, Reynolds was not only
a master, but he was, in this case, painting a friend. So he put on the canvas, not merely
the eccentric face of Dr. Johnson as a stranger might see it, but he painted in it that expression
of intellectual power which the great man showed among his congenial friends. Something, too,
is suggested in the portrait of that sternly upright spirit which hated a lie.

It is a portrait of Johnson the scholar, the thinker, and the conversationalist. He seems to
be engaged in some argument, and is delivering his opinion with characteristic authoritativeness.
The heavy features are lighted by his thought. One may fancy that the talk turns upon patriotism,
when Johnson, roused to indignation by the false pretences of many would-be patriots, exclaims,
"Sir, patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel."

THE PORTRAIT OF REYNOLDS

In the city of Florence, Italy, there is a famous gallery of portraits unlike any other collection
of pictures in the world. It consists of the portraits of artists, painted by their own hands,
and includes the most celebrated painters of all nations, from the fifteenth century to the
present time. Here may be seen the portraits of Velasquez, Titian, Tintoretto, Rembrandt,--the
world's greatest portrait painters,--and in the same splendid company hangs the portrait of
Reynolds, reproduced in our frontispiece. He painted it in 1776 for the special purpose of
sending it to Florence at the request of the Imperial Academy of that city, of which he had
just been elected a member.

As we have seen in our study of the Angels' Heads, a single portrait can show us only one side
of the sitter's character. This portrait of Reynolds, painted as a condition of membership
in a society of artists, and for a gallery of artists' portraits, was intended chiefly to show
the artistic side of his nature. The pose itself at once suggests the artist. The expression
of the mobile face is that of a painter engaged at his easel, turning a searching glance upon
the object he is painting. In short, it is a sort of official portrait, introducing the new
member to his associates in the Imperial Academy.

The artist wears the Oxford cap and gown, to which he is entitled, by virtue of the honorary
degree of D. C. L., conferred upon him by the University of Oxford. In his hand he carries
a roll of manuscript, presumably one of his lectures before the Royal Academy. Both the roll
and the costume are, as it were, insignia of his English honors. A Latin inscription on the
back of the portrait, written by the painter's own hand, enumerates the several distinctions
which are his.

Reynolds might, indeed, be pardoned the pride with which he reviewed his career. From somewhat
humble beginnings he had now made his way to the foremost place in his profession. He was born
at a time when art was in a very low state in England, and there were no advantages for the
study of painting. His only instruction was under an inferior portrait painter named Hudson,
with whom he served as apprentice about two years.

His real art training was during three years of travel in Italy. There he examined and studied
the works of the greatest masters of the past, and returned to England with altogether new
ideals. Setting up a studio in London, he soon gained an immense popularity. When the Royal
Academy was founded, in 1768, he became the first president, and at the same time the honor
of knighthood was conferred upon him. Other artists now rose to prominence, but he still held
the supremacy.

The painter's popularity depended by no means on his artistic talents alone; his opinions were
worth hearing on many subjects. He was fond of books and literary discussions, and his friendship
was valued by such men of intellect as Johnson, Goldsmith, Burke, and others of that charmed
circle making the Literary Club. He had a genial, kindly nature, and his manners were exquisitely
courteous. Thackeray once wrote that "of all the polite men of that age, Joshua Reynolds was
the finest gentleman." He was a member of several clubs, was fond of society, and was a welcome
guest in many of the best houses in London. He himself entertained with generous hospitality,
and gathered about his table some of the brightest people of his time.

His intimate friend, Edmund Malone, described him as a man "rather under the middle size, of
a florid complexion, and a lively and pleasing aspect; well made, and extremely active. His
appearance at first sight impressed the spectator with the idea of a well-born and well-bred
English gentleman. With an uncommon equability of temper, which, however, never degenerated
into insipidity or apathy, he possessed a constant flow of spirits which rendered him at all
times a most pleasing companion.... He appeared to me the happiest man I have ever known."

Through many years Reynolds was very deaf, and was obliged to use an ear trumpet to aid him
in general conversation. In later years he also wore spectacles, so that we always picture
him in his advancing life with trumpet and glasses. His habit of taking great quantities of
snuff was one which gave occasion to many jokes among his friends.

Numerous poetic tributes were written by his admirers, describing more or less rhetorically
his qualities as a man and an artist.
