Lord George, in his defence, proved, by undeniable evidence, that he never received the orders
issued on the eve of the battle, nor any sort of intimation or plan of action, although he
was certainly entitled to some such communication, as commander-in-chief of the British forces;
that, nevertheless, the orders concerning the horses were obeyed by those who received them;
that lord George, instead of loitering or losing time while the troops were forming, prepared
to put himself at the head of the cavalry on the first notice that they were in motion; that
he was so eager to perform his duty, as to set out from his quarters without even waiting for
an aidecamp to attend him, and was in the field before any general officer of his division.
He declared that, when captain Winchingrode delivered the order to form the cavalry in one
line, making a third, to advance and sustain the infantry, he neither heard him say he was
to march by the left, nor saw him point with his sword to the wood through which he was to
pass. Neither of these directions were observed by any of the aids-de-camp or officers then
present, except one gentleman, the person who bore witness to the confusion in the looks and
deportment of his lordship. It was proved that the nearest and most practicable way of advancing
against the enemy was by the way of the windmill, to the left of the village of Halen. It appeared
that lord George imagined this was the only way by which he should be ordered to advance; that,
in this persuasion, he had sent an officer to reconnoitre the village of Halen, as an object
of importance, as it would have been upon the flank of the cavalry in advancing forwards; that
when he received the order from Winchingrode to form the line, and advance, he still imagined
this was his route, and on this supposition immediately detached an aidecamp to remove a regiment
of Saxe-Gotha which was in the front; that he sent a second to observe the place where the
infantry were, and a third to reconnoitre the enemy; that in a few minutes colonel Ligonier
coming up with an order from prince Ferdinand to advance the cavalry, his lordship immediately
drew his sword, and ordered them to march forward by the windmill. The colonel declared that
when he delivered the order, he added, "by the left;" but lord George affirmed that he heard
no such direction, nor did it reach the ears of any other person then present, except of that
officer who witnessed to the same direction given by Winchingrode. It was proved that immediately
after the troops were put in motion, colonel Fitzroy arrived with an order from prince Ferdinand,
importing that the British cavalry only should advance by the left; that lord George declared
their orders were contradictory, and seemed the more puzzled, as he understood that both these
gentlemen came off nearly at the same time from the prince, and were probably directed to communicate
the same order. It was therefore natural to suppose there was a mistake, as there might be
danger in breaking the line, as the route by the wood appeared more difficult and tedious than
that by the windmill, which led directly through open ground to the enemy: and as he could
not think that if a body of horse was immediately wanted, the general would send for the British,
that were at the farthest extremity of the wing, rather than for the Hanoverian cavalry who
formed the left of the line, and consequently were much nearer the scene of action. It was
proved that lord George, in this uncertainty, resolved to apply for an explanation to the prince
in person, who he understood was at a small distance; that with this view he set out with all
possible expedition; that having entered the wood, and perceived that the country beyond it
opened sooner to the left than he had imagined, and captain Smith, his aidecamp advising, that
the British cavalry should be put in motion he sent back that gentleman, with orders for them
to advance by the left with all possible despatch; that he rode up to the general, who received
him without any marks of displeasure, and ordered him to bring up the whole cavalry of the
right wing in a line upon the heath; an order, as the reader will perceive, quite different
from that which was so warmly espoused by the aidecamp; that as the marquis of Granby had already
put the second line in motion, according to a separate order which he had received, and the
head of his column was already in view, coming out of the wood, lord George thought it necessary
to halt the troops on the left until the right should come into the line; and afterwards sent
them orders to march slower, that two regiments, which had been thrown out of the line, might
have an opportunity to replace themselves in their proper stations.

With respect to the confusion which one officer affirmed was perceivable in the countenance
and deportment of this commander, a considerable number of other officers then present being
interrogated by his lordship, unanimously declared that they saw no such marks of confusion,
but that he delivered his orders with all the marks of coolness and deliberation. The candid
reader will of himself determine, whether a man's heart is to be judged by any change of his
complexion, granting such a change to have happened; whether the evidence of one witness, in
such a case, will weigh against the concurrent testimony of all the officers whose immediate
business it was to attend and observe the commander: whether it was likely that an officer,
who had been more than once in actual service, and behaved without reproach so as to attain
such an eminent rank in the army, should exhibit symptons of fear and confusion, when there
was in reality no appearance of danger; for none of the orders imported that he should attack
the enemy, but only advance to sustain the infantry. The time which elapsed from the first
order he received by captain Winchingrode, to the arrival of colonel Ligonier, did not exceed
eight minutes, during which his aide-camp, captain Hugo, was employed in removing the Saxe-Gotha
regiment from the front, by which he proposed to advance. From that period till the cavalry
actually marched in consequence of an order from lord George, the length of time was differently
estimated in the opinion of different witnesses, but at a medium computed by the judge-advocate
at fifteen minutes, during which the following circumstances were transacted: The troops were
first ordered to advance forwards, then halted; the contradictory orders arrived and were disputed;
the commander desired the two aidsdecamp to agree about which was the precise order, and he
would obey it immediately: each insisting upon that which he had delivered, lord George hastened
to the general for an explanation; and, as he passed the wood, sent back captain Smith to the
right of the cavalry, which was at a considerable distance, to put the British horse in motion.
We shall not pretend to determine whether the commander of such an important body may be excusable
for hesitating, when he received contradictory orders at the same time, especially when both
orders run counter to his own judgment, whether in that case it is allowable for him to suspend
the operation for a few minutes, in order to consult in person the commander-in-chief about
a step of such consequence to the preservation of the whole army. Neither will we venture to
decide dogmatically on the merits of the march, after the cavalry were put in motion; whether
they marched too slow, or were unnecessarily halted in their way to the heath. It was proved,
indeed, that lord George was always remarkably slow in his movements of cavalry, on the supposition
that if horses are blown they must be unfit for service, and that the least hurry is apt to
disorder the line of horse to such a degree, as would rob them of their proper effect, and
render all their efforts abortive. This being the system of lord George Sackville, it may deserve
consideration, whether he could deviate from it on this delicate occasion, without renouncing
the dictates of his own judgment and discretion; and whether he was at liberty to use his own
judgment, after having received the order to advance. After all, whether he was intentionally
guilty; and what were the motives by which he was really actuated, are questions which his
own conscience alone can solve. Even granting him to have hesitated from perplexity, to have
lingered from vexation, to have failed through error of judgment, he will probably find favour
with the candid and humane part of his fellow-subjects, when they reflect upon the nature of
his situation, placed at the head of such a body of cavalry, uninstructed and uninformed of
plan or circumstance, divided from the rest of the army, unacquainted with the operations of
the day, chagrined with doubt and disappointment, and perplexed by contradictory orders, neither
of which he could execute without offering violence to his own judgment; when they consider
the endeavours he used to manifest his obedience; the last distinct order which he in person
received and executed; that mankind are liable to mistakes; that the cavalry were not originally
intended to act, as appears in the account of the battle published at the Hague, by the authority
of prince Ferdinand, expressly declaring that the cavalry on the right did not act, because
it was destined to sustain the infantry in a third line; that if it had really been designed
for action, it ought either to have been posted in another place, or permitted to advance straight
forwards by the windmill, according to the idea of its commander; finally, when they recall
to view the general confusion that seems to have prevailed through the manouvres of that morning,
and remember some particulars of the action; that the brigades of British artillery had no
orders until they applied to lord George Sackville, who directed them to the spot where they
acquitted themselves with so much honour and effect, in contributing to the success of the
day; that the glory and advantage acquired by the few brigades of infantry, who may be said
to have defeated the whole French army, was in no respect owing to any general or particular
orders or instructions, but entirely flowing from the native valour of the troops, and the
spirited conduct of their immediate commanders; and that a great number of officers in the
allied army, even of those who remained on the open heath, never saw the face of the enemy,
or saw them at such a distance that they could not distinguish more than the hats and the arms
of the British regiments with which they were engaged. With respect to the imputation of cowardice
levelled at lord George by the unthinking multitude, and circulated with such industry and
clamour, we ought to consider it as a mob accusation which the bravest of men, even the great
duke of Marlborough, could not escape; we ought to receive it as a dangerous suspicion, which
strikes at the root of character, and may blast that honour in a moment which the soldier has
acquired in a long course of painful service, at the continual hazard of his life; we ought
to distrust it as a malignant charge, altogether inconsistent with the former conduct of the
person accused, as well as with his subsequent impatience and perseverance in demanding a trial,
to which he never would have been called; a trial which, though his life was at stake, and
his cause out of countenance, he sustained with such courage, fortitude, and presence of mind,
as even his enemies themselves could not help admiring.
