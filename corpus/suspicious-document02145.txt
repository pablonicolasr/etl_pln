HORATIUS

By LORD MACAULAY

     NOTE.--This spirited poem by Lord Macaulay is founded on one of the
     most popular Roman legends. While the story is based on facts, we
     can by no means be certain that all of the details are historical.

     According to Roman legendary history, the Tarquins, Lucius
     Tarquinius Priscus and Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, were among the
     early kings of Rome. The reign of the former was glorious, but that
     of the latter was most unjust and tyrannical. Finally the
     unscrupulousness of the king and his son reached such a point that
     it became unendurable to the people, who in 509 B. C. rose in
     rebellion and drove the entire family from Rome. Tarquinius
     Superbus appealed to Lars Porsena, the powerful king of Clusium for
     aid and the story of the expedition against Rome is told in this
     poem.

    And now hath every city
      Sent up her tale[3-5] of men:
    The foot are fourscore thousand,
      The horse are thousand ten.

    But by the yellow Tiber
      Was tumult and affright:
    From all the spacious champaign[3-8]
      To Rome men took their flight.

    But when the face of Sextus
      Was seen among the foes,
    A yell that bent the firmament
      From all the town arose.
    With shield and blade Horatius
      Right deftly turned the blow.
    But when they turned their faces,
      And on the farther shore
    Saw brave Horatius stand alone,
      They would have crossed once more.

[1-2] According to the religion of the Etruscans there were nine great gods. An oath by them
was considered the most binding oath that a man could take.

[2-3] This line shows us that the writing of the Etruscans was done backwards, as we should
consider it; that is, they wrote from right to left instead of from left to right.

[3-4] Nurscia was a city of the Sabines.

[3-5] Tale here means number.

[3-6] Sutrium was an Etruscan town twenty-nine miles from Rome.

[3-7] The Latins were an Italian race who, even before the dawn of history, dwelt on the plains
south of the Tiber. Rome was supposed to be a colony of Alba Longa, the chief Latin city, but
the Latin peoples were in the fourth century brought into complete subjection to Rome.

[3-8] Champaign, or campagna, means any open, level tract of country. The name is specifically
applied to the extensive plains about Rome.

[4-9] A part of the Capitoline, one of the seven hills on which Rome is built, was called the
Tarpeian Rock, after Tarpeia, daughter of an early governor of the citadel on the Capitoline.
According to the popular legend, when the Sabines came against Rome, Tarpeia promised to open
the gate of the fortress to them if they would give her what they wore on their left arms.
It was their jewelry which she coveted, but she was punished for her greed and treachery, for
when the soldiers had entered the fortress they hurled their shields upon her, crushing her
to death.

[5-10] Fathers of the City was the name given to the members of the Roman Senate.

[5-11] Ostia was the port of Rome, situated at the mouth of the Tiber.

[5-12] Janiculum is a hill on the west bank of the Tiber at Rome. It was strongly fortified,
and commanded the approach to Rome.

[5-13] Iwis is an obsolete word meaning truly.

[5-14] When the kings were banished from Rome the people vowed that never again should one
man hold the supreme power. Two chief rulers were therefore chosen, and were given the name
of consuls.

[7-15] Sextus was the son of the last king of Rome. It was a shameful deed of his which finally
roused the people against the Tarquin family.

[8-16] In the temple of the goddess Vesta a sacred flame was kept burning constantly, and it
was thought that the consequences to the city would be most dire if the fire were allowed to
go out. The Vestal virgins, priestesses who tended the flame, were held in the highest honor.

[10-17] The Roman people were divided into two classes, the patricians, to whom belonged all
the privileges of citizenship, and the plebeians, who were not allowed to hold office or even
to own property. Macaulay gives the English name Commons to the plebeians.

[11-18] A discussion as to who these chiefs were, or as to where the places mentioned were
located, would be profitless. The notes attempt to give only such information as will aid in
understanding the story.

[12-19] Campania is another name for the campagna.

[12-20] Hinds here means peasants.

[14-21] Romulus, the founder of Rome, and Remus, his brother, were, according to the legend,
rescued and brought up by a she-wolf, after they had been cast into the Tiber to die.

[18-22] The Palatine is one of the seven hills of Rome.

[18-23] The Romans personified the Tiber River, and even offered prayers to it.

[20-24] The Comitium was the old Roman polling-place, a square situated between the Forum and
the Senate House.

[20-25] The Volscians were among the most determined of the Italian enemies of Rome.

[20-26] Juno was the goddess who was thought of as presiding over marriage and the birth of
children.

[22-27] You can tell from these last three stanzas, that Macaulay is writing his poem, not
as an Englishman of the nineteenth century, but as if he were a Roman in the days when Rome,
though powerful, had not yet become the luxurious city which it afterward was. That is, he
thought of himself as writing in the days of the Republic, not in the days of the Empire.

    And still they row'd amidst the roar
      Of waters fast prevailing:
    Lord Ullin reach'd that fatal shore,
      His wrath was changed to wailing.

SIR WALTER SCOTT

By GRACE E. SELLON

Of the old and honorable families of Scotland there are perhaps none more worthy than those
from which were descended the parents of Sir Walter Scott. In the long line of ancestors on
either side were fearless knights and bold chiefs of the Scottish Border whose adventures became
a delightful heritage to the little boy born into the Edinburgh family of Scott in 1771. Perhaps
his natural liking for strange and exciting events would have made him even more eager than
other children to be told fairy stories and tales of real heroes of his own land. But even
had this not been so, the way in which he was forced to spend his early childhood was such
that entertainment of this kind was about all that he could enjoy. He was not two years old
when, after a brief illness, he lost the use of one of his legs and thus became unable to run
about as before, or even to stand. Soon afterward he was sent to his grandfather's farm at
Sandy-Knowe, where it was thought that the country life would help him. There he spent his
days in listening to lively stories of Scotsmen who had lived in the brave and rollicking fashion
of Robin Hood, in being read to by his aunt or in lying out among the rocks, cared for by his
grandfather's old shepherd. When thus out of doors he found so much of interest about him that
he could not lie still and would try so hard to move himself about that at length he became
able to rise to his feet and even to walk and run.
