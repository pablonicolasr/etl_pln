IX. Nothing can be in more harmony with the nature of any given thing  than other individuals
of the same species; therefore (cf. vii.) for man  in the preservation of his being and the
enjoyment of the rational life  there is nothing more useful than his fellow-man who is led
by reason.  Further, as we know not anything among individual things which is more  excellent
than a man led by reason, no man can better display the power of  his skill and disposition,
than in so training men, that they come at last  to live under the dominion of their own reason.

X. In so far as men are influenced by envy or any kind of hatred, one  towards another, they
are at variance, and are therefore to be feared in  proportion, as they are more powerful than
their fellows.

XI. Yet minds are not conquered by force, but by love and high-mindedness.

XII. It is before all things useful to men to associate their ways of life,  to bind themselves
together with such bonds as they think most fitted to  gather them all into unity, and generally
to do whatsoever serves to  strengthen friendship.

XIII. But for this there is need of skill and watchfulness. For men are  diverse (seeing that
those who live under the guidance of reason are few),  yet are they generally envious and more
prone to revenge than to sympathy.  No small force of character is therefore required to take
everyone as he  is, and to restrain one's self from imitating the emotions of others. But 
those who carp at mankind, and are more skilled in railing at vice than  in instilling virtue,
and who break rather than strengthen men's  dispositions, are hurtful both to themselves and
others. Thus many from  too great impatience of spirit, or from misguided religious zeal, have
preferred to live among brutes rather than among men; as boys or youths,  who cannot peaceably
endure the chidings of their parents, will enlist as  soldiers and choose the hardships of
war and the despotic discipline in  preference to the comforts of home and the admonitions
of their father:  suffering any burden to be put upon them, so long as they may spite  their
parents.

XIV. Therefore, although men are generally governed in everything by their  own lusts, yet
their association in common brings many more advantages  than drawbacks. Wherefore it is better
to bear patiently the wrongs they  may do us, and to strive to promote whatsoever serves to
bring about  harmony and friendship.

XV. Those things, which beget harmony, are such as are attributable to  justice, equity, and
honourable living. For men brook ill not only what is  unjust or iniquitous, but also what
is reckoned disgraceful, or that a man  should slight the received customs of their society.
For winning love those  qualities are especially necessary which have regard to religion and
piety  (cf. IV:xxxvii.Notes.i., &.ii.; IV:xlvi.Note; and IV:lxxiii.Note).

XVI. Further, harmony is often the result of fear: but such harmony is  insecure. Further,
fear arises from infirmity of spirit and moreover  belongs not to the exercise of reason: the
same is true of compassion,  though this latter seems to bear a certain resemblance to piety.

XVII. Men are also gained over by liberality, especially such as have  not the means to buy
what is necessary to sustain life. However, to give  aid to every poor man is far beyond the
power and the advantage of any  private person. For the riches of any private person are wholly
inadequate  to meet such a call. Again, an individual man's resources of character  are too
limited for him to be able to make all men his friends. Hence  providing for the poor is a
duty, which falls on the State as a whole,  and has regard only to the general advantage.

XVIII. In accepting favours, and in returning gratitude our duty must be  wholly different
(cf. IV:lxx.Note; IV:lxxi. Note). 

XIX. Again, meretricious love, that is, the lust of generation arising  from bodily beauty,
and generally every sort of love, which owns anything  save freedom of soul as its cause, readily
passes into hate; unless indeed,  what is worse, it is a species of madness; and then it promotes
discord  rather than harmony (cf. III:xxxi.Coroll.).

XX. As concerning marriage, it is certain that this is in harmony with  reason, if the desire
for physical union be not engendered solely by  bodily beauty, but also by the desire to beget
children and to train them  up wisely; and moreover, if the love of both, to wit, of the man
and of  the woman, is not caused by bodily beauty only, but also by freedom of soul.

XXI. Furthermore, flattery begets harmony; but only by means of the vile  offence of slavishness
or treachery. None are more readily taken with  flattery than the proud, who wish to be first,
but are not.

XXII. There is in abasement a spurious appearance of piety and  religion. Although abasement
is the opposite to pride, yet is he that  abases himself most akin to the proud (IV:lvii.Note).

XXIII. Shame also brings about harmony, but only in such matters as cannot  be hid. Further,
as shame is a species of pain, it does not concern the  exercise of reason. 

XXIV. The remaining emotions of pain towards men are directly opposed to justice, equity, honour,
piety, and religion; and, although  indignation seems to bear a certain resemblance to equity,
yet is life  but lawless, where every man may pass judgment on another's deeds, and  vindicate
his own or other men's rights. 

XXV. Correctness of conduct (modestia), that is, the desire of pleasing  men which is determined
by reason, is attributable to piety (as we said  in IV:xxxvii.Note.i.). But, if it spring from
emotion, it is ambition,  or the desire whereby, men, under the false cloak of piety, generally
stir up discords and seditions. For he who desires to aid his fellows.  either in word or in
deed, so that they may together enjoy the highest  good, he, I say, will before all things
strive to, win them over with  love: not to draw them into admiration, so that a system may
be called  after his name, nor to give any cause for envy. Further, in his  conversation he
will shrink from talking of men's faults, and will be  careful to speak but sparingly of human
infirmity: but he will dwell at  length on human virtue or power, and the way whereby it may
be perfected.  Thus will men be stirred not by fear, nor by aversion, but only by the  emotion
of joy, to endeavour, so far as in them lies, to live in  obedience to reason.

XXVI. Besides men, we know of no particular thing in nature in whose mind  we may rejoice,
and whom we can associate with ourselves in friendship or  any sort of fellowship; therefore,
whatsoever there be in nature besides  man, a regard for our advantage does not call on us
to preserve, but to  preserve or destroy according to its various capabilities, and to adapt
to our use as best we may.

XXVII. The advantage which we derive from things external to us, besides  the experience and
knowledge which we acquire from observing them, and  from recombining their elements in different
forms, is principally the  preservation of the body; from this point of view, those things
are most  useful which can so feed and nourish the body, that all its parts may  rightly fulfil
their functions. For, in proportion as the body is capable  of being affected in a greater
variety of ways, and of affecting external  bodies in a great number of ways, so much the more
is the mind capable of  thinking (IV:xxxviii., IV:xxxix.). But there seem to be very few things
of this kind in nature; wherefore for the due nourishment of the body we  must use many foods
of diverse nature. For the human body is composed of  very many parts of different nature,
which stand in continual need of  varied nourishment, so that the whole body may be equally
capable of  doing everything that can follow from its own nature, and consequently  that the
mind also may be equally capable of forming many perceptions.

XXVIII. Now for providing these nourishments the strength of each  individual would hardly
suffice, if men did not lend one another mutual  aid. But money has furnished us with a token
for everything: hence it is  with the notion of money, that the mind of the multitude is chiefly
engrossed: nay, it can hardly conceive any kind of pleasure, which is not  accompanied with
the idea of money as cause.

XXIX. This result is the fault only of those, who seek money, not from  poverty or to supply
their necessary, wants, but because they, have  learned the arts of gain, wherewith they bring
themselves to great  splendour. Certainly they nourish their bodies, according to custom, but
scantily, believing that they lose as much of their wealth as they spend on  the preservation
of their body. But they who know the true use of money,  and who fix the measure of wealth
solely with regard to their actual needs,  live content with little.

XXX. As, therefore, those things are good which assist the various parts  of the body, and
enable them to perform their functions; and as pleasure  consists in an increase of, or aid
to, man's power, in so far as he is  composed of mind and body; it follows that all those things
which bring  pleasure are good. But seeing that things do not work with the object of  giving
us pleasure, and that their power of action is not tempered to suit  our advantage, and, lastly,
that pleasure is generally referred to one  part of the body more than to the other parts;
therefore most emotions of  pleasure (unless reason and watchfulness be at hand), and consequently
the  desires arising therefrom, may become excessive. Moreover we may add that  emotion leads
us to pay most regard to what is agreeable in the present,  nor can we estimate what is future
with emotions equally vivid.  (IV:xliv.Note, and IV:lx.Note.)

XXXI. Superstition, on the other hand, seems to account as good all that  brings pain, and
as bad all that brings pleasure. However, as we said  above (IV:xlv.Note), none but the envious
take delight in my infirmity  and trouble. For the greater the pleasure whereby we are affected,
the  greater is the perfection whereto we pass, and consequently the more do  we partake of
the divine nature: no pleasure can ever be evil, which is  regulated by a true regard for our
advantage. But contrariwise he, who is  led by fear and does good only to avoid evil, is not
guided by reason.

Ap.XXXII. (1) But human power is extremely limited, and is infinitely  surpassed by the power
of external causes; we have not, therefore, an  absolute power of shaping to our use those
things which are without us.   Nevertheless, we shall bear with an equal mind all that happens
to us  in contravention to the claims of our own advantage, so long as we are  conscious, that
we have done our duty, and that the power which we possess  is not sufficient to enable us
to protect ourselves completely;  remembering that we are a part of universal nature, and that
we  follow her order. If we have a clear and distinct understanding of  this, that part of
our nature which is defined by intelligence, in other  words the better part of ourselves,
will assuredly acquiesce in what  befalls us, and in such acquiescence will endeavour to persist.
For,  in so far as we are intelligent beings, we cannot desire anything save  that which is
necessary, nor yield absolute acquiescence to anything,  save to that which is true: wherefore,
in so far as we have a right  understanding of these things, the endeavour of the better part
of  ourselves is in harmony with the order of nature as a whole.
