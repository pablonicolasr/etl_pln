" "The nation has groaned under the intolerable burden of those
who sucked her blood for gain. We have carried on wars, that we might fill the pockets of stock-jobbers.
We have revised our Constitution, and by a great and united national effort, have secured our
Protestant succession, only that we may become the tools of a faction, who arrogate to themselves
the whole merit of what was a national act. We are governed by upstarts, who are unsettling
the landmarks of our social system, and are displacing the influence of our landed gentry by
that of a class of men who find their profit in our woes." The rule of the tradesman must be
replaced by the rule of those whose lives are bound up with the land of their country. The
art of government was not "the importation of nutmegs, and the curing of herrings;" but the
political embodiment of the will of "a Parliament freely chosen, without threatening or corruption,"
and "composed of landed men" whose interests being in the soil would be at one with the interests
of those who lived on the soil. Whigs and Tories may dispute as they will among themselves
as to the best side from which to defend the country; but the men of the true party are the
men of the National party--they "whose principles in Church and State, are what I have above
related; whose actions are derived from thence, and who have no attachment to any set of ministers,
further than as these are friends to the Constitution in all its parts; but will do their utmost
to save their Prince and Country, whoever be at the Helm".[1]

In this spirit and in such wise did Swift temper his time and champion the cause of those men
who had chosen him. This was a kind of "examining" to which neither the Whigs nor the Tories
had been accustomed. It shed quite a new light on matters, which the country at large was not
slow to appreciate. Throughout the length and breadth of the kingdom "The Examiner" was welcomed
and its appeals responded to. Its success was notable, even magnificent; but it was not a lasting
success. It did the work that the ministry had intended it to do, and did it unmistakably;
but the principles of this National party were for men of a sterner mould than either Harley
or St. John. Swift had laid a burden on their shoulders heavier than they could carry, and
they fell when they were bereft of his support. But the work Swift did bears witness to-day
to a very unusual combination of qualities in the genius of this man, whose personality stands
out even above his work. It was ever his fate to serve and never his happiness to command;
but then he had himself accepted servitude when he donned the robe of the priest. To which
Monck Mason pertinently remarks: "The Doctor should have told us what these papers were which
Addison wrote in opposition to Swift's 'Examiner;' for the last 'Whig Examiner,' written by
Addison, was published October 12th, 1710, and Swift's first 'Examiner' on the 2nd November
following."[2]

In this volume have been collected those writings of Swift which form his contributions to
the periodicals of his time. Care has been taken to give the best text and to admit nothing
that Swift did not write. In the preparation of the volume the editor has received such assistance
from Mr. W. Spencer Jackson that it might with stricter justice be said that he had edited
it. He collated the texts, revised the proofs, and supplied most of the notes. Without his
assistance the volume must inevitably have been further delayed, and the editor gladly takes
this occasion to acknowledge his indebtedness to Mr. Jackson and to thank him for his help.

His further indebtedness must be acknowledged to the researches of those writers already named
in the previously published volumes of this edition, and also cited in the notes to the present
volume.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO "THE TATLER."

NOTE.

In the original dedication of the first volume of "The Tatler" to Arthur Maynwaring Richard
Steele, its projector and editor, gives characteristic expression to the motive which prompted
him in its establishment.

That Steele succeeded in this laudable purpose has been amply made evident by the effect "The
Tatler" had upon his literary successors, both of his own age and of the generations since
his time. "The Tatler" was, if we except Defoe's "Weekly Review," the earliest literary periodical
which, in the language of Scott, "had no small effect in fixing and refining the character
of the English nation."

Steele conducted his periodical under the name of Isaac Bickerstaff. The gentleman referred
to is, of course, Swift, whose pamphlets on Partridge had been the talk of the town.

Steele very kindly ascribes the success of the periodical to this "good fortune;" and though
there may be something in what he said, we, in the present day, can more justly appreciate
the great benefit conferred upon his countrymen by himself and his co-workers.

The influence of "The Tatler" on contemporary thought is acknowledged by Gay in his "Present
State of Wit," published in 1711.

Among the contributors, in addition to the editor himself, were Swift, Addison, Yalden, John
Hughes, William Harrison, and James Greenwood.

It must always remain to a great extent a matter of conjecture as to the exact authorship of
"The Tatler" papers. In the preface to the fourth volume the authorship of a very few of the
articles was admitted. Peter Wentworth wrote to his brother, Lord Raby, on May 9th, 1709, saying
the Tatlers "are writ by a club of wits, who make it their business to pick up all the merry
stories they can.... Three of the authors are guessed at, viz.: Swift,... Yalden, and Steele"
("Wentworth Papers," 85).

Swift's first recognized prose contribution to "The Tatler" was in No. 32 (June 23rd), and
he continued from time to time, as the following reprint will show, to assist his friend; but,
unfortunately, party politics separated the two, and Swift retired from the venture.

A particular meaning was attached to the place from which the articles in "The Tatler" were dated.

"The Tatler" was reprinted in Edinburgh as soon as possible after its publication in London,
commencing apparently with No. 130, as No. 31 (Edinburgh, James Watson) is dated April 24th,
1710, and corresponds to No. 160 of the original edition, April 18th, 1710. [T.S.]

THE TATLER, NUMB. 32.

FROM TUESDAY JUNE 21. TO THURSDAY JUNE 23. 1709.

This paper is written in ridicule of some affected ladies of the period, who pretended, with
rather too much ostentation, to embrace the doctrines of Platonic Love. Mrs. Mary Astell, a
learned and worthy woman, had embraced this fantastic notion so deeply, that, in an essay upon
the female sex, in 1696, she proposed a sort of female college, in which the young might be
instructed, and 'ladies nauseating the parade of the world,' might find a happy retirement.
The plan was disconcerted by Bishop Burnet, who, understanding that the Queen intended to give
£10,000 towards the establishment, dissuaded her, by an assurance, that it would lead to the
introduction of Popish orders, and be called a nunnery. This lady is the Madonella of the Tatler....
This paper has been censured as a gross reflection on Mrs. Astell's character, but on no very
just foundation. Swift only prophesies the probable issue of such a scheme, as that of the
Protestant nunnery; and it is a violent interpretation of his words to suppose him to insinuate,
that the conclusion had taken place without the premises. Indeed, the scourge of ridicule is
seldom better employed than on that species of Précieuse, who is anxious to confound the boundaries
which nature has fixed for the employments and studies of the two sexes. No man was more zealous
than Swift for informing the female mind in those points most becoming and useful to their
sex. His "Letter to a Young Married Lady" and "Thoughts on Education" point out the extent
of those studies. [S.]

Nichols, in his edition of "The Tatler" (1786), ascribes this paper to "Swift and Addison";
but he thinks the humour of it "certainly originated in the licentious imagination of the Dean
of St. Patrick's." [T.S.]]

[Footnote 2: John Norris (1657-1711), Rector of Bemerton, author of "The Theory and Regulation
of Love" (1688), and of many other works. His correspondence with the famous Platonist, Henry
More, is appended to this "moral essay." Chalmers speaks of him as "a man of great ingenuity,
learning, and piety"; but Locke refers to him as "an obscure, enthusiastic man." [T.S.]]

[Footnote 3: Henry More (1614-1687), the famous Cambridge Platonist, and author of "Philosophicall
Poems" (1647), "The Immortality of the Soul" (1659), and other works of a similar nature. Chalmers
notes that "Mr. Chishall, an eminent bookseller, declared, that Dr. More's 'Mystery of Godliness'
and his other works, ruled all the booksellers of London for twenty years together." [T.S. ]]

[Footnote 4: The reference here is to Milton's "Apology for Smectymnuus." Milton and More were,
during one year, fellow-students at Christ's College, Cambridge. [T.S.]]

[Footnote 5: Said to refer to a Mr. Repington, a well-known wag of the time, and a member of
an old Warwickshire family, of Amington, near Tamworth. [T.S.]]

[Footnote 6: The Betty here referred to is the Lady Elizabeth Hastings (1682-1739), daughter
of Theophilus, seventh Earl of Huntingdon. In No. 49 of "The Tatler," Steele refers to her
in the famous sentence: "to love her is a liberal education." She contributed to Mrs. Astell's
plans for the establishment of a "Protestant nunnery." [T.S.]]

[Footnote 7: See previous note. Mrs. Mary Astell (1668-1731) the authoress of "A Serious Proposal
to the Ladies for the Advancement of their true and greatest Interest" (1694), was the friend
of Lady Elizabeth Hastings and the correspondent of John Norris of Bemerton. There is not the
slightest foundation for the gross and cruel insinuations against her character in this paper.
The libel is repeated in the 59th and 63rd numbers of "The Tatler." Her correspondence with
Norris was published in 1695, with the title, "Letters Concerning the Love of God". Later in
life she attacked Atterbury, Locke, and White Kennett. [T.S.]]

[Footnote 8: The reference here is to Sir Thomas Browne's "Religio Medici," part ii., section
9. [T.S.]]

[Footnote 9: M. Bournelle--a pseudonym of William Oldisworth--remarks: "The next interview
after a second is still a second; there is no progress in time to lovers" ("Annotations on
'The Tatler'"). Chalmers reads here, "a second and a third interview." [T.S.]]

The proposed work had been promised in the 32nd number of "The Tatler," where it was stated
that, "I shall dedicate this discourse to a gentleman, my very good friend, who is the Janus
of our times, and whom, by his years and wit, you would take to be of the last age; but by
his dress and morals, of this." [T.S.]]

THE TATLER, NUMB. 59.

FROM TUESDAY AUGUST 23. TO THURSDAY AUGUST 25. 1709.

Will's Coffee-house, August 24.

The author of the ensuing letter, by his name, and the quotations he makes from the ancients,
seems a sort of spy from the old world, whom we moderns ought to be careful of offending; therefore
I must be free, and own it a fair hit where he takes me, rather than disoblige him.

"SIR, Having a peculiar humour of desiring to be somewhat the better or wiser for what I read,
I am always uneasy when, in any profound writer (for I read no others) I happen to meet with
what I cannot understand. When this falls out, it is a great grievance to me that I am not
able to consult the author himself about his meaning; for commentators are a sect that has
little share in my esteem. Your elaborate writings have, among many others, this advantage,
that their author is still alive, and ready (as his extensive charity makes us expect) to explain
whatever may be found in them too sublime for vulgar understandings. This, Sir, makes me presume
to ask you, how the Hampstead hero's character could be perfectly new[1] when the last letters
came away, and yet Sir John Suckling so well acquainted with it sixty years ago? I hope, Sir,
you will not take this amiss: I can assure you, I have a profound respect for you; which makes
me write this, with the same disposition with which Longinus bids us read Homer and Plato.

"'When in reading,' says he, 'any of those celebrated authors, we meet with a passage to which
we cannot well reconcile our reasons, we ought firmly to believe, that were those great wits
present to answer for themselves, we should to our wonder be convinced, that we only are guilty
of the mistakes we before attributed to them.' If you think fit to remove the scruple that
now torments me, it will be an encouragement to me to settle a frequent correspondence with
you, several things falling in my way which would not, perhaps, be altogether foreign to your
purpose, and whereon your thoughts would be very acceptable to

"Your most humble servant,

"OBADIAH GREENHAT."
