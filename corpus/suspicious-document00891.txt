MARK TWAIN, A BIOGRAPHY

By Albert Bigelow Paine

VOLUME III, Part 1: 1900-1907

THE RETURN OF THE CONQUEROR

It would be hard to exaggerate the stir which the newspapers and the public generally made
over the homecoming of Mark Twain. He had left America, staggering under heavy obligation and
set out on a pilgrimage of redemption. At the moment when this Mecca, was in view a great sorrow
had befallen him and, stirred a world-wide and soul-deep tide of human sympathy. Then there
had followed such ovation as has seldom been conferred upon a private citizen, and now approaching
old age, still in the fullness of his mental vigor, he had returned to his native soil with
the prestige of these honors upon him and the vast added glory of having made his financial
fight single-handed-and won.

He was heralded literally as a conquering hero. Every paper in the land had an editorial telling
the story of his debts, his sorrow, and his triumphs.

Howells acknowledges that he had some doubts as to the permanency of the vast acclaim of the
American public, remembering, or perhaps assuming, a national fickleness. Says Howells:

    He had hitherto been more intelligently accepted or more largely
    imagined in Europe, and I suppose it was my sense of this that
    inspired the stupidity of my saying to him when we came to consider
    "the state of polite learning" among us, "You mustn't expect people
    to keep it up here as they do in England." But it appeared that his
    countrymen were only wanting the chance, and they kept it up in
    honor of him past all precedent.

Clemens went to the Earlington Hotel and began search for a furnished house in New York. They
would not return to Hartford--at least not yet. The associations there were still too sad,
and they immediately became more so. Five days after Mark Twain's return to America, his old
friend and co-worker, Charles Dudley Warner, died. Clemens went to Hartford to act as a pall-bearer
and while there looked into the old home.

Even if the surroundings had been less sorrowful it is not likely that Clemens would have returned
to Hartford at this time. He had become a world-character, a dweller in capitals. Everywhere
he moved a world revolved about him. Such a figure in Germany would live naturally in Berlin;
in England London; in France, Paris; in Austria, Vienna; in America his headquarters could
only be New York.

Clemens empowered certain of his friends to find a home for him, and Mr. Frank N. Doubleday
discovered an attractive and handsomely furnished residence at 14 West Tenth Street, which
was promptly approved. Doubleday, who was going to Boston, left orders with the agent to draw
the lease and take it up to the new tenant for signature. To Clemens he said:

"The house is as good as yours. All you've got to do is to sign the lease. You can consider
it all settled."

When Doubleday returned from Boston a few days later the agent called on him and complained
that he couldn't find Mark Twain anywhere. It was reported at his hotel that he had gone and
left no address. Doubleday was mystified; then, reflecting, he had an inspiration. He walked
over to 14 West Tenth Street and found what he had suspected--Mark Twain had moved in. He had
convinced the caretaker that everything was all right and he was quite at home. Doubleday said:

"Why, you haven't executed the lease yet."

"No," said Clemens, "but you said the house was as good as mine," to which Doubleday agreed,
but suggested that they go up to the real-estate office and give the agent notice that he was
in possession of the premises.

Doubleday's troubles were not quite over, however. Clemens began to find defects in his new
home and assumed to hold Doubleday responsible for them. He sent a daily postal card complaining
of the windows, furnace, the range, the water-whatever he thought might lend interest to Doubleday's
life. As a matter of fact, he was pleased with the place. To MacAlister he wrote:

    We were very lucky to get this big house furnished.

The house at 14 West Tenth Street became suddenly one of the most conspicuous residences in
New York. The papers immediately made its appearance familiar. Many people passed down that
usually quiet street, stopping to observe or point out where Mark Twain lived. There was a
constant procession of callers of every kind. Many were friends, old and new, but there was
a multitude of strangers. Hundreds came merely to express their appreciation of his work, hoping
for a personal word or a hand-shake or an autograph; but there were other hundreds who came
with this thing and that thing--axes to grind--and there were newspaper reporters to ask his
opinion on politics, or polygamy, or woman's suffrage; on heaven and hell and happiness; on
the latest novel; on the war in Africa, the troubles in China; on anything under the sun, important
or unimportant, interesting or inane, concerning which one might possibly hold an opinion.
He was unfailing "copy" if they could but get a word with him. Anything that he might choose
to say upon any subject whatever was seized upon and magnified and printed with head-lines.
Sometimes opinions were invented for him. If he let fall a few words they were multiplied into
a column interview.

"That reporter worked a miracle equal to the loaves and fishes," he said of one such performance.

Many men would have become annoyed and irritable as these things continued; but Mark Twain
was greater than that. Eventually he employed a secretary to stand between him and the wash
of the tide, as a sort of breakwater; but he seldom lost his temper no matter what was the
request which was laid before him, for he recognized underneath it the great tribute of a great
nation.

Of course his literary valuation would be affected by the noise of the general applause. Magazines
and syndicates besought him for manuscripts. He was offered fifty cents and even a dollar a
word for whatever he might give them. He felt a child-like gratification in these evidences
of his market advancement, but he was not demoralized by them. He confined his work to a few
magazines, and in November concluded an arrangement with the new management of Harper & Brothers,
by which that firm was to have the exclusive serial privilege of whatever he might write at
a fixed rate of twenty cents per word--a rate increased to thirty cents by a later contract,
which also provided an increased royalty for the publication of his books.

The United States, as a nation, does not confer any special honors upon private citizens. We
do not have decorations and titles, even though there are times when it seems that such things
might be not inappropriately conferred. Certain of the newspapers, more lavish in their enthusiasm
than others, were inclined to propose, as one paper phrased it, "Some peculiar recognition--something
that should appeal to Samuel L. Clemens, the man, rather than to Mark Twain, the literate.
Just what form this recognition should take is doubtful, for the case has no exact precedent."

Perhaps the paper thought that Mark Twain was entitled--as he himself once humorously suggested-to
the "thanks of Congress" for having come home alive and out of debt, but it is just as well
that nothing of the sort was ever seriously considered. The thanks of the public at large contained
more substance, and was a tribute much more to his mind. The paper above quoted ended by suggesting
a very large dinner and memorial of welcome as being more in keeping with the republican idea
and the American expression of good-will.

But this was an unneeded suggestion. If he had eaten all the dinners proposed he would not
have lived to enjoy his public honors a month. As it was, he accepted many more dinners than
he could eat, and presently fell into the habit of arriving when the banqueting was about over
and the after-dinner speaking about to begin. Even so the strain told on him.

"His friends saw that he was wearing himself out," says Howells, and perhaps this was true,
for he grew thin and pale and contracted a hacking cough. He did not spare himself as often
as he should have done. Once to Richard Watson Gilder he sent this line of regrets:

    In bed with a chest cold and other company--Wednesday.

He became again the guest of honor at the Lotos Club, which had dined him so lavishly seven
years before, just previous to his financial collapse. That former dinner had been a distinguished
occasion, but never before had the Lotos Club been so brimming with eager hospitality as on
the second great occasion. In closing his introductory speech President Frank Lawrence said,
"We hail him as one who has borne great burdens with manliness and courage, who has emerged
from great struggles victorious," and the assembled diners roared out their applause.

It was like him to make that public acknowledgment. He could not let an unfair impression remain
that any man or any set of men had laid an unnecessary burden upon him-his sense of justice
would not consent to it. He also spoke on that occasion of certain national changes.

    How many things have happened in the seven years I have been away
    from home! We have fought a righteous war, and a righteous war is a
    rare thing in history. We have turned aside from our own comfort
    and seen to it that freedom should exist, not only within our own
    gates, but in our own neighborhood. We have set Cuba free and
    placed her among the galaxy of free nations of the world. We
    started out to set those poor Filipinos free, but why that righteous
    plan miscarried perhaps I shall never know. We have also been
    making a creditable showing in China, and that is more than all the
    other powers can say. The "Yellow Terror" is threatening the world,
    but no matter what happens the United States says that it has had no
    part in it.

    Since I have been away we have been nursing free silver. We have
    watched by its cradle, we have done our best to raise that child,
    but every time it seemed to be getting along nicely along came some
    pestiferous Republican and gave it the measles or something. I fear
    we will never raise that child.

    We've done more than that. We elected a President four years ago.
    We've found fault and criticized him, and here a day or two ago we
    go and elect him for another four years, with votes enough to spare
    to do it over again.

One club followed another in honoring Mark Twain--the Aldine, the St. Nicholas, the Press clubs,
and other associations and societies. His old friends were at these dinners--Howells, Aldrich,
Depew, Rogers, ex-Speaker Reed--and they praised him and gibed him to his and their hearts'
content.

It was a political year, and he generally had something to say on matters municipal, national,
or international; and he spoke out more and more freely, as with each opportunity he warmed
more righteously to his subject.

At the dinner given to him by the St. Nicholas Club he said, with deep irony:

    Gentlemen, you have here the best municipal government in the world,
    and the most fragrant and the purest. The very angels of heaven
    envy you and wish they had a government like it up there. You got
    it by your noble fidelity to civic duty; by the stern and ever
    watchful exercise of the great powers lodged in you as lovers and
    guardians of your city; by your manly refusal to sit inert when base
    men would have invaded her high places and possessed them; by your
    instant retaliation when any insult was offered you in her person,
    or any assault was made upon her fair fame. It is you who have made
    this government what it is, it is you who have made it the envy and
    despair of the other capitals of the world--and God bless you for
    it, gentlemen, God bless you! And when you get to heaven at last
    they'll say with joy, "Oh, there they come, the representatives of
    the perfectest citizenship in the universe show them the archangel's
    box and turn on the limelight!"

Those hearers who in former years had been indifferent to Mark Twain's
more serious purpose began to realize that, whatever he may have been
formerly, he was by no means now a mere fun-maker, but a man of deep and
grave convictions, able to give them the fullest and most forcible
expression. He still might make them laugh, but he also made them think,
and he stirred them to a truer gospel of patriotism. He did not preach a
patriotism that meant a boisterous cheering of the Stars and Stripes
right or wrong, but a patriotism that proposed to keep the Stars and
Stripes clean and worth shouting for. We teach them to regard as traitors, and hold in aversion
    and contempt, such as do not shout with the crowd, & so here in our
    democracy we are cheering a thing which of all things is most
    foreign to it & out of place--the delivery of our political
    conscience into somebody else's keeping. This is patriotism on the
    Russian plan.

Howells tells of discussing these vital matters with him in "an upper room, looking south over
a quiet, open space of back yards where," he says, "we fought our battles in behalf of the
Filipinos and Boers, and he carried on his campaign against the missionaries in China."

Howells at the time expressed an amused fear that Mark Twain's countrymen, who in former years
had expected him to be merely a humorist, should now, in the light of his wider acceptance
abroad, demand that he be mainly serious.

But the American people were quite ready to accept him in any of his phases, fully realizing
that whatever his philosophy or doctrine it would have somewhat of the humorous form, and whatever
his humor, there would somewhere be wisdom in it. He had in reality changed little; for a generation
he had thought the sort of things which he now, with advanced years and a different audience,
felt warranted in uttering openly. The man who in '64 had written against corruption in San
Francisco, who a few years later had defended the emigrant Chinese against persecution, who
at the meetings of the Monday Evening Club had denounced hypocrisy in politics, morals, and
national issues, did not need to change to be able to speak out against similar abuses now.
And a newer generation as willing to herald Mark Twain as a sage as well as a humorist, and
on occasion to quite overlook the absence of the cap and bells.

MARK TWAIN--GENERAL SPOKESMAN

Clemens did not confine his speeches altogether to matters of reform.

But a few days later he was back again in the forefront of reform,
preaching at the Berkeley Lyceum against foreign occupation in China. It
was there that he declared himself a Boxer. We drive the
    Chinaman out of our country; the Boxer believes in driving us out of
    his country. I am a Boxer, too, on those terms.

Introducing Winston Churchill, of England, at a dinner some weeks later, he explained how generous
England and America had been in not requiring fancy rates for "extinguished missionaries" in
China as Germany had done. Germany had required territory and cash, he said, in payment for
her missionaries, while the United States and England had been willing to settle for produce--firecrackers
and tea.

The Churchill introduction would seem to have been his last speech for the year 1900, and he
expected it, with one exception, to be the last for a long time. He realized that he was tired
and that the strain upon him made any other sort of work out of the question. Writing to MacAlister
at the end of the year, he said, "I seem to have made many speeches, but it is not so. It is
not more than ten, I think." Still, a respectable number in the space of two months, considering
that each was carefully written and committed to memory, and all amid crushing social pressure.
Again to MacAlister:

    I declined 7 banquets yesterday (which is double the daily average)
    & answered 29 letters. I have slaved at my mail every day since we
    arrived in mid-October, but Jean is learning to typewrite &
    presently I'll dictate & thereby save some scraps of time.

He added that after January 4th he did not intend to speak again for a year--that he would
not speak then only that the matter concerned the reform of city government.

The occasion of January 4, 1901, was a rather important one. It was a meeting of the City Club,
then engaged in the crusade for municipal reform. Wheeler H. Peckham presided, and Bishop Potter
made the opening address. It all seems like ancient history now, and perhaps is not very vital
any more; but the movement was making a great stir then, and Mark Twain's declaration that
he believed forty-nine men out of fifty were honest, and that the forty-nine only needed to
organize to disqualify the fiftieth man (always organized for crime), was quoted as a sort
of slogan for reform.

Clemens was not permitted to keep his resolution that he wouldn't speak again that year. He
had become a sort of general spokesman on public matters, and demands were made upon him which
could not be denied. He declined a Yale alumni dinner, but he could not refuse to preside at
the Lincoln Birthday celebration at Carnegie Hall, February 11th, where he must introduce Watterson
as the speaker of the evening.

The Watterson introduction is one of the choicest of Mark Twain's speeches--a pure and perfect
example of simple eloquence, worthy of the occasion which gave it utterance, worthy in spite
of its playful paragraphs (or even because of them, for Lincoln would have loved them), to
become the matrix of that imperishable Gettysburg phrase with which he makes his climax. He
opened by dwelling for a moment on Colonel Watterson as a soldier, journalist, orator, statesman,
and patriot; then he said:

    It is a curious circumstance that without collusion of any kind, but
    merely in obedience to a strange and pleasant and dramatic freak of
    destiny, he and I, kinsmen by blood--[Colonel Watterson's forebears
    had intermarried with the Lamptons.]--for we are that--and one-time
    rebels--for we were that--should be chosen out of a million
    surviving quondam rebels to come here and bare our heads in
    reverence and love of that noble soul whom 40 years ago we tried
    with all our hearts and all our strength to defeat and dispossess
    --Abraham Lincoln! Is the Rebellion ended and forgotten? Are the
    Blue and the Gray one to-day? By authority of this sign we may
    answer yes; there was a Rebellion--that incident is closed.

    I was born and reared in a slave State, my father was a slaveowner;
    and in the Civil War I was a second lieutenant in the Confederate
    service. For a while. This second cousin of mine, Colonel
    Watterson, the orator of this present occasion, was born and reared
    in a slave State, was a colonel in the Confederate service, and
    rendered me such assistance as he could in my self-appointed great
    task of annihilating the Federal armies and breaking up the Union.
    I laid my plans with wisdom and foresight, and if Colonel Watterson
    had obeyed my orders I should have succeeded in my giant
    undertaking. It was my intention to drive General Grant into the
    Pacific--if I could get transportation--and I told Colonel Watterson
    to surround the Eastern armies and wait till I came. But he was
    insubordinate, and stood upon a punctilio of military etiquette; he
    refused to take orders from a second lieutenant--and the Union was
    saved. This is the first time that this secret has been revealed.
    Until now no one outside the family has known the facts. But there
    they stand: Watterson saved the Union. Yet to this day that man
    gets no pension. Those were great days, splendid days. What an
    uprising it was! For the hearts of the whole nation, North and
    South, were in the war. We of the South were not ashamed; for, like
    the men of the North, we were fighting for 'flags we loved; and when
    men fight for these things, and under these convictions, with
    nothing sordid to tarnish their cause, that cause is holy, the blood
    spilt for it is sacred, the life that is laid down for it is
    consecrated. To-day we no longer regret the result, to-day we are
    glad it came out as it did, but we are not ashamed that we did our
    endeavor; we did our bravest best, against despairing odds, for the
    cause which was precious to us and which our consciences approved;
    and we are proud--and you are proud--the kindred blood in your veins
    answers when I say it--you are proud of the record we made in those
    mighty collisions in the fields.

    What an uprising it was! We did not have to supplicate for soldiers
    on either side. "We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred
    thousand strong!" That was the music North and South. The very
    choicest young blood and brawn and brain rose up from Maine to the
    Gulf and flocked to the standards--just as men always do when in
    their eyes their cause is great and fine and their hearts are in it;
    just as men flocked to the Crusades, sacrificing all they possessed
    to the cause, and entering cheerfully upon hardships which we cannot
    even imagine in this age, and upon toilsome and wasting journeys
    which in our time would be the equivalent of circumnavigating the
    globe five times over.

    We are here to honor the birthday of the greatest citizen, and the
    noblest and the best, after Washington, that this land or any other
    has yet produced. The old wounds are healed, you and we are
    brothers again; you testify it by honoring two of us, once soldiers
    of the Lost Cause, and foes of your great and good leader--with the
    privilege of assisting here; and we testify it by laying our honest
    homage at the feet of Abraham Lincoln, and in forgetting that you of
    the North and we of the South were ever enemies, and remembering
    only that we are now indistinguishably fused together and nameable
    by one common great name--Americans!

CCXIV

MARK TWAIN AND THE MISSIONARIES

Mark Twain had really begun his crusade for reform soon after his arrival in America in a practical
hand-to-hand manner. His housekeeper, Katie Leary, one night employed a cabman to drive her
from the Grand Central Station to the house at 14 West Tenth Street. No contract had been made
as to price, and when she arrived there the cabman's extortionate charge was refused. He persisted
in it, and she sent into the house for her employer. Of all men, Mark Twain was the last one
to countenance an extortion. He reasoned with the man kindly enough at first; when the driver
at last became abusive Clemens demanded his number, which was at first refused. In the end
he paid the legal fare, and in the morning entered a formal complaint, something altogether
unexpected, for the American public is accustomed to suffering almost any sort of imposition
to avoid trouble and publicity.

In some notes which Clemens had made in London four years earlier he wrote:

    If you call a policeman to settle the dispute you can depend on one
    thing--he will decide it against you every time. And so will the
    New York policeman. In London if you carry your case into court the
    man that is entitled to win it will win it. In New York--but no one
    carries a cab case into court there. It is my impression that it is
    now more than thirty years since any one has carried a cab case into
    court there.

Nevertheless, he was promptly on hand when the case was called to sustain the charge and to
read the cabdrivers' union and the public in general a lesson in good-citizenship. At the end
of the hearing, to a representative of the union he said:

"This is not a matter of sentiment, my dear sir. It is simply practical business. You cannot
imagine that I am making money wasting an hour or two of my time prosecuting a case in which
I can have no personal interest whatever. I am doing this just as any citizen should do. He
has no choice. He has a distinct duty. He is a non-classified policeman. Every citizen is,
a policeman, and it is his duty to assist the police and the magistracy in every way he can,
and give his time, if necessary, to do so. Here is a man who is a perfectly natural product
of an infamous system in this city--a charge upon the lax patriotism in this city of New York
that this thing can exist. You have encouraged him, in every way you know how to overcharge.
He is not the criminal here at all. The criminal is the citizen of New York and the absence
of patriotism. I am not here to avenge myself on him. I have no quarrel with him. My quarrel
is with the citizens of New York, who have encouraged him, and who created him by encouraging
him to overcharge in this way."

The driver's license was suspended. The case made a stir in the newspapers, and it is not likely
that any one incident ever contributed more to cab-driving morals in New York City.

But Clemens had larger matters than this in prospect. His many speeches on municipal and national
abuses he felt were more or less ephemeral. He proposed now to write himself down more substantially
and for a wider hearing. The human race was behaving very badly: unspeakable corruption was
rampant in the city; the Boers were being oppressed in South Africa; the natives were being
murdered in the Philippines; Leopold of Belgium was massacring and mutilating the blacks in
the Congo, and the allied powers, in the cause of Christ, were slaughtering the Chinese. In
his letters he had more than once boiled over touching these matters, and for New-Year's Eve,
1900, had written:

      A GREETING FROM THE NINETEENTH TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY

    I bring you the stately nation named Christendom, returning,
    bedraggled, besmirched, and dishonored, from pirate raids in Kiao-
    Chou, Manchuria, South Africa, and the Philippines, with her soul
    full of meanness, her pocket full of boodle, and her mouth full of
    pious hypocrisies. Give her soap and towel, but hide the looking-
    glass.--[Prepared for Red Cross Society watch-meeting, which was
    postponed until March. Clemens recalled his "Greeting" for that
    reason and for one other, which he expressed thus: "The list of
    greeters thus far issued by you contains only vague generalities and
    one definite name--mine: 'Some kings and queens and Mark Twain.' Now
    I am not enjoying this sparkling solitude and distinction. It makes
    me feel like a circus-poster in a graveyard."]

This was a sort of preliminary. Then, restraining himself no longer, he embodied his sentiments
in an article for the North American Review entitled, "To the Person Sitting in Darkness."
There was crying need for some one to speak the right word. He was about the only one who could
do it and be certain of a universal audience. He took as his text some Christmas Eve clippings
from the New York Tribune and Sun which he had been saving for this purpose. The Tribune clipping
said:

    Christmas will dawn in the United States over a people full of hope
    and aspiration and good cheer. Such a condition means contentment
    and happiness. The carping grumbler who may here and there go forth
    will find few to listen to him. The majority will wonder what is
    the matter with him, and pass on.

A Sun clipping depicted the "terrible offenses against humanity committed in the name of politics
in some of the most notorious East Side districts "--the unmissionaried, unpoliced darker New
York. The Sun declared that they could not be pictured even verbally. But it suggested enough
to make the reader shudder at the hideous depths of vice in the sections named. Another clipping
from the same paper reported the "Rev. Mr. Ament, of the American Board of Foreign Missions,"
as having collected indemnities for Boxer damages in China at the rate of three hundred taels
for each murder, "full payment for all destroyed property belonging to Christians, and national
fines amounting to thirteen times the indemnity." It quoted Mr. Ament as saying that the money
so obtained was used for the propagation of the Gospel, and that the amount so collected was
moderate when compared with the amount secured by the Catholics, who had demanded, in addition
to money, life for life, that is to say, "head for head"--in one district six hundred and eighty
heads having been so collected.

The despatch made Mr. Ament say a great deal more than this, but the gist here is enough. Mark
Twain, of course, was fiercely stirred. The missionary idea had seldom appealed to him, and
coupled with this business of bloodshed, it was less attractive than usual. He printed the
clippings in full, one following the other; then he said:

    By happy luck we get all these glad tidings on Christmas Eve--just
    the time to enable us to celebrate the day with proper gaiety and
    enthusiasm. Our spirits soar and we find we can even make jokes;
    taels I win, heads you lose.

He went on to score Ament, to compare the missionary policy in China to that of the Pawnee
Indians, and to propose for him a monument --subscriptions to be sent to the American Board.
He denounced the national policies in Africa, China, and the Philippines, and showed by the
reports and by the private letters of soldiers home, how cruel and barbarous and fiendish had
been the warfare made by those whose avowed purpose was to carry the blessed light of civilization
and Gospel "to the benighted native"--how in very truth these priceless blessings had been
handed on the point of a bayonet to the "Person Sitting in Darkness."

Mark Twain never wrote anything more scorching, more penetrating in its sarcasm, more fearful
in its revelation of injustice and hypocrisy, than his article "To the Person Sitting in Darkness."
He put aquafortis on all the raw places, and when it was finished he himself doubted the wisdom
of printing it. Howells, however, agreed that it should be published, and "it ought to be illustrated
by Dan Beard," he added, "with such pictures as he made for the Yankee in King Arthur's Court,
but you'd better hang yourself afterward."

Meeting Beard a few days later, Clemens mentioned the matter and said:

"So if you make the pictures, you hang with me."

But pictures were not required. It was published in the North American Review for February,
1901, as the opening article; after which the cyclone. Two storms moving in opposite directions
produce a cyclone, and the storms immediately developed; one all for Mark Twain and his principles,
the other all against him. Every paper in England and America commented on it editorially,
with bitter denunciations or with eager praise, according to their lights and convictions.

At 14 West Tenth Street letters, newspaper clippings, documents poured in by the bushel--laudations,
vituperations, denunciations, vindications; no such tumult ever occurred in a peaceful literary
home. It was really as if he had thrown a great missile into the human hive, one-half of which
regarded it as a ball of honey and the remainder as a cobblestone. Whatever other effect it
may have had, it left no thinking person unawakened.

Clemens reveled in it. W. A. Rogers, in Harper's Weekly, caricatured him as Tom Sawyer in a
snow fort, assailed by the shower of snowballs, "having the time of his life." Another artist,
Fred Lewis, pictured him as Huck Finn with a gun.

The American Board was naturally disturbed. The Ament clipping which Clemens had used had been
public property for more than a month--its authenticity never denied; but it was immediately
denied now, and the cable kept hot with inquiries.

The Rev. Judson Smith, one of the board, took up the defense of Dr. Ament, declaring him to
be one who had suffered for the cause, and asked Mark Twain, whose "brilliant article," he
said, "would produce an effect quite beyond the reach of plain argument," not to do an innocent
man an injustice. Clemens in the same paper replied that such was not his intent, that Mr.
Ament in his report had simply arraigned himself.

Then it suddenly developed that the cable report had "grossly exaggerated" the amount of Mr.
Ament's collections. Instead of thirteen times the indemnity it should have read "one and a
third times" the indemnity; whereupon, in another open letter, the board demanded retraction
and apology. Clemens would not fail to make the apology--at least he would explain. It was
precisely the kind of thing that would appeal to him--the delicate moral difference between
a demand thirteen times as great as it should be and a demand that was only one and a third
times the correct amount. "To My Missionary Critics," in the North American Review for April
(1901), was his formal and somewhat lengthy reply.

"I have no prejudice against apologies," he wrote. "I trust I shall never withhold one when
it is due."

He then proceeded to make out his case categorically. Touching the exaggerated indemnity, he said:

To Dr. Smith the "thirteen-fold-extra" clearly stood for "theft and extortion," and he was
right, distinctly right, indisputably right. He manifestly thinks that when it got scaled away
down to a mere "one-third" a little thing like that was some other than "theft and extortion."
Why, only the board knows!

I will try to explain this difficult problem so that the board can get an idea of it. If a
pauper owes me a dollar and I catch him unprotected and make him pay me fourteen dollars thirteen
of it is "theft and extortion." If I make him pay only one dollar thirty-three and a third
cents the thirty-three and a third cents are "theft and extortion," just the same.

I will put it in another way still simpler. If a man owes me one dog --any kind of a dog, the
breed is of no consequence--and I--but let it go; the board would never understand it. It can't
understand these involved and difficult things.

He offered some further illustrations, including the "Tale of a King and His Treasure" and
another tale entitled "The Watermelons."

    I have it now. Many years ago, when I was studying for the gallows,
    I had a dear comrade, a youth who was not in my line, but still a
    scrupulously good fellow though devious. He was preparing to
    qualify for a place on the board, for there was going to be a
    vacancy by superannuation in about five years. This was down South,
    in the slavery days. It was the nature of the negro then, as now,
    to steal watermelons. They stole three of the melons of an adoptive
    brother of mine, the only good ones he had. I suspected three of a
    neighbor's negroes, but there was no proof, and, besides, the
    watermelons in those negroes' private patches were all green and
    small and not up to indemnity standard. But in the private patches
    of three other negroes there was a number of competent melons. I
    consulted with my comrade, the understudy of the board. He said
    that if I would approve his arrangements he would arrange. I said,
    "Consider me the board; I approve; arrange." So he took a gun and
    went and collected three large melons for my brother-on-the-
    halfshell, and one over. I was greatly pleased and asked:

    "Who gets the extra one?"
    "Widows and orphans."

    "A good idea, too. Why didn't you take thirteen?"

    "It would have been wrong; a crime, in fact-theft and extortion."

    "What is the one-third extra--the odd melon--the same?"

    It caused him to reflect. But there was no result.

    The justice of the peace was a stern man. On the trial he found
    fault with the scheme and required us to explain upon what we based
    our strange conduct--as he called it. The understudy said:

    "On the custom of the niggers. They all do it."--[The point had
    been made by the board that it was the Chinese custom to make the
    inhabitants of a village responsible for individual crimes; and
    custom, likewise, to collect a third in excess of the damage, such
    surplus having been applied to the support of widows and orphans of
    the slain converts.]

    The justice forgot his dignity and descended to sarcasm.

    "Custom of the niggers! Are our morals so inadequate that we have
    to borrow of niggers?"

    Then he said to the jury: "Three melons were owing; they were
    collected from persons not proven to owe them: this is theft; they
    were collected by compulsion: this is extortion. A melon was added
    for the widows and orphans. It was owed by no one. It is another
    theft, another extortion. Return it whence it came, with the
    others. It is not permissible here to apply to any purpose goods
    dishonestly obtained; not even to the feeding of widows and orphans,
    for this would be to put a shame upon charity and dishonor it."

    He said it in open court, before everybody, and to me it did not
    seem very kind.

It was in the midst of the tumult that Clemens, perhaps feeling the need of sacred melody,
wrote to Andrew Carnegie:

DEAR SIR & FRIEND,--You seem to be in prosperity. Could you lend an admirer $1.50 to buy a
hymn-book with? God will bless you. I feel it; I know it.

N. B.--If there should be other applications, this one not to count.
                                Yours, MARK.

P. S.-Don't send the hymn-book; send the money; I want to make the selection myself.

Carnegie answered:

    Nothing less than a two-dollar & a half hymn-book gilt will do for
    you. Your place in the choir (celestial) demands that & you shall
    have it.

    There's a new Gospel of Saint Mark in the North American which I
    like better than anything I've read for many a day.

    I am willing to borrow a thousand dollars to distribute that sacred
    message in proper form, & if the author don't object may I send that
    sum, when I can raise it, to the Anti-Imperialist League, Boston, to
    which I am a contributor, the only missionary work I am responsible
    for.

    Just tell me you are willing & many thousands of the holy little
    missals will go forth. This inimitable satire is to become a
    classic. I count among my privileges in life that I know you, the
    author.

Perhaps a few more of the letters invited by Mark Twain's criticism of missionary work in China
may still be of interest to the reader: Frederick T. Cook, of the Hospital Saturday and Sunday
Association, wrote: "I hail you as the Voltaire of America. It is a noble distinction. God
bless you and see that you weary not in well-doing in this noblest, sublimest of crusades."

Ministers were by no means all against him. The associate pastor of the Every-day Church, in
Boston, sent this line: "I want to thank you for your matchless article in the current North
American. It must make converts of well-nigh all who read it."

But a Boston school-teacher was angry. "I have been reading the North American," she wrote,
"and I am filled with shame and remorse that I have dreamed of asking you to come to Boston
to talk to the teachers."

On the outside of the envelope Clemens made this pencil note:

"Now, I suppose I offended that young lady by having an opinion of my own, instead of waiting
and copying hers. I never thought. I suppose she must be as much as twenty-five, and probably
the only patriot in the country."

A critic with a sense of humor asked: "Please excuse seeming impertinence, but were you ever
adjudged insane? Be honest. How much money does the devil give you for arraigning Christianity
and missionary causes?"

But there were more of the better sort. Edward S. Martin, in a grateful letter, said: "How
gratifying it is to feel that we have a man among us who understands the rarity of the plain
truth, and who delights to utter it, and has the gift of doing so without cant and with not
too much seriousness."

Sir Hiram Maxim wrote: "I give you my candid opinion that what you have done is of very great
value to the civilization of the world. There is no man living whose words carry greater weight
than your own, as no one's writings are so eagerly sought after by all classes."

Clemens himself in his note-book set down this aphorism:

"Do right and you will be conspicuous."

CCXV

SUMMER AT "THE LAIR"

In June Clemens took the family to Saranac Lake, to Ampersand. They occupied a log cabin which
he called "The Lair," on the south shore, near the water's edge, a remote and beautiful place
where, as had happened before, they were so comfortable and satisfied that they hoped to return
another summer. There were swimming and boating and long walks in the woods; the worry and
noise of the world were far away. They gave little enough attention to the mails. They took
only a weekly paper, and were likely to allow it to lie in the postoffice uncalled for. Clemens,
especially, loved the place, and wrote to Twichell:

    I am on the front porch (lower one-main deck) of our little bijou of
    a dwelling-house. The lake edge (Lower Saranac) is so nearly under
    me that I can't see the shore, but only the water, small-poxed with
    rain splashes--for there is a heavy down pour. It is charmingly
    like sitting snuggled up on a ship's deck with the stretching sea
    all around but very much more satisfactory, for at sea a rainstorm
    is depressing, while here of course the effect engendered is just a
    deep sense of comfort & contentment. The heavy forest shuts us
    solidly in on three sides--there are no neighbors. There are
    beautiful little tan-colored impudent squirrels about. They take
    tea 5 P.M. (not invited) at the table in the woods where Jean does
    my typewriting, & one of them has been brave enough to sit upon
    Jean's knee with his tail curved over his back & munch his food.
    They come to dinner 7 P.M. on the front porch (not invited), but
    Clara drives them away. It is an occupation which requires some
    industry & attention to business. They all have the one name
    --Blennerhasset, from Burr's friend--& none of them answers to it
    except when hungry.

Clemens could work at "The Lair," often writing in shady seclusions along the shore, and he
finished there the two-part serial,--[ Published in Harper's Magazine for January and February,
1902.]--"The Double-Barrelled Detective Story," intended originally as a burlesque on Sherlock
Holmes. It did not altogether fulfil its purpose, and is hardly to be ranked as one of Mark
Twain's successes. It contains, however, one paragraph at least by which it is likely to be
remembered, a hoax--his last one--on the reader. It runs as follows:

    It was a crisp and spicy morning in early October. The lilacs and
    laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung burning and
    flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind nature
    for the wingless wild things that have their home in the tree-tops
    and would visit together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their
    purple and yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the
    slanting sweep of woodland, the sensuous fragrance of innumerable
    deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere, far in the
    empty sky a solitary oesophagus slept upon motionless wing;
    everywhere brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God.

The warm light and luxury of this paragraph are factitious. The careful reader will, note that
its various accessories are ridiculously associated, and only the most careless reader will
accept the oesophagus as a bird. But it disturbed a great many admirers, and numerous letters
of inquiry came wanting to know what it was all about. Some suspected the joke and taunted
him with it; one such correspondent wrote:

    MY DEAR MARK TWAIN,--Reading your "Double-Barrelled Detective Story"
    in the January Harper's late one night I came to the paragraph where
    you so beautifully describe "a crisp and spicy morning in early
    October." I read along down the paragraph, conscious only of its
    woozy sound, until I brought up with a start against your oesophagus
    in the empty sky. Then I read the paragraph again. Oh, Mark Twain!
    Mark Twain! How could you do it? Put a trap like that into the
    midst of a tragical story? Do serenity and peace brood over you
    after you have done such a thing?

    Who lit the lilacs, and which end up do they hang? When did larches
    begin to flame, and who set out the pomegranates in that canyon?
    What are deciduous flowers, and do they always "bloom in the fall,
    tra la"?

    I have been making myself obnoxious to various people by demanding
    their opinion of that paragraph without telling them the name of the
    author. They say, "Very well done." "The alliteration is so
    pretty." "What's an oesophagus, a bird?" "What's it all mean,
    anyway?" I tell them it means Mark Twain, and that an oesophagus is
    a kind of swallow. Am I right? Or is it a gull? Or a gullet?

    Hereafter if you must write such things won't you please be so kind
    as to label them?
                     Very sincerely yours,
                                ALLETTA F. DEAN.

Mark Twain to Miss Dean:

    Don't you give that oesophagus away again or I'll never trust you
    with another privacy!

So many wrote, that Clemens finally felt called upon to make public confession, and as one
searching letter had been mailed from Springfield, Massachusetts, he made his reply through
the Republican of that city. After some opening comment he said:

    I published a short story lately & it was in that that I put the
    oesophagus. I will say privately that I expected it to bother some
    people--in fact, that was the intention--but the harvest has been
    larger than I was calculating upon. The oesophagus has gathered in
    the guilty and the innocent alike, whereas I was only fishing for
    the innocent--the innocent and confiding.

He quoted a letter from a schoolmaster in the Philippines who thought the passage beautiful
with the exception of the curious creature which "slept upon motionless wings." Said Clemens:

    Do you notice? Nothing in the paragraph disturbed him but that one
    word. It shows that that paragraph was most ably constructed for
    the deception it was intended to put upon the reader. It was my
    intention that it should read plausibly, and it is now plain that it
    does; it was my intention that it should be emotional and touching,
    and you see yourself that it fetched this public instructor. Alas!
    if I had but left that one treacherous word out I should have
    scored, scored everywhere, and the paragraph would have slidden
    through every reader's sensibilities like oil and left not a
    suspicion behind.

    The other sample inquiry is from a professor in a New England
    university. It contains one naughty word (which I cannot bear to
    suppress), but he is not in the theological department, so it is no
    harm:

    "DEAR MR. CLEMENS,--'Far in the empty sky a solitary oesophagus
    slept upon motionless wing.'

    "It is not often I get a chance to read much periodical literature,
    but I have just gone through at this belated period, with much
    gratification and edification, your 'Double-Barrelled Detective
    Story.'

    "But what in hell is an oesophagus? I keep one myself, but it never
    sleeps in the air or anywhere else. My profession is to deal with
    words, and oesophagus interested me the moment I lighted upon it.
    But, as a companion of my youth used to say, 'I'll be eternally,
    co-eternally cussed' if I can make it out. Is it a joke or am I an
    ignoramus?"

    Between you and me, I was almost ashamed of having fooled that man,
    but for pride's sake I was not going to say so. I wrote and told
    him it was a joke--and that is what I am now saying to my
    Springfield inquirer. And I told him to carefully read the whole
    paragraph and he would find not a vestige of sense in any detail of
    it. This also I recommend to my Springfield inquirer.

    I have confessed. I am sorry--partially. I will not do so any
    more--for the present. Don't ask me any more questions; let the
    oesophagus have a rest--on his same old motionless wing.

He wrote Twichell that the story had been a six-day 'tour de force', twenty-five thousand words,
and he adds:

    How long it takes a literary seed to sprout sometimes! This seed was
    planted in your house many years ago when you sent me to bed with a
    book not heard of by me until then--Sherlock Holmes . . . .
    I've done a grist of writing here this summer, but not for
    publication soon, if ever. I did write two satisfactory articles
    for early print, but I've burned one of them & have buried the other
    in my large box of posthumous stuff. I've got stacks of literary
    remains piled up there.

Early in August Clemens went with H. H. Rogers in his yacht Kanawha on a cruise to New Brunswick
and Nova Scotia. Rogers had made up a party, including ex-Speaker Reed, Dr. Rice, and Col.
A. G. Paine. Young Harry Rogers also made one of the party. Clemens kept a log of the cruise,
certain entries of which convey something of its spirit. On the 11th, at Yarmouth, he wrote:

    Fog-bound. The garrison went ashore. Officers visited the yacht in
    the evening & said an anvil had been missed. Mr. Rogers paid for
    the anvil.

    August 13th. There is a fine picture-gallery here; the sheriff
    photographed the garrison, with the exception of Harry (Rogers) and
    Mr. Clemens.

    August 14th. Upon complaint of Mr. Reed another dog was procured.
    He said he had been a sailor all his life, and considered it
    dangerous to trust a ship to a dog-watch with only one dog in it.

    Poker, for a change.

    August 15th. To Rockland, Maine, in the afternoon, arriving about 6
    P.M. In the night Dr. Rice baited the anchor with his winnings &
    caught a whale 90 feet long. He said so himself. It is thought
    that if there had been another witness like Dr. Rice the whale would
    have been longer.

    August 16th. We could have had a happy time in Bath but for the
    interruptions caused by people who wanted Mr. Reed to explain votes
    of the olden time or give back the money. Mr. Rogers recouped them.

    Another anvil missed. The descendant of Captain Kidd is the only
    person who does not blush for these incidents. Harry and Mr.
    Clemens blush continually. It is believed that if the rest of the
    garrison were like these two the yacht would be welcome everywhere
    instead of being quarantined by the police in all the ports. Mr.
    Clemens & Harry have attracted a great deal of attention, & men have
    expressed a resolve to turn over a new leaf & copy after them from
    this out.

    Evening. Judge Cohen came over from another yacht to pay his
    respects to Harry and Mr. Clemens, he having heard of their
    reputation from the clergy of these coasts. He was invited by the
    gang to play poker apparently as a courtesy & in a spirit of seeming
    hospitality, he not knowing them & taking it all at par. Mr. Rogers
    lent him clothes to go home in.

    August 17th. The Reformed Statesman growling and complaining again
    --not in a frank, straightforward way, but talking at the Commodore,
    while letting on to be talking to himself. This time he was
    dissatisfied about the anchor watch; said it was out of date,
    untrustworthy, & for real efficiency didn't begin with the
    Waterbury, & was going on to reiterate, as usual, that he had been a
    pilot all his life & blamed if he ever saw, etc., etc., etc.

    But he was not allowed to finish. We put him ashore at Portland.

That is to say, Reed landed at Portland, the rest of the party returning with the yacht.

"We had a noble good time in the yacht," Clemens wrote Twichell on their return. "We caught
a Chinee missionary and drowned him."

Twichell had been invited to make one of the party, and this letter was to make him feel sorry
he had not accepted.

RIVERDALE--A YALE DEGREE

The Clemens household did not return to 14 West Tenth Street. They spent a week in Elmira at
the end of September, and after a brief stop in New York took up their residence on the northern
metropolitan boundary, at Riverdale-on-the-Hudson, in the old Appleton home. They had permanently
concluded not to return to Hartford. They had put the property there into an agent's hands
for sale. Mrs. Clemens never felt that she had the strength to enter the house again.

They had selected the Riverdale place with due consideration. They decided that they must have
easy access to the New York center, but they wished also to have the advantage of space and
spreading lawn and trees, large rooms, and light. The Appleton homestead provided these things.
It was a house built in the first third of the last century by one of the Morris family, so
long prominent in New York history. On passing into the Appleton ownership it had been enlarged
and beautified and named "Holbrook Hall." It overlooked the Hudson and the Palisades. It had
associations: the Roosevelt family had once lived there, Huxley, Darwin, Tyndall, and others
of their intellectual rank had been entertained there during its occupation by the first Appleton,
the founder of the publishing firm. The great hall of the added wing was its chief feature.
Clemens once remembered:

"We drifted from room to room on our tour of inspection, always with a growing doubt as to
whether we wanted that house or not; but at last, when we arrived in a dining-room that was
60 feet long, 30 feet wide, and had two great fireplaces in it, that settled it."

There were pleasant neighbors at Riverdale, and had it not been for the illnesses that seemed
always ready to seize upon that household the home there might have been ideal. They loved
the place presently, so much so that they contemplated buying it, but decided that it was too
costly. They began to prospect for other places along the Hudson shore. They were anxious to
have a home again--one that they could call their own.

Among the many pleasant neighbors at Riverdale were the Dodges, the Quincy Adamses, and the
Rev. Mr. Carstensen, a liberal-minded minister with whom Clemens easily affiliated. Clemens
and Carstensen visited back and forth and exchanged views. Once Mr. Carstensen told him that
he was going to town to dine with a party which included the Reverend Gottheil, a Catholic
bishop, an Indian Buddhist, and a Chinese scholar of the Confucian faith, after which they
were all going to a Yiddish theater. Clemens said:

"Well, there's only one more thing you need to make the party complete --that is, either Satan
or me."

Howells often came to Riverdale. He was living in a New York apartment, and it was handy and
made an easy and pleasant outing for him. He says:

"I began to see them again on something like the sweet old terms. They lived far more unpretentiously
than they used, and I think with a notion of economy, which they had never very successfully
practised. I recall that at the end of a certain year in Hartford, when they had been saving
and paying cash for everything, Clemens wrote, reminding me of their avowed experiment, and
asking me to guess how many bills they had at New-Year's; he hastened to say that a horse-car
would not have held them. At Riverdale they kept no carriage, and there was a snowy night when
I drove up to their handsome old mansion in the station carryall, which was crusted with mud,
as from the going down of the Deluge after transporting Noah and his family from the Ark to
whatever point they decided to settle provisionally. But the good talk, the rich talk, the
talk that could never suffer poverty of mind or soul was there, and we jubilantly found ourselves
again in our middle youth."

Both Howells and Clemens were made doctors of letters by Yale that year and went over in October
to receive their degrees. It was Mark Twain's second Yale degree, and it was the highest rank
that an American institution of learning could confer.

Twichell wrote:

I want you to understand, old fellow, that it will be in its intention the highest public compliment,
and emphatically so in your case, for it will be tendered you by a corporation of gentlemen,
the majority of whom do not at all agree with the views on important questions which you have
lately promulgated in speech and in writing, and with which you are identified to the public
mind. They grant, of course, your right to hold and express those views, though for themselves
they don't like 'em; but in awarding you the proposed laurel they will make no count of that
whatever. Their action will appropriately signify simply and solely their estimate of your
merit and rank as a man of letters, and so, as I say, the compliment of it will be of the pure,
unadulterated quality.

Howells was not especially eager to go, and tried to conspire with Clemens to arrange some
excuse which would keep them at home.

I remember with satisfaction [he wrote] our joint success in keeping away from the Concord
Centennial in 1875, and I have been thinking we might help each other in this matter of the
Yale Anniversary. What are your plans for getting left, or shall you trust to inspiration?

Their plans did not avail. Both Howells and Clemens went to New Haven to receive their honors.

When they had returned, Howells wrote formally, as became the new rank:

    DEAR SIR,--I have long been an admirer of your complete works,
    several of which I have read, and I am with you shoulder to shoulder
    in the cause of foreign missions. I would respectfully request a
    personal interview, and if you will appoint some day and hour most
    inconvenient to you I will call at your baronial hall. I cannot
    doubt, from the account of your courtesy given me by the Twelve
    Apostles, who once visited you in your Hartford home and were
    mistaken for a syndicate of lightning-rod men, that our meeting will
    be mutually agreeable.

                     Yours truly,
                            W. D. HOWELLS.
    DR. CLEMENS.

MARK TWAIN IN POLITICS

There was a campaign for the mayoralty of New York City that fall, with Seth Low on the Fusion
ticket against Edward M. Shepard as the Tammany candidate. Mark Twain entered the arena to
try to defeat Tammany Hall. He wrote and he spoke in favor of clean city government and police
reform. He was savagely in earnest and openly denounced the clan of Croker, individually and
collectively. He joined a society called 'The Acorns'; and on the 17th of October, at a dinner
given by the order at the Waldorf-Astoria, delivered a fierce arraignment, in which he characterized
Croker as the Warren Hastings of New York. His speech was really a set of extracts from Edmund
Burke's great impeachment of Hastings, substituting always the name of Croker, and paralleling
his career with that of the ancient boss of the East India Company.

It was not a humorous speech. It was too denunciatory for that. It probably contained less
comic phrasing than any former effort. There is hardly even a suggestion of humor from beginning
to end. It concluded with this paraphrase of Burke's impeachment:

    I impeach Richard Croker of high crimes and misdemeanors. I impeach
    him in the name of the people, whose trust he has betrayed.

    I impeach him in the name of all the people of America, whose
    national character he has dishonored.

The Acorn speech was greatly relied upon for damage to the Tammany ranks, and hundreds of thousands
of copies of it were printed and circulated. --[The "Edmund Burke on Croker and Tammany" speech
had originally been written as an article for the North American Review.]

Clemens was really heart and soul in the campaign. He even joined a procession that marched
up Broadway, and he made a speech to a great assemblage at Broadway and Leonard Street, when,
as he said, he had been sick abed two days and, according to the doctor, should be in bed then.

    But I would not stay at home for a nursery disease, and that's what
    I've got. Now, don't let this leak out all over town, but I've been
    doing some indiscreet eating--that's all. It wasn't drinking. If
    it had been I shouldn't have said anything about it.

    I ate a banana. I bought it just to clinch the Italian vote for
    fusion, but I got hold of a Tammany banana by mistake. Just one
    little nub of it on the end was nice and white. That was the
    Shepard end. The other nine-tenths were rotten. Now that little
    white end won't make the rest of the banana good. The nine-tenths
    will make that little nub rotten, too.

    We must get rid of the whole banana, and our Acorn Society is going
    to do its share, for it is pledged to nothing but the support of
    good government all over the United States. We will elect the
    President next time.

    It won't be I, for I have ruined my chances by joining the Acorns,
    and there can be no office-holders among us.

There was a movement which Clemens early nipped in the bud--to name a political party after him.

"I should be far from willing to have a political party named after me," he wrote, "and I would
not be willing to belong to a party which allowed its members to have political aspirations
or push friends forward for political preferment."

In other words, he was a knight-errant; his sole purpose for being in politics at all--something
he always detested--was to do what he could for the betterment of his people.

He had his reward, for when Election Day came, and the returns were in, the Fusion ticket had
triumphed and Tammany had fallen. Clemens received his share of the credit. One paper celebrated
him in verse:

              Who killed Croker?
              I, said Mark Twain,
              I killed Croker,
              I, the jolly joker!

Among Samuel Clemens's literary remains there is an outline plan for a "Casting-Vote party,"
whose main object was "to compel the two great parties to nominate their best man always."
It was to be an organization of an infinite number of clubs throughout the nation, no member
of which should seek or accept a nomination for office in any political appointment, but in
each case should cast its vote as a unit for the candidate of one of the two great political
parties, requiring that the man be of clean record and honest purpose.

    From constable up to President [runs his final clause] there is no
    office for which the two great parties cannot furnish able, clean,
    and acceptable men. Whenever the balance of power shall be lodged
    in a permanent third party, with no candidate of its own and no
    function but to cast its whole vote for the best man put forward by
    the Republicans and Democrats, these two parties will select the
    best man they have in their ranks. Good and clean government will
    follow, let its party complexion be what it may, and the country
    will be quite content.

It was a Utopian idea, very likely, as human nature is made; full of that native optimism which
was always overflowing and drowning his gloomier logic. Clearly he forgot his despair of humanity
when he formulated that document, and there is a world of unselfish hope in these closing lines:

    If in the hands of men who regard their citizenship as a high trust
    this scheme shall fail upon trial a better must be sought, a better
    must be invented; for it cannot be well or safe to let the present
    political conditions continue indefinitely. They can be improved,
    and American citizenship should arouse up from its disheartenment
    and see that it is done.

Had this document been put into type and circulated it might have founded a true Mark Twain party.

Clemens made not many more speeches that autumn, closing the year at last with the "Founder's
Night" speech at The Players, the short address which, ending on the stroke of midnight, dedicates
each passing year to the memory of Edwin Booth, and pledges each new year in a loving-cup passed
in his honor. 

He added that he had written frankly to Mr. Gladstone, telling him
that he was dissatisfied, and expressed his opinion that Mr. Gladstone
would give way, and that his reign could not last long.

Through the somewhat involved phraseology of Mr. Gladstone's letter,
it seemed possible to extract some hope in regard to extra powers
for local authorities, and a revision of taxation in favour of the
working classes.

He concluded by saying that if his party could get a majority, he would make their terms on
joining the Government, and regretting that Sir Charles was not still staying with him.

The letter to Mr. Gladstone spoke of the manifesto as a blow to the
Radical party, and went on to say that, in the event of the Liberal
party returning in full power to office, he would offer loyal support,
as far as possible, to any Government that might be formed, but that
the joining any Administration formed on the narrow basis of the programme
now presented would be impossible.

                It ended with the words: 'Dilke has left me, but, from a letter I
have received from him, I am justified in saying that he shares my
views.'

'I told Chamberlain that in my first speech (and I had two
to make shortly after my proposed marriage in October) I intended
to attack Reform of the House of Lords from the Single Chamber point
of view.'

He replied urging Sir Charles to give this question prominence
and importance, and to do so in the name of the Radical Party, as
expressing their policy, for fear that even Radical candidates should
be under some misapprehension.

    He also authorized him to use his (Mr. Chamberlain's) name, as concurring
in the views expressed.

                  

    
    'On the 25th I received a letter from Chamberlain containing Mr. Gladstone's
reply:

'"My Dear Chamberlain,

'"Were I engaged (which Heaven forfend)
in the formation of a new Liberal Government, and were your letter
of yesterday an answer to some invitation to join it, then I should
have read the letter with great regret; but I pointed out to you (as
I think), in a previous letter, that it would (as far as I could judge)
be an entire mistake to lay down a credo of Liberal policy for a new
Government at the present juncture.

    You and Hartington were both demurring in opposite senses, and I made
    to each the same reply. My aim was for the election only, in giving
    form to my address.

                      As to what lies beyond, I suppose the party will, so far as it has
a choice, set first about the matters on which it is agreed.

    But no one is bound to this proposition.
    
    '"Bright once said, with much force and sense, that the average opinion
    of the party ought to be the rule of immediate action.
    
    '"It is likely that there may be a split in the party in the
    far or middle distance,
    but I shall have nothing to do with it, and you, I am sure,
    do not wish to anticipate it or force it on. What I have said
    may, I hope, mitigate any
    regret such as you seem to intimate.
    

'"I am at present busy on private affairs and papers, to which for six years past I have hardly
given one continuous hour. Later on I should like much to explain to you my personal views
and intentions in conversation. It would be difficult to do so in
writing.

       They turn very much upon Ireland--the one imperial question that
seems at present possible to be brought into immediate view.

          But, for Liberals generally, I
           should have thought that there was work enough for three or four
years on which they might all agree.

So far as my observation and correspondence go, I have not found that non-Whig opinion is offended.

'"Sincerely
yours, '"W. E. Gladstone.

'"P.S.--A letter received from Dilke speaks pleasingly about the address.

'"I

may say that I was quite unconscious of interfering with your present view, which I understood
to be that none of your advanced proposals were to be excluded, but all left open for discussion.--W.
E. G."

'On the passage with regard to Ireland I noted: "He means that he
would go on as Prime Minister if he could see his way to carry the
larger Local Government (Ireland) scheme, and not otherwise."

But he meant more.'

Sir Charles also wrote suggesting that Mr. Chamberlain should, in his correspondence with Mr.
Gladstone, go into the question of the Whig composition of Liberal
Cabinets, and the latter promised 'to say just what you suggest.'

Those
who occupied the centre position in the Liberal party were bewildered
by divided counsels.

    
    
    'On September 28th I received from Chamberlain a letter enclosing one
    from Harcourt.... He (Harcourt) dwelt upon the delicacy of Mr. Gladstone's
    position. "He (Mr. Gladstone) says, if he is not wanted, he will
    'cut out,' and he doubts, I think, if either you or Hartington want
him.

But I hope in this he is mistaken; for he is wanted, and neither section can do without him....
When I spoke at Plymouth I knew nothing of the contents of his address, nor indeed, that it was about
to appear so soon, though, oddly enough, it came out the next day. I therefore spoke like a
cat in walnut shells, and had, like a man who makes a miss at billiards,
to 'play for safety.' I am quite with you on the subject of the acquisition
of land by local authorities, and also on free education, which seem
to be your two sine qua nons.

    As to what you say about remaining outside a new Liberal Government,
    forgive me for saying that is all nonsense. If a Liberal Government
    cannot be formed with you and Dilke, it certainly cannot be formed
    without you. You have acquired the right and the power to make your
    own conditions, and I am sure they will be reasonable ones."'

    

    Sir William Harcourt omitted to consider the possibility of a Government
being formed--as actually happened--while the charges against Sir
Charles were still untried.

    Politically, he made an omission which was less natural; once more
    there is no reference to the Irish problem and its effect.

Yet in Mr. Gladstone's mind it was daily becoming more insistent.

'On September 28th Chamberlain wrote enclosing a letter from Mr. Gladstone, and his reply:

'"My Dear Chamberlain,

'"I felt well pleased and easy after receiving your note of the 21st, but there is a point I should
like to put to you with reference to your self-denying ordinance making the three points conditions of office.

'"Suppose
Parnell to come back eighty to ninety strong, to keep them together, to bring forward a plan
which shall contain in your opinion adequate securities for the union
of the Empire, and to press this plan, under whatever name, as having
claims to precedence (claims which could hardly be denied even by
opponents), do you think no Government should be formed to promote
such a plan, unless the three points were glued on to it at the same
time?

Do you not think you would do well to reserve elbow-room for a case like this? I hope you will
not think my suggestion--it is not a question-- captious and a man-trap. It is meant in a very
different sense. A Liberal majority is assumed in it.

'"Yours sincerely, '"W. E. Gladstone."'

When that letter reached Highbury, Sir Charles was in France, awaiting Mrs. Pattison's arrival
from India. Mr. Chamberlain's reply was written without consultation on September 28th. In it
he said that he had assumed that Local Government would be the first work of a Liberal Government,
and that Bills for the three countries would be brought in together. Mr. Parnell's change of
front would, he thought, have limited the proposals to the establishment of County Councils,
with certain powers for the acquisition of land by Local Authorities. He thought it unlikely
that Parnell would bring forward a scheme that any Liberal Government
could support; but if he did, he would do all he could to assist the
Government in dealing with it, whether from inside or outside the
Cabinet.

Chamberlain further urged Dilke to lay stress on the determination of his party not to be 'mere lay
figures in a Cabinet of Goschens.' He regarded his party as indispensable, and if the Government
tried to do without them, they were determined to make trouble. He expressed an earnest wish
that Sir Charles Dilke could be working with them; but he did not
press this at the moment, if Sir Charles was taking a holiday after
his marriage.

Dilke took the briefest of holidays; on October 6th, three days after his wedding, he spoke at
Chelsea.

After dwelling at length on Chamberlain's proposal to give powers of compulsory land purchase to local
authorities, he asked for the widest form of elective self- government for Ireland consistent
with the integrity of the Empire, [Footnote: 'In my individual opinion,
the natural crowning stone of any large edifice of local government
must sooner or later be some such elective Local Government Board
for each of the three principal parts of the United Kingdom and for
the Principality of Wales, as I have often sketched out to you.

As regards Ireland, we all of us here, I think, agree that the widest form of elective self-government
should be conferred which is consistent with the integrity of the
Empire.

No one can justify the existence of the nominated official Boards which at present attempt to govern
Ireland. I care not whether the Irish people are or are not at the moment willing to accept
the changes we have to propose. If the present system is as indefensible as I think it, we
should propose them all the same. If they are not at first accepted, our scheme will at least
be seen and weighed, and we shall be freed from the necessity of appearing to defend a system
which is obnoxious to every Liberal principle. I would ask you to remember some words in Mr.
Ruskin's chapter on "The Future of England," in his Crown of Wild Olive, which are very applicable
to the situation:--"In Ireland, especially, a vicious system has
been so long maintained that it has become impossible to give due
support to the cause of order without seeming to countenance injury."

    The bodies which would deal with education, with private Bills, with
    provisional order Bills, and with appeals from local authorities in
    matters too large for county treatment, in Wales and Scotland
    and England itself, if I had my way, as well as in Ireland, would,
    I believe, make the future government of the United Kingdom, as
    a United Kingdom, more easy than it is at present.'] and went on to
    assume that the first session of the new Parliament would be 'a
    Local Government session.' In the following week 'I made an important
    speech at Halifax on Local Government which attracted much attention.'
    'Halifax will be all Local Government,' he wrote to Mr. Frank Hill,
    'which is necessary, as it is clear that Balfour and Salisbury have
    cribbed my last year's Bill.'
    
    'I may note here that on October 6th, at my Chelsea meeting, George
    Russell told me that he had on the previous day induced Mr. Gladstone
    to send for Chamberlain to Hawarden. On October 7th Chamberlain
    wrote:
    
    '"Hawarden Castle.
    
    '"My Dear Dilke,
    
    '"I was sent for here, but up to now I do not know why.... My present
    object is to say that you made a capital speech, and that I approve
    every word of it except the part about London Government. But as to
    this I suppose that Londoners must have their way and their own form
of municipal government though I doubt if it will not prove a fatal
gift.

Why will the papers invent differences between you and me? I verily believe that if I spoke your speech,
and you spoke mine, they would still find the distinguishing characteristics
of each speaker unchanged.

I thought your last part admirable and just what I should have said. Yet the Standard thinks it
quite a different note to the South London and Bradford speeches. Mr. G. thinks Mr. Parnell's
last speech more satisfactory I confess I had not perceived the improvement. He (Mr. G.) is still
very sweet on National Councils."

'On October 9th Chamberlain wrote:

'"I am not quite certain what was Mr. G.'s object in sending for me. I suppose he desired to minimize
our conditions as far as possible.

He was very pleasant and very well, with no apparent trace of his
hoarseness.

                He spoke at considerable length on the Irish Question; said he was
more than ever impressed with the advantages of the Central Council
scheme, and had written strongly to that effect to Hartington.

    But I do not gather that he has any definite plan under present circumstances.
    He thought Parnell's last speech was more moderate (I confess I do
not agree with him), and I suppose that if we get a majority his first
effort will be to find a modus vivendi, and to enter into direct communications
with this object.

              

    
    '"As regards Radical programme I stuck to the terms of your speech,
    namely, first, compulsory powers for acquiring land to be inserted
in the Local Government Bill.

    Second, freedom to speak and vote as we liked on questions of free
    schools. He boggled a good deal over this, and said it was very weakening
    to a Government; but I told him we could not honestly do less, and
that I expected a large majority of Liberals were in favour of the
proposal.

    We did not come to any positive conclusion, nor do I think
    that he has absolutely made up his mind, but the tone of the conversation
implied that he was seeking to work with us, and had no idea of doing
without us.

    At the close he spoke of his intention to give up the leadership soon
    after the new Parliament met.

    I protested, and said that if he did this our whole attitude would
be changed, and we must and should ask from Hartington much larger
concessions than we were prepared to accept from him.

                         I expect the force of circumstances will keep him in his place till
the end, though I believe he is sincerely anxious to be free."' [Footnote:
Mr. Gladstone's account of this interview is to be found in Morley's
Life of Gladstone, vol. iii., p. 224.]

On October 17th Chamberlain
wrote 'on another letter of Mr. Gladstone's, which I do not possess:

'"I
do not think it is wise to do anything about Mr G.'s letter on Ireland.

    I agree with your recollection of the matter. But Mr. G. is not far wrong,
    and we have our hands full of other things. The Irish business is not
    the first just now."

                         

'About this time I was taken as arbitrator in a considerable number
of disputed candidatures, in most of which I acted by myself, and
in one, the Walworth case, with Chamberlain and John Morley.'

'I
had been to see Manning, at his wish, with my wife, and he had spoken
kindly about Chamberlain, on which I wrote to Chamberlain about him;
and Chamberlain replied:

'"Our experience in the Irish Question has
not been encouraging.

We understood the Cardinal cordially to approve of my scheme of National
Councils and to be ready to use his influence in any way to promote
its acceptance.

On our part we were prepared to press the question at any sacrifice, and to make the adoption
of our scheme a condition of our membership of any future Government. And yet, when the time came
to ask the Cardinal for his help, he refused categorically so small a matter as an introduction
to the Irish Bishops, and, as I understood, on the ground that the Conservatives were in office.
Would not the same influence prevail in the matter of education? Besides, I do not see what
Cardinal Manning has to offer. The majority of English Catholics are Conservative, and no
concession that it is in our power to make would secure their support for the Liberal party. I am therefore
of opinion that the differences between us can only be decided by
the constituencies."

'The Cardinal wrote concerning Chamberlain:

    '"Mr. Chamberlain was good enough to send me his scheme for Local Government
    in Ireland, in which in the main I agree, and did all in my power
    to promote its acceptance. The Government went out, and you asked of
    me to promote what I called a 'Midlothian in Ireland,' under the
    eyes of the new Lord Lieutenant. (I wrote on this to Chamberlain: 'I
    answered this at the time and have done so again now.') Did
    Mr. Chamberlain understand my agreement with his scheme as carrying
    any consequences beyond that scheme or any solidarity in such an aggressive
    action against any party whatsoever in power?... In the matter in
    which he was courteous enough to make known his scheme to me, I have
    promoted it where and in ways he does not know."
    
    'In a day or two there came another letter from Manning:
    

    '"It is true you did disclaim a Midlothian; but I told you that I know
    my Irishmen too well, and believe that even Paul and Barnabas would
    have been carried away.

    Moreover, if you had been silent as fishes, the moral effect would
    have been a counter-move. Your humility does not admit this. So you
    must absolve me for my one word."'

    
    Mr. Chamberlain commented in strong terms on the diplomatic methods
    of the great ecclesiastic. The 'countermove' implied that there had
    been a Tory move in the direction of Home Rule with a view to securing
    Irish support. Manning believed, as Mr. Gladstone also believed,
    that the Tories meant business; later it became clear that they had
    no constructive Irish policy at all. Yet the question grew daily more
    pressing.

    
    'At the end of October Chamberlain wrote:
    
    '"I had a note from Mr. G. this morning urging unity, and saying he
    had an instinct that Irish questions 'might elbow out all others.'
    This makes me uneasy. I hear from another source that he is trying
    to get Parnell's ideas in detail.

    It is no use."'
    
    To Mr. Gladstone, Chamberlain wrote, on October 26th, that he could
not see his way at all about Ireland.

    He emphasized his view that Ireland had better go altogether than
the responsibilities of a nominal union be accepted, and that probably
the majority of Liberals would not give more than English Local Government;
and that, if possible, Irish and English Local Government should be
dealt with together.

    Unless the principle of the acquisition of land by local authorities
was accepted, neither he nor Dilke nor Morley, nor probably Lefevre,
could join the Government.

    
    

    The strife between Chamberlain and Hartington was maintained, and
Mr. Gladstone interposed by a letter to the Chief Whip, in which he
advised the intervention of Lord Granville in view of 'his great tact,
prudence, and experience.' On November 5th Mr. Chamberlain wrote to
Sir Charles, enclosing Mr. Gladstone's letter, and adding:

'Mr. G.'s
is the most definite proof I have had yet that he does not mean to
quarrel with us.

    Lord Granville has just been here. He told me nothing about Ireland,
    but I am convinced that Mr. Gladstone has been trying to make a treaty
all to himself.

    It must fail.'
                                       

No such treaty was made, and on the eve of the General Election of November, 1885, Parnell issued
an instruction that the Irish in England should vote Tory.

'On Tuesday, November 24th, our poll took place in Chelsea, and on
Wednesday, November 25th, the count, which showed that I was returned,
although only by a small majority.... The Irish had voted for Whitmore,
the Conservative candidate, my opponent, in consequence of the issue
at the last moment of the bill, "Mr. Parnell's order--Vote for the
Conservative, Mr. Whitmore.

Irishmen, do your duty and obey your leader."'

'I had been summoned by Chamberlain, who desired a meeting of our
party within the party, in a letter in which he said:

'"It does not
look as if the Tories would have the chance of doing much mischief;
but I should much like them to be in for a couple of years before
we try again, and then I should 'go for the Church.'"'

Dilke notes
that Chamberlain was persuaded to drop this line of attack, on which
he had already embarked.

Disestablishment of the Church of England had proved to be anything
but a good election cry; the ransom doctrine had not brought in more
votes than it lost; and the 366 certain Liberal seats with twenty-six
doubtful ones which Mr. Schnadhorst counted up at the end of October
were now an illusion of the past.

The election was generally taken as a set-back to the extreme Radicals.

'On

Saturday, December 5th, we met at Highbury, and remained in council
until Monday, December 7th.

 He had no other duty to perform.

Whatever else may be said of this kind of doctrine, it is at least original and has a conclusive
sound. Mark Twain had very little use for orthodoxy and conservatism. When it was announced
that Dr. Jacques Loeb, of the University of California, had demonstrated the creation of life
by chemical agencies he was deeply interested. When a newspaper writer commented that a "consensus
of opinion among biologists" would probably rate Dr. Loeb as a man of lively imagination rather
than an inerrant investigator of natural phenomena, he felt called to chaff the consensus idea.

    I wish I could be as young as that again. Although I seem so old
    now I was once as young as that. I remember, as if it were but
    thirty or forty years ago, how a paralyzing consensus of opinion
    accumulated from experts a-setting around about brother experts who
    had patiently and laboriously cold-chiseled their way into one or
    another of nature's safe-deposit vaults and were reporting that they
    had found something valuable was plenty for me. It settled it.

    But it isn't so now-no. Because in the drift of the years I by and
    by found out that a Consensus examines a new thing with its feelings
    rather oftener than with its mind.

    There was that primitive steam-engine-ages back, in Greek times: a
    Consensus made fun of it. There was the Marquis of Worcester's
    steam-engine 250 years ago: a Consensus made fun of it. There was
    Fulton's steamboat of a century ago: a French Consensus, including
    the great Napoleon, made fun of it. There was Priestley, with his
    oxygen: a Consensus scoffed at him, mobbed him, burned him out,
    banished him. While a Consensus was proving, by statistics and
    things, that a steamship could not cross the Atlantic, a steamship
    did it.

And so on through a dozen pages or more of lively satire, ending with an extract from Adam's Diary.

    Then there was a Consensus about it. It was the very first one. It
    sat six days and nights. It was then delivered of the verdict that
    a world could not be made out of nothing; that such small things as
    sun and moon and stars might, maybe, but it would take years and
    years if there was considerable many of them. Then the Consensus
    got up and looked out of the window, and there was the whole outfit,
    spinning and sparkling in space! You never saw such a disappointed
    lot.
                                        ADAM.

He was writing much at this time, mainly for his own amusement, though now and then he offered
one of his reflections for print. That beautiful fairy tale, "The Five Boons of Life," of which
the most precious is "Death," was written at this period. Maeterlinck's lovely story of the
bee interested him; he wrote about that. Somebody proposed a Martyrs' Day; he wrote a paper
ridiculing the suggestion. In his note-book, too, there is a memorandum for a love-story of
the Quarternary Epoch which would begin, "On a soft October afternoon 2,000,000 years ago."
John Fiske's Discovery of America, Volume I, he said, was to furnish the animals and scenery,
civilization and conversation to be the same as to-day; but apparently this idea was carried
no further. He ranged through every subject from protoplasm to infinity, exalting, condemning,
ridiculing, explaining; his brain was always busy--a dynamo that rested neither night nor day.

In April Clemens received notice of another yachting trip on the Kanawha, which this time would
sail for the Bahama and West India islands. The guests were to be about the same.--[The invited
ones of the party were Hon. T. B. Reed, A. G. Paine, Laurence Hutton, Dr. C. C. Rice, W. T.
Foote, and S. L. Clemens. "Owners of the yacht," Mr. Rogers called them, signing himself as
"Their Guest."]

He sent this telegram:

H. H. ROGERS, Fairhaven, Mass.

Can't get away this week. I have company here from tonight till middle
of next week. Will Kanawha be sailing after that & can I go as
Sunday-school superintendent at half rate? Answer and prepay.
                                       DR. CLEMENS.

The sailing date was conveniently arranged and there followed a happy cruise among those balmy
islands. Mark Twain was particularly fond of "Tom" Reed, who had been known as "Czar" Reed
in Congress, but was delightfully human in his personal life. They argued politics a good deal,
and Reed, with all his training and intimate practical knowledge of the subject, confessed
that he "couldn't argue with a man like that."

"Do you believe the things you say?" he asked once, in his thin, falsetto voice.

"Yes," said Clemens. "Some of them."

"Well, you want to look out. If you go on this way, by and by you'll get to believing nearly
everything you say."

Draw poker appears to have been their favorite diversion. Clemens in his notes reports that
off the coast of Florida Reed won twenty-three pots in succession. It was said afterward that
they made no stops at any harbor; that when the chief officer approached the poker-table and
told them they were about to enter some important port he received peremptory orders to "sail
on and not interrupt the game." This, however, may be regarded as more or less founded on fiction.

MARK TWAIN AND THE PHILIPPINES

Among the completed manuscripts of the early part of 1902 was a North American Review article
(published in April)--"Does the Race of Man Love a Lord?"--a most interesting treatise on snobbery
as a universal weakness. There were also some papers on the Philippine situation. In one of
these Clemens wrote:

    We have bought some islands from a party who did not own them; with
    real smartness and a good counterfeit of disinterested friendliness
    we coaxed a confiding weak nation into a trap and closed it upon
    them; we went back on an honored guest of the Stars and Stripes when
    we had no further use for him and chased him to the mountains; we
    are as indisputably in possession of a wide-spreading archipelago as
    if it were our property; we have pacified some thousands of the
    islanders and buried them; destroyed their fields; burned their
    villages, and turned their widows and orphans out-of-doors;
    furnished heartbreak by exile to some dozens of disagreeable
    patriots; subjugated the remaining ten millions by Benevolent
    Assimilation, which is the pious new name of the musket; we have
    acquired property in the three hundred concubines and other slaves
    of our business partner, the Sultan of Sulu, and hoisted our
    protecting flag over that swag.

    And so, by these Providences of God--the phrase is the government's,
    not mine--we are a World Power; and are glad and proud, and have a
    back seat in the family. With tacks in it. At least we are letting
    on to be glad and proud; it is the best way. Indeed, it is the only
    way. We must maintain our dignity, for people are looking. We are
    a World Power; we cannot get out of it now, and we must make the
    best of it.

And again he wrote:

    I am not finding fault with this use of our flag, for in order not
    to seem eccentric I have swung around now and joined the nation in
    the conviction that nothing can sully a flag. I was not properly
    reared, and had the illusion that a flag was a thing which must be
    sacredly guarded against shameful uses and unclean contacts lest it
    suffer pollution; and so when it was sent out to the Philippines to
    float over a wanton war and a robbing expedition I supposed it was
    polluted, and in an ignorant moment I said so. But I stand
    corrected. I concede and acknowledge that it was only the
    government that sent it on such an errand that was polluted. Let us
    compromise on that. I am glad to have it that way. For our flag
    could not well stand pollution, never having been used to it, but it
    is different with the administration.

But a much more conspicuous comment on the Philippine policy was the so-called "Defense of
General Funston" for what Funston himself referred to as a "dirty Irish trick"; that is to
say, deception in the capture of Aguinaldo. Clemens, who found it hard enough to reconcile
himself to-any form of warfare, was especially bitter concerning this particular campaign.
The article appeared in the North American Review for May, 1902, and stirred up a good deal
of a storm. He wrote much more on the subject--very much more--but it is still unpublished.

THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE

One day in April, 1902, Samuel Clemens received the following letter from the president of
the University of Missouri:

MY DEAR MR. CLEMENS, Although you received the degree of doctor of literature last fall from
Yale, and have had other honors conferred upon you by other great universities, we want to
adopt you here as a son of the University of Missouri. In asking your permission to confer
upon you the degree of LL.D. the University of Missouri does not aim to confer an honor upon
you so much as to show her appreciation of you. The rules of the University forbid us to confer
the degree upon any one in absentia. I hope very much that you can so arrange your plans as
to be with us on the fourth day of next June, when we shall hold our Annual Commencement.

                     Very truly yours,
                            R. H. JESSE.

Clemens had not expected to make another trip to the West, but a proffered honor such as this
from one's native State was not a thing to be declined.

It was at the end of May when he arrived in St. Louis, and he was met at the train there by
his old river instructor and friend, Horace Bixby--as fresh, wiry, and capable as he had been
forty-five years before.

"I have become an old man. You are still thirty-five," Clemens said.

They went to the Planters Hotel, and the news presently got around that Mark Twain was there.
There followed a sort of reception in the hotel lobby, after which Bixby took him across to
the rooms of the Pilots Association, where the rivermen gathered in force to celebrate his
return. A few of his old comrades were still alive, among them Beck Jolly. The same afternoon
he took the train for Hannibal.

It was a busy five days that he had in Hannibal. High-school commencement day came first. He
attended, and willingly, or at least patiently, sat through the various recitals and orations
and orchestrations, dreaming and remembering, no doubt, other high-school commencements of
more than half a century before, seeing in some of those young people the boys and girls he
had known in that vanished time. A few friends of his youth were still there, but they were
among the audience now, and no longer fresh and looking into the future. Their heads were white,
and, like him, they were looking down the recorded years. Laura Hawkins was there and Helen
Kercheval (Mrs. Frazer and Mrs. Garth now), and there were others, but they were few and scattering.

He was added to the program, and he made himself as one of the graduates, and told them some
things of the young people of that earlier time that brought their laughter and their tears.

He was asked to distribute the diplomas, and he undertook the work in his own way. He took
an armful of them and said to the graduates:

"Take one. Pick out a good one. Don't take two, but be sure you get a good one."

So each took one "unsight and unseen" aid made the more exact distributions among themselves later.

Next morning it was Saturday--he visited the old home on Hill Street, and stood in the doorway
all dressed in white while a battalion of photographers made pictures of "this return of the
native" to the threshold of his youth.

He went through the rooms and up-stairs where he had slept and looked out the window down in
the back yard where, nearly sixty years before, Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn, Joe Harper, and the
rest--that is to say, Tom Blankenship, John Briggs, Will Pitts, and the Bowen boys--set out
on their nightly escapades. Of that lightsome band Will Pitts and John Briggs still remained,
with half a dozen others--schoolmates of the less adventurous sort. And while these were assembled
in a little group on the pavement outside the home a small old man came up and put out his
hand, and it was Jimmy MacDaniel, to whom so long before, sitting on the river-bank and eating
gingerbread, he had first told the story of Jim Wolfe and the cats.

They put him into a carriage, drove him far and wide, and showed the hills and resorts and
rendezvous of Tom Sawyer and his marauding band.

He was entertained that evening by the Labinnah Club (whose name was achieved by a backward
spelling of Hannibal), where he found most of the survivors of his youth. The news report of
that occasion states that he was introduced by Father McLoughlin, and that he "responded in
a very humorous and touchingly pathetic way, breaking down in tears at the conclusion. Commenting
on his boyhood days and referring to his mother was too much for the great humorist. Before
him as he spoke were sitting seven of his boyhood friends."

On Sunday morning Col. John Robards escorted him to the various churches and Sunday-schools.
They were all new churches to Samuel Clemens, but he pretended not to recognize this fact.
In each one he was asked to speak a few words, and he began by saying how good it was to be
back in the old home Sunday-school again, which as a boy he had always so loved, and he would
go on and point out the very place he had sat, and his escort hardly knew whether or not to
enjoy the proceedings. At one place he told a moral story. He said:

Little boys and girls, I want to tell you a story which illustrates the value of perseverance--of
sticking to your work, as it were. It is a story very proper for a Sunday-school. When I was
a little boy in Hannibal I used to play a good deal up here on Holliday's Hill, which of course
you all know. John Briggs and I played up there. I don't suppose there are any little boys
as good as we were then, but of course that is not to be expected. Little boys in those days
were 'most always good little boys, because those were the good old times when everything was
better than it is now, but never mind that. Well, once upon a time, on Holliday's Hill, they
were blasting out rock, and a man was drilling for a blast. He sat there and drilled and drilled
and drilled perseveringly until he had a hole down deep enough for the blast. Then he put in
the powder and tamped and tamped it down, but maybe he tamped it a little too hard, for the
blast went off and he went up into the air, and we watched him. He went up higher and higher
and got smaller and smaller. First he looked as big as a child, then as big as a dog, then
as big as a kitten, then as big as a bird, and finally he went out of sight. John Briggs was
with me, and we watched the place where he went out of sight, and by and by we saw him coming
down first as big as a bird, then as big as a kitten, then as big as a dog, then as big as
a child, and then he was a man again, and landed right in his seat and went to drilling just
persevering, you see, and sticking to his work. Little boys and girls, that's the secret of
success, just like that poor but honest workman on Holliday's Hill. Of course you won't always
be appreciated. He wasn't. His employer was a hard man, and on Saturday night when he paid
him he docked him fifteen minutes for the time he was up in the air--but never mind, he had
his reward.

He told all this in his solemn, grave way, though the Sunday-school was in a storm of enjoyment
when he finished. There still remains a doubt in Hannibal as to its perfect suitability, but
there is no doubt as to its acceptability. It was jest such a Sunday as that one when they
had so nearly demolished the negro driver and had damaged a cooper-shop. They calculated that
nearly three thousand Sundays had passed since then, and now here they were once more, two
old men with the hills still fresh and green, the river still sweeping by and rippling in the sun.

They came to the place where they had pried out the great rock that had so nearly brought them
to grief. Sam Clemens said:

"John, if we had killed that man we'd have had a dead nigger on our hands without a cent to
pay for him." We were like brothers once, and I feel that we are the same now. Good-by, John.
I'll try to meet you--somewhere."

CCXXII

A PROPHET HONORED IN HIS COUNTRY

Clemens left next day for Columbia. Committees met him at Rensselaer, Monroe City, Clapper,
Stoutsville, Paris, Madison, Moberly--at every station along the line of his travel. At each
place crowds were gathered when the train pulled in, to cheer and wave and to present him with
flowers. Sometimes he spoke a few words; but oftener his eyes were full of tears--his voice
would not come.

There is something essentially dramatic in official recognition by one's native State--the
return of the lad who has set out unknown to battle with life, and who, having conquered, is
invited back to be crowned. No other honor, however great and spectacular, is quite like that,
for there is in it a pathos and a completeness that are elemental and stir emotions as old
as life itself.

It was on the 4th of June, 1902, that Mark Twain received his doctor of laws degree from the
State University at Columbia, Missouri. James Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture, and Ethan Allen
Hitchcock, Secretary of the Interior, were among those similarly honored. Mark Twain was naturally
the chief attraction. Dressed in his Yale scholastic gown he led the procession of graduating
students, and, as in Hannibal, awarded them their diplomas. The regular exercises were made
purposely brief in order that some time might be allowed for the conferring of the degrees.
This ceremony was a peculiarly impressive one. Gardner Lathrop read a brief statement introducing
"America's foremost author and best-loved citizen, Samuel Langhorne Clemens--Mark Twain."

Clemens rose, stepped out to the center of the stage, and paused. He seemed to be in doubt
as to whether he should make a speech or simply express his thanks and retire. It was dramatic;
it was tremendous in its impressiveness. He had recovered himself when they finished. He said
he didn't know whether he was expected to make a speech or not. They did not leave him in doubt.
They cheered and demanded a speech, a speech, and he made them one--one of the speeches he
could make best, full of quaint phrasing, happy humor, gentle and dramatic pathos. He closed
by telling the watermelon story for its "moral effect."

He was the guest of E. W. Stevens in Columbia, and a dinner was given in his honor. They would
have liked to keep him longer, but he was due in St. Louis again to join in the dedication
of the grounds, where was to be held a World's Fair, to celebrate the Louisiana Purchase. Another
ceremony he attended was the christening of the St. Louis harbor-boat, or rather the rechristening,
for it had been decided to change its name from the St. Louis--[Originally the Elon G. Smith,
built in 1873.]--to the Mark Twain. A short trip was made on it for the ceremony. Governor
Francis and Mayor Wells were of the party, and Count and Countess Rochambeau and Marquis de
Lafayette, with the rest of the French group that had come over for the dedication of the World's
Fair grounds.

Mark Twain himself was invited to pilot the harbor boat, and so returned for the last time
to his old place at the wheel. They all collected in the pilot-house behind him, feeling that
it was a memorable occasion. They were going along well enough when he saw a little ripple
running out from the shore across the bow. In the old days he could have told whether it indicated
a bar there or was only caused by the wind, but he could not be sure any more. Turning to the
pilot languidly, he said: "I feel a little tired. I guess you had better take the wheel."

Luncheon was served aboard, and Mayor Wells made the christening speech; then the Countess
Rochambeau took a bottle of champagne from the hand of Governor Francis and smashed it on the
deck, saying, "I christen thee, good boat, Mark Twain." So it was, the Mississippi joined in
according him honors. In his speech of reply he paid tribute to those illustrious visitors
from France and recounted something of the story of French exploration along that great river.

"The name of La Salle will last as long as the river itself," he said; "will last until commerce
is dead. We have allowed the commerce of the river to die, but it was to accommodate the railroads,
and we must be grateful."

Carriages were waiting for them when the boat landed in the afternoon, and the party got in
and were driven to a house which had been identified as Eugene Field's birthplace. A bronze
tablet recording this fact had been installed, and this was to be the unveiling. The place
was not in an inviting quarter of the town. It stood in what is known as Walsh's Row--was fashionable
enough once, perhaps, but long since fallen into disrepute. Ragged children played in the doorways,
and thirsty lodgers were making trips with tin pails to convenient bar-rooms. A curious nondescript
audience assembled around the little group of dedicators, wondering what it was all about.
The tablet was concealed by the American flag, which could be easily pulled away by an attached
cord. Governor Francis spoke a few words, to the effect that they had gathered here to unveil
a tablet to an American poet, and that it was fitting that Mark Twain should do this. They
removed their hats, and Clemens, his white hair blowing in the wind, said:

"My friends; we are here with reverence and respect to commemorate and enshrine in memory the
house where was born a man who, by his life, made bright the lives of all who knew him, and
by his literary efforts cheered the thoughts of thousands who never knew him. I take pleasure
in unveiling the tablet of Eugene Field."

The flag fell and the bronze inscription was revealed. By this time the crowd, generally, had
recognized who it was that was speaking. A working-man proposed three cheers for Mark Twain,
and they were heartily given. Then the little party drove away, while the neighborhood collected
to regard the old house with a new interest.

It was reported to Clemens later that there was some dispute as to the identity of the Field
birthplace. He said:

"Never mind. It is of no real consequence whether it is his birthplace or not. A rose in any
other garden will bloom as sweet."

CCXXIII

AT YORK HARBOR

They decided to spend the summer at York Harbor, Maine. They engaged a cottage, there, and
about the end of June Mr. Rogers brought his yacht Kanawha to their water-front at Riverdale,
and in perfect weather took them to Maine by sea. They landed at York Harbor and took possession
of their cottage, The Pines, one of their many attractive summer lodges. Howells, at Kittery
Point, was not far away, and everything promised a happy summer.

Mrs. Clemens wrote to Mrs. Crane:

    We are in the midst of pines. They come up right about us, and the
    house is so high and the roots of the trees are so far below the
    veranda that we are right in the branches. We drove over to call on
    Mr. and Mrs. Howells. The drive was most beautiful, and never in my
    life have I seen such a variety of wild flowers in so short a space.

Howells tells us of the wide, low cottage in a pine grove overlooking York River, and how he
used to sit with Clemens that summer at a corner of the veranda farthest away from Mrs. Clemens's
window, where they could read their manuscripts to each other, and tell their stories and laugh
their hearts out without disturbing her.

Clemens, as was his habit, had taken a work-room in a separate cottage "in the house of a friend
and neighbor, a fisherman and a boatman":

    There was a table where he could write, and a bed where he could lie
    down and read; and there, unless my memory has played me one of
    those constructive tricks that people's memories indulge in, he read
    me the first chapters of an admirable story. The scene was laid in
    a Missouri town, and the characters such as he had known in boyhood;
    but often as I tried to make him own it, he denied having written
    any such story; it is possible that I dreamed it, but I hope the MS.
    will yet be found.

Howells did not dream it; but in one way his memory misled him. The story was one which Clemens
had heard in Hannibal, and he doubtless related it in his vivid way. Howells, writing at a
later time, quite naturally included it among the several manuscripts which Clemens read aloud
to him. Clemens may have intended to write the tale, may even have begun it, though this is
unlikely. The incidents were too well known and too notorious in his old home for fiction.

Among the stories that Clemens did show, or read, to Howells that summer was "The Belated Passport,"
a strong, intensely interesting story with what Howells in a letter calls a "goat's tail ending,"
perhaps meaning that it stopped with a brief and sudden shake--with a joke, in fact, altogether
unimportant, and on the whole disappointing to the reader. A far more notable literary work
of that summer grew out of a true incident which Howells related to Clemens as they sat chatting
together on the veranda overlooking the river one summer afternoon. It was a pathetic episode
in the life of some former occupants of The Pines--the tale of a double illness in the household,
where a righteous deception was carried on during several weeks for the benefit of a life that
was about to slip away. Out of this grew the story, "Was it Heaven? or Hell?" a heartbreaking
history which probes the very depths of the human soul. Next to "Hadleyburg," it is Mark Twain's
greatest fictional sermon.

Clemens that summer wrote, or rather finished, his most pretentious poem. One day at Riverdale,
when Mrs. Clemens had been with him on the lawn, they had remembered together the time when
their family of little folks had filled their lives so full, conjuring up dream-like glimpses
of them in the years of play and short frocks and hair-plaits down their backs. It was pathetic,
heart-wringing fancying; and later in the day Clemens conceived and began the poem which now
he brought to conclusion. It was built on the idea of a mother who imagines her dead child
still living, and describes to any listener the pictures of her fancy. It is an impressive
piece of work; but the author, for some reason, did not offer it for publication.--[This poem
was completed on the anniversary of Susy's death and is of considerable length. Some selections
from it will be found under Appendix U, at the end of this work.]

Mrs. Clemens, whose health earlier in the year had been delicate, became very seriously ill
at York Harbor. Howells writes:

At first she had been about the house, and there was one gentle afternoon when she made tea
for us in the parlor, but that was the last time I spoke with her. After that it was really
a question of how soonest and easiest she could be got back to Riverdale.

She had seemed to be in fairly good health and spirits for several weeks after the arrival
at York. Then, early in August, there came a great celebration of some municipal anniversary,
and for two or three days there were processions, mass-meetings, and so on by day, with fireworks
at night. Mrs. Clemens, always young in spirit, was greatly interested. She went about more
than her strength warranted, seeing and hearing and enjoying all that was going on. She was
finally persuaded to forego the remaining ceremonies and rest quietly on the pleasant veranda
at home; but she had overtaxed herself and a collapse was inevitable. Howells and two friends
called one afternoon, and a friend of the Queen of Rumania, a Madame Hartwig, who had brought
from that gracious sovereign a letter which closed in this simple and modest fashion:

    I beg your pardon for being a bore to one I so deeply love and
    admire, to whom I owe days and days of forgetfulness of self and
    troubles, and the intensest of all joys-hero-worship! People don't
    always realize what a happiness that is! God bless you for every
    beautiful thought you poured into my tired heart, and for every
    smile on a weary way.                CARMEN SYLVA.

This was the occasion mentioned by Howells when Mrs. Clemens made tea for them in the parlor
for the last time. Her social life may be said to have ended that afternoon. Next morning the
break came. Clemens, in his notebook for that day, writes:

Tuesday, August 12, 1902. At 7 A.M. Livy taken violently ill. Telephoned and Dr. Lambert was
here in 1/2 hour. She could not breathe-was likely to stifle. Also she had severe palpitation.
She believed she was dying. I also believed it.

Nurses were summoned, and Mrs. Crane and others came from Elmira. Clara Clemens took charge
of the household and matters generally, and the patient was secluded and guarded from every
disturbing influence. Clemens slipped about with warnings of silence. A visitor found notices
in Mark Twain's writing pinned to the trees near Mrs. Clemens's window warning the birds not
to sing too loudly.

The patient rallied, but she remained very much debilitated. On September 3d the note-book says:

    Always Mr. Rogers keeps his yacht Kanawha in commission & ready to
    fly here and take us to Riverdale on telegraphic notice.

But Mrs. Clemens was unable to return by sea. When it was decided at last, in October, that
she could be removed to Riverdale, Clemens and Howells went to Boston and engaged an invalid
car to make the journey from York Harbor to Riverdale without change. Howells tells us that
Clemens gave his strictest personal attention to the arrangement of these details, and that
they absorbed him.

    There was no particular of the business which he did not scrutinize
    and master . . . . With the inertness that grows upon an aging
    man he had been used to delegate more and more things, but of that
    thing I perceived that he would not delegate the least detail.

They made the journey on the 16th, in nine and a half hours. With the
exception of the natural weariness due to such a trip, the invalid was
apparently no worse on their arrival. The stout English butler carried
her to her room. It would be many months before she would leave it
again. We did not know how to value it. We
    know now.

And in a notation, on a letter praising him for what he had done for the world's enjoyment,
and for his splendid triumph over debt, he said:

    Livy never gets her share of these applauses, but it is because the
    people do not know. Yet she is entitled to the lion's share.

He wrote Twichell at the end of October:

    Livy drags along drearily. It must be hard times for that turbulent
    spirit. It will be a long time before she is on her feet again. It
    is a most pathetic case. I wish I could transfer it to myself.
    Between ripping & raging & smoking & reading I could get a good deal
    of holiday out of it. Clara runs the house smoothly & capitally.

Heavy as was the cloud of illness, he could not help pestering Twichell a little about a recent
mishap--a sprained shoulder:

    I should like to know how & where it happened. In the pulpit, as
    like as not, otherwise you would not be taking so much pains to
    conceal it. This is not a malicious suggestion, & not a personally
    invented one: you told me yourself once that you threw artificial
    power & impressiveness in your sermons where needed by "banging the
    Bible"--(your own words). You have reached a time of life when it
    is not wise to take these risks. You would better jump around. We
    all have to change our methods as the infirmities of age creep upon
    us. Jumping around will be impressive now, whereas before you were
    gray it would have excited remark.

Mrs. Clemens seemed to improve as the weeks passed, and they had great hopes of her complete
recovery. Clemens took up some work--a new Huck Finn story, inspired by his trip to Hannibal.
It was to have two parts --Huck and Tom in youth, and then their return in old age. He did
some chapters quite in the old vein, and wrote to Howells of his plan. Howells answered:

    It is a great lay-out: what I shall enjoy most will be the return of
    the old fellows to the scene and their tall lying. There is a
    matchless chance there. I suppose you will put in plenty of pegs in
    this prefatory part.

But the new story did not reach completion. Huck and Tom would not come back, even to go over
the old scenes.

CCXXIV

THE SIXTY-SEVENTH BIRTHDAY DINNER

It was on the evening of the 27th of November, 1902, I at the Metropolitan Club, New York City,
that Col. George Harvey, president of the Harper Company, gave Mark Twain a dinner in celebration
of his sixty-seventh birthday. The actual date fell three days later; but that would bring
it on Sunday, and to give it on Saturday night would be more than likely to carry it into Sabbath
morning, and so the 27th was chosen. Colonel Harvey himself presided, and Howells led the speakers
with a poem, "A Double-Barreled Sonnet to Mark Twain," which closed:

       Still, to have everything beyond cavil right,
       We will dine with you here till Sunday night.

Thomas Brackett Reed followed with what proved to be the last speech he would ever make, as
it was also one of his best. All the speakers did well that night, and they included some of
the country's foremost in oratory: Chauncey Depew, St. Clair McKelway, Hamilton Mabie, and
Wayne MacVeagh. Dr. Henry van Dyke and John Kendrick Bangs read poems. The chairman constantly
kept the occasion from becoming too serious by maintaining an attitude of "thinking ambassador"
for the guest of the evening, gently pushing Clemens back in his seat when he attempted to
rise and expressing for him an opinion of each of the various tributes.

"The limit has been reached," he announced at the close of Dr. van Dyke's poem. "More that
is better could not be said. Gentlemen, Mr. Clemens."

It is seldom that Mark Twain has made a better after-dinner speech than he delivered then.
He was surrounded by some of the best minds of the nation, men assembled to do him honor. They
expected much of him--to Mark Twain always an inspiring circumstance. He was greeted with cheers
and hand-clapping that came volley after volley, and seemed never ready to end. When it had
died away at last he stood waiting a little in the stillness for his voice; then he said, "I
think I ought to be allowed to talk as long as I want to," and again the storm broke.

It is a speech not easy to abridge--a finished and perfect piece of after-dinner eloquence,--[The
"Sixty-seventh Birthday Speech" entire is included in the volume Mark Twain's Speeches.]--full
of humorous stories and moving references to old friends--to Hay; and Reed, and Twichell, and
Howells, and Rogers, the friends he had known so long and loved so well. He told of his recent
trip to his boyhood home, and how he had stood with John Briggs on Holliday's Hill and they
had pointed out the haunts of their youth. Then at the end he paid a tribute to the companion
of his home, who could not be there to share his evening's triumph.

The sixty-seventh birthday dinner was widely celebrated by the press, and newspaper men generally
took occasion to pay brilliant compliments to Mark Twain. Arthur Brisbane wrote editorially:

    For more than a generation he has been the Messiah of a genuine
    gladness and joy to the millions of three continents.

It was little more than a week later that one of the old friends he had mentioned, Thomas Brackett
Reed, apparently well and strong that birthday evening, passed from the things of this world.
Clemens felt his death keenly, and in a "good-by" which he wrote for Harper's Weekly he said:

    His was a nature which invited affection--compelled it, in fact--and
    met it half-way. Hence, he was "Tom" to the most of his friends and
    to half of the nation . . . .

    I cannot remember back to a time when he was not "Tom" Reed to me,
    nor to a time when he could have been offended at being so addressed
    by me. I cannot remember back to a time when I could let him alone
    in an after-dinner speech if he was present, nor to a time when he
    did not take my extravagance concerning him and misstatements about
    him in good part, nor yet to a time when he did not pay them back
    with usury when his turn came. The last speech he made was at my
    birthday dinner at the end of November, when naturally I was his
    text; my last word to him was in a letter the next day; a day later
    I was illustrating a fantastic article on art with his portrait
    among others--a portrait now to be laid reverently away among the
    jests that begin in humor and end in pathos. These things happened
    only eight days ago, and now he is gone from us, and the nation is
    speaking of him as one who was. It seems incredible, impossible.
    Such a man, such a friend, seems to us a permanent possession; his
    vanishing from our midst is unthinkable, as was the vanishing of the
    Campanile, that had stood for a thousand years and was turned to
    dust in a moment.

The appreciation closes:

    I have only wished to say how fine and beautiful was his life and
    character, and to take him by the hand and say good-by, as to a
    fortunate friend who has done well his work and gees a pleasant
    journey.

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE CONTROVERSIES

The North American Review for December (1902) contained an instalment of the Christian Science
series which Mark Twain had written in Vienna several years before. He had renewed his interest
in the doctrine, and his admiration for Mrs. Eddy's peculiar abilities and his antagonism toward
her had augmented in the mean time. Howells refers to the "mighty moment when Clemens was building
his engines of war for the destruction of Christian Science, which superstition nobody, and
he least of all, expected to destroy":

    He believed that as a religious machine the Christian Science Church
    was as perfect as the Roman Church, and destined to be more
    formidable in its control of the minds of men . . . .

    An interesting phase of his psychology in this business was not.
    only his admiration for the masterly policy of the Christian Science
    hierarchy, but his willingness to allow the miracles of its healers
    to be tried on his friends and family if they wished it. He had a
    tender heart for the whole generation of empirics, as well as the
    newer sorts of scienticians, but he seemed to base his faith in them
    largely upon the failure of the regulars, rather than upon their own
    successes, which also he believed in. He was recurrently, but not
    insistently, desirous that you should try their strange magics when
    you were going to try the familiar medicines.

Clemens never had any quarrel with the theory of Christian Science or mental healing, or with
any of the empiric practices. He acknowledged good in all of them, and he welcomed most of
them in preference to materia medica. It is true that his animosity for the founder of the
Christian Science cult sometimes seems to lap over and fringe the religion itself; but this
is apparent rather than real. Furthermore, he frequently expressed a deep obligation which
humanity owed to the founder of the faith, in that she had organized a healing element ignorantly
and indifferently employed hitherto. His quarrel with Mrs. Eddy lay in the belief that she
herself, as he expressed it, was "a very unsound Christian Scientist."

    I believe she has a serious malady--self-edification--and that it
    will be well to have one of the experts demonstrate over her.

Necessarily, the forces of Christian Science were aroused by these articles, and there were
various replies, among them, one by the founder herself, a moderate rejoinder in her usual
literary form.

    "Mrs. Eddy in Error," in the North American Review for April, 1903,
    completed what Clemens had to say on the matter for this time.

He was putting together a book on the subject, comprised of his various published papers and
some added chapters. It would not be a large volume, and he offered to let his Christian Science
opponents share it with him, stating their side of the case. Mr. William D. McCrackan, one
of the church's chief advocates, was among those invited to participate. McCrackan and Clemens,
from having begun as enemies, had become quite friendly, and had discussed their differences
face to face at considerable length. Early in the controversy Clemens one night wrote McCrackan
a pretty savage letter. He threw it on the hall table for mailing, but later got out of bed
and slipped down-stairs to get it. It was too late--the letters had been gathered up and mailed.
Next evening a truly Christian note came from McCrackan, returning the hasty letter, which
he said he was sure the writer would wish to recall. Their friendship began there. For some
reason, however, the collaborated volume did not materialize. In the end, publication was delayed
a number of years, by which time Clemens's active interest was a good deal modified, though
the practice itself never failed to invite his attention.

Howells refers to his anti-Christian Science rages, which began with the postponement of the
book, and these Clemens vented at the time in another manuscript entitled, "Eddypus," an imaginary
history of a thousand years hence, when Eddyism should rule the world. By that day its founder
would have become a deity, and the calendar would be changed to accord with her birth. It was
not publishable matter, and really never intended as such. It was just one of the things which
Mark Twain wrote to relieve mental pressure.

"WAS IT HEAVEN? OR HELL?"

The Christmas number of Harper's Magazine for 1902 contained the story, "Was it Heaven? or
Hell?" and it immediately brought a flood of letters to its author from grateful readers on
both sides of the ocean. An Englishman wrote: "I want to thank you for writing so pathetic
and so profoundly true a story"; and an American declared it to be the best short story ever
written. Another letter said:

    I have learned to love those maiden liars--love and weep over them
    --then put them beside Dante's Beatrice in Paradise.

There were plenty of such letters; but there was one of a different sort. It was a letter from
a man who had but recently gone through almost precisely the experience narrated in the tale.
His dead daughter had even borne the same name--Helen. She had died of typhus while her mother
was prostrated with the same malady, and the deception had been maintained in precisely the
same way, even to the fictitiously written letters. Clemens replied to this letter, acknowledging
the striking nature of the coincidence it related, and added that, had he invented the story,
he would have believed it a case of mental telegraphy.

    I was merely telling a true story just as it had been told to me by
    one who well knew the mother and the daughter & all the beautiful &
    pathetic details. I was living in the house where it had happened,
    three years before, & I put it on paper at once while it was fresh
    in my mind, & its pathos still straining at my heartstrings.

Clemens did not guess that the coincidences were not yet complete, that within a month the
drama of the tale would be enacted in his own home. In his note-book, under the date of December
24(1902), he wrote:

    Jean was hit with a chill: Clara was completing her watch in her
    mother's room and there was no one able to force Jean to go to bed.
    As a result she is pretty ill to-day-fever & high temperature.

Three days later he added:

    It was pneumonia. For 5 days jean's temperature ranged between 103
    & 104 2/5, till this morning, when it got down to 101. She looks
    like an escaped survivor of a forest fire. For 6 days now my story
    in the Christmas Harper's "Was it Heaven? or Hell?"--has been
    enacted in this household. Every day Clara & the nurses have lied
    about Jean to her mother, describing the fine times she is having
    outdoors in the winter sports.

That proved a hard, trying winter in the Clemens home, and the burden of it fell chiefly, indeed
almost entirely, upon Clara Clemens. Mrs. Clemens became still more frail, and no other member
of the family, not even her husband, was allowed to see her for longer than the briefest interval.
Yet the patient was all the more anxious to know the news, and daily it had to be prepared--chiefly
invented--for her comfort. In an account which Clemens once set down of the "Siege and Season
of Unveracity," as he called it, he said:

    Clara stood a daily watch of three or four hours, and hers was a
    hard office indeed. Daily she sealed up in her heart a dozen
    dangerous truths, and thus saved her mother's life and hope and
    happiness with holy lies. She had never told her mother a lie in
    her life before, and I may almost say that she never told her a
    truth afterward. It was fortunate for us all that Clara's
    reputation for truthfulness was so well established in her mother's
    mind. It was our daily protection from disaster. The mother never
    doubted Clara's word. Clara could tell her large improbabilities
    without exciting any suspicion, whereas if I tried to market even a
    small and simple one the case would have been different. I was
    never able to get a reputation like Clara's. Mrs. Clemens
    questioned Clara every day concerning Jean's health, spirits,
    clothes, employments, and amusements, and how she was enjoying
    herself; and Clara furnished the information right along in minute
    detail--every word of it false, of course. Every day she had to
    tell how Jean dressed, and in time she got so tired of using Jean's
    existing clothes over and over again, and trying to get new effects
    out of them, that finally, as a relief to her hard-worked invention,
    she got to adding imaginary clothes to Jean's wardrobe, and probably
    would have doubled it and trebled it if a warning note in her
    mother's comments had not admonished her that she was spending more
    money on these spectral gowns and things than the family income
    justified.

Some portions of detailed accounts of Clara's busy days of this period, as written at the time
by Clemens to Twichell and to Mrs. Crane, are eminently worth preserving. To Mrs. Crane:

    Clara does not go to her Monday lesson in New York today [her mother
    having seemed not so well through the night], but forgets that fact
    and enters her mother's room (where she has no business to be)
    toward train-time dressed in a wrapper.

    LIVY. Why, Clara, aren't you going to your lesson?
    CLARA (almost caught). Yes.
    L. In that costume?
    CL. Oh no.
    L. Well, you can't make your train; it's impossible.
    CL. I know, but I'm going to take the other one.
    L. Indeed that won't do--you'll be ever so much too late for
    your lesson.
    CL. No, the lesson-time has been put an hour later.
    L. (satisfied, then suddenly). But, Clara, that train and the late
    lesson together will make you late to Mrs. Hapgood's luncheon.
    CL. No, the train leaves fifteen minutes earlier than it used to.
    L. (satisfied). Tell Mrs. Hapgood, etc., etc., etc. (which Clara
    promises to do). Clara, dear, after the luncheon--I hate to put
    this on you--but could you do two or three little shopping-errands
    for me?
    CL. Oh, it won't trouble me a bit-I can do it. (Takes a list of
    the things she is to buy-a list which she will presently hand to
    another.)

    At 3 or 4 P.M. Clara takes the things brought from New York,
    studies over her part a little, then goes to her mother's room.

    LIVY. It's very good of you, dear. Of course, if I had known it
    was going to be so snowy and drizzly and sloppy I wouldn't have
    asked you to buy them. Did you get wet?
    CL. Oh, nothing to hurt.
    L. You took a cab both ways?
    CL. Not from the station to the lesson-the weather was good enough
    till that was over.
    L. Well, now, tell me everything Mrs. Hapgood said.

    Clara tells her a long yarn-avoiding novelties and surprises and
    anything likely to inspire questions difficult to answer; and of
    course detailing the menu, for if it had been the feeding of the
    5,000 Livy would have insisted on knowing what kind of bread it was
    and how the fishes were served. By and by, while talking of
    something else:

    LIVY. Clams!--in the end of December. Are you sure it was clams?
    CL. I didn't say cl---I meant Blue Points.
    L. (tranquilized). It seemed odd. What is Jean doing?
    CL. She said she was going to do a little typewriting.
    L. Has she been out to-day?
    CL. Only a moment, right after luncheon. She was determined to go
    out again, but----
    L. How did you know she was out?
    CL. (saving herself in time). Katie told me. She was determined
    to go out again in the rain and snow, but I persuaded her to stay
    in.
    L. (with moving and grateful admiration). Clara, you are
    wonderful! the wise watch you keep over Jean, and the influence you
    have over her; it's so lovely of you, and I tied here and can't take
    care of her myself. (And she goes on with these undeserved praises
    till Clara is expiring with shame.)

To Twichell:

    I am to see Livy a moment every afternoon until she has another bad
    night; and I stand in dread, for with all my practice I realize that
    in a sudden emergency I am but a poor, clumsy liar, whereas a fine
    alert and capable emergency liar is the only sort that is worth
    anything in a sick-chamber.

    Now, Joe, just see what reputation can do. All Clara's life she has
    told Livy the truth and now the reward comes; Clara lies to her
    three and a half hours every day, and Livy takes it all at par,
    whereas even when I tell her a truth it isn't worth much without
    corroboration . . . .

    Soon my brief visit is due. I've just been up listening at Livy's
    door.

    5 P.M. A great disappointment. I was sitting outside Livy's door
    waiting. Clara came out a minute ago and said L ivy is not so well,
    and the nurse can't let me see her to-day.

That pathetic drama was to continue in some degree for many a long month. All that winter and
spring Mrs. Clemens kept but a frail hold on life. Clemens wrote little, and refused invitations
everywhere he could. He spent his time largely in waiting for the two-minute period each day
when he could stand at the bed-foot and say a few words to the invalid, and he confined his
writing mainly to the comforting, affectionate messages which he was allowed to push under
her door. He was always waiting there long before the moment he was permitted to enter. Her
illness and her helplessness made manifest what Howells has fittingly characterized as his
"beautiful and tender loyalty to her, which was the most moving quality of his most faithful soul."

CCXXVII

THE SECOND RIVERDALE WINTER

Most of Mark Twain's stories have been dramatized at one time or another, and with more or
less success. He had two plays going that winter, one of them the little "Death Disk," which--in
story form had appeared a year before in Harper's Magazine. It was put on at the Carnegie Lyceum
with considerable effect, but it was not of sufficient importance to warrant a long continuance.

Another play of that year was a dramatization of Huckleberry Finn, by Lee Arthur. This was
played with a good deal of success in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, the receipts
ranging from three hundred to twenty-one hundred dollars per night, according to the weather
and locality. Why the play was discontinued is not altogether apparent; certainly many a dramatic
enterprise has gone further, faring worse.

Huck in book form also had been having adventures a little earlier, in being tabooed on account
of his morals by certain librarians of Denver and Omaha. It was years since Huck had been in
trouble of that sort, and he acquired a good deal of newspaper notoriety in consequence.

Certain entries in Mark Twain's note-book reveal somewhat of his life and thought at this period.
We find such entries as this:

    Saturday, January 3, 1903. The offspring of riches: Pride, vanity,
    ostentation, arrogance, tyranny.

    Sunday, January 4, 1903. The offspring of poverty: Greed,
    sordidness, envy, hate, malice, cruelty, meanness, lying, shirking,
    cheating, stealing, murder.

    Monday, February 2, 1903. 33d wedding anniversary. I was allowed
    to see Livy 5 minutes this morning in honor of the day. She makes
    but little progress toward recovery, still there is certainly some,
    we are sure.

    Sunday, March 1, 1903. We may not doubt that society in heaven
    consists mainly of undesirable persons.

    Thursday, March 19, 1903. Susy's birthday. She would be 31 now.

The family illnesses, which presently included an allotment for himself, his old bronchitis,
made him rage more than ever at the imperfections of the species which could be subject to
such a variety of ills. Once he wrote:

    Man was made at the end of the week's work when God was tired.

And again:

    Adam, man's benefactor--he gave him all that he has ever received
    that was worth having--death.

The Riverdale home was in reality little more than a hospital that spring. Jean had scarcely
recovered her physical strength when she was attacked by measles, and Clara also fell a victim
to the infection. Fortunately Mrs. Clemens's health had somewhat improved.

It was during this period that Clemens formulated his eclectic therapeutic doctrine. Writing
to Twichell April 4, 1903, he said:

    Livy does make a little progress these past 3 or 4 days, progress
    which is visible to even the untrained eye. The physicians are
    doing good work for her, but my notion is, that no art of healing is
    the best for all ills. I should distribute the ailments around:
    surgery cases to the surgeon; lupus to the actinic-ray specialist;
    nervous prostration to the Christian Scientist; most ills to the
    allopath & the homeopath; & (in my own particular case) rheumatism,
    gout, & bronchial attack to the osteopathist.

He had plenty of time to think and to read during those weeks of confinement, and to rage,
and to write when he felt the need of that expression, though he appears to have completed
not much for print beyond his reply to Mrs. Eddy, already mentioned, and his burlesque, "Instructions
in Art," with pictures by himself, published in the Metropolitan for April and May.

Howells called his attention to some military outrages in the Philippines, citing a case where
a certain lieutenant had tortured one of his men, a mild offender, to death out of pure deviltry,
and had been tried but not punished for his fiendish crime.--[The torture to death of Private
Edward C. Richter, an American soldier, by orders of a commissioned officer of the United States
army on the night of February 7, 1902. Private Richter was bound and gagged and the gag held
in his mouth by means of a club while ice-water was slowly poured into his face, a dipper full
at a time, for two hours and a half, until life became extinct.]

Clemens undertook to give expression to his feelings on this subject, but he boiled so when
he touched pen to paper to write of it that it was simply impossible for him to say anything
within the bounds of print. Then his only relief was to rise and walk the floor, and curse
out his fury at the race that had produced such a specimen.

Mrs. Clemens, who perhaps got some drift or the echo of these tempests, now and then sent him
a little admonitory, affectionate note.

Among the books that Clemens read, or tried to read, during his confinement were certain of
the novels of Sir Walter Scott. He had never been able to admire Scott, and determined now
to try to understand this author's popularity and his standing with the critics; but after
wading through the first volume of one novel, and beginning another one, he concluded to apply
to one who could speak as having authority. He wrote to Brander Matthews:

    DEAR BRANDER,--I haven't been out of my bed for 4 weeks, but-well, I
    have been reading a good deal, & it occurs to me to ask you to sit
    down, some time or other when you have 8 or 9 months to spare, & jot
    me down a certain few literary particulars for my help & elevation.
    Your time need not be thrown away, for at your further leisure you
    can make Columbian lectures out of the results & do your students a
    good turn.

    1. Are there in Sir Walter's novels passages done in good English
    --English which is neither slovenly nor involved?

    2. Are there passages whose English is not poor & thin &
    commonplace, but is of a quality above that?

    3. Are there passages which burn with real fire--not punk, fox-
    fire, make-believe?
    4. Has he heroes & heroines who are not cads and cadesses?

    5. Has he personages whose acts & talk correspond with their
    characters as described by him?

    6. Has he heroes & heroines whom the reader admires--admires and
    knows why?

    7. Has he funny characters that are funny, and humorous passages
    that are humorous?

    8. Does he ever chain the reader's interest & make him reluctant to
    lay the book down?

    9. Are there pages where he ceases from posing, ceases from
    admiring the placid flood & flow of his own dilution, ceases from
    being artificial, & is for a time, long or short, recognizably
    sincere & in earnest?

    10. Did he know how to write English, & didn't do it because he
    didn't want to?

    11. Did he use the right word only when he couldn't think of
    another one, or did he run so much to wrong words because he didn't
    know the right one when he saw it?

    12. Can you read him and keep your respect for him? Of course a
    person could in his day--an era of sentimentality & sloppy
    romantics--but land! can a body do it to-day?

    Brander, I lie here dying; slowly dying, under the blight of Sir
    Walter. I have read the first volume of Rob Roy, & as far as
    Chapter XIX of Guy Mannering, & I can no longer hold my head up or
    take my nourishment. Lord, it's all so juvenile! so artificial, so
    shoddy; & such wax figures & skeletons & specters. Interest? Why,
    it is impossible to feel an interest in these bloodless shams, these
    milk-&-water humbugs. And oh, the poverty of invention! Not
    poverty in inventing situations, but poverty in furnishing reasons
    for them. Sir Walter usually gives himself away when he arranges
    for a situation--elaborates & elaborates & elaborates till, if you
    live to get to it, you don't believe in it when it happens.

    I can't find the rest of Rob Roy, I, can't stand any more Mannering
    --I do not know just what to do, but I will reflect, & not quit this
    great study rashly ....

    My, I wish I could see you & Leigh Hunt!

    Sincerely yours,

                                   S. L. CLEMENS.

But a few days later he experienced a revelation. It came when he perseveringly attacked still
a third work of Scott--Quentin Durward. Hastily he wrote to Matthews again:

I'm still in bed, but the days have lost their dullness since I broke into Sir Walter & lost
my temper. I finished Guy Mannering that curious, curious book, with its mob of squalid shadows
gibbering around a single flesh-&-blood being--Dinmont; a book crazily put together out of
the very refuse of the romance artist's stage properties--finished it & took up Quentin Durward
& finished that.

It was like leaving the dead to mingle with the living; it was like withdrawing from the infant
class in the college of journalism to sit under the lectures in English literature in Columbia
University.

I wonder who wrote Quentin Durward?--[This letter, enveloped, addressed, and stamped, was evidently
mislaid. It was found and mailed seven years later, June, 1910 message from the dead.]

Among other books which he read that winter and spring was Helen Keller's 'The Story of My
Life', then recently published. That he finished it in a mood of sweet gentleness we gather
from a long, lovely letter which he wrote her--a letter in which he said:

I am charmed with your book--enchanted. You are a wonderful creature, the most wonderful in
the world--you and your other half together--Miss Sullivan, I mean--for it took the pair of
you to make a complete & perfect whole. How she stands out in her letters! her brilliancy,
penetration, originality, wisdom, character, & the fine literary competencies of her pen--they
are all there.

When reading and writing failed as diversion, Mark Twain often turned to mathematics. With
no special talent for accuracy in the matter of figures, he had a curious fondness for calculations,
scientific and financial, and he used to cover pages, ciphering at one thing and another, arriving
pretty inevitably at the wrong results. When the problem was financial, and had to do with
his own fortunes, his figures were as likely as not to leave him in a state of panic. The expenditures
were naturally heavy that spring; and one night, when he had nothing better to do, he figured
the relative proportion to his income. The result showed that they were headed straight for
financial ruin. He put in the rest of the night fearfully rolling and tossing, and reconstructing
his figures that grew always worse, and next morning summoned Jean and Clara and petrified
them with the announcement that the cost of living was one hundred and twenty-five per cent.
more than the money-supply.

Writing to MacAlister three days later he said:

    It was a mistake. When I came down in the morning, a gray and aged
    wreck, I found that in some unaccountable way (unaccountable to a
    business man, but not to me) I had multiplied the totals by two. By
    God, I dropped seventy-five years on the floor where I stood!

    Do you know it affected me as one is affected when one wakes out of
    a hideous dream & finds it was only a dream. It was a great comfort
    & satisfaction to me to call the daughters to a private meeting of
    the board again. Certainly there is a blistering & awful reality
    about a well-arranged unreality. It is quite within the
    possibilities that two or three nights like that of mine would drive
    a man to suicide. He would refuse to examine the figures, they
    would revolt him so, & he would go to his death unaware that there
    was nothing serious about them. I cannot get that night out of my
    head, it was so vivid, so real, so ghastly: In any other year of
    these thirty-three the relief would have been simple: go where you
    can, cut your cloth to fit your income. You can't do that when your
    wife can't be moved, even from one room to the next.

    The doctor & a specialist met in conspiracy five days ago, & in
    their belief she will by and by come out of this as good as new,
    substantially. They ordered her to Italy for next winter--which
    seems to indicate that by autumn she will be able to undertake the
    voyage. So Clara is writing to a Florence friend to take a look
    around among the villas for us in the regions near that city.

CCXXVIII

PROFFERED HONORS

Mark Twain had been at home well on toward three years; but his popularity showed no signs
of diminishing. So far from having waned, it had surged to a higher point than ever before.
His crusade against public and private abuses had stirred readers, and had set them to thinking;
the news of illness in his household; a report that he was contemplating another residence
abroad--these things moved deeply the public heart, and a tide of letters flowed in, letters
of every sort--of sympathy, of love, or hearty endorsement, whatever his attitude of reform.

When a writer in a New York newspaper said, "Let us go outside the realm of practical politics
next time in choosing our candidates for the Presidency," and asked, "Who is our ablest and
most conspicuous private citizen?" another editorial writer, Joseph Hollister, replied that
Mark Twain was "the greatest man of his day in private life, and entitled to the fullest measure
of recognition."

But Clemens was without political ambitions. He knew the way of such things too well. When
Hollister sent him the editorial he replied only with a word of thanks, and did not, even in
jest, encourage that tiny seed of a Presidential boom. One would like to publish many of the
beautiful letters received during this period, for they are beautiful, most of them, however
illiterate in form, however discouraging in length --beautiful in that they overflow with the
writers' sincerity and gratitude.

So many of them came from children, usually without the hope of a reply, some signed only with
initials, that the writers might not be open to the suspicion of being seekers for his autograph.
Almost more than any other reward, Mark Twain valued this love of the children.

A department in the St. Nicholas Magazine offered a prize for a caricature drawing of some
well-known man. There were one or two of certain prominent politicians and capitalists, and
there was literally a wheelbarrow load of Mark Twain. When he was informed of this he wrote:
"No tribute could have pleased me more than that--the friendship of the children."

Tributes came to him in many forms. In his native State it was proposed to form a Mark Twain
Association, with headquarters at Hannibal, with the immediate purpose of having a week set
apart at the St. Louis World's Fair, to be called the Mark Twain week, with a special Mark
Twain day, on which a national literary convention would be held. But when his consent was
asked, and his co-operation invited, he wrote characteristically:

It is indeed a high compliment which you offer me, in naming an association after me and in
proposing the setting apart of a Mark Twain day at the great St. Louis Fair, but such compliments
are not proper for the living; they are proper and safe for the dead only. I value the impulse
which moves you to tender me these honors. I value it as highly as any one can, and am grateful
for it, but I should stand in a sort of terror of the honors themselves. So long as we remain
alive we are not safe from doing things which, however righteously and honorably intended,
can wreck our repute and extinguish our friendships.

I hope that no society will be named for me while I am still alive, for I might at some time
or other do something which would cause its members to regret having done me that honor. After
I shall have joined the dead I shall follow the custom of those people, and be guilty of no
conduct that can wound any friend; but until that time shall come I shall be a doubtful quantity,
like the rest of our race.

The committee, still hoping for his consent, again appealed to him. But again he wrote:

While I am deeply touched by the desire of my friends of Hannibal to confer these great honors
upon me I must still forbear to accept them. Spontaneous and unpremeditated honors, like those
which came to me at Hannibal, Columbia, St. Louis, and at the village stations all down the
line, are beyond all price and are a treasure for life in the memory, for they are a free gift
out of the heart and they come without solicitation; but I am a Missourian, and so I shrink
from distinctions which have to be arranged beforehand and with my privity, for I then become
a party to my own exalting. I am humanly fond of honors that happen, but chary of those that
come by canvass and intention.

Somewhat later he suggested a different feature for the fair; one that was not practical, perhaps,
but which certainly would have aroused interest--that is to say, an old-fashioned six-day steamboat-race
from New Orleans to St. Louis, with the old-fashioned accessories, such as torch-baskets, forecastle
crowds of negro singers, with a negro on the safety-valve. In his letter to President Francis
he said:

As to particulars, I think that the race should be a genuine reproduction of the old-time race,
not just an imitation of it, and that it should cover the whole course. I think the boats should
begin the trip at New Orleans, and side by side (not an interval between), and end it at North
St. Louis, a mile or two above the Big Mound.

In a subsequent letter to Governor Francis he wrote:

It has been a dear wish of mine to exhibit myself at the great Fair & get a prize, but circumstances
beyond my control have interfered . . . .

I suppose you will get a prize, because you have created the most prodigious Fair the planet
has ever seen. Very well, you have indeed earned it, and with it the gratitude of the State
and the nation.

Newspaper men used every inducement to get interviews from him. They invited him to name a
price for any time he could give them, long or short. One reporter offered him five hundred
dollars for a two-hour talk. Another proposed to pay him one hundred dollars a week for a quarter
of a day each week, allowing him to discuss any subject he pleased. One wrote asking him two
questions: the first, "Your favorite method of escaping from Indians"; the second, "Your favorite
method of escaping capture by the Indians when they were in pursuit of you." They inquired
as to his favorite copy-book maxim; as to what he considered most important to a young man's
success; his definition of a gentleman. They wished to know his plan for the settlement of
labor troubles. But they did not awaken his interest, or his cupidity. To one applicant he wrote:

No, there are temptations against which we are fire-proof. Your proposition is one which comes
to me with considerable frequency, but it never tempts me. The price isn't the objection; you
offer plenty. It is the nature of the work that is the objection--a kind of work which I could
not do well enough to satisfy me. To multiply the price by twenty would not enable me to do
the work to my satisfaction, & by consequence would make no impression upon me.

Once he allowed himself to be interviewed for the Herald, when from Mr. Rogers's yacht he had
watched Sir Thomas Lipton's Shamrock go down to defeat; but this was a subject which appealed
to him--a kind of hotweather subject--and he could be as light-minded about it as he chose.

CCXXXIX

THE LAST SUMMER AT ELMIRA

The Clemenses were preparing to take up residence in Florence, Italy. The Hartford house had
been sold in May, ending forever the association with the city that had so long been a part
of their lives. The Tarrytown place, which they had never occupied, they also agreed to sell,
for it was the belief now that Mrs. Clemens's health would never greatly prosper there. Howells
says, or at least implies, that they expected their removal to Florence to be final. He tells
us, too, of one sunny afternoon when he and Clemens sat on the grass before the mansion at
Riverdale, after Mrs. Clemens had somewhat improved, and how they "looked up toward a balcony
where by and by that lovely presence made itself visible, as if it had stooped there from a
cloud. A hand frailly waved a handkerchief; Clemens ran over the lawn toward it, calling tenderly."
It was a greeting to Howells the last he would ever receive from her.

Mrs. Clemens was able to make a trip to Elmira by the end of June, and on the 1st of July Mr.
Rogers brought Clemens and his wife down the river on his yacht to the Lackawanna pier, and
they reached Quarry Farm that evening. She improved in the quietude and restfulness of that
beloved place. Three weeks later Clemens wrote to Twichell:

Livy is coming along: eats well, sleeps some, is mostly very gay, not very often depressed;
spends all day on the porch, sleeps there a part of the night; makes excursions in carriage
& in wheel-chair; &, in the matter of superintending everything & everybody, has resumed business
at the old stand.

During three peaceful months she spent most of her days reclining on the wide veranda, surrounded
by those dearest to her, and looking out on the dreamlike landscape--the long, grassy slope,
the drowsy city, and the distant hills--getting strength for the far journey by sea. Clemens
did some writing, occupying the old octagonal study--shut in now and overgrown with vines--where
during the thirty years since it was built so many of his stories had been written. 'A Dog's
Tale'--that pathetic anti-vivisection story--appears to have been the last manuscript ever
completed in the spot consecrated by Huck and Tom, and by Tom Canty the Pauper and the little
wandering Prince.

It was October 5th when they left Elmira.

They did not return to Riverdale, but went to the Hotel Grosvenor for the intervening weeks.
They had engaged passage for Italy on the Princess Irene, which would sail on the 24th. It
was during the period of their waiting that Clemens concluded his final Harper contract. On
that day, in his note-book, he wrote:

                      THE PROPHECY

In 1895 Cheiro the palmist examined my hand & said that in my 68th year (1903) I would become
suddenly rich. I was a bankrupt & $94,000 in debt at the time through the failure of Charles
L. Webster & Co. Two years later--in London--Cheiro repeated this long-distance prediction,
& added that the riches would come from a quite unexpected source. I am superstitious. I kept
the prediction in mind & often thought of it. When at last it came true, October 22, 1903,
there was but a month & 9 days to spare.

The contract signed that day concentrates all my books in Harper's hands & now at last they
are valuable; in fact they are a fortune. They guarantee me $25,000 a year for 5 years, and
they will yield twice as much as that.--[In earlier note-books and letters Clemens more than
once refers to this prophecy and wonders if it is to be realized. The Harper contract, which
brought all of his books into the hands of one publisher (negotiated for him by Mr. Rogers),
proved, in fact, a fortune. The books yielded always more than the guarantee; sometimes twice
that amount, as he had foreseen.]

During the conclusion of this contract Clemens made frequent visits to Fairhaven on the Kanawha.
Joe Goodman came from the Pacific to pay him a good-by visit during this period. Goodman had
translated the Mayan inscriptions, and his work had received official recognition and publication
by the British Museum. It was a fine achievement for a man in later life and Clemens admired
it immensely. Goodman and Clemens enjoyed each other in the old way at quiet resorts where
they could talk over the old tales. Another visitor of that summer was the son of an old friend,
a Hannibal printer named Daulton. Young Daulton came with manuscripts seeking a hearing of
the magazine editors, so Clemens wrote a letter which would insure that favor: INTRODUCING
MR. GEO. DAULTON:

TO GILDER, ALDEN, HARVEY, McCLURE, WALKER, PAGE, BOK, COLLIER, and such other members of the
sacred guild as privilege me to call them friends-these:

Although I have no personal knowledge of the bearer of this, I have what is better: He comes
recommended to me by his own father--a thing not likely to happen in any of your families,
I reckon. I ask you, as a favor to me, to waive prejudice & superstition for this once & examine
his work with an eye to its literary merit, instead of to the chastity of its spelling. I wish
to God you cared less for that particular.

I set (or sat) type alongside of his father, in Hannibal, more than 50 years ago, when none
but the pure in heart were in that business. A true man he was; and if I can be of any service
to his son--and to you at the same time, let me hope--I am here heartily to try.

Yours by the sanctions of time & deserving,

              Sincerely,
                            S. L. CLEMENS.

Among the kindly words which came to Mark Twain before leaving America was this one which Rudyard
Kipling had written to his publisher, Frank Doubleday:

    I love to think of the great and godlike Clemens. He is the biggest
    man you have on your side of the water by a damn sight, and don't
    you forget it. Cervantes was a relation of his.

It curiously happened that Clemens at the same moment was writing to Doubleday about Kipling:

    I have been reading "The Bell Buoy" and "The Old Man" over and over
    again-my custom with Kipling's work--and saving up the rest for
    other leisurely and luxurious meals. A bell-buoy is a deeply
    impressive fellow-being. In these many recent trips up and down the
    Sound in the Kanawha he has talked to me nightly sometimes in his
    pathetic and melancholy way, sometimes with his strenuous and urgent
    note, and I got his meaning--now I have his words! No one but
    Kipling could do this strong and vivid thing. Some day I hope to
    hear the poem chanted or sung-with the bell-buoy breaking in out of
    the distance.

    P. S.--Your letter has arrived. It makes me proud and glad--what
    Kipling says. I hope Fate will fetch him to Florence while we are
    there. I would rather see him than any other man.

THE RETURN TO FLORENCE

From the note-book:

    Saturday, October 24, 1903. Sailed in the Princess Irene for Genoa
    at 11. Flowers & fruit from Mrs. Rogers & Mrs. Coe. We have with
    us Katie Leary (in our domestic service 23 years) & Miss Margaret
    Sherry (trained nurse).

Two days later he wrote:

    Heavy storm all night. Only 3 stewardesses. Ours served 60 meals
    in rooms this morning.

On the 27th:

    Livy is enduring the voyage marvelously well. As well as Clara &
    Jean, I think, & far better than the trained nurse.

    She has been out on deck an hour.

    November 2. Due at Gibraltar 10 days from New York. 3 days to
    Naples, then 2 day to Genoa.
    At supper the band played "Cavalleria Rusticana," which is forever
    associated in my mind with Susy. I love it better than any other,
    but it breaks my heart.

It was the "Intermezzo" he referred to, which had been Susy's favorite music, and whenever
he heard it he remembered always one particular opera-night long ago, and Susy's face rose
before him. In later times it has been occupied and altered by royal families of Wurtemberg
and Russia. Now it was the property of the Countess Massiglia, from whom Clemens had leased it.

They had hoped to secure the Villa Papiniano, under Fiesole, near Professor Fiske, but negotiations
for it had fallen through. The Villa Quarto, as it is usually called, was a more pretentious
place and as beautifully located, standing as it does in an ancient garden looking out over
Florence toward Vallombrosa and the Chianti hills. Yet now in the retrospect, it seems hardly
to have been the retreat for an invalid. Its garden was supernaturally beautiful, all that
one expects that a garden of Italy should be--such a garden as Maxfield Parrish might dream;
but its beauty was that which comes of antiquity--the accumulation of dead years. Its funereal
cypresses, its crumbling walls and arches, its clinging ivy and moldering marbles, and a clock
that long ago forgot the hours, gave it a mortuary look. In a way it suggested Arnold Bocklin's
"Todteninsel," and it might well have served as the allegorical setting for a gateway to the
bourne of silence.

The house itself, one of the most picturesque of the old Florentine suburban palaces, was historically
interesting, rather than cheerful. The rooms, in number more than sixty, though richly furnished,
were vast and barnlike, and there were numbers of them wholly unused and never entered. There
was a dearth of the modern improvements which Americans have learned to regard as a necessity,
and the plumbing, such as it was, was not always in order. The place was approached by narrow
streets, along which the more uninviting aspects of Italy were not infrequent. Youth and health
and romance might easily have reveled in the place; but it seems now not to have been the best
choice for that frail invalid, to whom cheer and brightness and freshness and the lovelier
things of hope meant always so much.--[Villa Quarto has recently been purchased by Signor P.
de Ritter Lahony, and thoroughly restored and refreshed and beautified without the sacrifice
of any of its romantic features.]--Neither was the climate of Florence all that they had hoped
for. Their former sunny winter had misled them. Tradition to the contrary, Italy--or at least
Tuscany--is not one perpetual dream of sunlight. It is apt to be damp and cloudy; it is likely
to be cold. Writing to MacAlister, Clemens said:

Florentine sunshine? Bless you, there isn't any. We have heavy fogs every morning & rain all
day. This house is not merely large, it is vast--therefore I think it must always lack the
home feeling.

His dissatisfaction in it began thus early, and it grew as one thing after another went wrong.
With it all, however, Mrs. Clemens seemed to gain a little, and was glad to see company--a
reasonable amount of company--to brighten her surroundings.

Clemens began to work and wrote a story or two, and those lively articles about the Italian
language.

To Twichell he reported progress:

    I have a handsome success in one way here. I left New York under a
    sort of half-promise to furnish to the Harper magazines 30,000 words
    this year. Magazining is difficult work because every third page
    represents two pages that you have put in the fire (you are nearly
    sure to start wrong twice), & so when you have finished an article &
    are willing to let it go to print it represents only 10 cents a word
    instead of 30.

    But this time I had the curious (& unprecedented) luck to start
    right in each case. I turned out 37,000 words in 25 working days; &
    the reason I think I started right every time is, that not only have
    I approved and accepted the several articles, but the court of last
    resort (Livy) has done the same.

    On many of the between-days I did some work, but only of an idle &
    not necessarily necessary sort, since it will not see print until I
    am dead. I shall continue this (an hour per day), but the rest of
    the year I expect to put in on a couple of long books (half-
    completed ones). No more magazine work hanging over my head.

    This secluded & silent solitude, this clean, soft air, & this
    enchanting view of Florence, the great valley & snow-mountains that
    frame it, are the right conditions for work. They are a persistent
    inspiration. To-day is very lovely; when the afternoon arrives
    there will be a new picture every hour till dark, & each of them
    divine--or progressing from divine to diviner & divinest. On this
    (second) floor Clara's room commands the finest; she keeps a window
    ten feet high wide open all the time & frames it in that. I go in
    from time to time every day & trade sass for a look. The central
    detail is a distant & stately snow-hump that rises above & behind
    black-forested hills, & its sloping vast buttresses, velvety & sun-
    polished, with purple shadows between, make the sort of picture we
    knew that time we walked in Switzerland in the days of our youth.

From this letter, which is of January 7, 1904, we gather that the weather had greatly improved,
and with it Mrs. Clemens's health, notwithstanding she had an alarming attack in December.
One of the stories he had finished was "The $30,000 Bequest." The work mentioned, which would
not see print until after his death, was a continuation of those autobiographical chapters
which for years he had been setting down as the mood seized him.

He experimented with dictation, which he had tried long before with Redpath, and for a time
now found it quite to his liking. He dictated some of his copyright memories, and some anecdotes
and episodes; but his amanuensis wrote only longhand, which perhaps hampered him, for he tired
of it by and by and the dictations were discontinued.

Among these notes there is one elaborate description of the Villa di Quarto, dictated at the
end of the winter, by which time we are not surprised to find he had become much attached to
the place. The Italian spring was in the air, and it was his habit to grow fond of his surroundings.
Some atmospheric paragraphs of these impressions invite us here:

    We are in the extreme south end of the house, if there is any such
    thing as a south end to a house, whose orientation cannot be
    determined by me, because I am incompetent in all cases where an
    object does not point directly north & south. This one slants
    across between, & is therefore a confusion. This little private
    parlor is in one of the two corners of what I call the south end of
    the house. The sun rises in such a way that all the morning it is
    pouring its light through the 33 glass doors or windows which pierce
    the side of the house which looks upon the terrace & garden; the
    rest of the day the light floods this south end of the house, as I
    call it; at noon the sun is directly above Florence yonder in the
    distance in the plain, directly across those architectural features
    which have been so familiar to the world in pictures for some
    centuries, the Duomo, the Campanile, the Tomb of the Medici, & the
    beautiful tower of the Palazzo Vecchio; in this position it begins
    to reveal the secrets of the delicious blue mountains that circle
    around into the west, for its light discovers, uncovers, & exposes a
    white snowstorm of villas & cities that you cannot train yourself to
    have confidence in, they appear & disappear so mysteriously, as if
    they might not be villas & cities at all, but the ghosts of perished
    ones of the remote & dim Etruscan times; & late in the afternoon the
    sun sets down behind those mountains somewhere, at no particular
    time & at no particular place, so far as I can see.

Again at the end of March he wrote:

    Now that we have lived in this house four and a half months my
    prejudices have fallen away one by one & the place has become very
    homelike to me. Under certain conditions I should like to go on
    living in it indefinitely. I should wish the Countess to move out
    of Italy, out of Europe, out of the planet. I should want her
    bonded to retire to her place in the next world & inform me which of
    the two it was, so that I could arrange for my own hereafter.

Complications with their landlady had begun early, and in time, next to Mrs. Clemens's health,
to which it bore such an intimate and vital relation, the indifference of the Countess Massiglia
to their needs became the supreme and absorbing concern of life at the villa, and led to continued
and almost continuous house-hunting.

Days when the weather permitted, Clemens drove over the hills looking for a villa which he
could lease or buy--one with conveniences and just the right elevation and surroundings. There
were plenty of villas; but some of them were badly situated as to altitude or view; some were
falling to decay, and the search was rather a discouraging one. Still it was not abandoned,
and the reports of these excursions furnished new interest and new hope always to the invalid
at home.

"Even if we find it," he wrote Howells, "I am afraid it will be months before we can move Mrs.
Clemens. Of course it will. But it comforts us to let on that we think otherwise, and these
pretensions help to keep hope alive in her."

She had her bad days and her good days, days when it was believed she had passed the turning-point
and was traveling the way to recovery; but the good days were always a little less hopeful,
the bad days a little more discouraging. On February 22d Clemens wrote in his note-book:

At midnight Livy's pulse went to 192 & there was a collapse. Great alarm. Subcutaneous injection
of brandy saved her.

And to MacAlister toward the end of March:

We are having quite perfect weather now & are hoping that it will bring effects for Mrs. Clemens.

But a few days later he added that he was watching the driving rain through the windows, and
that it was bad weather for the invalid. "But it will not last," he said.

The invalid improved then, and there was a concert in Florence at which Clara Clemens sang.
Clemens in his note-book says:

    April 8. Clara's concert was a triumph. Livy woke up & sent for
    her to tell her all about it, near midnight.

But a day or two later she was worse again--then better. The hearts in that household were
as pendulums, swinging always between hope and despair.

One familiar with the Clemens history might well have been filled with forebodings. Already
in January a member of the family, Mollie Clemens, Orion's wife, died, news which was kept
from Mrs. Clemens, as was the death of Aldrich's son, and that of Sir Henry M. Stanley, both
of which occurred that spring.

Indeed, death harvested freely that year among the Clemens friendships. Clemens wrote Twichell:

    Yours has just this moment arrived-just as I was finishing a note to
    poor Lady Stanley. I believe the last country-house visit we paid
    in England was to Stanley's. Lord! how my friends & acquaintances
    fall about me now in my gray-headed days! Vereshchagin, Mommsen,
    Dvorak, Lenbach, & Jokai, all so recently, & now Stanley. I have
    known Stanley 37 years. Goodness, who is there I haven't known?

THE CLOSE OF A BEAUTIFUL LIFE

In one of his notes near the end of April Clemens writes that once more, as at Riverdale, he
has been excluded from Mrs. Clemens's room except for the briefest moment at a time. But on
May 12th, to R. W. Gilder, he reported:

    For two days now we have not been anxious about Mrs. Clemens
    (unberufen). After 20 months of bedridden solitude & bodily misery
    she all of a sudden ceases to be a pallid, shrunken shadow, & looks
    bright & young & pretty. She remains what she always was, the most
    wonderful creature of fortitude, patience, endurance, and
    recuperative power that ever was. But ah, dear! it won't last;
    this fiendish malady will play new treacheries upon her, and I shall
    go back to my prayers again--unutterable from any pulpit!

    May 13, A.M. I have just paid one of my pair of permitted 2-minute
    visits per day to the sick-room. And found what I have learned to
    expect--retrogression.

There was a day when she was brought out on the terrace in a wheel-chair to see the wonder
of the early Italian summer. She had been a prisoner so long that she was almost overcome with
the delight of it all--the more so, perhaps, in the feeling that she might so soon be leaving it.

It was on Sunday, the 5th of June, that the end came. Clemens and Jean had driven out to make
some calls, and had stopped at a villa, which promised to fulfil most of the requirements.
They came home full of enthusiasm concerning it, and Clemens, in his mind, had decided on the
purchase. In the corridor Clara said:

"She is better to-day than she has been for three months."

Then quickly, under her breath, "Unberufen," which the others, too, added hastily--superstitiously.

Mrs. Clemens was, in fact, bright and cheerful, and anxious to hear all about the new property
which was to become their home. She urged him to sit by her during the dinner-hour and tell
her the details; but once, when the sense of her frailties came upon her, she said they must
not mind if she could not go very soon, but be content where they were. He remained from half
past seven until eight--a forbidden privilege, but permitted because she was so animated, feeling
so well. Their talk was as it had been in the old days, and once during it he reproached himself,
as he had so often done, and asked forgiveness for the tears he had brought into her life.

He was so hopeful and happy that it amounted to exaltation. He went to his room at first, then
he was moved to do a thing which he had seldom done since Susy died. He went to the piano up-stairs
and sang the old jubilee songs that Susy had liked to hear him sing. Jean came in presently,
listening. She had not done this before, that he could remember. He sang "Swing Low, Sweet
Chariot," and "My Lord He Calls Me." He noticed Jean then and stopped, but she asked him to
go on. He went and bent over and looked into her face, surprised that she did not greet him.
He did not suspect what had happened until he heard one of the daughters ask:

"Katie, is it true? Oh, Katie, is it true?"

He realized then that she was gone.

In his note-book that night he wrote:

    At a quarter past 9 this evening she that was the life of my life
    passed to the relief & the peace of death after as months of unjust
    & unearned suffering. I first saw her near 37 years ago, & now I
    have looked upon her face for the last time. Oh, so unexpected!...
    I was full of remorse for things done & said in these 34 years of
    married life that hurt Livy's heart.

He envied her lying there, so free from it all, with the great peace upon her face. He wrote
to Howells and to Twichell, and to Mrs. Crane, those nearest and dearest ones. To Twichell he said:

    How sweet she was in death, how young, how beautiful, how like her
    dear girlish self of thirty years ago, not a gray hair showing!
    This rejuvenescence was noticeable within two hours after her death;
    & when I went down again (2.30) it was complete. In all that night
    & all that day she never noticed my caressing hand--it seemed
    strange.

To Howells he recalled the closing scene:

    I bent over her & looked in her face & I think I spoke--I was
    surprised & troubled that she did not notice me. Then we understood
    & our hearts broke. How poor we are to-day!

    But how thankful I am that her persecutions are ended! I would not
    call her back if I could. I am tired & old; I wish I were with Livy.

And in a few days:

It would break Livy's heart to see Clara. We excuse ourself from all the friends that call--though,
of course, only intimates come. Intimates --but they are not the old, old friends, the friends
of the old, old times when we laughed. Shall we ever laugh again? If I could only see a dog
that I knew in the old times & could put my arms around his neck and tell him all, everything,
& ease my heart!

THE SAD JOURNEY HOME

A tidal wave of sympathy poured in. Noble and commoner, friend and stranger--humanity of every
station--sent their messages of condolence to the friend of mankind. The cablegrams came first--bundles
of them from every corner of the world--then the letters, a steady inflow. Howells, Twichell,
Aldrich--those oldest friends who had themselves learned the meaning of grief--spoke such few
and futile words as the language can supply to allay a heart's mourning, each recalling the
rarity and beauty of the life that had slipped away. Twichell and his wife wrote:

DEAR, DEAR MARK,--There is nothing we can say. What is there to say?
But here we are--with you all every hour and every minute--filled with
unutterable thoughts; unutterable affection for the dead and for the
living.
                            HARMONY AND JOE.

Howells in his letter said:

She hallowed what she touched far beyond priests . . . . What are you going to do, you poor soul?

A hundred letters crowd in for expression here, but must be denied--not, however, the beam
of hope out of Helen Keller's illumined night:

    Do try to reach through grief and feel the pressure of her hand, as
    I reach through darkness and feel the smile on my friends' lips and
    the light in their eyes though mine are closed.

They were adrift again without plans for the future. They would return to America to lay Mrs.
Clemens to rest by Susy and little Langdon, but beyond that they could not see. Then they remembered
a quiet spot in Massachusetts, Tyringham, near Lee, where the Gilders lived, and so, on June
7th, he wrote:

    DEAR GILDER FAMILY,--I have been worrying and worrying to know what
    to do; at last I went to the girls with an idea--to ask the Gilders
    to get us shelter near their summer home. It was the first time
    they have not shaken their heads. So to-morrow I will cable to you
    and shall hope to be in time.

    An hour ago the best heart that ever beat for me and mine was
    carried silent out of this house, and I am as one who wanders and
    has lost his way. She who is gone was our head, she was our hands.
    We are now trying to make plans--we: we who have never made a plan
    before, nor ever needed to. If she could speak to us she would make
    it all simple and easy with a word, & our perplexities would vanish
    away. If she had known she was near to death she would have told us
    where to go and what to do, but she was not suspecting, neither were
    we. She was all our riches and she is gone; she was our breath, she
    was our life, and now we are nothing.

    We send you our love-and with it the love of you that was in her
    heart when she died.
                            S. L. CLEMENS.

They arranged to sail on the Prince Oscar on the 29th of June. There was an earlier steamer,
but it was the Princess Irene, which had brought them, and they felt they would not make the
return voyage on that vessel. During the period of waiting a curious thing happened. Clemens
one day got up in a chair in his room on the second floor to pull down the high window-sash.
It did not move easily and his hand slipped. It was only by the merest chance that he saved
himself from falling to the ground far below. He mentions this in his note-book, and once,
speaking of it to Frederick Duneka, he said:

"Had I fallen it would probably have killed me, and in my bereaved circumstances the world
would have been convinced that it was suicide. It was one of those curious coincidences which
are always happening and being misunderstood."

The homeward voyage and its sorrowful conclusion are pathetically conveyed in his notes:

    June 29, 1904. Sailed last night at 10. The bugle-call to
    breakfast. I recognized the notes and was distressed. When I heard
    them last Livy heard them with me; now they fall upon her ear
    unheeded.

    In my life there have been 68 Junes--but how vague & colorless 67 of
    them are contrasted with the deep blackness of this one!

    July 1, 1904. I cannot reproduce Livy's face in my mind's eye--I
    was never in my life able to reproduce a face. It is a curious
    infirmity--& now at last I realize it is a calamity.

    July 2, 1904. In these 34 years we have made many voyages together,
    Livy dear--& now we are making our last; you down below & lonely; I
    above with the crowd & lonely.

    July 3, 1904. Ship-time, 8 A.M. In 13 hours & a quarter it will be
    4 weeks since Livy died.

    Thirty-one years ago we made our first voyage together--& this is
    our last one in company. Susy was a year old then. She died at 24
    & had been in her grave 8 years.

    July 10, 1904. To-night it will be 5 weeks. But to me it remains
    yesterday--as it has from the first. But this funeral march--how
    sad & long it is!

    Two days more will end the second stage of it.

    July 14, 1904 (ELMIRA). Funeral private in the house of Livy's
    young maidenhood. Where she stood as a bride 34 years ago there her
    coffin rested; & over it the same voice that had made her a wife
    then committed her departed spirit to God now.

It was Joseph Twichell who rendered that last service. Mr. Beecher was long since dead. It
was a simple, touching utterance, closing with this tender word of farewell:

    Robert Browning, when he was nearing the end of his earthly days,
    said that death was the thing that we did not believe in. Nor do we
    believe in it. We who journeyed through the bygone years in
    companionship with the bright spirit now withdrawn are growing old.
    The way behind is long; the way before is short. The end cannot be
    far off. But what of that? Can we not say, each one:

       "So long that power hath blessed me, sure it still
                   Will lead me on;
        O'er moor and fen; o'er crag and torrent, till
                   The night is gone;
         And with the morn, their angel faces smile,
        Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile!"

    And so good-by. Good-by, dear heart! Strong, tender, and true.
    Good-by until for us the morning break and these shadows fly away.

Dr. Eastman, who had succeeded Mr. Beecher, closed the service with a prayer, and so the last
office we can render in this life for those we love was finished.

Clemens ordered that a simple marker should be placed at the grave, bearing, besides the name,
the record of birth and death, followed by the German line:

BEGINNING ANOTHER HOME

There was an extra cottage on the Gilder place at Tyringham, and this they occupied for the
rest of that sad summer. Clemens, in his note-book, has preserved some of its aspects and incidents.

July 24, 1904. Rain--rain--rain. Cold. We built a fire in my room. Then clawed the logs out
& threw water, remembering there was a brood of swallows in the chimney. The tragedy was averted.

July 31. LEE, MASSACHUSETTS (BERKSHIRE HILLS). Last night the young people out on a moonlight
ride. Trolley frightened Jean's horse --collision--horse killed. Rodman Gilder picked Jean
up, unconscious; she was taken to the doctor, per the car. Face, nose, side, back contused;
tendon of left ankle broken.

August 10. NEW YORK. Clam here sick--never well since June 5. Jean is at the summer home in
the Berkshire Hills crippled.

The next entry records the third death in the Clemens family within a period of eight months--that
of Mrs. Moffett, who had been Pamela Clemens. Clemens writes:

    September 1. Died at Greenwich, Connecticut, my sister, Pamela
    Moffett, aged about 73.

    Death dates this year January 14, June 5, September 1.

That fall they took a house in New York City, on the corner of Ninth Street and Fifth Avenue,
No. 21, remaining for a time at the Grosvenor while the new home was being set in order. The
home furniture was brought from Hartford, unwrapped, and established in the light of strange
environment. Clemens wrote:

We have not seen it for thirteen years. Katie Leary, our old housekeeper, who has been in our
service more than twenty-four years, cried when she told me about it to-day. She said, "I had
forgotten it was so beautiful, and it brought Mrs. Clemens right back to me--in that old time
when she was so young and lovely."

Clara Clemens had not recovered from the strain of her mother's long illness and the shock
of her death, and she was ordered into retirement with the care of a trained nurse. The life
at 21 Fifth Avenue, therefore, began with only two remaining members of the broken family --Clemens
and Jean.

Clemens had undertaken to divert himself with work at Tyringham, though without much success.
He was not well; he was restless and disturbed; his heart bleak with a great loneliness. He
prepared an article on Copyright for the 'North American Review',--[Published Jan., 7905. A
dialogue presentation of copyright conditions, addressed to Thorwald Stolberg, Register of
Copyrights, Washington, D. C. One of the best of Mark Twain's papers on the subject.]--and
he began, or at least contemplated, that beautiful fancy, 'Eve's Diary', which in the widest
and most reverential sense, from the first word to the last, conveys his love, his worship,
and his tenderness for the one he had laid away. Adam's single comment at the end, "Wheresoever
she was, there was Eden," was his own comment, and is perhaps the most tenderly beautiful line
he ever wrote. These two books, Adam's Diary and Eve's--amusing and sometimes absurd as they
are, and so far removed from the literal--are as autobiographic as anything he has done, and
one of them as lovely in its truth. Like the first Maker of men, Mark Twain created Adam in
his own image; and his rare Eve is no less the companion with whom, half a lifetime before,
he had begun the marriage journey. Only here the likeness ceases. No Serpent ever entered their
Eden. And they never left it; it traveled with them so long as they remained together.

In the Christmas Harper for 1904 was published "Saint Joan of Arc"--the same being the Joan
introduction prepared in London five years before. Joan's proposed beatification had stirred
a new interest in the martyred girl, and this most beautiful article became a sort of key-note
of the public heart. Those who read it were likely to go back and read the Recollections, and
a new appreciation grew for that masterpiece. In his later and wider acceptance by his own
land, and by the world at large, the book came to be regarded with a fresh understanding. Letters
came from scores of readers, as if it were a newly issued volume. A distinguished educator wrote:

    I would rather have written your history of Joan of Arc than any
    other piece of literature in any language.

And this sentiment grew. The demand for the book increased, and has continued to increase,
steadily and rapidly. In the long and last analysis the good must prevail. A day will come
when there will be as many readers of Joan as of any other of Mark Twain's works.

[The growing appreciation of Joan is shown by the report of sales for the three years following
1904. The sales for that year in America were 1,726; for 1905, 2,445 for 1906, 5,381; for 1907,
6,574. At this point it passed Pudd'nhead Wilson, the Yankee, The Gilded Age, Life on the Mississippi,
overtook the Tramp Abroad, and more than doubled The American Claimant. Only The Innocents
Abroad, Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, and Roughing It still ranged ahead of it, in the order
named.]

LIFE AT 21 FIFTH AVENUE

The house at 21 Fifth Avenue, built by the architect who had designed Grace Church, had a distinctly
ecclesiastical suggestion about its windows, and was of fine and stately proportions within.
It was a proper residence for a venerable author and a sage, and with the handsome Hartford
furnishings distributed through it, made a distinctly suitable setting for Mark Twain. But
it was lonely for him. It lacked soul. He believed that he would play it himself when he needed
the comfort of harmony, and that Jean, who had not received musical training, or his secretary
could also play to him. He had a passion for music, or at least for melody and stately rhythmic
measures, though his ear was not attuned to what are termed the more classical compositions.
For Wagner, for instance, he cared little, though in a letter to Mrs. Crane he said:

Certainly nothing in the world is so solemn and impressive and so divinely beautiful as "Tannhauser."
It ought to be used as a religious service.

Beethoven's sonatas and symphonies also moved him deeply. Once, writing to Jean, he asked:

What is your favorite piece of music, dear? Mine is Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. I have found
that out within a day or two.

It was the majestic movement and melodies of the second part that he found most satisfying;
but he oftener inclined to the still tenderer themes of Chopin's nocturnes and one of Schubert's
impromptus, while the "Lorelei" and the "Erlking" and the Scottish airs never wearied him.
Music thus became a chief consolation during these lonely days--rich organ harmonies that filled
the emptiness of his heart and beguiled from dull, material surroundings back into worlds and
dreams that he had known and laid away.

He went out very little that winter--usually to the homes of old and intimate friends. Once
he attended a small dinner given him by George Smalley at the Metropolitan Club; but it was
a private affair, with only good friends present. Still, it formed the beginning of his return
to social life, and it was not in his nature to retire from the brightness of human society,
or to submerge himself in mourning. As the months wore on he appeared here and there, and took
on something of his old-time habit. Then his annual bronchitis appeared, and he was confined
a good deal to his home, where he wrote or planned new reforms and enterprises.

The improvement of railway service, through which fewer persons should be maimed and destroyed
each year, interested him. He estimated that the railroads and electric lines killed and wounded
more than all of the wars combined, and he accumulated statistics and prepared articles on
the subject, though he appears to have offered little of such matter for publication. Once,
however, when his sympathy was awakened by the victim of a frightful trolley and train collision
in Newark, New Jersey, he wrote a letter which promptly found its way into print.

    DEAR MISS MADELINE, Your good & admiring & affectionate brother has
    told me of your sorrowful share in the trolley disaster which
    brought unaccustomed tears to millions of eyes & fierce resentment
    against those whose criminal indifference to their responsibilities
    caused it, & the reminder has brought back to me a pang out of that
    bygone time. I wish I could take you sound & whole out of your bed
    & break the legs of those officials & put them in it--to stay there.
    For in my spirit I am merciful, and would not break their necks &
    backs also, as some would who have no feeling.

    It is your brother who permits me to write this line--& so it is not
    an intrusion, you see.

    May you get well-& soon!
                     Sincerely yours,
                                S. L. CLEMENS.

A very little later he was writing another letter on a similar subject to St. Clair McKelway,
who had narrowly escaped injury in a railway accident.

    DEAR McKELWAY, Your innumerable friends are grateful, most grateful.

    As I understand the telegrams, the engineers of your train had never
    seen a locomotive before . . . . The government's official
    report, showing that our railways killed twelve hundred persons last
    year & injured sixty thousand, convinces me that under present
    conditions one Providence is not enough properly & efficiently to
    take care of our railroad business. But it is characteristically
    American--always trying to get along short-handed & save wages.

A massacre of Jews in Moscow renewed his animosity for semi-barbaric Russia. Asked for a Christmas
sentiment, he wrote:

    It is my warm & world-embracing Christmas hope that all of us that
    deserve it may finally be gathered together in a heaven of rest &
    peace, & the others permitted to retire into the clutches of Satan,
    or the Emperor of Russia, according to preference--if they have a
    preference.

An article, "The Tsar's Soliloquy," written at this time, was published in the North American
Review for March (1905). He wrote much more, but most of the other matter he put aside. On
a subject like that he always discarded three times as much as he published, and it was usually
about three times as terrific as that which found its way into type. "The Soliloquy," however,
is severe enough. It represents the Tsar as contemplating himself without his clothes, and
reflecting on what a poor human specimen he presents:

    Is it this that 140,000,000 Russians kiss the dust before and
    worship?--manifestly not! No one could worship this spectacle which
    is Me. Then who is it, what is it, that they worship? Privately,
    none knows better than I: it is my clothes! Without my clothes I
    should be as destitute of authority as any other naked person. No
    one could tell me from a parson and barber tutor. Then who is the
    real Emperor of Russia! My clothes! There is no other.

The emperor continues this fancy, and reflects on the fierce cruelties that are done in his
name. It was a withering satire on Russian imperialism, and it stirred a wide response. This
encouraged Clemens to something even more pretentious and effective in the same line. He wrote
"King Leopold's Soliloquy," the reflections of the fiendish sovereign who had maimed and slaughtered
fifteen millions of African subjects in his greed--gentle, harmless blacks-men, women, and
little children whom he had butchered and mutilated in his Congo rubber-fields. Seldom in the
history of the world have there been such atrocious practices as those of King Leopold in the
Congo, and Clemens spared nothing in his picture of them. The article was regarded as not quite
suitable for magazine publication, and it was given to the Congo Reform Association and issued
as a booklet for distribution, with no return to the author, who would gladly have written
a hundred times as much if he could have saved that unhappy race and have sent Leopold to the
electric chair.--[The book was price-marked twenty-five cents, but the returns from such as
were sold went to the cause. Thousands of them were distributed free. The Congo, a domain four
times as large as the German empire, had been made the ward of Belgium at a convention in Berlin
by the agreement of fourteen nations, America and thirteen European states. Leopold promptly
seized the country for his personal advantage and the nations apparently found themselves powerless
to depose him. No more terrible blunder was ever committed by an assemblage of civilized people.]

Various plans and movements were undertaken for Congo reform, and Clemens worked and wrote
letters and gave his voice and his influence and exhausted his rage, at last, as one after
another of the half-organized and altogether futile undertakings showed no results. His interest
did not die, but it became inactive. Eventually he declared: "I have said all I can say on
that terrible subject. I am heart and soul in any movement that will rescue the Congo and hang
Leopold, but I cannot write any more."

His fires were likely to burn themselves out, they raged so fiercely. His final paragraph on
the subject was a proposed epitaph for Leopold when time should have claimed him. It ran:

    Here under this gilded tomb lies rotting the body of one the smell
    of whose name will still offend the nostrils of men ages upon ages
    after all the Caesars and Washingtons & Napoleons shall have ceased
    to be praised or blamed & been forgotten--Leopold of Belgium.

Clemens had not yet lost interest in the American policy in the Philippines, and in his letters
to Twichell he did not hesitate to criticize the President's attitude in this and related matters.
Once, in a moment of irritation, he wrote:

    DEAR JOE,--I knew I had in me somewhere a definite feeling about the
    President. If I could only find the words to define it with! Here
    they are, to a hair--from Leonard Jerome:

    "For twenty years I have loved Roosevelt the man, and hated
    Roosevelt the statesman and politician."

    It's mighty good. Every time in twenty-five years that I have met
    Roosevelt the man a wave of welcome has streaked through me with the
    hand-grip; but whenever (as a rule) I meet Roosevelt the statesman &
    politician I find him destitute of morals & not respect-worthy. It
    is plain that where his political self & party self are concerned he
    has nothing resembling a conscience; that under those inspirations
    he is naively indifferent to the restraints of duty & even unaware
    of them; ready to kick the Constitution into the back yard whenever
    it gets in his way....

    But Roosevelt is excusable--I recognize it & (ought to) concede it.
    We are all insane, each in his own way, & with insanity goes
    irresponsibility. Theodore the man is sane; in fairness we ought to
    keep in mind that Theodore, as statesman & politician, is insane &
    irresponsible.

He wrote a great deal more from time to time on this subject; but that is the gist of his conclusions,
and whether justified by time, or otherwise, it expresses today the deduction of a very large
number of people. It is set down here, because it is a part of Mark Twain's history, and also
because a little while after his death there happened to creep into print an incomplete and
misleading note (since often reprinted), which he once made in a moment of anger, when he was
in a less judicial frame of mind. It seems proper that a man's honest sentiments should be
recorded concerning the nation's servants.

Clemens wrote an article at this period which he called the "War Prayer." It pictured the young
recruits about to march away for war--the excitement and the celebration--the drum-beat and
the heart-beat of patriotism--the final assembly in the church where the minister utters that
tremendous invocation:

           God the all-terrible! Thou who ordainest,
           Thunder, Thy clarion, and lightning, Thy sword!

and the "long prayer" for victory to the nation's armies. As the prayer closes a white-robed
stranger enters, moves up the aisle, and takes the preacher's place; then, after some moments
of impressive silence, he begins:

    "I come from the Throne-bearing a message from Almighty God!.....
    He has heard the prayer of His servant, your shepherd, & will grant
    it if such shall be your desire after I His messenger shall have
    explained to you its import--that is to say its full import. For it
    is like unto many of the prayers of men in that it asks for more
    than he who utters it is aware of--except he pause & think.

    "God's servant & yours has prayed his prayer. Has he paused & taken
    thought? Is it one prayer? No, it is two--one uttered, the other
    not. Both have reached the ear of Him who heareth all
    supplications, the spoken & the unspoken . . . .

    "You have heard your servant's prayer--the uttered part of it. I am
    commissioned of God to put into words the other part of it--that
    part which the pastor--and also you in your hearts--fervently
    prayed, silently. And ignorantly & unthinkingly? God grant that it
    was so! You heard these words: 'Grant us the victory, O Lord our
    God!' That is sufficient. The whole of the uttered prayer is
    completed into those pregnant words.

    "Upon the listening spirit of God the Father fell also the unspoken
    part of the prayer. He commandeth me to put it into words. Listen!

       "O Lord our Father, our young patriots, idols of our hearts, go
       forth to battle--be Thou near them! With them--in spirit--we
       also go forth from the sweet peace of our beloved firesides to
       smite the foe.

       "O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody
       shreds with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields
       with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the
       thunder of the guns with the wounded, writhing in pain; help us
       to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help
       us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with
       unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their
       little children to wander unfriended through wastes of their
       desolated land in rags & hunger & thirst, sport of the sun-
       flames of summer & the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit,
       worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave &
       denied it--for our sakes, who adore Thee, Lord, blast their
       hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage,
       make heavy their steps, water their way with their tears, stain
       the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet! We ask of
       one who is the Spirit of love & who is the ever-faithful refuge
       & friend of all that are sore beset, & seek His aid with humble
       & contrite hearts. Grant our prayer, O Lord; & Thine shall be
       the praise & honor & glory now & ever, Amen."

       (After a pause.) "Ye have prayed it; if ye still desire it,
       speak!--the messenger of the Most High waits."

              . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

       It was believed, afterward, that the man was a lunatic, because
       there was no sense in what he said.

To Dan Beard, who dropped in to see him, Clemens read the "War Prayer," stating that he had
read it to his daughter Jean, and others, who had told him he must not print it, for it would
be regarded as sacrilege.

"Still you--are going to publish it, are you not?"

Clemens, pacing up and down the room in his dressing-gown and slippers, shook his head.

"No," he said, "I have told the whole truth in that, and only dead men can tell the truth in
this world. It can be published after I am dead."

He did not care to invite the public verdict that he was a lunatic, or even a fanatic with
a mission to destroy the illusions and traditions and conclusions of mankind. To Twichell he
wrote, playfully but sincerely:

Am I honest? I give you my word of honor (privately) I am not. For seven years I have suppressed
a book which my conscience tells me I ought to publish. I hold it a duty to publish it. There
are other difficult duties which I am equal to, but I am not equal to that one. Yes, even I
am dishonest. Not in many ways, but in some. Forty-one, I think it is. We are certainly all
honest in one or several ways--every man in the world--though I have a reason to think I am
the only one whose blacklist runs so light. Sometimes I feel lonely enough in this lofty solitude.

It was his Gospel he referred to as his unpublished book, his doctrine of Selfishness, and
of Man the irresponsible Machine. To Twichell he pretended to favor war, which he declared,
to his mind, was one of the very best methods known of diminishing the human race.

What a life it is!--this one! Everything we try to do, somebody intrudes & obstructs it. After
years of thought & labor I have arrived within one little bit of a step of perfecting my invention
for exhausting the oxygen in the globe's air during a stretch of two minutes, & of course along
comes an obstructor who is inventing something to protect human life. Damn such a world anyway.

He generally wrote Twichell when he had things to say that were outside of the pale of print.
He was sure of an attentive audience of one, and the audience, whether it agreed with him or
not, would at least understand him and be honored by his confidence. In one letter of that
year he said:

I have written you to-day, not to do you a service, but to do myself one. There was bile in
me. I had to empty it or lose my day to-morrow. If I tried to empty it into the North American
Review--oh, well, I couldn't afford the risk. No, the certainty! The certainty that I wouldn't
be satisfied with the result; so I would burn it, & try again to-morrow; burn that and try
again the next day. It happens so nearly every time. I have a family to support, & I can't
afford this kind of dissipation. Last winter when I was sick I wrote a magazine article three
times before I got it to suit me. I Put $500 worth of work on it every day for ten days, &
at last when I got it to suit me it contained but 3,000 words-$900. I burned it & said I would
reform.

And I have reformed. I have to work my bile off whenever it gets to where I can't stand it,
but I can work it off on you economically, because I don't have to make it suit me. It may
not suit you, but that isn't any matter; I'm not writing it for that. I have used you as an
equilibrium--restorer more than once in my time, & shall continue, I guess. I would like to
use Mr. Rogers, & he is plenty good-natured enough, but it wouldn't be fair to keep him rescuing
me from my leather-headed business snarls & make him read interminable bile-irruptions besides;
I can't use Howells, he is busy & old & lazy, & won't stand it; I dasn't use Clara, there's
things I have to say which she wouldn't put up with--a very dear little ashcat, but has claws.
And so--you're It.

    [See the preface to the "Autobiography of Mark Twain": 'I am writing
    from the grave. On these terms only can a man be approximately
    frank. He cannot be straitly and unqualifiedly frank either in the
    grave or out of it.' D.W.]

A SUMMER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

He took for the summer a house at Dublin, New Hampshire, the home of Henry Copley Greene, Lone
Tree Hill, on the Monadnock slope. It was in a lovely locality, and for neighbors there were
artists, literary people, and those of kindred pursuits, among them a number of old friends.
Colonel Higginson had a place near by, and Abbott H. Thayer, the painter, and George de Forest
Brush, and the Raphael Pumpelly family, and many more.

Colonel Higginson wrote Clemens a letter of welcome as soon as the news got out that he was
going to Dublin; and Clemens, answering, said:

    I early learned that you would be my neighbor in the summer & I
    rejoiced, recognizing in you & your family a large asset. I hope
    for frequent intercourse between the two households. I shall have
    my youngest daughter with me. The other one will go from the rest-
    cure in this city to the rest-cure in Norfolk, Connecticut; & we
    shall not see her before autumn. We have not seen her since the
    middle of October.

    Jean, the younger daughter, went to Dublin & saw the house & came
    back charmed with it. I know the Thayers of old--manifestly there
    is no lack of attractions up there. Mrs. Thayer and I were
    shipmates in a wild excursion perilously near 40 years ago.

    Aldrich was here half an hour ago, like a breeze from over the
    fields, with the fragrance still upon his spirit. I am tired
    wanting for that man to get old.

They went to Dublin in May, and became at once a part of the summer colony which congregated
there. There was much going to and fro among the different houses, pleasant afternoons in the
woods, mountain-climbing for Jean, and everywhere a spirit of fine, unpretentious comradeship.

The Copley Greene house was romantically situated, with a charming outlook. Clemens wrote to
Twichell:

    We like it here in the mountains, in the shadows of Monadnock. It
    is a woody solitude. We have no near neighbors. We have neighbors
    and I can see their houses scattered in the forest distances, for we
    live on a hill. I am astonished to find that I have known 8 of
    these 14 neighbors a long time; 10 years is the shortest; then seven
    beginning with 25 years & running up to 37 years' friendship. It is
    the most remarkable thing I ever heard of.

This letter was written in July, and he states in it that he has turned out one hundred thousand
words of a large manuscript. . It was a fantastic tale entitled "3,000 Years among the Microbes,"
a sort of scientific revel--or revelry--the autobiography of a microbe that had been once a
man, and through a failure in a biological experiment transformed into a cholera germ when
the experimenter was trying to turn him into a bird. His habitat was the person of a disreputable
tramp named Blitzowski, a human continent of vast areas, with seething microbic nations and
fantastic life problems. It was a satire, of course --Gulliver's Lilliput outdone--a sort of
scientific, socialistic, mathematical jamboree.

He tired of it before it reached completion, though not before it had attained the proportions
of a book of size. As a whole it would hardly have added to his reputation, though it is not
without fine and humorous passages, and certainly not without interest. Its chief mission was
to divert him mentally that summer during, those days and nights when he would otherwise have
been alone and brooding upon his loneliness.--[For extracts from "3,000 Years among the Microbes"

His inability to reproduce faces in his mind's eye he mourned as an increasing calamity. Photographs
were lifeless things, and when he tried to conjure up the faces of his dead they seemed to
drift farther out of reach; but now and then kindly sleep brought to him something out of that
treasure-house where all our realities are kept for us fresh and fair, perhaps for a day when
we may claim them again. Once he wrote to Mrs. Crane:

    SUSY DEAR,--I have had a lovely dream. Livy, dressed in black, was
    sitting up in my bed (here) at my right & looking as young & sweet
    as she used to when she was in health. She said, "What is the name
    of your sweet sister?" I said, "Pamela." "Oh yes, that is it, I
    thought it was--(naming a name which has escaped me) won't you write
    it down for me?" I reached eagerly for a pen & pad, laid my hands
    upon both, then said to myself, "It is only a dream," and turned
    back sorrowfully & there she was still. The conviction flamed
    through me that our lamented disaster was a dream, & this a reality.
    I said, "How blessed it is, how blessed it is, it was all a dream,
    only a dream!" She only smiled and did not ask what dream I meant,
    which surprised me. She leaned her head against mine & kept saying,
    "I was perfectly sure it was a dream; I never would have believed it
    wasn't." I think she said several things, but if so they are gone
    from my memory. I woke & did not know I had been dreaming. She was
    gone. I wondered how she could go without my knowing it, but I did
    not spend any thought upon that. I was too busy thinking of how
    vivid & real was the dream that we had lost her, & how unspeakably
    blessed it was to find that it was not true & that she was still
    ours & with us.

He had the orchestrelle moved to Dublin, although it was no small undertaking, for he needed
the solace of its harmonies; and so the days passed along, and he grew stronger in body and
courage as his grief drifted farther behind him. Sometimes, in the afternoon or in the evening;
when the neighbors had come in for a little while, he would walk up and down and talk in his
old, marvelous way of all the things on land and sea, of the past and of the future, "Of Providence,
foreknowledge, will, and fate," of the friends he had known and of the things he had done,
of the sorrow and absurdities of the world.

It was the same old scintillating, incomparable talk of which Howells once said:

"We shall never know its like again. When he dies it will die with him."

It was during the summer at Dublin that Clemens and Rogers together made up a philanthropic
ruse on Twichell. Twichell, through his own prodigal charities, had fallen into debt, a fact
which Rogers knew. Rogers was a man who concealed his philanthropies when he could, and he
performed many of them of which the world will never know: In this case he said:

"Clemens, I want to help Twichell out of his financial difficulty. I will supply the money
and you will do the giving. Twichell must think it comes from you."

Clemens agreed to this on the condition that he be permitted to leave a record of the matter
for his children, so that he would not appear in a false light to them, and that Twichell should
learn the truth of the gift, sooner or later. So the deed was done, and Twichell and his wife
lavished their thanks upon Clemens, who, with his wife, had more than once been their benefactors,
making the deception easy enough now. Clemens writhed under these letters of gratitude, and
forwarded them to Clara in Norfolk, and later to Rogers himself. He pretended to take great
pleasure in this part of the conspiracy, but it was not an unmixed delight. To Rogers he wrote:

    I wanted her [Clara] to see what a generous father she's got. I
    didn't tell her it was you, but by and by I want to tell her, when I
    have your consent; then I shall want her to remember the letters. I
    want a record there, for my Life when I am dead, & must be able to
    furnish the facts about the Relief-of-Lucknow-Twichell in case I
    fall suddenly, before I get those facts with your consent, before
    the Twichells themselves.

    I read those letters with immense pride! I recognized that I had
    scored one good deed for sure on my halo account. I haven't had
    anything that tasted so good since the stolen watermelon.

    P. S.-I am hurrying them off to you because I dasn't read them
    again! I should blush to my heels to fill up with this unearned
    gratitude again, pouring out of the thankful hearts of those poor
    swindled people who do not suspect you, but honestly believe I gave
    that money.

Mr. Rogers hastily replied:

    MY DEAR CLEMENS,--The letters are lovely. Don't breathe. They are
    so happy! It would be a crime to let them think that you have in
    any way deceived them. I can keep still. You must. I am sending
    you all traces of the crime, so that you may look innocent and tell
    the truth, as you usually do when you think you can escape
    detection. Don't get rattled.

    Seriously. You have done a kindness. You are proud of it, I know.
    You have made your friends happy, and you ought to be so glad as to
    cheerfully accept reproof from your conscience. Joe Wadsworth and I
    once stole a goose and gave it to a poor widow as a Christmas
    present. No crime in that. I always put my counterfeit money on
    the plate. "The passer of the sasser" always smiles at me and I get
    credit for doing generous things. But seriously again, if you do
    feel a little uncomfortable wait until I see you before you tell
    anybody. Avoid cultivating misery. I am trying to loaf ten solid
    days. We do hope to see you soon.

The secret was kept, and the matter presently (and characteristically) passed out of Clemens's
mind altogether. He never remembered to tell Twichell, and it is revealed here, according to
his wish.

The Russian-Japanese war was in progress that summer, and its settlement occurred in August.
The terms of it did not please Mark Twain. When a newspaper correspondent asked him for an
expression of opinion on the subject he wrote:

    Russia was on the highroad to emancipation from an insane and
    intolerable slavery. I was hoping there would be no peace until
    Russian liberty was safe. I think that this was a holy war, in the
    best and noblest sense of that abused term, and that no war was ever
    charged with a higher mission.

    I think there can be no doubt that that mission is now defeated and
    Russia's chain riveted; this time to stay. I think the Tsar will
    now withdraw the small humanities that have been forced from him,
    and resume his medieval barbarisms with a relieved spirit and an
    immeasurable joy. I think Russian liberty has had its last chance
    and has lost it.

    I think nothing has been gained by the peace that is remotely
    comparable to what has been sacrificed by it. One more battle would
    have abolished the waiting chains of billions upon billions of
    unborn Russians, and I wish it could have been fought. I hope I am
    mistaken, yet in all sincerity I believe that this peace is entitled
    to rank as the most conspicuous disaster in political history.

It was the wisest public utterance on the subject--the deep, resonant note of truth sounding
amid a clamor of foolish joy-bells. It was the message of a seer--the prophecy of a sage who
sees with the clairvoyance of knowledge and human understanding. Clemens, a few days later,
was invited by Colonel Harvey to dine with Baron Rosen and M. Sergius Witte; but an attack
of his old malady--rheumatism--prevented his acceptance. His telegram of declination apparently
pleased the Russian officials, for Witte asked permission to publish it, and declared that
he was going to take it home to show to the Tsar. It was as follows:

To COLONEL HARVEY,--I am still a cripple, otherwise I should be more than
glad of this opportunity to meet the illustrious magicians who came here
equipped with nothing but a pen, & with it have divided the honors of the
war with the sword. It is fair to presume that in thirty centuries
history will not get done in admiring these men who attempted what the
world regarded as the impossible & achieved it.
                                   MARK TWAIN.

But this was a modified form. His original draft would perhaps have been
less gratifying to that Russian embassy. If I may, let me in
    all respect and honor salute them as my fellow-humorists, I taking
    third place, as becomes one who was not born to modesty, but by
    diligence & hard work is acquiring it.
                                       MARK.

There was still another form, brief and expressive:

DEAR COLONEL,--No, this is a love-feast; when you call a lodge of sorrow send for me.     
MARK.

Clemens's war sentiment was given the widest newspaper circulation, and brought him many letters,
most of them applauding his words. Charles Francis Adams wrote him:

    It attracted my attention because it so exactly expresses the views
    I have myself all along entertained.

And this was the gist of most of the expressed sentiments which came to him.

Clemens wrote a number of things that summer, among them a little essay entitled, "The Privilege
of the Grave"--that is to say, free speech. He was looking forward, he said, to the time when
he should inherit that privilege, when some of the things he had said, written and laid away,
could be published without damage to his friends or family. An article entitled, "Interpreting
the Deity," he counted as among the things to be uttered when he had entered into that last
great privilege. It is an article on the reading of signs and auguries in all ages to discover
the intentions of the Almighty, with historical examples of God's judgments and vindications.
Here is a fair specimen.

The entire article is in this amusing, satirical strain, and might well enough be printed to-day.
It is not altogether clear why it was withheld, even then.

He finished his Eve's Diary that summer, and wrote a story which was originally planned to
oblige Mrs. Minnie Maddern Fiske, to aid her in a crusade against bullfighting in Spain. Mrs.
Fiske wrote him that she had read his dog story, written against the cruelties of vivisection,
and urged him to do something to save the horses that, after faithful service, were sacrificed
in the bull-ring. Her letter closed:

    I have lain awake nights very often wondering if I dare ask you to
    write a story of an old horse that is finally given over to the
    bull-ring. The story you would write would do more good than all
    the laws we are trying to have made and enforced for the prevention
    of cruelty to animals in Spain. We would translate and circulate
    the story in that country. I have wondered if you would ever write
    it.

    With most devoted homage,
                         Sincerely yours,
                                MINNIE MADDERN FISKE.

Clemens promptly replied:

DEAR MRS. FISKE, I shall certainly write the story. But I may not get it to suit me, in which
case it will go in the fire. Later I will try it again--& yet again--& again. I am used to
this. It has taken me twelve years to write a short story--the shortest one I ever wrote, I
think. --[Probably "The Death Disk:"]--So do not be discouraged; I will stick to this one in
the same way.

                  Sincerely yours,
                                   S. L. CLEMENS.

It was an inspiring subject, and he began work on it immediately. Within a month from the time
he received Mrs. Fiske's letter he had written that pathetic, heartbreaking little story, "A
Horse's Tale," and sent it to Harper's Magazine for illustration. In a letter written to Mr.
Duneka at the time, he tells of his interest in the narrative, and adds:

    This strong interest is natural, for the heroine is my small
    daughter Susy, whom we lost. It was not intentional--it was a good
    while before I found it out, so I am sending you her picture to use
    --& to reproduce with photographic exactness the unsurpassable
    expression & all. May you find an artist who has lost an idol.

He explains how he had put in a good deal of work, with his secretary, on the orchestrelle
to get the bugle-calls.

    We are to do these theatricals this evening with a couple of
    neighbors for audience, and then pass the hat.

It is not one of Mark Twain's greatest stories, but its pathos brings the tears, and no one
can read it without indignation toward the custom which it was intended to oppose. When it
was published, a year later, Mrs. Fiske sent him her grateful acknowledgments, and asked permission
to have it printed for pamphlet circulation m Spain.

A number of more or less notable things happened in this, Mark Twain's seventieth year. There
was some kind of a reunion going on in California, and he was variously invited to attend.
Robert Fulton, of Nevada, was appointed a committee of one to invite him to Reno for a great
celebration which was to be held there. Clemens replied that he remembered, as if it were but
yesterday, when he had disembarked from the Overland stage in front of the Ormsby Hotel, in
Carson City, and told how he would like to accept the invitation.

If I were a few years younger I would accept it, and promptly, and I would go. I would let
somebody else do the oration, but as for me I would talk--just talk. I would renew my youth;
and talk--and talk--and talk--and have the time of my life! I would march the unforgotten and
unforgetable antiques by, and name their names, and give them reverent hail and farewell as
they passed--Goodman, McCarthy, Gillis, Curry, Baldwin, Winters, Howard, Nye, Stewart, Neely
Johnson, Hal Clayton, North, Root--and my brother, upon whom be peace!--and then the desperadoes,
who made life a joy, and the "slaughter-house," a precious possession: Sam Brown, Farmer Pete,
Bill Mayfield, Six-fingered Jake, Jack Williams, and the rest of the crimson discipleship,
and so on, and so on. Believe me, I would start a resurrection it would do you more good to
look at than the next one will, if you go on the way you are going now.

Those were the days!--those old ones. They will come no more; youth will come no more. They
were so full to the brim with the wine of life; there have been no others like them. It chokes
me up to think of them. Would you like me to come out there and cry? It would not beseem my
white head.

Good-by. I drink to you all. Have a good time-and take an old man's blessing.

In reply to another invitation from H. H. Bancroft, of San Francisco, he wrote that his wandering
days were over, and that it was his purpose to sit by the fire for the rest of his "remnant
of life."

    A man who, like me, is going to strike 70 on the 30th of next
    November has no business to be flitting around the way Howells does
    --that shameless old fictitious butterfly. (But if he comes don't
    tell him I said it, for it would hurt him & I wouldn't brush a flake
    of powder from his wing for anything. I only say it in envy of his
    indestructible youth anyway.

Which, by the way, is a perfect example of Mark Twain's humorous manner, the delicately timed
pause, and the afterthought.

AT PIER 70

Mark Twain was nearing seventy, the scriptural limitation of life, and the returns were coming
in. Some one of the old group was dying all the time. The roll-call returned only a scattering
answer. Of his oldest friends, Charles Henry Webb, John Hay, and Sir Henry Irving, all died
that year. When Hay died Clemens gave this message to the press:

    I am deeply grieved, & I mourn with the nation this loss which is
    irreparable. My friendship with Mr. Hay & my admiration of him
    endured 38 years without impairment.

It was only a little earlier that he had written Hay an anonymous letter, a copy of which he
preserved. It here follows:

    DEAR & HONORED SIR,--I never hear any one speak of you & of your
    long roll of illustrious services in other than terms of pride &
    praise--& out of the heart. I think I am right in believing you to
    be the only man in the civil service of the country the cleanness of
    whose motives is never questioned by any citizen, & whose acts
    proceed always upon a broad & high plane, never by accident or
    pressure of circumstance upon a narrow or low one. There are
    majorities that are proud of more than one of the nation's great
    servants, but I believe, & I think I know, that you are the only one
    of whom the entire nation is proud. Proud & thankful.

    Name & address are lacking here, & for a purpose: to leave you no
    chance to make my words a burden to you and a reproach to me, who
    would lighten your burdens if I could, not add to them.

Irving died in October, and Clemens ordered a wreath for his funeral. To MacAlister he wrote:

    I profoundly grieve over Irving's death. It is another reminder.
    My section of the procession has but a little way to go. I could
    not be very sorry if I tried.

Mark Twain, nearing seventy, felt that there was not much left for him to celebrate; and when
Colonel Harvey proposed a birthday gathering in his honor, Clemens suggested a bohemian assembly
over beer and sandwiches in some snug place, with Howells, Henry Rogers, Twichell, Dr. Rice,
Dr. Edward Quintard, Augustus Thomas, and such other kindred souls as were still left to answer
the call. But Harvey had something different in view: something more splendid even than the
sixty-seventh birthday feast, more pretentious, indeed, than any former literary gathering.
He felt that the attainment of seventy years by America's most distinguished man of letters
and private citizen was a circumstance which could not be moderately or even modestly observed.
The date was set five days later than the actual birthday--that is to say, on December 5th,
in order that it might not conflict with the various Thanksgiving holidays and occasions. Delmonico's
great room was chosen for the celebration of it, and invitations were sent out to practically
every writer of any distinction in America, and to many abroad. Of these nearly two hundred
accepted, while such as could not come sent pathetic regrets.

What an occasion it was! The flower of American literature gathered to do honor to its chief.
The whole atmosphere of the place seemed permeated with his presence, and when Colonel Harvey
presented William Dean Howells, and when Howells had read another double-barreled sonnet, and
introduced the guest of the evening with the words, "I will not say, 'O King, live forever,'
but, 'O King, live as long as you like!'" and Mark Twain rose, his snow-white hair gleaming
above that brilliant assembly, it seemed that a world was speaking out in a voice of applause
and welcome. With a great tumult the throng rose, a billow of life, the white handkerchiefs
flying foam-like on its crest. Those who had gathered there realized that it was a mighty moment,
not only in his life but in theirs. They were there to see this supreme embodiment of the American
spirit as he scaled the mountain-top. He, too, realized the drama of that moment--the marvel
of it--and he must have flashed a swift panoramic view backward over the long way he had come,
to stand, as he had himself once expressed it, "for a single, splendid moment on the Alps of
fame outlined against the sun." He must have remembered; for when he came to speak he went
back to the very beginning, to his very first banquet, as he called it, when, as he said, "I
hadn't any hair; I hadn't any teeth; I hadn't any clothes." There was not one who was ashamed
to pay the great tribute of tears.

Many of his old friends, one after another, rose to tell their love for him--Brander Matthews,
Cable, Kate Douglas Riggs, Gilder, Carnegie, Bangs, Bacheller--they kept it up far into the
next morning. No other arrival at Pier 70 ever awoke a grander welcome.

AFTERMATH

The announcement of the seventieth birthday dinner had precipitated a perfect avalanche of
letters, which continued to flow in until the news accounts of it precipitated another avalanche.
The carriers' bags were stuffed with greetings that came from every part of the world, from
every class of humanity. They were all full of love and tender wishes. A card signed only with
initials said: "God bless your old sweet soul for having lived."

Aldrich, who could not attend the dinner, declared that all through the evening he had been
listening in his mind to a murmur of voices in the hall at Delmonico's. A group of English
authors in London combined in a cable of congratulations. Anstey, Alfred Austin, Balfour, Barrie,
Bryce, Chesterton, Dobson, Doyle, Gosse, Hardy, Hope, Jacobs, Kipling, Lang, Parker, Tenniel,
Watson, and Zangwill were among the signatures. It was his observation and his logic that led
him to write those things that, even in their bitterness, somehow conveyed that spirit of human
sympathy which is so closely linked to hope. To Miss Keller he wrote:

"Oh, thank you for your lovely words!"

He was given another birthday celebration that month--this time by the Society of Illustrators.
Dan Beard, president, was also toast-master; and as he presented Mark Twain there was a trumpet-note,
and a lovely girl, costumed as Joan of Arc, entered and, approaching him, presented him with
a laurel wreath. It was planned and carried out as a surprise to him, and he hardly knew for
the moment whether it was a vision or a reality. He was deeply affected, so much so that for
several moments he could not find his voice to make any acknowledgments.

Clemens was more than ever sought now, and he responded when the cause was a worthy one. He
spoke for the benefit of the Russian sufferers at the Casino on December 18th. Madame Sarah
Bernhardt was also there, and spoke in French.

And truly, at seventy, Mark Twain was young, his manner, his movement, his point of view-these
were all, and always, young.

A number of palmists about that time examined impressions of his hand without knowledge as
to the owner, and they all agreed that it was the hand of a man with the characteristics of
youth, with inspiration, and enthusiasm, and sympathy--a lover of justice and of the sublime.
They all agreed, too, that he was a deep philosopher, though, alas! they likewise agreed that
he lacked the sense of humor, which is not as surprising as it sounds, for with Mark Twain
humor was never mere fun-making nor the love of it; rather it was the flower of his philosophy
--its bloom and fragrance.

When the fanfare and drum-beat of his birthday honors had passed by, and a moment of calm had
followed, Mark Twain set down some reflections on the new estate he had achieved. The little
paper, which forms a perfect pendant to the "Seventieth Birthday Speech," here follows:

                    OLD AGE

    I think it likely that people who have not been here will be
    interested to know what it is like. I arrived on the thirtieth of
    November, fresh from carefree & frivolous 69, & was disappointed.

    There is nothing novel about it, nothing striking, nothing to thrill
    you & make your eye glitter & your tongue cry out, "Oh, it is
    wonderful, perfectly wonderful!" Yes, it is disappointing. You
    say, "Is this it?--this? after all this talk and fuss of a thousand
    generations of travelers who have crossed this frontier & looked
    about them & told what they saw & felt? Why, it looks just like
    69."

    And that is true. Also it is natural, for you have not come by the
    fast express; you have been lagging & dragging across the world's
    continents behind oxen; when that is your pace one country melts
    into the next one so gradually that you are not able to notice the
    change; 70 looks like 69; 69 looked like 68; 68 looked like 67--& so
    on back & back to the beginning. If you climb to a summit & look
    back--ah, then you see!

    Down that far-reaching perspective you can make out each country &
    climate that you crossed, all the way up from the hot equator to the
    ice-summit where you are perched. You can make out where Infancy
    verged into Boyhood; Boyhood into down-lipped Youth; Youth into
    bearded, indefinite Young-Manhood; indefinite Young-Manhood into
    definite Manhood; definite Manhood, with large, aggressive
    ambitions, into sobered & heedful Husbandhood & Fatherhood; these
    into troubled & foreboding Age, with graying hair; this into Old
    Age, white-headed, the temple empty, the idols broken, the
    worshipers in their graves, nothing left but You, a remnant, a
    tradition, belated fag-end of a foolish dream, a dream that was so
    ingeniously dreamed that it seemed real all the time; nothing left
    but You, center of a snowy desolation, perched on the ice-summit,
    gazing out over the stages of that long trek & asking Yourself,
    "Would you do it again if you had the chance?"

THE WRITER MEETS MARK TWAIN

We have reached a point in this history where the narrative becomes mainly personal, and where,
at the risk of inviting the charge of egotism, the form of the telling must change.

It was at the end of 1901 that I first met Mark Twain--at The Players Club on the night when
he made the Founder's Address mentioned in an earlier chapter.

I was not able to arrive in time for the address, but as I reached the head of the stairs I
saw him sitting on the couch at the dining-room entrance, talking earnestly to some one, who,
as I remember it, did not enter into my consciousness at all. I saw only that crown of white
hair, that familiar profile, and heard the slow modulations of his measured speech. I was surprised
to see how frail and old he looked. From his pictures I had conceived him different. I did
not realize that it was a temporary condition due to a period of poor health and a succession
of social demands. I have no idea how long I stood there watching him. He had been my literary
idol from childhood, as he had been of so many others; more than that, for the personality
in his work had made him nothing less than a hero to his readers.

He rose presently to go, and came directly toward me. A year before I had done what new writers
were always doing--I had sent him a book I had written, and he had done what he was always
doing--acknowledged it with a kindly letter. I made my thanks now an excuse for addressing
him. It warmed me to hear him say that he remembered the book, though at the time I confess
I thought it doubtful. Then he was gone; but the mind and ear had photographed those vivid
first impressions that remain always clear.

It was the following spring that I saw him again--at an afternoon gathering, and the memory
of that occasion is chiefly important because I met Mrs. Clemens there for the only time, and
like all who met her, however briefly, felt the gentleness and beauty of her spirit. I think
I spoke with her at two or three different moments during the afternoon, and on each occasion
was impressed with that feeling of acquaintanceship which we immediately experience with those
rare beings whose souls are wells of human sympathy and free from guile. Bret Harte had just
died, and during the afternoon Mr. Clemens asked me to obtain for him some item concerning
the obsequies.

It was more than three years before I saw him again. Meantime, a sort of acquaintance had progressed.
I had been engaged in writing the life of Thomas Nast, the cartoonist, and I had found among
the material a number of letters to Nast from Mark Twain. I was naturally anxious to use those
fine characteristic letters, and I wrote him for his consent. He wished to see the letters,
and the permission that followed was kindness itself. His admiration of Nast was very great.

It was proper, under the circumstances, to send him a copy of the book when it appeared; but
that was 1904, his year of sorrow and absence, and the matter was postponed. Then came the
great night of his seventieth birthday dinner, with an opportunity to thank him in person for
the use of the letters. There was only a brief exchange of words, and it was the next day,
I think, that I sent him a copy of the book. It did not occur to me that I should hear of it again.

We step back a moment here. Something more than a year earlier, through a misunderstanding,
Mark Twain's long association with The Players had been severed. It was a sorrow to him, and
a still greater sorrow to the club. There was a movement among what is generally known' as
the "Round Table Group"--because its members have long had a habit of lunching at a large,
round table in a certain window--to bring him back again. David Munro, associate editor of
the North American Review--"David," a man well loved of men--and Robert Reid, the painter,
prepared this simple document:

                             TO
                         MARK TWAIN
                            from
                        THE CLANSMEN

                  Will ye no come back again?
                  Will ye no come back again?
                  Better lo'ed ye canna be,
                  Will ye no come back again?

It was signed by Munro and by Reid and about thirty others, and it touched Mark Twain deeply.
The lines had always moved him. He wrote:

    TO ROBT. REID & THE OTHERS--

    WELL-BELOVED,--Surely those lovely verses went to Prince Charlie's
    heart, if he had one, & certainly they have gone to mine. I shall
    be glad & proud to come back again after such a moving & beautiful
    compliment as this from comrades whom I have loved so long. I hope
    you can poll the necessary vote; I know you will try, at any rate.
    It will be many months before I can foregather with you, for this
    black border is not perfunctory, not a convention; it symbolizes the
    loss of one whose memory is the only thing I worship.

    It is not necessary for me to thank you--& words could not deliver
    what I feel, anyway. I will put the contents of your envelope in
    the small casket where I keep the things which have become sacred to
    me.
                         S. L. C.

So the matter was temporarily held in abeyance until he should return to social life. At the
completion of his seventieth year the club had taken action, and Mark Twain had been brought
back, not in the regular order of things, but as an honorary life member without dues or duties.
There was only one other member of this class, Sir Henry Irving.

The Players, as a club, does not give dinners. Whatever is done in that way is done by one
or more of the members in the private dining-room, where there is a single large table that
holds twenty-five, even thirty when expanded to its limit. That room and that table have mingled
with much distinguished entertainment, also with history. Henry James made his first after-dinner
speech there, for one thing--at least he claimed it was his first, though this is by the way.

A letter came to me which said that those who had signed the plea for the Prince's return were
going to welcome him in the private dining-room on the 5th of January. It was not an invitation,
but a gracious privilege. I was in New York a day or two in advance of the date, and I think
David Munro was the first person I met at The Players. As he greeted me his eyes were eager
with something he knew I would wish to hear. He had been delegated to propose the dinner to
Mark Twain, and had found him propped up in bed, and noticed on the table near him a copy of
the Nast book. I suspect that Munro had led him to speak of it, and that the result had lost
nothing filtered through that radiant benevolence of his.

The night of January 5, 1906, remains a memory apart from other dinners. Brander Matthews presided,
and Gilder was there, and Frank Millet and Willard Metcalf and Robert Reid, and a score of
others; some of them are dead now, David Munro among them. He was no longer frail and thin,
as when I had first met him. He had a robust, rested look; his complexion had the tints of
a miniature painting. Lit by the glow of the shaded candles, relieved against the dusk richness
of the walls, he made a picture of striking beauty. One could not take his eyes from it, and
to one guest at least it stirred the farthest memories. Now here he was, just across the table.
It was the fairy tale come true.

Genung said:

"You should write his life."

His remark seemed a pleasant courtesy, and was put aside as such. When he persisted I attributed
it to the general bloom of the occasion, and a little to the wine, maybe, for the dinner was
in its sweetest stage just then--that happy, early stage when the first glass of champagne,
or the second, has proved its quality. He urged, in support of his idea, the word that Munro
had brought concerning the Nast book, but nothing of what he said kindled any spark of hope.
I could not but believe that some one with a larger equipment of experience, personal friendship,
and abilities had already been selected for the task. By and by the speaking began --delightful,
intimate speaking in that restricted circle--and the matter went out of my mind.

When the dinner had ended, and we were drifting about the table in general talk, I found an
opportunity to say a word to the guest of the evening about his Joan of Arc, which I had recently
re-read. To my happiness, he detained me while he told me the long-ago incident which had led
to his interest, not only in the martyred girl, but in all literature. I think we broke up
soon after, and descended to the lower rooms. At any rate, I presently found the faithful Charles
Genung privately reasserting to me the proposition that I should undertake the biography of
Mark Twain. Perhaps it was the brief sympathy established by the name of Joan of Arc, perhaps
it was only Genung's insistent purpose--his faith, if I may be permitted the word. Whatever
it was, there came an impulse, in the instant of bidding good-by to our guest of honor, which
prompted me to say:

"May I call to see you, Mr. Clemens, some day?"

And something--dating from the primal atom, I suppose--prompted him to answer:

"Yes, come soon."

This was on Wednesday night, or rather on Thursday morning, for it was past midnight, and a
day later I made an appointment with his secretary to call on Saturday.

I can say truly that I set out with no more than the barest hope of success, and wondering
if I should have the courage, when I saw him, even to suggest the thought in my mind. I know
I did not have the courage to confide in Genung that I had made the appointment--I was so sure
it would fail. I arrived at 21 Fifth Avenue and was shown into that long library and drawing-room
combined, and found a curious and deep interest in the books and ornaments along the shelves
as I waited. Then I was summoned, and I remember ascending the stairs, wondering why I had
come on so futile an errand, and trying to think of an excuse to offer for having come at all.

He was propped up in bed--in that stately bed-sitting, as was his habit, with his pillows placed
at the foot, so that he might have always before him the rich, carved beauty of its headboard.
He was delving through a copy of Huckleberry Finn, in search of a paragraph concerning which
some random correspondent had asked explanation. He was commenting unfavorably on this correspondent
and on miscellaneous letter-writing in general. He pushed the cigars toward me, and the talk
of these matters ran along and blended into others more or less personal. By and by I told
him what so many thousands had told him before: what he had meant to me, recalling the childhood
impressions of that large, black-and-gilt-covered book with its wonderful pictures and adventures--the
Mediterranean pilgrimage. Very likely it bored him--he had heard it so often--and he was willing
enough, I dare say, to let me change the subject and thank him for the kindly word which David
Munro had brought. I do not remember what he said then, but I suddenly found myself suggesting
that out of his encouragement had grown a hope--though certainly it was something less--that
I might some day undertake a book about himself. I expected the chapter to end at this point,
and his silence which followed seemed long and ominous. He may have added one or two other
general remarks; then, turning those piercing agate-blue eyes directly upon me, he said:

"When would you like to begin?"

There was a dresser with a large mirror behind him. I mentioned that my family was still in
the country, and that it would require a day or two to get established in the city. I asked
if Tuesday, January 9th, would be too soon to begin. He agreed that Tuesday would do, and inquired
something about my plan of work. Of course I had formed nothing definite, but I said that in
similar undertakings a part of the work had been done with a stenographer, who had made the
notes while I prompted the subject to recall a procession of incidents and episodes, to be
supplemented with every variety of material obtainable--letters and other documentary accumulations.
We can have the dictation here in the morning, and you can put in the rest of the day to suit
yourself. You can have a key and come and go as you please."

That was always his way. He did nothing by halves; nothing without unquestioning confidence
and prodigality. He got up and showed me the lovely luxury of the study, with its treasures
of material. I did not believe it true yet. It had all the atmosphere of a dream, and I have
no distinct recollection of how I came away. When I returned to The Players and found Charles
Harvey Genung there, and told him about it, it is quite certain that he perjured himself when
he professed to believe it true and pretended that he was not surprised.

CCXXXIX

WORKING WITH MARK TWAIN

On Tuesday, January 9, 1906, I was on hand with a capable stenographer --Miss Josephine Hobby,
who had successively, and successfully, held secretarial positions with Charles Dudley Warner
and Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge, and was therefore peculiarly qualified for the work in hand.

Clemens, meantime, had been revolving our plans and adding some features of his own. He proposed
to double the value and interest of our employment by letting his dictations continue the form
of those earlier autobiographical chapters, begun with Redpath in 1885, and continued later
in Vienna and at the Villa Quarto. He said he did not think he could follow a definite chronological
program; that he would like to wander about, picking up this point and that, as memory or fancy
prompted, without any particular biographical order. It was his purpose, he declared, that
his dictations should not be published until he had been dead a hundred years or more--a prospect
which seemed to give him an especial gratification.--[As early as October, 1900, he had proposed
to Harper & Brothers a contract for publishing his personal memoirs at the expiration of one
hundred years from date; and letters covering the details were exchanged with Mr. Rogers. The
document, however, was not completed.]

He wished to pay the stenographer, and to own these memoranda, he said, allowing me free access
to them for any material I might find valuable. I could also suggest subjects for dictation,
and ask particulars of any special episode or period. I believe this covered the whole arrangement,
which did not require more than five minutes, and we set to work without further prologue.

I ought to state that he was in bed when we arrived, and that he remained there during almost
all of these earlier dictations, clad in a handsome silk dressing-gown of rich Persian pattern,
propped against great snowy pillows. He loved this loose luxury and ease, and found it conducive
to thought. On the little table beside him, where lay his cigars, papers, pipes, and various
knickknacks, shone a reading-lamp, making more brilliant the rich coloring of his complexion
and the gleam of his shining hair. There was daylight, too, but it was north light, and the
winter days were dull. Also the walls of the room were a deep, unreflecting red, and his eyes
were getting old. The outlines of that vast bed blending into the luxuriant background, the
whole focusing to the striking central figure, remain in my mind to-day--a picture of classic
value.

He dictated that morning some matters connected with the history of the Comstock mine; then
he drifted back to his childhood, returning again to the more modern period, and closed, I
think, with some comments on current affairs. It was absorbingly interesting; his quaint, unhurried
fashion of speech, the unconscious movement of his hands, the play of his features as his fancies
and phrases passed in mental review and were accepted or waved aside. We were watching one
of the great literary creators of his time in the very process of his architecture. We constituted
about the most select audience in the world enjoying what was, likely enough, its most remarkable
entertainment. It was always delightful, and always amusing, tragic, or instructive, and it
was likely to be one of these at one instant, and another the next. I felt myself the most
fortunate biographer in the world, as undoubtedly I was, though not just in the way that I
first imagined.

It was not for several weeks that I began to realize that these marvelous reminiscences bore
only an atmospheric relation to history; that they were aspects of biography rather than its
veritable narrative, and built largely--sometimes wholly--from an imagination that, with age,
had dominated memory, creating details, even reversing them, yet with a perfect sincerity of
purpose on the part of the narrator to set down the literal and unvarnished truth. It was his
constant effort to be frank and faithful to fact, to record, to confess, and to condemn without
stint. If you wanted to know the worst of Mark Twain you had only to ask him for it. He would
give it, to the last syllable--worse than the worst, for his imagination would magnify it and
adorn it with new iniquities, and if he gave it again, or a dozen times, he would improve upon
it each time, until the thread of history was almost impossible to trace through the marvel
of that fabric; and he would do the same for another person just as willingly. Those vividly
real personalities that he marched and countermarched before us were the most convincing creatures
in the world; the most entertaining, the most excruciatingly humorous, or wicked, or tragic;
but, alas, they were not always safe to include in a record that must bear a certain semblance
to history. They often disagreed in their performance, and even in their characters, with the
documents in the next room, as I learned by and by when those records, disentangled, began
to rebuild the structure of the years.

His gift of dramatization had been exercised too long to be discarded now. The things he told
of Mrs. Clemens and of Susy were true --marvelously and beautifully true, in spirit and in
aspect--and the actual detail of these mattered little in such a record. The rest was history
only as 'Roughing It' is history, or the 'Tramp Abroad'; that is to say, it was fictional history,
with fact as a starting-point. In a prefatory note to these volumes we have quoted Mark Twain's
own lovely and whimsical admission, made once when he realized his deviations:

"When I was younger I could remember anything, whether it happened or not; but I am getting
old, and soon I shall remember only the latter."

At another time he paraphrased one of Josh Billings's sayings in the remark: "It isn't so astonishing,
the number of things that I can remember, as the number of things I can remember that aren't so."

I do not wish to say, by any means, that his so-called autobiography is a mere fairy tale.
It is far from that. It is amazingly truthful in the character-picture it represents of the
man himself. It is only not reliable--and it is sometimes even unjust--as detailed history.
Yet, curiously enough, there were occasional chapters that were photographically exact, and
fitted precisely with the more positive, if less picturesque, materials. It is also true that
such chapters were likely to be episodes intrinsically so perfect as to not require the touch
of art.

In the talks which we usually had, when the dictations were ended and Miss Hobby had gone,
I gathered much that was of still greater value. Imagination was temporarily dispossessed,
as it were, and, whether expounding some theory or summarizing some event, he cared little
for literary effect, and only for the idea and the moment immediately present.

It was at such times that he allowed me to make those inquiries we had planned in the beginning,
and which apparently had little place in the dictations themselves. Sometimes I led him to
speak of the genesis of his various books, how he had come to write them, and I think there
was not a single case where later I did not find his memory of these matters almost exactly
in accord with the letters of the moment, written to Howells or Twichell, or to some member
of his family. Such reminiscence was usually followed by some vigorous burst of human philosophy,
often too vigorous for print, too human, but as dazzling as a search-light in its revelation.

It was during this earlier association that he propounded, one day, his theory of circumstance,
already set down, that inevitable sequence of cause and effect, beginning with the first act
of the primal atom. He had been dictating that morning his story of the clairvoyant dream which
preceded his brother's death, and the talk of foreknowledge had continued. I said one might
logically conclude from such a circumstance that the future was a fixed quantity.

"As absolutely fixed as the past," he said; and added the remark already quoted.--[Chap. lxxv]
A little later he continued:

"Even the Almighty Himself cannot check or change that sequence of events once it is started.
It is a fixed quantity, and a part of the scheme is a mental condition during certain moments
usually of sleep--when the mind may reach out and grasp some of the acts which are still to come."

It was a new angle to me--a line of logic so simple and so utterly convincing that I have remained
unshaken in it to this day. I have never been able to find any answer to it, nor any one who
could even attempt to show that the first act of the first created atom did not strike the
key-note of eternity.

At another time, speaking of the idea that God works through man, he burst out:

"Yes, of course, just about as much as a man works through his microbes!"

He had a startling way of putting things like that, and it left not much to say.

I was at this period interested a good deal in mental healing, and had been treated for neurasthenia
with gratifying results. Like most of the world, I had assumed, from his published articles,
that he condemned Christian Science and its related practices out of hand. When I confessed,
rather reluctantly, one day, the benefit I had received, he surprised me by answering:

"Of course you have been benefited. Christian Science is humanity's boon. Mother Eddy deserves
a place in the Trinity as much as any member of it. She has organized and made available a
healing principle that for two thousand years has never been employed, except as the merest
kind of guesswork. She is the benefactor of the age."

It seemed strange, at the time, to hear him speak in this way concerning a practice of which
he was generally regarded as the chief public antagonist. It was another angle of his many-sided
character.

CCXL

THE DEFINITION OF A GENTLEMAN

That was a busy winter for him socially. He was constantly demanded for this thing and that--for
public gatherings, dinners--everywhere he was a central figure. Once he presided at a Valentine
dinner given by some Players to David Munro. He had never presided at a dinner before, he said,
and he did it in his own way, which certainly was a taking one, suitable to that carefree company
and occasion--a real Scotch occasion, with the Munro tartan everywhere, the table banked with
heather, and a wild piper marching up and down in the anteroom, blowing savage airs in honor
of Scotland's gentlest son.

An important meeting of that winter was at Carnegie Hall--a great gathering which had assembled
for the purpose of aiding Booker T. Washington in his work for the welfare of his race. The
stage and the auditorium were thronged with notables. Joseph H. Choate and Mark Twain presided,
and both spoke; also Robert C. Ogden and Booker T. Washington himself. It was all fine and
interesting. Choate's address was ably given, and Mark Twain was at his best. He talked of
politics and of morals--public and private--how the average American citizen was true to his
Christian principles three hundred and sixty-three days in the year, and how on the other two
days of the year he left those principles at home and went to the tax-office and the voting-booths,
and did his best to damage and undo his whole year's faithful and righteous work.

I had never heard him address a miscellaneous audience. It was marvelous to see how he convulsed
it, and silenced it, and controlled it at will. He did not undertake any special pleading for
the negro cause; he only prepared the way with cheerfulness.

Clemens and Choate joined forces again, a few weeks later, at a great public meeting assembled
in aid of the adult blind. Helen Keller was to be present, but she had fallen ill through overwork.
She sent to Clemens one of her beautiful letters, in which she said:

    I should be happy if I could have spelled into my hand the words as
    they fall from your lips, and receive, even as it is uttered, the
    eloquence of our newest ambassador to the blind.

Clemens, dictating the following morning, told of his first meeting with Helen Keller at a
little gathering in Lawrence Hutton's home, when she was about the age of fourteen. It was
an incident that invited no elaboration, and probably received none.

    Henry Rogers and I went together. The company had all assembled and
    had been waiting a while. The wonderful child arrived now with her
    about equally wonderful teacher, Miss Sullivan, and seemed quite
    well to recognize the character of her surroundings. She said, "Oh,
    the books, the books, so many, many books. How lovely!"

    The guests were brought one after another. As she shook hands with
    each she took her hand away and laid her fingers lightly against
    Miss Sullivan's lips, who spoke against them the person's name.

    Mr. Howells seated himself by Helen on the sofa, and she put her
    fingers against his lips and he told her a story of considerable
    length, and you could see each detail of it pass into her mind and
    strike fire there and throw the flash of it into her face.

    After a couple of hours spent very pleasantly some one asked if
    Helen would remember the feel of the hands of the company after this
    considerable interval of time and be able to discriminate the hands
    and name the possessors of them. Miss Sullivan said, "Oh, she will
    have no difficulty about that." So the company filed past, shook
    hands in turn, and with each hand-shake Helen greeted the owner of
    the hand pleasantly and spoke the name that belonged to it without
    hesitation.

    By and by the assemblage proceeded to the dining-room and sat down
    to the luncheon. I had to go away before it was over, and as I
    passed by Helen I patted her lightly on the head and passed on.
    Miss Sullivan called to me and said, "Stop, Mr. Clemens, Helen is
    distressed because she did not recognize your hand. Won't you come
    back and do that again?" I went back and patted her lightly on the
    head, and she said at once, "Oh, it's Mr. Clemens."

    Perhaps some one can explain this miracle, but I have never been
    able to do it. Could she feel the wrinkles in my hand through her
    hair? Some one else must answer this.

It was three years following this dictation that the mystery received a very simple and rather
amusing solution. Helen had come to pay a visit to Mark Twain's Connecticut home, Stormfield,
then but just completed. He had met her, meantime, but it had not occurred to him before to
ask her how she had recognized him that morning at Hutton's, in what had seemed such a marvelous
way. She remembered, and with a smile said:

"I smelled you." Which, after all, did not make the incident seem much less marvelous.

On one of the mornings after Miss Hobby had gone Clemens said:

"A very curious thing has happened--a very large-sized-joke." Each girl seized her partner by the
hand and together they leapt across the flaming bonfire. Wild excitement was the order of the
night. It was the festival of the rude, primitive elements of human
nature.

It was a pageant of black shadow and brilliant light. It answered to the spirit of the bleak
moorland, to the steeps of the cliffs, to the mystery of the sea.

Only one man in the whole throng was utterly unmoved by the abandonment around him. Perrin
kept his deep set, keen eyes fixed on Dominic and his partner. He watched them leap with perfect
skill, across the roaring flame of the bonfire. He saw the master bend down, and once more peer
into the white face of the girl. He followed, very stealthily, the two, as they drew apart into
a shadowed place, where, nevertheless, the light from the bonfire could reach and bring their
faces into relief. He watched the girl unfasten her mask and throw it on the grass. He drew a
deep breath. Her face was pitifully ugly. It was covered with the pits and dents and scars that small-pox
had left. The skin was coarse and rough and of a yellowish white.

Her eyes were dim and red and bleared. Her eyebrows and lashes were gone. Her expression was
like that of a furtive, crouching creature who dreaded the lash.

And it came.

"Who are you, I'd like to know!" cried the master in a towering rage, "that has dared to choose
me only to cheat me. Do you know, woman, that you are as ugly as sin!"

He seized her bonnet and dragged it off. Then he burst into a brutal laugh.

"Almost bald, the old crone! I'll pay you out for this trick. Who the devil are you? Quick,
out with it, or else I'll call the other fellows in to help me to find out!"

Perrin moved quite close behind the master, who was too angry to notice him. The girl lifted her
eyes to Dominic. She spoke quietly.

"I am Ellenor Cartier."

"I might have guessed it, fool that I am! And you are a greater to think I would even look at you
now! You must be quite mad. All I ever cared for in you was your devilry, and your eyes that
used to set me all on fire with love. And now you look like a scared rabbit, a white, pinched
thing! And your eyes are hideous! And your hair is gone! How dare you cheat me, you ugly creature!"

She
had clasped her hands together; and gazed at him in stupefaction.

Suddenly, he turned on his heel and cried in a loud, far-carrying voice--

"Come here, you men, all of you, and help me to throw the witch, Ellenor Cartier, into the bonfire!
She's too devilish ugly to live."

The lower sort of the throng laughed uproariously, and turned to stare at the poor girl. But cries
of "Shame! shame!" rent the air. Perrin stepped forward, and, with
a well-planted blow and a skilful twist of his leg, he threw Dominic
to the ground.

"See to the drunken brute!" he cried.
    
    Then he turned to the trembling girl.
    

"Come, Ellenor," he said, with tender reverence, "come with me, I will take you home."

He led her to his mother, who took her up to her own attic and helped
her to get into bed, for the girl shivered with cold one minute and
was in a fever the next.

Perrin, meanwhile, went off to Les Casquets to tell her people that she was safe; and he gave
Jean the story of the evening, for fear he should hear it from strangers.

When he came back to the cottage, Mrs. Corbet was in the kitchen.

    
    "She's asleep at last! But she's cried till I thought she would
    die. I asked her how it was she made herself in such a state; and then
    she told me all the tale.

Silly girl! the very way to upset any man, and still more, Le Mierre,
to show how ugly she is now before all them people.

And, besides, it was all like play acting, to my mind!"

"Oh, no, not like that, mother!"

    

"Wait a bit, wait a bit, till you hears all! It seems, she told me, that she planned she'd do this,
there's weeks ago, while Le Mierre was yet to Jersey, and she had heard he was making love to girls
there."

"But why?"

"Well, listen! She's a strange creature, not like others! It's my belief she comes from those fairies
that built Les Casquets. You remember Perrin?"

"No, tell me."

"Well, once my great-grandfather was on the beach to Portelet, and he saw, a long, long way off
a big ship. It came nearer and nearer, and it was so big that great-grandfather expected to
see it smashed on hidden rocks.

    But, lo and behold, the ship got smaller and at last, bah, it looked
    like the toy of a child, and it ran in on the sand, close to great-grandfather.
    Out of the boat stepped a little chap, and would you believe it,
    the boat was turned into the blade-bone of a sheep, all tangled
    in sea-weed."
    
    "Quick, what happened?"
    
    "Have patience, my son, and don't hurry an old woman. Well, great-grandfather
    asked the little chap where he was going and what was his name. And
    all he would say was "Je vais cheminant." But he stopped
    to Guernsey after all and he married a girl from near here--and
    it was him built Les Casquets. There! that's where she gets her queer
    ways, Ellenor!"

"And now tell me about her plan."

"Well, it seems she thought, foolish girl, she'd find out, for sure, if Le Mierre really loves her
or only her looks. And she couldn't think of no better way than this
mad one.

She can't know much of men and their ways, her!"

"It's the best thing that could have happened, if only it makes her see Le Mierre in his true
colours."

"Well, we must hope for the best. And, look here, Perrin! Nothing he could do before, no wickedness,
no cruelty, could make her leave off caring! But we women, if our looks are held up to scorn--well!--that's
the worst of all. So who can tell what may happen! Come, I must make
her and give her a cup of tea.

    She told me she hadn't eaten or drank all day."
    
    CHAPTER VIII.
    
    It was a wild wet night in March. Dominic Le Mierre had just
    finished supper, and he sat by the fire in the kitchen of Orvillière;
    he was in a particularly good mood, owing to the excellence
    of the tobacco he was smoking. As he puffed at his second pipe he
    congratulated himself on his long acquaintance with Frenchmen,
    who had no scruples in giving him whole packages of this excellent
tobacco; and no conditions attached except the fun of helping to hide
it in the caves below the Haunted House, till it could be conveyed
to Brittany!

    
    
    Then he laughed aloud at the idea of the countryside about this very
    Haunted House.

    He had added two or three ghost tales to those current; and, though
    he believed firmly in every weird story of the two parishes,
    he had not felt a single scruple in inventing others to terrify people
from the spot.

                  His love of lawlessness
                                and danger was infinitely stronger than his inherited faith in the
supernatural.

    The Haunted House brought to his mind the festival of Les Brandons,
when the dreaded place had lost its horror for the time being, owing
to the safety that is supposed to lie in numbers.

He chuckled as he remembered what a fool he had made of Ellenor. Bah! Once and for all he had done
with her! Who cared to look at her now, fright that she was! And how dared that pious idiot
of a fisherman throw him down before all the company! Ah! he would soon teach him better manners!
he would thrash him well next time they met!

So he plotted and thought and smoked, and the night wind howled and the rain beat against the windows.
All at once, he got up, and from the rack fastened across the beamed ceiling he took an old
black book, his friend and evil counsellor, the Grand-Mêle which had been in his family for
generations. It was a book of magic, containing spells to be used on every conceivable occasion,
and Dominic Le Mierre was past-master in the black art. Turning over the pages with knitted
brows, he searched for a spell to be used against Perrin Corbet.

    At last he found it.
    
    "Ah, it is quite easy to draw blood, and it need be but a drop!" he
    muttered, "scratch his hand with my knife and it is done!

Then, he will walk in his sleep to the Haunted House. There I will meet him! Ah, Perrin Corbet,
it will be your turn to be down on the ground! I will see him to-morrow, and the spell will
work for the night.

    Bon, nothing could be better!"
    
    He took up his pipe again and smoked in full contentment. A sudden
    stillness had fallen over the wild night. It seemed to Dominic that
    he could hear the moan of the sea. He listened. His blood crept at
    the weird stillness.
    

Hark! Hush! What was that?

The wild sad cry of a sea-gull. Nearer and nearer it came, and Dominic's eyes were fixed in horror
upon the uncurtained window. The sea-gull came at last quite close, with wilder, sadder cries.
It flapped its wings and circled round and round the casement. Dominic was cold and stiff with
terror. He knew who the sea-gull was, but what did it mean? Some dreadful thing was drawing near
Orvillière.

    "Blaisette!" he cried, "I know you well enough! Why do you come here?"

Wilder,
    more despairing grew the cries. Closer and closer the bird drew
    to the panes, striking them with a twang like the sound of wild music.

With

a curse the master roused himself from the freezing spell. He took his loaded gun from its place
over the chimney piece. He fired. One of the panes of glass was broken. Outside, on the cobbled yard,
the gull lay dead, its glazed eyes fixed on the house.

    With a laugh of triumph, Dominic re-lighted his pipe and sat
    down again by the fire. He had just settled once more to the
    reading of Grand-Mêle when a very tempest of wind and hail shook the
    house, and in the midst of it, a low, sharp knock fell on the house
    door.
    
    This time, the master was not under a spell. He recognized the knock.
    In an instant he was in the entrance hall and had flung open the door.
    A rough, unkempt fisherman stood on the threshold.
    
    "You must come at once, Monsieur," he cried, "there's been great
           luck! A lot of brandy
                            has been brought, unexpected.

It's to the cave below the Haunted House. We could have got it up the cliffs alone. But we all
agreed that you must have your share in the fun."

"Quick! where did the stuff come from?"

"From France, from les Messieurs ----."

"Bon! Will you wait for me?"

"No, my horse is here--tied to the gate. He's impatient, him!

I'll be off to tell the rest you're coming."

"I'll ride too," and Dominic slammed the door, and hurried to the back of the house where his
horses were stabled for the night. He chose out a fleet white one that was used to wild rushes
through the dark. Before he mounted, he fastened a pistol to the saddle; but he laughed as he
did this, it was such a useless precaution. Never once yet had the excisemen appeared within
miles of the Haunted House. With a dark lantern swinging from the saddle bow, he rode out of
the farmyard and cantered up the hill. Then, urging the white mare to her swiftest pace, he
flew through steep lanes, past Torteval Church, and along the high road to Pleinmont.

The rain poured in torrents. The wind roared and howled.

Several times the mare paused, trembling. But Dominic lashed her on, and in pain and terror
she tore across the moorland, striking fire from the stones as she flew. He reined her in at
last and fastened her to a hook in the side wall of the Haunted House. He laughed as he thought what
a help she would be in keeping all comers away, for she seemed to shed a white dim light from
her drenched skin, and her loud breathing might easily be taken for
groans.

    
    
    He scrambled down the face of the cliff. Fortunately, the wind blew
    in from the sea, and in safety he reached a large cave, brilliant
    with the light of many torches. His boon companions, the roughest gangs
    of the two parishes, greeted him with shouts and jests, and an hour
    of drinking and feasting followed. Then, with no little difficulty,
    kegs of brandy were hauled up the cliffs and deposited in the Haunted
    House.

    With wonderful skill, the men worked almost all the while in the
dark, only using lanterns when it was absolutely necessary.

    At last, all the kegs were stowed away.

    The men scattered to fetch their horses from various sheds belonging
to friendly people, and the master of Orvillière was left alone.

    

    

    He looked carefully round at the precious kegs stowed half way up the
    walls. Ah--what was that! One of the barrels leaked! Brandy, velvety
    fragrant brandy was oozing out on the earthen floor! He knelt down
    and caught a few drops in his hand. It was superfine, the best stuff
    he had ever tasted.

Greedily he drank again and again from his hand. But that process was too slow. Catching up
a hatchet, he enlarged the leak, and throwing himself flat on the ground, he lapped the golden
spirit that filled him with ecstasy. At last, he had had enough. He fumbled at the leak, making
futile efforts to stop it. But he was too drunk to know what he was
about.

He had just sense enough to darken his lantern, to reel out of the Haunted House and fling
himself on the drenched grass beside his shivering mare.

Presently his debauch turned into a heavy sleep, and the hours passed.

    Suddenly he woke and sat up. He heard, quite distinctly,
    the sharp click of a horse's hoof. It had rung through his drunken
    sleep like a knell. He had dreamt he heard again the passing bell that
    had tolled for Blaisette.
    
    All at once the click passed into a smothered sound of pounding and
slushing.

    The horse had left the high road and must be on the moorland!

Sobered,
    Le Mierre leapt to his feet, unloosened the mare and jumped on her
    back. He turned her inland and urged her forward. But, trembling
    in every limb, the mare refused to move. Nearer and nearer
    came the pounding of the horse. It stopped. A lantern flashed out.
    Le Mierre saw the figure of a well known exciseman riding a powerful
    black horse. A voice cried above the howling of the wind.
    

"Give yourself up, and all will be well! I've looked for you far and wide. At last I find you. Come,
Le Mierre, don't be a fool about this. It will only be a fine, and perhaps not even that, if
you give up the other chaps."

But the master of Orvillière was not to be reasoned with.

He was in a towering rage. He wrenched the pistol from the saddle. He fired it at the exciseman.
It missed him. But he, too, lost his temper. In an instant he was
beside Le Mierre and had dragged the pistol away and flung it against
the house. Dominic, beside himself and unnerved with the night's carouse,
grappled with the exciseman and tried to throttle him.

A terrible
struggle. A wild pounding of hoofs. Cries and oaths. The fall of the
lantern. Gusts of rain, and wind that shrieked as if an agony of warning.
Then, the mare broke away at last, in a frenzy of terror, and made
straight for the edge of the cliffs behind the Haunted House.

Not
one word came from Dominic Le Mierre as the mare stumbled, fell, and,
with a horrible, almost human cry, rolled over and over down the precipitous
height.

The exciseman dismounted, groped for the lantern, lit it,
and fought his way half down the cliff, at the risk of his life, as
the wind had changed and was blowing out to sea. But there was not
a sign of the mare and her rider.

At the earliest streak of dawn,
the two parishes were roused, and long and careful search went on
for days. But it was all in vain. Somewhere, in the deep seas, perhaps,
the body of the master was at rest, but, after "life's fitful fever,"
did he, indeed "sleep well?"

Orvillière Farm was shut up. The finding
of the dead gull, with a red wound in its white breast, proved conclusively
that foul play and magic had been at work on the night of the storm.
The servant and the housekeeper had been all the evening at a wedding
feast, and when they returned at five o'clock next morning they found
excited groups of people all about the farm, and they heard the story
of the death of Dominic Le Mierre.

No one would dream of living henceforth
at Orvillière. It was haunted. People who were compelled to pass through
the valley at nightfall, saw flickering lights moving from window
to window of the farm, and heard the sudden firing of a gun, and the
plaintive cry of a wounded bird.

The wind sighed about the lonely
spot. The moan of the sea penetrated to the solitary farm. But no
human creature wept for the departed soul of the master of Orvillière.
All shuddered at his end. Two prayed, in defiance of their scruples,
for his wicked, wild soul. And these were only an old woman and her
fisherman son.

CHAPTER IX.

It was a still, beautiful evening in
summer. Perrin Corbet was free till ten o'clock, when he would go
fishing with Jean Cartier. It was very lonely now in the cottage,
for Perrin's mother was dead, and he spent very little time at home.
This special evening he decided to make a pilgrimage to the churchyard
of St. Pierre du Bois where his mother was buried. Her grave was close
to the church in a place of long grass and overshadowing trees. As
Perrin entered the churchyard he saw that a woman was bending over
the grave: he knew at once who it was, and his heart beat quicker.
It was so long since he had seen her and spoken with her!

When he
was quite close, she turned round, and he saw that she had been crying.
On the grave she had put a rude cross of immortelles.

"Ellenor,"
he said quietly, "I did not expect to see you. I thought you were
yet in Sark."

"I came back this morning by the early cutter. I was
longing to get back home."

"And we have been longing for you to come
back! It is kind of you to put flowers here. Ah, it is always a woman
who thinks of those things! We are such stupid creatures, we men!
She who lies here so often said that to me. I miss her more and more,
Ellenor."

"Poor Perrin!" she said softly, and for one long moment
she looked into the faithful face bent over his mother's grave; then
she turned away with a bitter sigh. Perrin lifted his head; not a
thing she did, not a movement, not a sigh of hers ever escaped him.

"What
is it?" he asked, in his low, kind voice, "are you fretting still?"

"No,
no, but it seems I can't forget quickly all that has passed."

She
covered her face with her hands and shuddered. Perrin touched her
arm.

"Come and sit in the church porch," he said, "and tell me all
about it."

Still with her hands covering her face, she let him lead
her to the old stone seat in the grey porch. Presently, with an evident
effort, her hands fell from her face, and she clasped them in her
lap.

"I am selfish," she said, "never once have I told you how sorry
I was to hear of your mother's death, it seems I could only think
of myself."

"I have understood all the time. I knew you would be
sad for me. But, of course, you could not help thinking most of yourself
and of what you have lost."

"Ah, how it hurts to hear you say that!
Tell me, am I very ugly! I know I will get the truth from you."

"Ugly!"
he repeated, "ugly, to me you are the prettiest woman in Guernsey.
Your hair, all growing again in dear little dark rings, like the curls
of a baby! Your eyes once more beautiful with long eyelashes; your
sad mouth! Ah, Ellenor, how can I speak to you like this quietly!
I love you more than ever!

"No," he said, "I am afraid it isn't. We have just had a telephone message that it is even
worse than at first reported. A great fire is consuming the city. Come along to the news-stand
and we'll see if there is a later edition."

We walked to Sixth Avenue and Eighth Street and got some fresh extras. The news was indeed
worse, than at first reported. San Francisco was going to destruction. Clemens was moved deeply,
and began to recall this old friend and that whose lives and property might be in danger. He
spoke of Joe Goodman and the Gillis families, and pictured conditions in the perishing city.

CCXLII

MARK TWAIN'S GOOD-BY TO THE PLATFORM

It was on April 19, 1906, the day following the great earthquake, that Mark Twain gave a "Farewell
Lecture" at Carnegie Hall for the benefit of the Robert Fulton Memorial Association. Some weeks
earlier Gen. Frederick D. Grant, its president, had proposed to pay one thousand dollars for
a Mark Twain lecture; but Clemens' had replied that he was permanently out of the field, and
would never again address any audience that had to pay to hear him.

"I always expect to talk as long as I can get people to listen to me," he sand, "but I never
again expect to charge for it." Later came one of his inspirations, and he wrote: "I will lecture
for one thousand dollars, on one condition: that it will be understood to be my farewell lecture,
and that I may contribute the thousand dollars to the Fulton Association."

It was a suggestion not to be discouraged, and the bills and notices, "Mark Twain's Farewell
Lecture," were published without delay.

I first heard of the matter one afternoon when General Grant had called. Clemens came into
the study where I was working; he often wandered in and out-sometimes without a word, sometimes
to relieve himself concerning things in general. But this time he suddenly chilled me by saying:

"I'm going to deliver my farewell lecture, and I want you to appear on the stage and help me."

I feebly expressed my pleasure at the prospect. Then he said:

"I am going to lecture on Fulton--on the story of his achievements. It will be a burlesque,
of course, and I am going to pretend to forget my facts, and I want you to sit there in a chair.
Now and then, when I seem to get stuck, I'll lean over and pretend to ask you some thing, and
I want you to pretend to prompt me. You don't need to laugh, or to pretend to be assisting
in the performance any more than just that." HANDBILL OF MARK TWAIN'S "FAREWELL LECTURE":

                      MARK TWAIN

             Will Deliver His Farewell Lecture
            ---------------------------------

                    CARNEGIE HALL

It was not likely that I should laugh. I had a sinking feeling in the cardiac region which
does not go with mirth. It did not for the moment occur to me that the stage would be filled
with eminent citizens and vice-presidents, and I had a vision of myself sitting there alone
in the chair in that wide emptiness, with the chief performer directing attention to me every
other moment or so, for perhaps an hour. Let me hurry on to say that it did not happen. I dare
say he realized my unfitness for the work, and the far greater appropriateness of conferring
the honor on General Grant, for in the end he gave him the assignment, to my immeasurable relief.

It was a magnificent occasion. That spacious hall was hung with bunting, the stage was banked
and festooned with decoration of every sort. General Grant, surrounded by his splendidly uniformed
staff, sat in the foreground, and behind was ranged a levee of foremost citizens of the republic.
The band played "America" as Mark Twain entered, and the great audience rose and roared out
its welcome. Some of those who knew him best had hoped that on this occasion of his last lecture
he would tell of that first appearance in San Francisco, forty years before, when his fortunes
had hung in the balance. Perhaps he did not think of it, and no one had had the courage to
suggest it. At all events, he did a different thing. He began by making a strong plea for the
smitten city where the flames were still raging, urging prompt help for those who had lost
not only their homes, but the last shred of their belongings and their means of livelihood.
Then followed his farcical history of Fulton, with General Grant to make the responses, and
presently he drifted into the kind of lecture he had given so often in his long trip around
the world-retelling the tales which had won him fortune and friends in many lands.

I do not know whether the entertainment was long or short. I think few took account of time.
To a letter of inquiry as to how long the entertainment would last, he had replied:

    I cannot say for sure. It is my custom to keep on talking till I
    get the audience cowed. Sometimes it takes an hour and fifteen
    minutes, sometimes I can do it in an hour.

There was no indication at any time that the audience was cowed. The house was packed, and
the applause was so recurrent and continuous that often his voice was lost to those in its
remoter corners. It did not matter. The tales were familiar to his hearers; merely to see Mark
Twain, in his old age and in that splendid setting, relating them was enough. The audience
realized that it was witnessing the close of a heroic chapter in a unique career.

CCXLIII

AN INVESTMENT IN REDDING

Many of the less important happenings seem worth remembering now. Among them was the sale,
at the Nast auction, of the Mark Twain letters, already mentioned. The fact that these letters
brought higher prices than any others offered in this sale was gratifying. Roosevelt, Grant,
and even Lincoln items were sold; but the Mark Twain letters led the list. One of them sold
for forty-three dollars, which was said to be the highest price ever paid for the letter of
a living man. It was the letter written in 1877, quoted earlier in this work, in which Clemens
proposed the lecture tour to Nast. None of the Clemens-Nast letters brought less than twenty-seven
dollars, and some of them were very brief. It was a new measurement of public sentiment. Clemens,
when he heard of it, said:

"I can't rise to General Grant's lofty place in the estimation of this country; but it is a
deep satisfaction to me to know that when it comes to letter-writing he can't sit in the front
seat along with me. That forty-three-dollar letter ought to be worth as much as eighty-six
dollars after I'm dead."

A perpetual string of callers came to 21 Fifth Avenue, and it kept the secretary busy explaining
to most of them why Mark Twain could not entertain their propositions, or listen to their complaints,
or allow them to express in person their views on public questions. He did see a great many
of what might be called the milder type persons who were evidently sincere and not too heavily
freighted with eloquence. Of these there came one day a very gentle-spoken woman who had promised
that she would stay but a moment, and say no more than a few words, if only she might sit face
to face with the great man. It was in the morning hour before the dictations, and he received
her, quite correctly clad in his beautiful dressing-robe and propped against his pillows. She
kept her contract to the letter; but when she rose to go she said, in a voice of deepest reverence:

"May I kiss your hand?"

It was a delicate situation, and might easily have been made ludicrous. Denial would have hurt
her. As it was, he lifted his hand, a small, exquisite hand it was, with the gentle dignity
and poise of a king, and she touched her lips to it with what was certainly adoration. Then,
as she went, she said:

"How God must love you!"

"I hope so," he said, softly, and he did not even smile; but after she had gone he could not
help saying, in a quaint, half-pathetic voice "I guess she hasn't heard of our strained relations."

Sitting in that royal bed, clad in that rich fashion, he easily conveyed the impression of
royalty, and watching him through those marvelous mornings he seemed never less than a king,
as indeed he was--the king of a realm without national boundaries. Some of those nearest to
him fell naturally into the habit of referring to him as "the King," and in time the title
crept out of the immediate household and was taken up by others who loved him.

He had been more than once photographed in his bed; but it was by those who had come and gone
in a brief time, with little chance to study his natural attitudes. I had acquired some knowledge
of the camera, and I obtained his permission to let me photograph him--a permission he seldom
denied to any one. We had no dictations on Saturdays, and I took the pictures on one of these
holiday mornings. He was so patient and tractable, and so natural in every attitude, that it
was a delight to make the negatives. I was afraid he would become impatient, and made fewer
exposures than I might otherwise have done. I think he expected very little from this amateur
performance; but, by that happy element of accident which plays so large a part in photographic
success, the results were better than I had hoped for. When I brought him the prints, a few
days later, he expressed pleasure and asked, "Why didn't you make more?"

Among them was one in an attitude which had grown so familiar to us, that of leaning over to
get his pipe from the smoking-table, and this seemed to give him particular satisfaction. It
being a holiday, he had not donned his dressing-gown, which on the whole was well for the photographic
result. He spoke of other pictures that had been made of him, especially denouncing one photograph,
taken some twenty years before by Sarony, a picture, as he said, of a gorilla in an overcoat,
which the papers and magazines had insisted on using ever since.

"Sarony was as enthusiastic about wild animals as he was about photography, and when Du Chaillu
brought over the first gorilla he sent for me to look at it and see if our genealogy was straight.
I said it was, and Sarony was so excited that I had recognized the resemblance between us,
that he wanted to make it more complete, so he borrowed my overcoat and put it on the gorilla
and photographed it, and spread that picture out over the world as mine. It turns up every
week in some newspaper or magazine; but it's not my favorite; I have tried to get it suppressed."

Mark Twain made his first investment in Redding that spring. I had located there the autumn
before, and bought a vacant old house, with a few acres of land, at what seemed a modest price.
I was naturally enthusiastic over the bargain, and the beauty and salubrity of the situation.
His interest was aroused, and when he learned that there was a place adjoining, equally reasonable
and perhaps even more attractive, he suggested immediately that I buy it for him; and he wanted
to write a check then for the purchase price, for fear the opportunity might be lost. I think
there was then no purpose in his mind of building a country home; but he foresaw that such
a site, at no great distance from New York, would become more valuable, and he had plenty of
idle means. The purchase was made without difficulty--a tract of seventy-five acres, to which
presently was added another tract of one hundred and ten acres, and subsequently still other
parcels of land, to complete the ownership of the hilltop, for it was not long until he had
conceived the idea of a home. He was getting weary of the heavy pressure of city life. He craved
the retirement of solitude--one not too far from the maelstrom, so that he might mingle with
it now and then when he chose. The country home would not be begun for another year yet, but
the purpose of it was already in the air. No one of the family had at this time seen the location.

CCXLIV

TRAITS AND PHILOSOPHIES

I brought to the dictation one morning the Omar Khayyam card which Twichell had written him
so long ago; I had found it among the letters. It furnished him a subject for that morning.
He said:

    How strange there was a time when I had never heard of Omar Khayyam!
    When that card arrived I had already read the dozen quatrains or so
    in the morning paper, and was still steeped in the ecstasy of
    delight which they occasioned. No poem had ever given me so much
    pleasure before, and none has given me so much pleasure since. It
    is the only poem I have ever carried about with me. It has not been
    from under my hand all these years.

He had no general fondness for poetry; but many poems appealed to him, and on occasion he liked
to read them aloud. Once, during the dictation, some verses were sent up by a young authoress
who was waiting below for his verdict. The lines pictured a phase of negro life, and she wished
to know if he thought them worthy of being read at some Tuskegee ceremony. He did not fancy
the idea of attending to the matter just then and said:

"Tell her she can read it. She has my permission. She may commit any crime she wishes in my name."

It was urged that the verses were of high merit and the author a very charming young lady.

"I'm very glad," he said, "and I am glad the Lord made her; I hope He will make some more just
like her. I don't always approve of His handiwork, but in this case I do."

Then suddenly he added:

"Well, let me see it--no time like the present to get rid of these things."

He took the manuscript and gave such a rendition of those really fine verses as I believe could
not be improved upon. We were held breathless by his dramatic fervor and power. He returned
a message to that young aspirant that must have made her heart sing. When the dictation had
ended that day, I mentioned his dramatic gift.

"Yes," he said, "it is a gift, I suppose, like spelling and punctuation and smoking. I seem
to have inherited all those." Continuing, he spoke of inherited traits in general.

"There was Paige," he said; "an ignorant man who could not make a machine himself that would
stand up, nor draw the working plans for one; but he invented the eighteen thousand details
of the most wonderful machine the world has ever known. He watched over the expert draftsmen,
and superintended the building of that marvel. Pratt & Whitney built it; but it was Paige's
machine, nevertheless--the child of his marvelous gift. We don't create any of our traits;
we inherit all of them. They have come down to us from what we impudently call the lower animals.
Man is the last expression, and combines every attribute of the animal tribes that preceded
him. One or two conspicuous traits distinguish each family of animals from the others, and
those one or two traits are found in every member of each family, and are so prominent as to
eternally and unchangeably establish the character of that branch of the animal world. In these
cases we concede that the several temperaments constitute a law of God, a command of God, and
that whatsoever is done in obedience to that law is blameless. Man, in his evolution, inherited
the whole sum of these numerous traits, and with each trait its share of the law of God. He
widely differs from them in this: that he possesses not a single characteristic that is equally
prominent in each member of his race. You can say the housefly is limitlessly brave, and in
saying it you describe the whole house-fly tribe; you can say the rabbit is limitlessly timid,
and by the phrase you describe the whole rabbit tribe; you can say the spider and the tiger
are limitlessly murderous, and by that phrase you describe the whole spider and tiger tribes;
you can say the lamb is limitlessly innocent and sweet and gentle, and by that phrase you describe
all the lambs. There is hardly a creature that you cannot definitely and satisfactorily describe
by one single trait--except man. Men are not all cowards like the rabbit, nor all brave like
the house-fly, nor all sweet and innocent and gentle like the lamb, nor all murderous like
the spider and the tiger and the wasp, nor all thieves like the fox and the bluejay, nor all
vain like the peacock, nor all frisky like the monkey. These things are all in him somewhere,
and they develop according to the proportion of each he received in his allotment: We describe
a man by his vicious traits and condemn him; or by his fine traits and gifts, and praise him
and accord him high merit for their possession. It is comical. He did not invent these things;
he did not stock himself with them. God conferred them upon him in the first instant of creation.
They constitute the law, and he could not escape obedience to the decree any more than Paige
could have built the type-setter he invented, or the Pratt & Whitney machinists could have
invented the machine which they built."

He liked to stride up and down, smoking as he talked, and generally his words were slowly measured,
with varying pauses between them. He halted in the midst of his march, and without a suggestion
of a smile added:

"What an amusing creature the human being is!"

It is absolutely impossible, of course, to preserve the atmosphere and personality of such
talks as this--the delicacies of his speech and manner which carried an ineffable charm. It
was difficult, indeed, to record the substance. I did not know shorthand, and I should not
have taken notes at such times in any case; but I had trained myself in similar work to preserve,
with a fair degree of accuracy, the form of phrase, and to some extent its wording, if I could
get hold of pencil and paper soon enough afterward. In time I acquired a sort of phonographic
faculty; though it always seemed to me that the bouquet, the subtleness of speech, was lacking
in the result. Sometimes, indeed, he would dictate next morning the substance of these experimental
reflections; or I would find among his papers memoranda and fragmentary manuscripts where he
had set them down himself, either before or after he had tried them verbally. In these cases
I have not hesitated to amend my notes where it seemed to lend reality to his utterance, though,
even so, there is always lacking--and must be--the wonder of his personality.

CCXLV

IN THE DAY'S ROUND

A number of dictations of this period were about Susy, her childhood, and the biography she
had written of him, most of which he included in his chapters. More than once after such dictations
he reproached himself bitterly for the misfortunes of his house. He consoled himself a little
by saying that Susy had died at the right time, in the flower of youth and happiness; but he
blamed himself for the lack of those things which might have made her childhood still more
bright. Once he spoke of the biography she had begun, and added:

"Oh, I wish I had paid more attention to that little girl's work! If I had only encouraged
her now and then, what it would have meant to her, and what a beautiful thing it would have
been to have had her story of me told in her own way, year after year! If I had shown her that
I cared, she might have gone on with it. We are always too busy for our children; we never
give them the time nor the interest they deserve. We lavish gifts upon them; but the most precious
gift-our personal association, which means so much to them-we give grudgingly and throw it
away on those who care for it so little." Then, after a moment of silence: "But we are repaid
for it at last. There comes a time when we want their company and their interest. We want it
more than anything in the world, and we are likely to be starved for it, just as they were
starved so long ago. There is no appreciation of my books that is so precious to me as appreciation
from my children. Theirs is the praise we want, and the praise we are least likely to get."

His moods of remorse seemed to overwhelm him at times. He spoke of Henry's death and little
Langdon's, and charged himself with both. He declared that for years he had filled Mrs. Clemens's
life with privations, that the sorrow of Susy's death had hastened her own end. How darkly
he painted it! One saw the jester, who for forty years had been making the world laugh, performing
always before a background of tragedy.

But such moods were evanescent. He was oftener gay than somber. One morning before we settled
down to work he related with apparent joy how he had made a failure of story-telling at a party
the night before. An artist had told him a yarn, he said, which he had considered the most
amusing thing in the world. But he had not been satisfied with it, and had attempted to improve
on it at the party. He had told it with what he considered the nicest elaboration of detail
and artistic effect, and when he had concluded and expected applause, only a sickening silence
had followed.

"A crowd like that can make a good deal of silence when they combine," he said, "and it probably
lasted as long as ten seconds, because it seemed an hour and a half. Then a lady said, with
evident feeling, 'Lord, how pathetic!' For a moment I was stupefied. Then the fountains of
my great deeps were broken up, and I rained laughter for forty days and forty nights during
as much as three minutes. By that time I realized it was my fault. I had overdone the thing.
I started in to deceive them with elaborate burlesque pathos, in order to magnify the humorous
explosion at the end; but I had constructed such a fog of pathos that when I got to the humor
you couldn't find it."

He was likely to begin the morning with some such incident which perhaps he did not think worth
while to include in his dictations, and sometimes he interrupted his dictations to relate something
aside, or to outline some plan or scheme which his thought had suggested.

Once, when he was telling of a magazine he had proposed to start, the Back Number, which was,
to contain reprints of exciting events from history--newspaper gleanings--eye-witness narrations,
which he said never lost their freshness of interest--he suddenly interrupted himself to propose
that we start such a magazine in the near future--he to be its publisher and I its editor.
I think I assented, and the dictation proceeded, but the scheme disappeared permanently.

He usually had a number of clippings or slips among the many books on the bed beside him from
which he proposed to dictate each day, but he seldom could find the one most needed. Once,
after a feverishly impatient search for a few moments, he invited Miss Hobby to leave the room
temporarily, so, as he said, that he might swear. He got up and we began to explore the bed,
his profanity increasing amazingly with each moment. It was an enormously large bed, and he
began to disparage the size of it.

"One could lose a dog in this bed," he declared.

Finally I suggested that he turn over the clipping which he had in his hand. He did so, and
it proved to be the one he wanted. Its discovery was followed by a period of explosions, only
half suppressed as to volume. Then he said:

"There ought to be a room in this house to swear in. It's dangerous to have to repress an emotion
like that."

A moment later, when Miss Hobby returned, he was serene and happy again. He was usually gentle
during the dictations, and patient with those around him--remarkably so, I thought, as a rule.
But there were moments that involved risk. He had requested me to interrupt his dictation at
any time that I found him repeating or contradicting himself, or misstating some fact known
to me. At first I hesitated to do this, and cautiously mentioned the matter when he had finished.
Then he was likely to say:

"Why didn't you stop me?

Then, of course, I would apologize and say I was sorry, which would rectify matters, though
half an hour later it might happen again. I became lightning-proof at last; also I learned
better to select the psychological moment for the correction.

There was a humorous complexion to the dictations which perhaps I have not conveyed to the
reader at all; humor was his natural breath and life, and was not wholly absent in his most
somber intervals.

But poetry was there as well. His presence was full of it: the grandeur of his figure; the
grace of his movement; the music of his measured speech. Sometimes there were long pauses when
he was wandering in distant valleys of thought and did not speak at all. At such times he had
a habit of folding and refolding the sleeve of his dressing-gown around his wrist, regarding
it intently, as it seemed. His hands were so fair and shapely; the palms and finger-tips as
pink as those of a child. Then when he spoke he was likely to fling back his great, white mane,
his eyes half closed yet showing a gleam of fire between the lids, his clenched fist lifted,
or his index-finger pointing, to give force and meaning to his words. I cannot recall the picture
too often, or remind myself too frequently how precious it was to be there, and to see him
and to hear him. I do not know why I have not said before that he smoked continually during
these dictations--probably as an aid to thought --though he smoked at most other times, for
that matter. His cigars were of that delicious fragrance which characterizes domestic tobacco;
but I had learned early to take refuge in another brand when he offered me one. They were black
and strong and inexpensive, and it was only his early training in the printing-office and on
the river that had seasoned him to tobacco of that temper. Rich, admiring friends used to send
him quantities of expensive imported cigars; but he seldom touched them, and they crumbled
away or were smoked by visitors. Once, to a minister who proposed to send him something very
special, he wrote:

    I should accept your hospitable offer at once but for the fact that
    I couldn't do it and remain honest. That is to say, if I allowed
    you to send me what you believed to be good cigars it would
    distinctly mean that I meant to smoke them, whereas I should do
    nothing of the kind. I know a good cigar better than you do, for I
    have had 60 years' experience.

    No, that is not what I mean; I mean I know a bad cigar better than
    anybody else. I judge by the price only; if it costs above 5 cents
    I know it to be either foreign or half foreign & unsmokable--by me.
    I have many boxes of Havana cigars, of all prices from 20 cents
    apiece up to $1.66 apiece; I bought none of them, they were all
    presents; they are an accumulation of several years. I have never
    smoked one of them & never shall; I work them off on the visitor.
    You shall have a chance when you come.

He smoked a pipe a good deal, and he preferred it to be old and violent; and once, when he
had bought a new, expensive English brier-root he regarded it doubtfully for a time, and then
handed it over to me, saying:

"I'd like to have you smoke that a year or two, and when it gets so you can't stand it, maybe
it will suit me."

I am happy to add that subsequently he presented me with the pipe altogether, for it apparently
never seemed to get qualified for his taste, perhaps because the tobacco used was too mild.

One day, after the dictation, word was brought up that a newspaper man was down-stairs who
wished to see him concerning a report that Chauncey Depew was to resign his Senatorial seat
and Mark Twain was to be nominated in his place. The fancy of this appealed to him, and the
reporter was allowed to come up. He was a young man, and seemed rather nervous, and did not
wish to state where the report had originated. His chief anxiety was apparently to have Mark
Twain's comment on the matter. Clemens said very little at the time. He did not wish to be
a Senator; he was too busy just now dictating biography, and added that he didn't think he
would care for the job, anyway. When the reporter was gone, however, certain humorous possibilities
developed. The Senatorship would be a stepping-stone to the Presidency, and with the combination
of humorist, socialist, and peace-patriot in the Presidential chair the nation could expect
an interesting time. Nothing further came of the matter. There was no such report. The young
newspaper man had invented the whole idea to get a "story" out of Mark Twain. The item as printed
next day invited a good deal of comment, and Collier's Weekly made it a text for an editorial
on his mental vigor and general fitness for the place.

If it happened that he had no particular engagement for the afternoon, he liked to walk out,
especially when the pleasant weather came. Sometimes we walked up Fifth Avenue, and I must
admit that for a good while I could not get rid of a feeling of self-consciousness, for most
people turned to look, though I was fully aware that I did not in the least come into their
scope of vision. They saw only Mark Twain. The feeling was a more comfortably one at The Players,
where we sometimes went for luncheon, for the acquaintance there and the democracy of that
institution had a tendency to eliminate contrasts and incongruities. We sat at the Round Table
among those good fellows who were always so glad to welcome him.

Once we went to the "Music Master," that tender play of Charles Klein's, given by that matchless
interpreter, David Warfield. Clemens was fascinated, and said more than once:

"It is as permanent as 'Rip Van Winkle.' Warfield, like Jefferson, can go on playing it all
his life."

We went behind when it was over, and I could see that Warfield glowed with Mark Twain's unstinted
approval. Later, when I saw him at The Players, he declared that no former compliment had ever
made him so happy.

There were some billiard games going on between the champions Hoppe and Sutton, at the Madison
Square Garden, and Clemens, with his eager fondness for the sport, was anxious to attend them.
He did not like to go anywhere alone, and one evening he invited me to accompany him. Just
as he stepped into the auditorium there was a vigorous round of applause. The players stopped,
somewhat puzzled, for no especially brilliant shot had been made. Then they caught the figure
of Mark Twain and realized that the game, for the moment, was not the chief attraction. The
audience applauded again, and waved their handkerchiefs. Such a tribute is not often paid to
a private citizen.

Clemens had a great admiration for the young champion Hoppe, which the billiardist's extreme
youth and brilliancy invited, and he watched his game with intense eagerness. When it was over
the referee said a few words and invited Mark Twain to speak. He rose and told them a story-probably
invented on the instant. He said:

    "Once in Nevada I dropped into a billiard-room casually, and picked
    up a cue and began to knock the balls around. The proprietor, who
    was a red-haired man, with such hair as I have never seen anywhere
    except on a torch, asked me if I would like to play. I said, 'Yes.'
    He said, 'Knock the balls around a little and let me see how you can
    shoot.' So I knocked them around, and thought I was doing pretty
    well, when he said, 'That's all right; I'll play you left-handed.'
    It hurt my pride, but I played him. We banked for the shot and he
    won it. Then he commenced to play, and I commenced to chalk my cue
    to get ready to play, and he went on playing, and I went on chalking
    my cue; and he played and I chalked all through that game. When he
    had run his string out I said:

    "That's wonderful! perfectly wonderful! If you can play that way
    left-handed what could you do right-handed?'

    "'Couldn't do anything,' he said. 'I'm a left-handed man.'"

How it delighted them! I think it was the last speech of any sort he made that season. A week
or two later he went to Dublin, New Hampshire, for the summer--this time to the Upton House,
which had been engaged a year before, the Copley Greene place being now occupied by its owner.

CCXLVI

THE SECOND SUMMER AT DUBLIN

The Upton House stands on the edge of a beautiful beech forest some two or three miles from
Dublin, just under Monadnock--a good way up the slope. It is a handsome, roomy frame-house,
and had a long colonnaded veranda overlooking one of the most beautiful landscape visions on
the planet: lake, forest, hill, and a far range of blue mountains--all the handiwork of God
is there. I had seen these things in paintings, but I had not dreamed that such a view really
existed. The immediate foreground was a grassy slope, with ancient, blooming apple-trees; and
just at the right hand Monadnock rose, superb and lofty, sloping down to the panorama below
that stretched away, taking on an ever deeper blue, until it reached that remote range on which
the sky rested and the world seemed to end. It was a masterpiece of the Greater Mind, and of
the highest order, perhaps, for it had in it nothing of the touch of man. A church spire glinted
here and there, but there was never a bit of field, or stone wall, or cultivated land. It was
lonely; it was unfriendly; it cared nothing whatever for humankind; it was as if God, after
creating all the world, had wrought His masterwork here, and had been so engrossed with the
beauty of it that He had forgotten to give it a soul. In a sense this was true, for He had
not made the place suitable for the habitation of men. It lacked the human touch; the human
interest, and I could never quite believe in its reality.

The time of arrival heightened this first impression. It was mid-May and the lilacs were prodigally
in bloom; but the bright sunlight was chill and unnatural, and there was a west wind that laid
the grass flat and moaned through the house, and continued as steadily as if it must never
stop from year's end to year's end. It seemed a spectral land, a place of supernatural beauty.
Warm, still, languorous days would come, but that first feeling of unreality would remain permanent.
I believe Jean Clemens was the only one who ever really loved the place. Something about it
appealed to her elemental side and blended with her melancholy moods. She dressed always in
white, and she was tall and pale and classically beautiful, and she was often silent, like
a spirit. She had a little retreat for herself farther up the mountain-side, and spent most
of her days there wood-carving, which was her chief diversion.

Clara Clemens did not come to the place at all. She was not yet strong, and went to Norfolk,
Connecticut, where she could still be in quiet retirement and have her physician's care. Miss
Hobby came, and on the 21st of May the dictations were resumed. We began in his bedroom, as
before, but the feeling there was depressing--the absence of the great carved bed and other
furnishings, which had been so much a part of the picture, was felt by all of us. Nothing of
the old luxury and richness was there. It was a summer-furnished place, handsome but with the
customary bareness. At the end of this first session he dressed in his snowy flannels, which
he had adopted in the place of linen for summer wear, and we descended to the veranda and looked
out over that wide, wonderful expanse of scenery.

"I think I shall like it," he said, "when I get acquainted with it, and get it classified and
labeled, and I think we'll do our dictating out here hereafter. It ought to be an inspiring place."

So the dictations were transferred to the long veranda, and he was generally ready for them,
a white figure pacing up and down before that panoramic background. During the earlier, cooler
weeks he usually continued walking with measured step during the dictations, pausing now and
then to look across the far-lying horizon. When it stormed we moved into the great living-room,
where at one end there was a fireplace with blazing logs, and at the other the orchestrelle,
which had once more been freighted up those mountain heights for the comfort of its harmonies.
Sometimes, when the wind and rain were beating outside, and he was striding up and down the
long room within, with only the blurred shapes of mountains and trees outlined through the
trailing rain, the feeling of the unreality became so strong that it was hard to believe that
somewhere down below, beyond the rain and the woods, there was a literal world--a commonplace
world, where the ordinary things of life were going on in the usual way. When the dictation
finished early, there would be music--the music that he loved most--Beethoven's symphonies,
or the Schubert impromptu, or the sonata by Chopin.--[Schubert, Op. 142, No. 2; Chopin, Op.
37, No. 2.]--It is easy to understand that this carried one a remove farther from the customary
things of life. It was a setting far out of the usual, though it became that unique white figure
and his occupation. In my notes, made from day to day, I find that I have set down more than
once an impression of the curious unreality of the place and its surroundings, which would
show that it was not a mere passing fancy.

I had lodgings in the village, and drove out mornings for the dictations, but often came out
again afoot on pleasant afternoons; for he was not much occupied with social matters, and there
was opportunity for quiet, informing interviews. There was a woods path to the Upton place,
and it was a walk through a fairyland. A part of the way was through such a growth of beech
timber as I have never seen elsewhere: tall, straight, mottled trees with an undergrowth of
laurel, the sunlight sifting through; one found it easy to expect there storybook ladies, wearing
crowns and green mantles, riding on white palfreys. Then came a more open way, an abandoned
grass-grown road full of sunlight and perfume; and this led to a dim, religious place, a natural
cathedral, where the columns were stately pine-trees branching and meeting at the top: a veritable
temple in which it always seemed that music was about to play. You crossed a brook and climbed
a little hill, and pushed through a hedge into a place more open, and the house stood there
among the trees.

The days drifted along, one a good deal like another, except, as the summer deepened, the weather
became warmer, the foliage changed, a drowsy haze gathered along the valleys and on the mountain-side.
He sat more often now in a large rocking-chair, and generally seemed to be looking through
half-dosed lids toward the Monadnock heights, that were always changing in aspect-in color
and in form--as cloud shapes drifted by or gathered in those lofty hollows. White and yellow
butterflies hovered over the grass, and there were some curious, large black ants--the largest
I have ever seen and quite harmless--that would slip in and out of the cracks on the veranda
floor, wholly undisturbed by us. Now and then a light flutter of wind would come murmuring
up from the trees below, and when the apple-bloom was falling there would be a whirl of white
and pink petals that seemed a cloud of smaller butterflies.

On June 1st I find in my note-book this entry:

    Warm and pleasant. The dictation about Grant continues; a great
    privilege to hear this foremost man, of letters review his
    associations with that foremost man of arms. He remained seated
    today, dressed in white as usual, a large yellow pansy in his
    buttonhole, his white hair ruffled by the breeze. He wears his worn
    morocco slippers with black hose; sits in the rocker, smoking and
    looking out over the hazy hills, delivering his sentences with a
    measured accuracy that seldom calls for change. He is speaking just
    now of a Grant dinner which he attended where Depew spoke. One is
    impressed with the thought that we are looking at and listening to
    the war-worn veteran of a thousand dinners--the honored guest of
    many; an honored figure of all. Earlier, when he had been
    chastising some old offender, he added, "However, he's dead, and I
    forgive him." Then, after a moment's reflection, "No; strike that
    last sentence out." When we laughed, he added, "We can't forgive
    him yet."

A few days later--it was June 4th, the day before the second anniversary of the death of Mrs.
Clemens--we found him at first in excellent humor from the long dictation of the day before.
Then his mind reverted to the tragedy of the season, and he began trying to tell of it. It
was hard work. He walked back and forth in the soft sunlight, saying almost nothing. He gave
it up at last, remarking, "We will not work to-morrow." So we went away.

He did not dictate on the 5th or the 6th, but on the 7th he resumed the story of Mrs. Clemens's
last days at Florence. The weather had changed: the sunlight and warmth had all gone; a chill,
penetrating mist was on the mountains; Monadnock was blotted out. We expected him to go to
the fire, but evidently he could not bear being shut in with that subject in his mind. A black
cape was brought out and thrown about his shoulders, which seemed to fit exactly into the somberness
of the picture. For two hours or more we sat there in the gloom and chill, while he paced up
and down, detailing as graphically as might be that final chapter in the life of the woman
he had loved.

It is hardly necessary to say that beyond the dictation Clemens did very little literary work
during these months. He had brought his "manuscript trunk" as usual, thinking, perhaps, to
finish the "microbe" story and other of the uncompleted things; but the dictation gave him
sufficient mental exercise, and he did no more than look over his "stock in trade," as he called
it, and incorporate a few of the finished manuscripts into "autobiography." Among these were
the notes of his trip down the Rhone, made in 1891, and the old Stormfield story, which he
had been treasuring and suppressing so long. He wrote Howells in June:

    The dictating goes lazily and pleasantly on. With intervals. I
    find that I've been at it, off & on, nearly two hours for 155 days
    since January 9. To be exact, I've dictated 75 hours in 80 days &
    loafed 75 days. I've added 60,000 words in the month that I've been
    here; which indicates that I've dictated during 20 days of that
    time--40 hours, at an average of 1,500 words an hour. It's a
    plenty, & I'm satisfied.

    There's a good deal of "fat." I've dictated (from January 9)
    210,000 words, & the "fat" adds about 50,000 more.

    The "fat" is old pigeonholed things of the years gone by which I or
    editors didn't das't to print. For instance, I am dumping in the
    little old book which I read to you in Hartford about 30 years ago &
    which you said "publish & ask Dean Stanley to furnish an
    introduction; he'll do it" (Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven).
    It reads quite to suit me without altering a word now that it isn't
    to see print until I am dead.

    To-morrow I mean to dictate a chapter which will get my heirs &
    assigns burned alive if they venture to print it this side of A.D.
    2006--which I judge they won't. There'll be lots of such chapters
    if I live 3 or 4 years longer. The edition of A.D. 2006 will make a
    stir when it comes out. I shall be hovering around taking notice,
    along with other dead pals. You are invited.

The chapter which was to invite death at the stake for his successors was naturally one of
religious heresies a violent attack on the orthodox, scriptural God, but really an expression
of the highest reverence for the God which, as he said, had created the earth and sky and the
music of the constellations. Mark Twain once expressed himself concerning reverence and the
lack of it:

"I was never consciously and purposely irreverent in my life, yet one person or another is
always charging me with a lack of reverence. Reverence for what--for whom? Who is to decide
what ought to command my reverence--my neighbor or I? I think I ought to do the electing myself.
The Mohammedan reveres Mohammed--it is his privilege; the Christian doesn't--apparently that
is his privilege; the account is square enough. They haven't any right to complain of the other,
yet they do complain of each other, and that is where the unfairness comes in. Each says that
the other is irreverent, and both are mistaken, for manifestly you can't have reverence for
a thing that doesn't command it. If you could do that you could digest what you haven't eaten,
and do other miracles and get a reputation."

He was not reading many books at this time--he was inclined rather to be lazy, as he said,
and to loaf during the afternoons; but I remember that he read aloud 'After the Wedding' and
'The Mother'--those two beautiful word-pictures by Howells--which he declared sounded the depths
of humanity with a deep-sea lead. Also he read a book by William Allen White, 'In Our Town',
a collection of tales that he found most admirable. I think he took the trouble to send White
a personal, hand-written letter concerning them, although, with the habit of dictation, he
had begun, as he said, to "loathe the use of the pen."

There were usually some sort of mild social affairs going on in the neighborhood, luncheons
and afternoon gatherings like those of the previous year, though he seems to have attended
fewer of them, for he did not often leave the house. Once, at least, he assisted in an afternoon
entertainment at the Dublin Club, where he introduced his invention of the art of making an
impromptu speech, and was assisted in its demonstration by George de Forest Brush and Joseph
Lindon Smith, to the very great amusement of a crowd of summer visitors. The "art" consisted
mainly of having on hand a few reliable anecdotes and a set formula which would lead directly
to them from any given subject.

Twice or more he collected the children of the neighborhood for charades and rehearsed them,
and took part in the performance, as in the Hartford days. Sometimes he drove out or took an
extended walk. But these things were seldom.

Now and then during the summer he made a trip to New York of a semi-business nature, usually
going by the way of Fairhaven, where he would visit for a few days, journeying the rest of
the way in Mr. Rogers's yacht. Once they made a cruise of considerable length to Bar Harbor
and elsewhere. Here is an amusing letter which he wrote to Mrs. Rogers after such a visit:

    DEAR MRS. ROGERS,--In packing my things in your house yesterday
    morning I inadvertently put in some articles that was laying around,
    I thinking about theology & not noticing, the way this family does
    in similar circumstances like these. Two books, Mr. Rogers' brown
    slippers, & a ham. I thought it was ourn, it looks like one we used
    to have. I am very sorry it happened, but it sha'n't occur again &
    don't you worry. He will temper the wind to the shorn lamb & I will
    send some of the things back anyway if there is some that won't
    keep.

CCXLVI

DUBLIN, CONTINUED

In time Mark Twain became very lonely in Dublin. After the brilliant winter the contrast was
too great. He was not yet ready for exile. In one of his dictations he said:

    The skies are enchantingly blue. The world is a dazzle of sunshine.
    Monadnock is closer to us than usual by several hundred yards. The
    vast extent of spreading valley is intensely green--the lakes as
    intensely blue. And there is a new horizon, a remoter one than we
    have known before, for beyond the mighty half-circle of hazy
    mountains that form the usual frame of the picture rise certain
    shadowy great domes that are unfamiliar to our eyes . . . .

    But there is a defect--only one, but it is a defect which almost
    entitles it to be spelled with a capital D. This is the defect of
    loneliness. We have not a single neighbor who is a neighbor.
    Nobody lives within two miles of us except Franklin MacVeagh, and he
    is the farthest off of any, because he is in Europe . . . .

    I feel for Adam and Eve now, for I know how it was with them. I am
    existing, broken-hearted, in a Garden of Eden.... The Garden of
    Eden I now know was an unendurable solitude. I know that the advent
    of the serpent was a welcome change--anything for society . . . .

    I never rose to the full appreciation of the utter solitude of this
    place until a symbol of it--a compact and visible allegory of it
    --furnished me the lacking lift three days ago. I was standing alone
    on this veranda, in the late afternoon, mourning over the stillness,
    the far-spreading, beautiful desolation, and the absence of visible
    life, when a couple of shapely and graceful deer came sauntering
    across the grounds and stopped, and at their leisure impudently
    looked me over, as if they had an idea of buying me as bric-a-brac.
    Then they seemed to conclude that they could do better for less
    money elsewhere, and they sauntered indolently away and disappeared
    among the trees. It sized up this solitude. It is so complete, so
    perfect, that even the wild animals are satisfied with it. Those
    dainty creatures were not in the least degree afraid of me.

This was no more than a mood--though real enough while it lasted--somber, and in its way regal.
It was the loneliness of a king--King Lear. Yet he returned gladly enough to solitude after
each absence.

It was just before one of his departures that I made another set of pictures of him, this time
on the colonnaded veranda, where his figure had become so familiar. He had determined to have
his hair cut when he reached New York, and I was anxious to get the pictures before this happened.
When the proofs came seven of them--he arranged them as a series to illustrate what he called
"The Progress of a Moral Purpose." He ordered a number of sets of this series, and he wrote
a legend on each photograph, numbering them from 1 to 7, laying each set in a sheet of letter-paper
which formed a sort of wrapper, on which was written:

    This series of q photographs registers with scientific precision,
    stage by stage, the progress of a moral purpose through the
    mind of the human race's Oldest Friend.        S. L. C.

He added a personal inscription, and sent one to each of his more intimate friends. One of
the pictures amused him more than the others, because during the exposure a little kitten,
unnoticed, had walked into it, and paused near his foot. He had never outgrown his love for
cats, and he had rented this kitten and two others for the summer from a neighbor. He didn't
wish to own them, he said, for then he would have to leave them behind uncared for, so he preferred
to rent them and pay sufficiently to insure their subsequent care. These kittens he called
Sackcloth and Ashes--Ashes being the joint name of the two that looked exactly alike, and so
did not need distinctive titles. Their gambols always amused him. He would stop any time in
the midst of dictation to enjoy them. Once, as he was about to enter the screen-door that led
into the hall, two of the kittens ran up in front of him and stood waiting. With grave politeness
he opened the door, made a low bow, and stepped back and said: "Walk in, gentlemen. I always
give precedence to royalty." And the kittens marched in, tails in air. All summer long they
played up and down the wide veranda, or chased grasshoppers and butterflies down the clover
slope. It was a never-ending amusement to him to see them jump into the air after some insect,
miss it and tumble back, and afterward jump up, with a surprised expression and a look of disappointment
and disgust. I remember once, when he was walking up and down discussing some very serious
subject--and one of the kittens was lying on the veranda asleep--a butterfly came drifting
along three feet or so above the floor. The kitten must have got a glimpse of the insect out
of the corner of its eye, and perhaps did not altogether realize its action. At all events,
it suddenly shot straight up into the air, exactly like a bounding rubber ball, missed the
butterfly, fell back on the porch floor with considerable force and with much surprise. Then
it sprang to its feet, and, after spitting furiously once or twice, bounded away. Clemens had
seen the performance, and it completely took his subject out of his mind. He laughed extravagantly,
and evidently cared more for that moment's entertainment than for many philosophies.

In that remote solitude there was one important advantage--there was no procession of human
beings with axes to grind, and few curious callers. Occasionally an automobile would find its
way out there and make a circuit of the drive, but this happened too seldom to annoy him. Even
newspaper men rarely made the long trip from Boston or New York to secure his opinions, and
when they came it was by permission and appointment. Newspaper telegrams arrived now and then,
asking for a sentiment on some public condition or event, and these he generally answered willingly
enough. When the British Premier, Campbell-Bannerman, celebrated his seventieth birthday, the
London Tribune and the New York Herald requested a tribute. He furnished it, for Bannerman
was a very old friend. He had known him first at Marienbad in '91, and in Vienna in '98, in
daily intercourse, when they had lived at the same hotel. His tribute ran:

To HIS EXCELLENCY THE BRITISH PREMIER,--Congratulations, not condolences.
Before seventy we are merely respected, at best, and we have to behave
all the time, or we lose that asset; but after seventy we are respected,
esteemed, admired, revered, and don't have to behave unless we want to.
When I first knew you, Honored Sir, one of us was hardly even respected.
                                   MARK TWAIN.

He had some misgivings concerning the telegram after it had gone, but he did not recall it.

Clemens became the victim of a very clever hoax that summer. One day a friend gave him two
examples of the most deliciously illiterate letters, supposed to have been written by a woman
who had contributed certain articles of clothing to the San Francisco sufferers, and later
wished to recall them because of the protests of her household. He was so sure that the letters
were genuine that he included them in his dictations, after reading them aloud with great effect.
To tell the truth, they did seem the least bit too well done, too literary in their illiteracy;
but his natural optimism refused to admit of any suspicion, and a little later he incorporated
one of the Jennie Allen letters in a speech which he made at a Press Club dinner in New York
on the subject of simplified spelling--offering it as an example of language with phonetic
brevity exercising its supreme function, the direct conveyance of ideas. The letters, in the
end, proved to be the clever work of Miss Grace Donworth, who has since published them serially
and in book form. Clemens was not at all offended or disturbed by the exposure. He even agreed
to aid the young author in securing a publisher, and wrote to Miss Stockbridge, through whom
he had originally received the documents:

    DEAR MISS STOCKBRIDGE (if she really exists),

    257 Benefit Street (if there is any such place):

    Yes, I should like a copy of that other letter. This whole fake is
    delightful; & I tremble with fear that you are a fake yourself &
    that I am your guileless prey. (But never mind, it isn't any
    matter.)

    Now as to publication----

He set forth his views and promised his assistance when enough of the letters should be completed.

Clemens allowed his name to be included with the list of spelling reformers, but he never employed
any of the reforms in his letters or writing. His interest was mainly theoretical, and when
he wrote or spoke on the subject his remarks were not likely to be testimonials in its favor.
His own theory was that the alphabet needed reform, first of all, so that each letter or character
should have one sound, and one sound only; and he offered as a solution of this an adaptation
of shorthand. He wrote and dictated in favor of this idea to the end of his life. Once he said:

"Our alphabet is pure insanity. It can hardly spell any large word in the English language
with any degree of certainty. Its sillinesses are quite beyond enumeration. English orthography
may need reforming and simplifying, but the English alphabet needs it a good many times as much."

He would naturally favor simplicity in anything. I remember him reading, as an example of beautiful
English, The Death of King Arthur, by Sir Thomas Malory, and his verdict:

"That is one of the most beautiful things ever written in English, and written when we had
no vocabulary."

"A vocabulary, then, is sometimes a handicap?"

"It is indeed."

Still I think it was never a handicap with him, but rather the plumage of flight. Sometimes,
when just the right word did not come, he would turn his head a little at different angles,
as if looking about him for the precise term. He would find it directly, and it was invariably
the word needed. Most writers employ, now and again, phrases that do not sharply present the
idea--that blur the picture like a poor opera-glass. Mark Twain's English always focused exactly.

"WHAT IS MAN?" AND THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY

Clemens decided to publish anonymously, or, rather, to print privately, the Gospel, which he
had written in Vienna some eight years before and added to from time to time. He arranged with
Frank Doubleday to take charge of the matter, and the De Vinne Press was engaged to do the
work. The book was copyrighted in the name of J. W. Bothwell, the superintendent of the De
Vinne company, and two hundred and fifty numbered copies were printed on hand-made paper, to
be gradually distributed to intimate friends.--[In an introductory word (dated February, 1905)
the author states that the studies for these papers had been made twenty-five or twenty-seven
years before. He probably referred to the Monday Evening Club essay, "What Is Happiness?" (February,
1883). See chap. cxli.]--A number of the books were sent to newspaper reviewers, and so effectually
had he concealed the personality of his work that no critic seems to have suspected the book's
authorship. It was not over-favorably received. It was generally characterized as a clever,
and even brilliant, expose of philosophies which were no longer startlingly new. The supremacy
of self-interest and "man the irresponsible machine" are the main features of 'What Is Man'
and both of these and all the rest are comprehended in his wider and more absolute doctrine
of that inevitable life-sequence which began with the first created spark. There can be no
training of the ideals, "upward and still upward," no selfishness and unselfishness, no atom
of voluntary effort within the boundaries of that conclusion. Once admitting the postulate,
that existence is merely a sequence of cause and effect beginning with the primal atom, and
we have a theory that must stand or fall as a whole. We cannot say that man is a creature of
circumstance and then leave him free to select his circumstance, even in the minutest fractional
degree. It was selected for him with his disposition; in that first instant of created life.
Clemens himself repeatedly emphasized this doctrine, and once, when it was suggested to him
that it seemed to "surround every thing, like the sky," he answered:

"Yes, like the sky; you can't break through anywhere."

Colonel Harvey came to Dublin that summer and persuaded Clemens to let him print some selections
from the dictations in the new volume of the North American Review, which he proposed to issue
fortnightly. The matter was discussed a good deal, and it was believed that one hundred thousand
words could be selected which would be usable forthwith, as well as in that long-deferred period
for which it was planned. Colonel Harvey agreed to take a copy of the dictated matter and make
the selections himself, and this plan was carried out. It may be said that most of the chapters
were delightful enough; though, had it been possible to edit them with the more positive documents
as a guide, certain complications might have been avoided. It does not matter now, and it was
not a matter of very wide import then.

The payment of these chapters netted Clemens thirty thousand dollars--a comfortable sum, which
he promptly proposed to spend in building on the property at Redding. He engaged John Mead
Howells to prepare some preliminary plans.

Clara Clemens, at Norfolk, was written to of the matter.

A little later I joined her in Redding, and she was the first of the family to see that beautiful
hilltop. She was well pleased with the situation, and that day selected the spot where the
house should stand. Clemens wrote Howells that he proposed to call it "Autobiography House,"
as it was to be built out of the Review money, and he said:

"If you will build on my farm and live there it will set Mrs. Howells's health up for sure.
Come and I'll sell you the site for twenty-five dollars. John will tell you it is a choice place."

The unusual summer was near its close. In my notebook, under date of September 16th, appears
this entry:

    Windy in valleys but not cold. This veranda is protected. It is
    peaceful here and perfect, but we are at the summer's end.

This is my last entry, and the dictations must have ceased a few days later. I do not remember
the date of the return to New York, and apparently I made no record of it; but I do not think
it could have been later than the 20th. It had been four months since the day of arrival, a
long, marvelous summer such as I would hardly know again. When I think of that time I shall
always hear the ceaseless slippered, shuffling walk, and see the white figure with its rocking,
rolling movement passing up and down the long gallery, with that preternaturally beautiful
landscape behind, and I shall hear his deliberate speech--always deliberate, save at rare intervals;
always impressive, whatever the subject might be; whether recalling some old absurdity of youth,
or denouncing orthodox creeds, or detailing the shortcomings of human-kind.

CCXLIX

BILLIARDS

The return to New York marked the beginning of a new era in my relations with Mark Twain. I
have not meant to convey up to this time that there was between us anything resembling a personal
friendship. Our relations were friendly, certainly, but they were relations of convenience
and mainly of a business, or at least of a literary nature. He was twenty-six years my senior,
and the discrepancy of experience and attainments was not measurable. With such conditions
friendship must be a deliberate growth; something there must be to bridge the dividing gulf.
Truth requires the confession that, in this case, the bridge took a very solid, material form,
it being, in fact, nothing less than a billiard-table.--[Clemens had been without a billiard-table
since 1891, the old one having been disposed of on the departure from Hartford.]

It was a present from Mrs. Henry H. Rogers, and had been intended for his Christmas; but when
he heard of it he could not wait, and suggested delicately that if he had it "right now" he
could begin using it sooner. So he went one day with Mr. Rogers to the Balke-Collender Company,
and they selected a handsome combination table suitable to all games--the best that money could
buy. He was greatly excited over the prospect, and his former bedroom was carefully measured,
to be certain that it was large enough for billiard purposes. Then his bed was moved into the
study, and the bookcases and certain appropriate pictures were placed and hung in the billiard-room
to give it the proper feeling.

The billiard-table arrived and was put in place, the brilliant green cloth in contrast with
the rich red wallpaper and the bookbindings and pictures making the room wonderfully handsome
and inviting.

Meantime, Clemens, with one of his sudden impulses, had conceived the notion of spending the
winter in Egypt, on the Nile. He had gone so far, within a few hours after the idea developed,
as to plan the time of his departure, and to partially engage a traveling secretary, so that
he might continue his dictations. He was quite full of the idea just at the moment when the
billiard table was being installed. He had sent for a book on the subject--the letters of Lady
Duff-Gordon, whose daughter, Janet Ross, had become a dear friend in Florence during the Viviani
days. He spoke of this new purpose on the morning when we renewed the New York dictations,
a month or more following the return from Dublin.

I said what was eminently true--that I could not play--that I had never played more "than a
few games of pool, and those very long ago.

"No matter," he answered; "the poorer you play, the better I shall like it."

So I remained for luncheon and we began, November 2d, the first game ever played on the Christmas
table. We played the English game, in which caroms and pockets both count. I had a beginner's
luck, on the whole, and I remember it as a riotous, rollicking game, the beginning of a closer
understanding between us--of a distinct epoch in our association. When it was ended he said:

"I'm not going to Egypt. There was a man here yesterday afternoon who said it was bad for bronchitis,
and, besides, it's too far away from this billiard-table."

He suggested that I come back in the evening and play some more. I did so, and the game lasted
until after midnight. He gave me odds, of course, and my "nigger luck," as he called it, continued.
It kept him sweating and swearing feverishly to win. His earlier habit of not eating in the
middle of the day continued; but he would get up and dress, and walk about the dining-room
in his old fashion, talking that marvelous, marvelous talk which I was always trying to remember,
and with only fractional success at best. To him it was only a method of killing time. I remember
once, when he had been discussing with great earnestness the Japanese question, he suddenly
noticed that the luncheon was about ending, and he said:

"Now we'll proceed to more serious matters--it's your--shot." And he was quite serious, for
the green cloth and the rolling balls afforded him a much larger interest.

To the donor of his new possession Clemens wrote:

    DEAR MRS. ROGERS,--The billiard-table is better than the doctors.
    I have a billiardist on the premises, & walk not less than ten miles
    every day with the cue in my hand. And the walking is not the whole
    of the exercise, nor the most health giving part of it, I think.
    Through the multitude of the positions and attitudes it brings into
    play every muscle in the body & exercises them all.

    The games begin right after luncheons, daily, & continue until
    midnight, with 2 hours' intermission for dinner & music. And so it
    is 9 hours' exercise per day & 10 or 12 on Sunday. Yesterday & last
    night it was 12--& I slept until 8 this morning without waking. The
    billiard-table as a Sabbath-breaker can beat any coal-breaker in
    Pennsylvania & give it 30 in the game. If Mr. Rogers will take to
    daily billiards he can do without the doctors & the massageur, I
    think.

    We are really going to build a house on my farm, an hour & a half
    from New York. It is decided.

    With love & many thanks.
                                S. L. C.

Naturally enough, with continued practice I improved my game, and he reduced my odds accordingly.
He was willing to be beaten, but not too often. Like any other boy, he preferred to have the
balance in his favor. We set down a record of the games, and he went to bed happier if the
tally-sheet showed him winner.

It was natural, too, that an intimacy of association and of personal interest should grow under
such conditions--to me a precious boon--and I wish here to record my own boundless gratitude
to Mrs. Rogers for her gift, which, whatever it meant to him, meant so much more to me.

To recall all the humors and interesting happenings of those early billiard-days would be to
fill a large volume. I can preserve no more than a few characteristic phases.

He was not an even-tempered player. When the balls were perverse in their movements and his
aim unsteady, he was likely to become short with his opponent--critical and even fault-finding.
Then presently a reaction would set in, and he would be seized with remorse. He would become
unnecessarily gentle and kindly--even attentive--placing the balls as I knocked them into the
pockets, hurrying from one end of the table to render this service, endeavoring to show in
every way except by actual confession in words that he was sorry for what seemed to him, no
doubt, an unworthy display of temper, unjustified irritation.

Naturally, this was a mood that I enjoyed less than that which had induced it.

Indeed, he was always not only human, but superhuman; not only a man, but superman. Nor does
this term apply only to his psychology. In no other human being have I ever seen such physical
endurance. I was comparatively a young man, and by no means an invalid; but many a time, far
in the night, when I was ready to drop with exhaustion, he was still as fresh and buoyant and
eager for the game as at the moment of beginning. He smoked and smoked continually, and followed
the endless track around the billiard-table with the light step of youth. At three or four
o'clock in the morning he would urge just one more game, and would taunt me for my weariness.
I can truthfully testify that never until the last year of his life did he willingly lay down
the billiard-cue, or show the least suggestion of fatigue.

He played always at high pressure. Now and then, in periods of adversity, he would fly into
a perfect passion with things in general. But, in the end, it was a sham battle, and he saw
the uselessness and humor of it, even in the moment of his climax. Once, when he found it impossible
to make any of his favorite shots, he became more and more restive, the lightning became vividly
picturesque as the clouds blackened. Finally, with a regular thunder-blast, he seized the cue
with both hands and literally mowed the balls across the table, landing one or two of them
on the floor. I do not recall his exact remarks during the performance; I was chiefly concerned
in getting out of the way, and those sublime utterances were lost. I gathered up the balls
and we went on playing as if nothing had happened, only he was very gentle and sweet, like
the sun on the meadows after the storm has passed by.

His enjoyment of his opponent's perplexities was very keen. When he had left the balls in some
unfortunate position which made it almost impossible for me to score he would laugh boisterously.
I used to affect to be injured and disturbed by this ridicule. Once, when he had made the conditions
unusually hard for me, and was enjoying the situation accordingly, I was tempted to remark:

"Whenever I see you laugh at a thing like that I always doubt your sense of humor." Which seemed
to add to his amusement.

Sometimes, when the balls were badly placed for me, he would offer ostensible advice, suggesting
that I should shoot here and there--shots that were possible, perhaps, but not promising. Often
I would follow his advice, and then when I failed to score his amusement broke out afresh.

Other billiardists came from time to time: Colonel Harvey, Mr. Duneka, and Major Leigh, of
the Harper Company, and Peter Finley Dunne (Mr. Dooley); but they were handicapped by their
business affairs, and were not dependable for daily and protracted sessions. Any number of
his friends were willing, even eager, to come for his entertainment; but the percentage of
them who could and would devote a number of hours each day to being beaten at billiards and
enjoy the operation dwindled down to a single individual. Even I could not have done it--could
not have afforded it, however much I might have enjoyed the diversion--had it not been contributory
to my work. To me the association was invaluable; it drew from him a thousand long-forgotten
incidents; it invited a stream of picturesque comments and philosophies; it furnished the most
intimate insight into his character.

He was not always glad to see promiscuous callers, even some one that he might have met pleasantly
elsewhere. One afternoon a young man whom he had casually invited to "drop in some day in town"
happened to call in the midst of a very close series of afternoon games. It would all have
been well enough if the visitor had been content to sit quietly on the couch and "bet on the
game," as Clemens suggested, after the greetings were over; but he was a very young man, and
he felt the necessity of being entertaining. He insisted on walking about the room and getting
in the way, and on talking about the Mark Twain books he had read, and the people he had met
from time to time who had known Mark Twain on the river, or on the Pacific coast, or elsewhere.
I knew how fatal it was for him to talk to Clemens during his play, especially concerning matters
most of which had been laid away. I trembled for our visitor. If I could have got his ear privately
I should have said: "For heaven's sake sit down and keep still or go away! There's going to
be a combination of earthquake and cyclone and avalanche if you keep this thing up."

I did what I could. I looked at my watch every other minute. At last, in desperation, I suggested
that I retire from the game and let the visitor have my cue. I suppose I thought this would
eliminate an element of danger. He declined on the ground that he seldom played, and continued
his deadly visit. I have never been in an atmosphere so fraught with danger. I did not know
how the game stood, and I played mechanically and forgot to count the score. Clemens's face
was grim and set and savage. He no longer ventured even a word. By and by I noticed that he
was getting white, and I said, privately, "Now, this young man's hour has come."

It was certainly by the mercy of God just then that the visitor said:

"I'm sorry, but I've got to go. I'd like to stay longer, but I've got an engagement for dinner."

I don't remember how he got out, but I know that tons lifted as the door closed behind him.
Clemens made his shot, then very softly said:

"If he had stayed another five minutes I should have offered him twenty-five cents to go."

But a moment later he glared at me.

"Why in nation did you offer him your cue?"

"Wasn't that the courteous thing to do?" I asked.

"No!" he ripped out. "The courteous and proper thing would have been to strike him dead. Did
you want to saddle that disaster upon us for life?" 

The Government proposed "next year." It was agreed that the Government were to guide the Committee
whenever it might sit, and that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be in the Chair.

'Mr. Gladstone wrote me a letter to ease off my surrender on beer
duties, by pointing out the importance of the proposals which were
being made to put realty in the same position as personalty as to
Death Duties.

         [Footnote: On this speech
           see the Life of Gladstone, vol. iii., p. 184; Life of Granville,
vol. ii., p. 440.] At this time I wrote to Hartington to suggest that
if we were forced into war with Russia we should attack the Russians
at Vladivostock, and the Intelligence Department wrote a memorandum
upon the subject.

I also sent round a paper pointing out that we should fight at the
greatest advantage from a Pacific base, that the help of China would
be of moment, and that Chinese troops drilled and officered by Englishmen
would be irresistible; and Northbrook strongly backed me up.

Lumsden was sending us most violent telegrams, and while I was preparing for war I was also asking
for the recall of Lumsden in favour of Colonel Stewart.

Lord Granville wrote: "Lumsden was a bad appointment, and I for a moment wished to recall him.
But it would be condemned here as an immense knock-under." [Footnote: See the Life of Granville,
vol. ii., pp. 441, 442.] I also suggested that the engineers for whom the Amir had asked should
be carefully picked, and should have a private Indian allowance for
keeping us informed of what passed at Kabul, and Lord Granville conveyed
the suggestion by telegraph to Lord Dufferin.

(This was afterwards done.)'

Russia unexpectedly withdrew.

'On May 2nd there was a sudden Cabinet on the Russian acceptance of arbitration, Harcourt, Chamberlain,
and Carlingford being absent. Kimberley, the Chancellor, Northbrook, Derby, and I were for immediate
acceptance of the offer; Hartington against; Lord Granville for amiably
getting out of it; Trevelyan and Lefevre silent; Rosebery late.

Mr. Gladstone at first sided with Lord Granville, then came half
way to us, and then proposed that we should wait a bit till Condie
Stephen reached us.

I replied by showing that Condie Stephen was a Jingo, the friend
of Drummond Wolff and of Bowles of Vanity Fair, and would make things
worse.

Then Mr. Gladstone came completely to our side.

    Childers drew up in Cabinet the form for the declaration as to the
    Select Committee on the Civil List, and I agreed to it. I wrote
    what had passed to Chamberlain, who was at Birmingham, and he replied
    on the next day that he trusted that the information about Russia would
    be immediately communicated to the House, and went on: "But, then,
    what becomes of the vote of credit and the Budget? It seems cheeky
    to ask for 6 1/2 millions of Preparations when the matter is practically
settled."

'On May 7th the Herat boundary was discussed and a line settled, and it was decided that either
the German Emperor or the King of Denmark should be named as the
Arbitrator about Penjdeh.' Later, 'There was a meeting of the Commons
Ministers to discuss the situation created by the refusal by Russia
of the German Emperor as Arbitrator, the Queen having previously refused
the King of Denmark.

The Queen had ultimately to yield. But, as I have said, the arbitration, although agreed on,
never took place at all.'

The demarcation of frontier for which Sir Charles had so long contended was carried through without
any marked incident, largely owing to the skill of Sir J. West Ridgeway, who had succeeded
Sir Peter Lumsden.

APPENDIX

The Memoir gives the following account of the proposals made for defence of the North-West Frontier
in India in the spring of 1885, and some observations arising from them:

'The general idea was to hold the northern route by an entrenched
position, and, as regards the southern or flank road, to fortify the
mountains before Quetta.

Roads and railways were to be made for concentration in the direction of Kandahar, and Sir
Frederick Roberts afterwards very wisely noted, "It is impossible
to threaten Russia's base, but we should do all in our power to keep
it as far away as possible."

Unfortunately, Sir Frederick Roberts afterwards forgot this, and suggested the possibility of advance
upon Herat with the view to attack Russia at her Sarakhs base.

The suggestions made in 1885 with regard to Kashmir and the Gromul Pass were acted upon in
1890.

Sir Donald Stewart, however, went on to recommend a railway extension from Peshawur towards
Kabul, and Sir Frederick Roberts, with greater judgment, on succeeding him, vetoed this scheme.
Lord Kitchener revived it, but was not allowed to complete his work.

Sir Donald Stewart's committee recommended the tunnel at the Khojak, which was carried out. Roberts
reported against it, and he was right.

'On the whole, when Sir Frederick Roberts sent me his view on the
defence proposals, I was struck with the contrast between the completeness
of the manner in which a defence scheme for India has been considered,
and the incompleteness, to say the least of it, of all strategic plans
at home.

Sir Charles Macgregor put on record at the same time his view that
a mere offensive on the North-West Frontier of India would be folly,
if not madness, and that it would be necessary also to undertake offensive
operations against Russia.

Quite so, according to all rules of war, and if ultimate defeat is to be avoided. Unfortunately,
however, it is not easy to attack Russia, and the proposals made
by Sir Charles Macgregor would not bear investigation.

Sir Frederick Roberts himself afterwards tried his hand at proposals of his own in a Memorandum entitled,
"What are Russia's vulnerable points?" But I do not know that he was more successful, and I fear
that his first question, "Has Russia any vulnerable points?" must, if we are looking to permanency,
and not to merely temporary measures, be answered in the negative, except as regards Vladivostock--a
case I put. After much correspondence with me on this last memorandum, Sir Frederick Roberts quoted
me, without naming me, as having, to his regret, informed him that English public opinion would
oppose a Turkish alliance, that a Turkish alliance would not be of much use if we could obtain
it, and that apart even from these considerations we could not obtain
it if we wished.'

The importance which Sir Charles attached to Vladivostock,
as the vulnerable point at which Russia could be attacked in time
of war, explains his regret when Port Hamilton, which threatened Vladivostock,
was abandoned.

[Footnote: See Life of Lord Granville, vol. ii., p. 440; and Europe and the Far East, by Sir Robert
K. Douglas, pp. 190, 248, 249.]

'May, 1885.--The Port Hamilton matter began about this time. We had seized it, and, as Northbrook and
I agreed, "for naval reasons we ought to keep it." Northbrook also wrote that he was laying
a cable from Shanghai to Port Hamilton, which he thought a most important
precaution in time of war; but Port Hamilton was afterwards given
up because the sailors found it dull--an insufficient reason.'

CHAPTER
XL

REDISTRIBUTION: COERCION AND DEVOLUTION

1885

I.

The year 1885
saw the Seats Bill, with its numerous compromises in detail, passed
into law, but not without attendant difficulties.

'On Ash Wednesday, February 18th, I saw Sir Stafford Northcote, and settled with him, in view
of the meeting of the House on the next day, the whole course of affairs for the 19th and 20th,
under guise of discussing details of the Seats Bill. After we had parted, Northcote wrote
to me that on consideration he had come to the conclusion that he must give notice of a vote of censure,
but our amicable communication continued on the next day.

"On consideration," with Northcote, always meant "After bullying by Randolph."'

In the process of settlement there were constant meetings with Lord Salisbury and Sir Stafford
Northcote together, with Lord John Manners, with Sir Michael Hicks
Beach; while on the Conservative scheme for Irish grouping

'I saw
Healy for them, to discover if the thing could be done by general
consent; and, although Healy did not oppose right out, the prospect
of an agreement on details was far from promising.

Healy and I took the opportunity to discuss the Parnell-Chamberlain Irish National Board scheme,
of which I had written to Grant Duff on January 23rd, "Chamberlain has a grand scheme for
an Irish Board."'

March 6th.--'Healy having told me that he was sure Lord Salisbury had "rigged" the Irish Boundary
Commission, and I having written this to Spencer, I received an indignant denial. "If indignation
were justified at anything that Healy says, I should indignantly deny his accusation."'

'Between March 11th and 13th the Conservatives had given me a good deal of trouble by trying, under
pressure from their friends, to vary the Seats Agreement upon several points.... They then attacked
the two-member towns in England, which, it may be remembered, had
been insisted on by Mr. Gladstone against my wish; and Northcote wrote:
"Lord Salisbury and I never liked that privilegium, and wished to
have single-member constituencies everywhere"; he tried hard to get
me to reopen the question, knowing doubtless that I was with him on
the merits.

He continued to press the question as late as March 15th, when he wrote: "Our men are getting
hard to hold, and, having twice walked through the lobby almost alone,
I have no taste for repeating the operation."

Conference with Lord Salisbury followed, and the final stages were
reached: from Monday, March 23rd, I had the Seats Bill in Committee
four days a week.'

The essential fact in these dealings is that emphasized
by Mr. Howel Thomas, Secretary to the Boundary Commission:

'No political
or other pressure would induce Sir Charles--and the strongest pressure
was used again and again--even to contemplate a departure from the
spirit of the compact.

When once an agreement became possible, he would spare no trouble
to modify details.

But without agreement, however strong the argument for a change, nothing was listened to.'

'On May 6th I received from Sir John Lambert, the retired Permanent Secretary of the Local Government
Board, a most grateful letter about the Privy Councillorship, which
had been announced to him by Mr. Gladstone, and which no man ever
more greatly deserved as an honour, or by his character more greatly
honoured.' [Footnote: John Lambert's letter to Sir Charles contained
these words: 'I have had the opportunity of assisting you in a work
which has placed you in the very foremost rank of statesmen, and I
have formed a friendship which is one of the most gratifying incidents
of my declining years.']

'On the morning of May 9th I received a
letter from Northcote, congratulating me on the manner in which I
had conducted the Redistribution Bill "through its difficult stages....
Let me thank you once more for the great consideration, as well as
the perfect loyalty, with which you have dealt with the numerous questions,
and congratulate you on having brought your ship so well into port."'
[Footnote: Upon a table in the larger drawing-room at 76, Sloane Street
there stood always a bronze 'Victory' sent by Sir George Trevelyan
to Sir Charles to celebrate the passing of the Redistribution Bill,
with these words:

'Dear Dilke,--The bronze is a Victory on a globe.

The Victory is obvious. The globe below signifies the manner in which your conduct of the
Redistribution Bill got the Tory Press under your feet.

I am pleased to think that, as a work of art, it may pass muster
even before such an artist as the future Lady Dilke.... It is a copy
of a Herculaneum bronze.... I cannot help hoping that you will think
it not unworthy of the event which it is meant to commemorate.']

But
'port' was not finally reached till after the fall of the Ministry
in June.

Work on the Housing Commission was also practically completed.

Throughout the year the Report had been under discussion.

On February 16th 'I told Chamberlain that the Labourers' Ireland Committee
had "advised taking of land under compulsory powers in order to attach
it to cottages"--a proposal which was afterwards carried; to which
Chamberlain replied: "And your Commission?" and I answered: "We shall,
I hope, but Lord Salisbury is jibbing since your speeches"

(on the unauthorized programme).

'On March 11th, at the meeting of my Housing Commission, Lord Salisbury proposed what Goschen
at once described as "Revolution," and Broadhurst "Socialism." He wanted to give public money
out of taxes to London. It may have been silly, but it was not either revolutionary or socialistic.'

When
it came to the point of acting on the Report, the Tory leader was very far from revolutionary;
on June 4th,

'I was also seeing Lord Salisbury as to the Housing Commission Bills, which he was to introduce
into the House of Lords, [Footnote: Sir Charles was to take charge
of the measures in the Commons.] He was strongly opposed to putting
it into the power of Boards of Guardians "to build out of the rates
as many cottages, with half- acres attached, as they like, taking
for the purpose any land they please."

In another letter he wrote: "I should provide that-- (1) The Local Authority must pass a petition
to the Local Government Board to apply the Acts.

(2) The Local Government Board must send down and inquire with a
long notice.

(3) If the Local Government Board inspector reports (i.) that the poorer classes of the parish are not,
and are not likely to be, sufficiently housed without the application of the Acts; (ii.) that
the Acts can be applied without ultimate loss to the ratepayers, then a vote of the local authorities
should be sufficient to apply the Acts. It would be better that a sufficient interval should be
passed in these processes to insure that the second vote should be given by a newly elected
local authority."'

On April 4th to 9th the Housing Commission visited Scotland.

'On the evening of April 4th I dined with the Lord Provost of Edinburgh.

On Easter Day I attended the Kirk with the Lord Provost, hearing a
magnificent sermon by Principal Caird, and in the evening dined with
the Lord Advocate.

On Easter Tuesday I dined with the Convention of Royal Burghs.

On Thursday, April 9th, we left Edinburgh for London.'

There remained only the question of inquiring and reporting with regard to Ireland, and here perplexities
abounded.

As far back as February 7th at the Cabinet, 'the third matter discussed
was that of the proposed visit of the Prince of Wales to Dublin as
a member of my Commission, or, by himself, in advance of the visit
of the Commission.

It was decided that Parliament could not be asked for his expenses
without trouble with the Irish.'

April 9th.--'I now began discussing
with Spencer the conditions on which the Commission was to appear
at Dublin, with regard to which there were great difficulties.

Gray was on the Commission, but could not be Spencer's guest in any
way, although, on the other hand, he and his friends were willing
to receive me in spite of my being a member of the Government.

[Footnote: Mr. Dwyer Gray, Nationalist member for Carlow in 1885. In 1886 he represented St.
Stephen's Green, Dublin.] Spencer, in inviting me to stay with him, wrote: "I do not think
you will fear the denunciation of United Ireland."

'On April 17th I entered in my diary, after the meeting of the Royal Commission at which we
signed our report: "Pleasures of Ireland.

If we stay with Spencer, the Irish witnesses say that they will not appear before the Commission;
and if we do not, I am told that the 'loyalists' will not appear." On this day I wrote to
Grant Duff: "I may go"


So his tailor was sent for, and six creamy flannel and serge suits were ordered, made with
the short coats, which he preferred, with a gray suit or two for travel, and he did not wear
black again, except for evening dress and on special occasions. It was a gratifying change,
and though the newspapers made much of it, there was no one who was not gladdened by the beauty
of his garments and their general harmony with his person. He had never worn anything so appropriate
or so impressive.

This departure of costume came along a week or two before the Washington trip, and when his
bags were being packed for the excursion he was somewhat in doubt as to the propriety of bursting
upon Washington in December in that snowy plumage. I ventured:

"This is a lobbying expedition of a peculiar kind, and does not seem to invite any half-way
measures. I should vote in favor of the white suit."

I think Miss Clemens was for it, too. She must have been or the vote wouldn't have carried,
though it was clear he strongly favored the idea. At all events, the white suits came along.

We were off the following afternoon: Howells, Robert Underwood Johnson, one of the Appletons,
one of the Putnams, George Bowker, and others were on the train. On the trip down in the dining-car
there was a discussion concerning the copyrighting of ideas, which finally resolved itself
into the possibility of originating a new one. Clemens said:

"There is no such thing as a new idea. It is impossible. We simply take a lot of old ideas
and put them into a sort of mental kaleidoscope. We give them a turn and they make new and
curious combinations. We keep on turning and making new combinations indefinitely; but they
are the same old pieces of colored glass that have been in use through all the ages."

We put up at the Willard, and in the morning drove over to the Congressional Library, where
the copyright hearing was in progress. There was a joint committee of the two Houses seated
round a long table at work, and a number of spectators more or less interested in the bill,
mainly, it would seem, men concerned with the protection of mechanical music-rolls. The fact
that this feature was mixed up with literature was not viewed with favor by most of the writers.
Clemens referred to the musical contingent as "those hand-organ men who ought to have a bill
of their own."

I should mention that early that morning Clemens had written this letter to Speaker Cannon:

December 7, 1906.

We went over to the Capitol now to deliver to "Uncle Joe" this characteristic letter. We had
picked up Clemens's nephew, Samuel E. Moffett, at the Library, and he came along and led the
way to the Speaker's room. Arriving there, Clemens laid off his dark overcoat and stood there,
all in white, certainly a startling figure among those clerks, newspaper men, and incidental
politicians. He had been noticed as he entered the Capitol, and a number of reporters had followed
close behind. Within less than a minute word was being passed through the corridors that Mark
Twain was at the Capitol in his white suit. The privileged ones began to gather, and a crowd
assembled in the hall outside.

Speaker Cannon was not present at the moment; but a little later he "billowed" in--which seems
to be the word to express it--he came with such a rush and tide of life. After greetings, Clemens
produced the letter and read it to him solemnly, as if he were presenting a petition. Uncle
Joe listened quite seriously, his head bowed a little, as if it were really a petition, as
in fact it was. He smiled, but he said, quite seriously:

"That is a request that ought to be granted; but the time has gone by when I am permitted any
such liberties. Tom Reed, when he was Speaker, inaugurated a strict precedent excluding all
outsiders from the use of the floor of the House."

"I got in the other time," Clemens insisted.

"Yes," said Uncle Joe; "but that ain't now. Sunset Cox could let you in, but I can't. They'd
hang me." He reflected a moment, and added: "I'll tell you what I'll do: I've got a private
room down-stairs that I never use. It's all fitted up with table and desk, stationery, chinaware,
and cutlery; you could keep house there, if you wanted to. I'll let you have it as long as
you want to stay here, and I'll give you my private servant, Neal, who's been here all his
life and knows every official, every Senator and Representative, and they all know him. He'll
bring you whatever you want, and you can send in messages by him. You can have the members
brought down singly or in bunches, and convert them as much as you please. I'd give you a key
to the room, only I haven't got one myself. I never can get in when I want to, but Neal can
get in, and he'll unlock it for you. You can have the room, and you can have Neal. Now, will
that do you?"

Clemens said it would. It was, in fact, an offer without precedent. Probably never in the history
of the country had a Speaker given up his private room to lobbyists. We went in to see the
House open, and then went down with Neal and took possession of the room. The reporters had
promptly seized upon the letter, and they now got hold of its author, led him to their own
quarters, and, gathering around him, fired questions at him, and kept their note-books busy.
He made a great figure, all in white there among them, and they didn't fail to realize the
value of it as "copy." He talked about copyright, and about his white clothes, and about a
silk hat which Howells wore.

Back in the Speaker's room, at last, he began laying out the campaign, which would begin next
day. By and by he said:

"Look here! I believe I've got to speak over there in that committee-room to-day or to-morrow.
I ought to know just when it is."

I had not heard of this before, and offered to go over and see about it, which I did at once.
I hurried back faster than I had gone.

"Mr. Clemens, you are to speak in half an hour, and the room is crowded full; people waiting
to hear you."

"The devil!" he said. "Well, all right; I'll just lie down here a few minutes and then we'll
go over. Take paper and pencil and make a few headings."

There was a couch in the room. He lay down while I sat at the table with a pencil, making headings
now and then, as he suggested, and presently he rose and, shoving the notes into his pocket,
was ready. It was half past three when we entered the committee-room, which was packed with
people and rather dimly lighted, for it was gloomy outside. Herbert Putnam, the librarian,
led us to seats among the literary group, and Clemens, removing his overcoat, stood in that
dim room clad as in white armor. There was a perceptible stir. Howells, startled for a moment,
whispered:

"What in the world did he wear that white suit for?" though in his heart he admired it as much
as the others.

I don't remember who was speaking when we came in, but he was saying nothing important. Whoever
it was, he was followed by Dr. Edward Everett Hale, whose age always commanded respect, and
whose words always invited interest. Then it was Mark Twain's turn. He did not stand by his
chair, as the others had done, but walked over to the Speaker's table, and, turning, faced
his audience. I have never seen a more impressive sight than that snow-white figure in that
dim-lit, crowded room. He never touched his notes; he didn't even remember them. He began in
that even, quiet, deliberate voice of his the most even, the most quiet, the most deliberate
voice in the world--and, without a break or a hesitation for a word, he delivered a copyright
argument, full of humor and serious reasoning, such a speech as no one in that room, I suppose,
had ever heard. Certainly it was a fine and dramatic bit of impromptu pleading. The weary committee,
which had been tortured all day with dull, statistical arguments made by the mechanical device
fiends, and dreary platitudes unloaded by men whose chief ambition was to shine as copyright
champions, suddenly realized that they were being rewarded for the long waiting. They began
to brighten and freshen, and uplift and smile, like flowers that have been wilted by a drought
when comes the refreshing shower that means renewed life and vigor. Every listener was as if
standing on tiptoe. When the last sentence was spoken the applause came like an explosion.--[Howells
in his book My Mark Twain speaks of Clemens's white clothing as "an inspiration which few men
would have had the courage to act upon." He adds: "The first time I saw him wear it was at
the authors' hearing before the Congressional Committee on Copyright in Washington. Nothing
could have been more dramatic than the gesture with which he flung off his long, loose overcoat
and stood forth in white from his feet to the crown of his silvery head. It was a magnificent
coup, and he dearly loved a coup; but the magnificent speech which he made, tearing to shreds
the venerable farrago of nonsense about nonproperty in ideas which had formed the basis of
all copyright legislation, made you forget even his spectacularity."]

There came a universal rush of men and women to get near enough for a word and to shake his
hand. But he was anxious to get away. We drove to the Willard and talked and smoked, and got
ready for dinner. He was elated, and said the occasion required full-dress. We started down
at last, fronted and frocked like penguins.

I did not realize then the fullness of his love for theatrical effect. I supposed he would
want to go down with as little ostentation as possible, so took him by the elevator which enters
the dining-room without passing through the long corridor known as "Peacock Alley," because
of its being a favorite place for handsomely dressed fashionables of the national capital.
When we reached the entrance of the dining-room he said:

"Isn't there another entrance to this place?"

I said there was, but that it was very conspicuous. We should have to go down the long corridor.

"Oh, well," he said, "I don't mind that. Let's go back and try it over."

So we went back up the elevator, walked to the other end of the hotel, and came down to the
F Street entrance. There is a fine, stately flight of steps--a really royal stair--leading
from this entrance down into "Peacock Alley." To slowly descend that flight is an impressive
thing to do. It is like descending the steps of a throne-room, or to some royal landing-place
where Cleopatra's barge might lie. I confess that I was somewhat nervous at the awfulness of
the occasion, but I reflected that I was powerfully protected; so side by side, both in full-dress,
white ties, white-silk waistcoats, and all, we came down that regal flight.

Of course he was seized upon at once by a lot of feminine admirers, and the passage along the
corridor was a perpetual gantlet. I realize now that this gave the dramatic finish to his day,
and furnished him with proper appetite for his dinner. I did not again make the mistake of
taking him around to the more secluded elevator. I aided and abetted him every evening in making
that spectacular descent of the royal stairway, and in running that fair and frivolous gantlet
the length of "Peacock Alley." The dinner was a continuous reception. No sooner was he seated
than this Congressman and that Senator came over to shake hands with Mark Twain. Governor Francis
of Missouri also came. Eventually Howells drifted in, and Clemens reviewed the day, its humors
and successes. Back in the rooms at last he summed up the progress thus far--smoked, laughed
over "Uncle Joe's" surrender to the "copyright bandits," and turned in for the night.

We were at the Capitol headquarters in Speaker Cannon's private room about eleven o'clock next
morning. Clemens was not in the best humor because I had allowed him to oversleep. He was inclined
to be discouraged at the prospect, and did not believe many of the members would come down
to see him. He expressed a wish for some person of influence and wide acquaintance, and walked
up and down, smoking gloomily. I slipped out and found the Speaker's colored body-guard, Neal,
and suggested that Mr. Clemens was ready now to receive the members.

That was enough. They began to arrive immediately. John Sharp Williams came first, then Boutell,
from Illinois, Littlefield, of Maine, and after them a perfect procession, including all the
leading lights--Dalzell, Champ Clark, McCall--one hundred and eighty or so in all during the
next three or four hours.

Neal announced each name at the door, and in turn I announced it to Clemens when the press
was not too great. He had provided boxes of cigars, and the room was presently blue with smoke,
Clemens in his white suit in the midst of it, surrounded by those darker figures--shaking hands,
dealing out copyright gospel and anecdotes--happy and wonderfully excited. There were chairs,
but usually there was only standing room. He was on his feet for several hours and talked continually;
but when at last it was over, and Champ Clark, who I believe remained longest and was most
enthusiastic in the movement, had bade him good-by, he declared that he was not a particle
tired, and added:

"I believe if our bill could be presented now it would pass."

He was highly elated, and pronounced everything a perfect success. Neal, who was largely responsible
for the triumph, received a ten-dollar bill.

We drove to the hotel and dined that night with the Dodges, who had been neighbors at Riverdale.
Later, the usual crowd of admirers gathered around him, among them I remember the minister
from Costa Rica, the Italian minister, and others of the diplomatic service, most of whom he
had known during his European residence. Some one told of traveling in India and China, and
how a certain Hindu "god" who had exchanged autographs with Mark Twain during his sojourn there
was familiar with only two other American names--George Washington and Chicago; while the King
of Siam had read but three English books--the Bible, Bryce's American Commonwealth, and The
Innocents Abroad.

We were at Thomas Nelson Page's for dinner next evening--a wonderfully beautiful home, full
of art treasures. A number of guests had been invited. Clemens naturally led the dinner-talk,
which eventually drifted to reading. He told of Mrs. Clemens's embarrassment when Stepniak
had visited them and talked books, and asked her what her husband thought of Balzac, Thackeray,
and the others. She had been obliged to say that he had not read them.

"'How interesting!' said Stepniak. But it wasn't interesting to Mrs. Clemens. It was torture."

He was light-spirited and gay; but recalling Mrs. Clemens saddened him, perhaps, for he was
silent as we drove to the hotel, and after he was in bed he said, with a weary despair which
even the words do not convey:

"If I had been there a minute earlier, it is possible--it is possible that she might have died
in my arms. Sometimes I think that perhaps there was an instant--a single instant--when she
realized that she was dying and that I was not there."

In New York I had once brought him a print of the superb "Adams Memorial," by Saint-Gaudens--the
bronze woman who sits in the still court in the Rock Creek Cemetery at Washington.

On the morning following the Page dinner at breakfast, he said:

"Engage a carriage and we will drive out and see the Saint-Gaudens bronze."

It was a bleak, dull December day, and as we walked down through the avenues of the dead there
was a presence of realized sorrow that seemed exactly suited to such a visit. We entered the
little inclosure of cedars where sits the dark figure which is art's supreme expression of
the great human mystery of life and death. Instinctively we removed our hats, and neither spoke
until after we had come away. Then:

"What does he call it?" he asked.

I did not know, though I had heard applied to it that great line of Shakespeare's--"the rest
is silence."

"But that figure is not silent," he said.

And later, as we were driving home:

"It is in deep meditation on sorrowful things."

When we returned to New York he had the little print framed, and kept it always on his mantelpiece.

CCLII

THEOLOGY AND EVOLUTION

From the Washington trip dates a period of still closer association with Mark Twain. On the
way to New York he suggested that I take up residence in his house--a privilege which I had
no wish to refuse. There was room going to waste, he said, and it would be handier for the
early and late billiard sessions. So, after that, most of the days and nights I was there.
This was the hour between dinner and billiards--the hour which he found most restful of the
day. Sometimes he rose, walking the length of the parlors, his step timed to the music and
his thought. Of medium height, he gave the impression of being tall-his head thrown up, and
like a lion's, rather large for his body. These are the pictures that have remained to me out
of the days spent under his roof, and they will not fade while memory lasts.

Of Mark Twain's table philosophies it seems proper to make rather extended record. They were
usually unpremeditated, and they presented the man as he was, and thought. I preserved as much
of them as I could, and have verified phrase and idea, when possible, from his own notes and
other unprinted writings.

This dinner-table talk naturally varied in character from that of the billiard-room. The latter
was likely to be anecdotal and personal; the former was more often philosophical and commentative,
ranging through a great variety of subjects scientific, political, sociological, and religious.
His talk was often of infinity--the forces of creation--and it was likely to be satire of the
orthodox conceptions, intermingled with heresies of his own devising.

Once, after a period of general silence, he said:

"No one who thinks can imagine the universe made by chance. It is too nicely assembled and
regulated. There is, of course, a great Master Mind, but it cares nothing for our happiness
or our unhappiness."

It was objected, by one of those present, that as the Infinite Mind suggested perfect harmony,
sorrow and suffering were defects which that Mind must feel and eventually regulate.

"Yes," he said, "not a sparrow falls but He is noticing, if that is what you mean; but the
human conception of it is that God is sitting up nights worrying over the individuals of this
infinitesimal race."

Then he recalled a fancy which I have since found among his memoranda. In this note he had written:

    The suns & planets that form the constellations of a billion billion
    solar systems & go pouring, a tossing flood of shining globes,
    through the viewless arteries of space are the blood-corpuscles in
    the veins of God; & the nations are the microbes that swarm and
    wiggle & brag in each, & think God can tell them apart at that
    distance & has nothing better to do than try. This--the
    entertainment of an eternity. Who so poor in his ambitions as to
    consent to be God on those terms? Blasphemy? No, it is not
    blasphemy. If God is as vast as that, He is above blasphemy; if He
    is as little as that, He is beneath it.

"The Bible," he said, "reveals the character of its God with minute exactness. It is a portrait
of a man, if one can imagine a man with evil impulses far beyond the human limit. In the Old
Testament He is pictured as unjust, ungenerous, pitiless, and revengeful, punishing innocent
children for the misdeeds of their parents; punishing unoffending people for the sins of their
rulers, even descending to bloody vengeance upon harmless calves and sheep as punishment for
puny trespasses committed by their proprietors. It is the most damnatory biography that ever
found its way into print. Its beginning is merely childish. Adam is forbidden to eat the fruit
of a certain tree, and gravely informed that if he disobeys he shall die. How could that impress
Adam? He could have no idea of what death meant. He had never seen a dead thing. He had never
heard of one. If he had been told that if he ate the apples he would be turned into a meridian
of longitude that threat would have meant just as much as the other one. The watery intellect
that invented that notion could be depended on to go on and decree that all of Adam's descendants
down to the latest day should be punished for that nursery trespass in the beginning.

"There is a curious poverty of invention in Bibles. Most of the great races each have one,
and they all show this striking defect. Each pretends to originality, without possessing any.
Each of them borrows from the other, confiscates old stage properties, puts them forth as fresh
and new inspirations from on high. We borrowed the Golden Rule from Confucius, after it had
seen service for centuries, and copyrighted it without a blush. We went back to Babylon for
the Deluge, and are as proud of it and as satisfied with it as if it had been worth the trouble;
whereas we know now that Noah's flood never happened, and couldn't have happened--not in that
way. The flood is a favorite with Bible-makers. Another favorite with the founders of religions
is the Immaculate Conception. It had been worn threadbare; but we adopted it as a new idea.
It was old in Egypt several thousand years before Christ was born. The Hindus prized it ages
ago. The Egyptians adopted it even for some of their kings. The Romans borrowed the idea from
Greece. We got it straight from heaven by way of Rome. We are still charmed with it."

He would continue in this strain, rising occasionally and walking about the room. Once, considering
the character of God--the Bible God-he said:

"We haven't been satisfied with God's character as it is given in the Old Testament; we have
amended it. We have called Him a God of mercy and love and morals. He didn't have a single
one of those qualities in the beginning. He didn't hesitate to send the plagues on Egypt, the
most fiendish punishments that could be devised--not for the king, but for his innocent subjects,
the women and the little children, and then only to exhibit His power just to show off--and
He kept hardening Pharaoh's heart so that He could send some further ingenuity of torture,
new rivers of blood, and swarms of vermin and new pestilences, merely to exhibit samples of
His workmanship. Now and then, during the forty years' wandering, Moses persuaded Him to be
a little more lenient with the Israelites, which would show that Moses was the better character
of the two. That Old Testament God never had an inspiration of His own."

He referred to the larger conception of God, that Infinite Mind which had projected the universe.
He said:

"In some details that Old Bible God is probably a more correct picture than our conception
of that Incomparable One that created the universe and flung upon its horizonless ocean of
space those giant suns, whose signal-lights are so remote that we only catch their flash when
it has been a myriad of years on its way. For that Supreme One is not a God of pity or mercy--not
as we recognize these qualities. Think of a God of mercy who would create the typhus germ,
or the house-fly, or the centipede, or the rattlesnake, yet these are all His handiwork. They
are a part of the Infinite plan. The minister is careful to explain that all these tribulations
are sent for a good purpose; but he hires a doctor to destroy the fever germ, and he kills
the rattlesnake when he doesn't run from it, and he sets paper with molasses on it for the
house-fly.

"Two things are quite certain: one is that God, the limitless God, manufactured those things,
for no man could have done it. The man has never lived who could create even the humblest of
God's creatures. The other conclusion is that God has no special consideration for man's welfare
or comfort, or He wouldn't have created those things to disturb and destroy him. The human
conception of pity and morality must be entirely unknown to that Infinite God, as much unknown
as the conceptions of a microbe to man, or at least as little regarded.

"If God ever contemplates those qualities in man He probably admires them, as we always admire
the thing which we do not possess ourselves; probably a little grain of pity in a man or a
little atom of mercy would look as big to Him as a constellation. He could create a constellation
with a thought; but He has been all the measureless ages, and He has never acquired those qualities
that we have named--pity and mercy and morality. He goes on destroying a whole island of people
with an earthquake, or a whole cityful with a plague, when we punish a man in the electric
chair for merely killing the poorest of our race. The human being needs to revise his ideas
again about God. Most of the scientists have done it already; but most of them don't dare to
say so."

He pointed out that the moral idea was undergoing constant change; that what was considered
justifiable in an earlier day was regarded as highly immoral now. He pointed out that even
the Decalogue made no reference to lying, except in the matter of bearing false witness against
a neighbor. Also, that there was a commandment against covetousness, though covetousness to-day
was the basis of all commerce: The general conclusion being that the morals of the Lord had
been the morals of the beginning; the morals of the first-created man, the morals of the troglodyte,
the morals of necessity; and that the morals of mankind had kept pace with necessity, whereas
those of the Lord had remained unchanged. It is hardly necessary to say that no one ever undertook
to contradict any statements of this sort from him. In the first place, there was no desire
to do so; and in the second place, any one attempting it would have cut a puny figure with
his less substantial arguments and his less vigorous phrase. It was the part of wisdom and
immeasurably the part of happiness to be silent and listen.

On another evening he began:

"The mental evolution of the species proceeds apparently by regular progress side by side with
the physical development until it comes to man, then there is a long, unexplained gulf. Somewhere
man acquired an asset which sets him immeasurably apart from the other animals--his imagination.
Out of it he created for himself a conscience, and clothes, and immodesty, and a hereafter,
and a soul. I wonder where he got that asset. It almost makes one agree with Alfred Russel
Wallace that the world and the universe were created just for his benefit, that he is the chief
love and delight of God. Wallace says that the whole universe was made to take care of and
to keep steady this little floating mote in the center of it, which we call the world. It looks
like a good deal of trouble for such a small result; but it's dangerous to dispute with a learned
astronomer like Wallace. Still, I don't think we ought to decide too soon about it--not until
the returns are all in. There is the geological evidence, for instance. Even after the universe
was created, it took a long time to prepare the world for man. Some of the scientists, ciphering
out the evidence furnished by geology, have arrived at the conviction that the world is prodigiously
old. Lord Kelvin doesn't agree with them. He says that it isn't more than a hundred million
years old, and he thinks the human race has inhabited it about thirty thousand years of that
time. Even so, it was 99,970,000 years getting ready, impatient as the Creator doubtless was
to see man and admire him. That was because God first had to make the oyster. You can't make
an oyster out of nothing, nor you can't do it in a day. You've got to start with a vast variety
of invertebrates, belemnites, trilobites, jebusites, amalekites, and that sort of fry, and
put them into soak in a primary sea and observe and wait what will happen. Some of them will
turn out a disappointment; the belemnites and the amalekites and such will be failures, and
they will die out and become extinct in the course of the nineteen million years covered by
the experiment; but all is not lost, for the amalekites will develop gradually into encrinites
and stalactites and blatherskites, and one thing and another, as the mighty ages creep on and
the periods pile their lofty crags in the primordial seas, and at last the first grand stage
in the preparation of the world for man stands completed; the oyster is done. Now an oyster
has hardly any more reasoning power than a man has, so it is probable this one jumped to the
conclusion that the nineteen million years was a preparation for him. That would be just like
an oyster, and, anyway, this one could not know at that early date that he was only an incident
in a scheme, and that there was some more to the scheme yet.

"The oyster being finished, the next step in the preparation of the world for man was fish.
So the old Silurian seas were opened up to breed the fish in. It took twenty million years
to make the fish and to fossilize him so we'd have the evidence later.

"Then, the Paleozoic limit having been reached, it was necessary to start a new age to make
the reptiles. Man would have to have some reptiles --not to eat, but to develop himself from.
Thirty million years were required for the reptiles, and out of such material as was left were
made those stupendous saurians that used to prowl about the steamy world in remote ages, with
their snaky heads forty feet in the air and their sixty feet of body and tail racing and thrashing
after them. They are all gone now, every one of them; just a few fossil remnants of them left
on this far-flung fringe of time.

"It took all those years to get one of those creatures properly constructed to proceed to the
next step. Then came the pterodactyl, who thought all that preparation all those millions of
years had been intended to produce him, for there wasn't anything too foolish for a pterodactyl
to imagine. I suppose he did attract a good deal of attention, for even the least observant
could see that there was the making of a bird in him, also the making of a mammal, in the course
of time. You can't say too much for the picturesqueness of the pterodactyl --he was the triumph
of his period. He wore wings and had teeth, and was a starchy-looking creature. But the progression
went right along.

"During the next thirty million years the bird arrived, and the kangaroo, and by and by the
mastodon, and the giant sloth, and the Irish elk, and the old Silurian ass, and some people
thought that man was about due. But that was a mistake, for the next thing they knew there
came a great ice-sheet, and those creatures all escaped across the Bering Strait and wandered
around in Asia and died, all except a few to carry on the preparation with. There were six
of those glacial periods, with two million years or so between each. They chased those poor
orphans up and down the earth, from weather to weather, from tropic temperature to fifty degrees
below. They never knew what kind of weather was going to turn up next, and if they settled
any place the whole continent suddenly sank from under them, and they had to make a scramble
for dry land. Sometimes a volcano would turn itself loose just as they got located. They led
that uncertain, strenuous existence for about twenty-five million years, always wondering what
was going to happen next, never suspecting that it was just a preparation for man, who had
to be done just so or there wouldn't be any proper or harmonious place for him when he arrived,
and then at last the monkey came, and everybody could see at a glance that man wasn't far off
now, and that was true enough. The monkey went on developing for close upon five million years,
and then he turned into a man--to all appearances.

"It does look like a lot of fuss and trouble to go through to build anything, especially a
human being, and nowhere along the way is there any evidence of where he picked up that final
asset--his imagination. It makes him different from the others--not any better, but certainly
different. Those earlier animals didn't have it, and the monkey hasn't it or he wouldn't be
so cheerful."

    [Paine records Twain's thoughts in that magnificent essay: "Was the
    World Made for Man" published long after his death in the group of
    essays under the title "Letters from the Earth." There are minor
    additions in the published version: "coal to fry the fish"; and
    the remnants of life being chased from pole to pole "without a dry
    rag on them,"; and the "coat of paint" on top of the bulb on top
    the Eiffel Tower representing "man's portion of this world's
    history."  Ed.]

He often held forth on the shortcomings of the human race--always a favorite subject--the incompetencies
and imperfections of this final creation, in spite of, or because of, his great attribute--the
imagination. Once (this was in the billiard-room) I started him by saying that whatever the
conditions in other planets, there seemed no reason why life should not develop in each, adapted
as perfectly to prevailing conditions as man is suited to conditions here. He said:

"Is it your idea, then, that man is perfectly adapted to the conditions of this planet?"

I began to qualify, rather weakly; but what I said did not matter. He was off on his favorite
theme.

"Man adapted to the earth?" he said. "Why, he can't sleep out-of-doors without freezing to
death or getting the rheumatism or the malaria; he can't keep his nose under water over a minute
without being drowned; he can't climb a tree without falling out and breaking his neck. Why,
he's the poorest, clumsiest excuse of all the creatures that inhabit this earth. He has got
to be coddled and housed and swathed and bandaged and up holstered to be able to live at all.
He is a rickety sort of a thing, anyway you take him, a regular British Museum of infirmities
and inferiorities. He is always under going repairs. A machine that is as unreliable as he
is would have no market. The higher animals get their teeth without pain or inconvenience.
The original cave man, the troglodyte, may have got his that way. But now they come through
months and months of cruel torture, and at a time of life when he is least able to bear it.
As soon as he gets them they must all be pulled out again, for they were of no value in the
first place, not worth the loss of a night's rest. The second set will answer for a while;
but he will never get a set that can be depended on until the dentist makes one. The animals
are not much troubled that way. In a wild state, a natural state, they have few diseases; their
main one is old age. But man starts in as a child and lives on diseases to the end as a regular
diet. He has mumps, measles, whooping-cough, croup, tonsilitis, diphtheria, scarlet-fever,
as a matter of course. Afterward, as he goes along, his life continues to be threatened at
every turn by colds, coughs, asthma, bronchitis, quinsy, consumption, yellow-fever, blindness,
influenza, carbuncles, pneumonia, softening of the brain, diseases of the heart and bones,
and a thousand other maladies of one sort and another. He's just a basketful of festering,
pestilent corruption, provided for the support and entertainment of microbes. Look at the workmanship
of him in some of its particulars. What are his tonsils for? They perform no useful function;
they have no value. They are but a trap for tonsilitis and quinsy. And what is the appendix
for? It has no value. Its sole interest is to lie and wait for stray grape-seeds and breed
trouble. What is his beard for? It is just a nuisance. All nations persecute it with the razor.
Nature, however, always keeps him supplied with it, instead of putting it on his head, where
it ought to be. You seldom see a man bald-headed on his chin, but on his head. A man wants
to keep his hair. It is a graceful ornament, a comfort, the best of all protections against
weather, and he prizes it above emeralds and rubies, and Nature half the time puts it on so
it won't stay.

"Man's sight and smell and hearing are all inferior. If he were suited to the conditions he
could smell an enemy; he could hear him; he could see him, just as the animals can detect their
enemies. The robin hears the earthworm burrowing his course under the ground; the bloodhound
follows a scent that is two days old. Man isn't even handsome, as compared with the birds;
and as for style, look at the Bengal tiger--that ideal of grace, physical perfection, and majesty.
Think of the lion and the tiger and the leopard, and then think of man--that poor thing!--the
animal of the wig, the ear-trumpet, the glass eye, the porcelain teeth, the wooden leg, the
trepanned skull, the silver wind-pipe--a creature that is mended and patched all over from
top to bottom. If he can't get renewals of his bric-a-brac in the next world what will he look
like? He has just that one stupendous superiority--his imagination, his intellect. It makes
him supreme--the higher animals can't match him there. It's very curious."

A letter which he wrote to J. Howard Moore concerning his book The Universal Kinship was of
this period, and seems to belong here.

    DEAR MR. MOORE, The book has furnished me several days of deep
    pleasure & satisfaction; it has compelled my gratitude at the same
    time, since it saves me the labor of stating my own long-cherished
    opinions & reflections & resentments by doing it lucidly & fervently
    & irascibly for me.

    There is one thing that always puzzles me: as inheritors of the
    mentality of our reptile ancestors we have improved the inheritance
    by a thousand grades; but in the matter of the morals which they
    left us we have gone backward as many grades. That evolution is
    strange & to me unaccountable & unnatural. Necessarily we started
    equipped with their perfect and blemishless morals; now we are
    wholly destitute; we have no real morals, but only artificial ones
    --morals created and preserved by the forced suppression of natural
    & healthy instincts. Yes, we are a sufficiently comical invention,
    we humans.

              Sincerely yours,
                                S. L. CLEMENS.

AN EVENING WITH HELEN KELLER

I recall two pleasant social events of that winter: one a little party given at the Clemenses'
home on New-Year's Eve, with charades and story-telling and music. It was the music feature
of this party that was distinctive; it was supplied by wire through an invention known as the
telharmonium which, it was believed, would revolutionize musical entertainment in such places
as hotels, and to some extent in private houses. The music came over the regular telephone
wire, and was delivered through a series of horns or megaphones--similar to those used for
phonographs--the playing being done, meanwhile, by skilled performers at the central station.
Just why the telharmonium has not made good its promises of popularity I do not know. Clemens
was filled with enthusiasm over the idea. He made a speech a little before midnight, in which
he told how he had generally been enthusiastic about inventions which had turned out more or
less well in about equal proportions. He did not dwell on the failures, but he told how he
had been the first to use a typewriter for manuscript work; how he had been one of the earliest
users of the fountain-pen; how he had installed the first telephone ever used in a private
house, and how the audience now would have a demonstration of the first telharmonium music
so employed. It was just about the stroke of midnight when he finished, and a moment later
the horns began to play chimes and "Auld Lang Syne" and "America."

The other pleasant evening referred to was a little company given in honor of Helen Keller.
It was fascinating to watch her, and to realize with what a store of knowledge she had lighted
the black silence of her physical life. To see Mark Twain and Helen Keller together was something
not easily to be forgotten. When Mrs. Macy (who, as Miss Sullivan, had led her so marvelously
out of the shadows) communicated his words to her with what seemed a lightning touch of the
fingers her face radiated every shade of his meaning-humorous, serious, pathetic. Helen visited
the various objects in the room, and seemed to enjoy them more than the usual observer of these
things, and certainly in greater detail. Her sensitive fingers spread over articles of bric-a-brac,
and the exclamations she uttered were always fitting, showing that she somehow visualized each
thing in all its particulars. There was a bronze cat of handsome workmanship and happy expression,
and when she had run those all--seeing fingers of hers over it she said: "It is smiling."

BILLIARD-ROOM NOTES

The billiard games went along pretty steadily that winter. My play improved, and Clemens found
it necessary to eliminate my odds altogether, and to change the game frequently in order to
keep me in subjection. Frequently there were long and apparently violent arguments over the
legitimacy of some particular shot or play--arguments to us quite as enjoyable as the rest
of the game. Sometimes he would count a shot which was clearly out of the legal limits, and
then it was always a delight to him to have a mock-serious discussion over the matter of conscience,
and whether or not his conscience was in its usual state of repair. It would always end by
him saying: "I don't wish even to seem to do anything which can invite suspicion. I refuse
to count that shot," or something of like nature. Sometimes when I had let a questionable play
pass without comment, he would watch anxiously until I had made a similar one and then insist
on my scoring it to square accounts. His conscience was always repairing itself.

He had experimented, a great many years before, with what was in the nature of a trick on some
unsuspecting player. It consisted in turning out twelve pool-balls on the table with one cue
ball, and asking his guest how many caroms he thought he could make with all those twelve balls
to play on. He had learned that the average player would seldom make more than thirty-one counts,
and usually, before this number was reached, he would miss through some careless play or get
himself into a position where he couldn't play at all. The thing looked absurdly easy. It looked
as if one could go on playing all day long, and the victim was usually eager to bet that he
could make fifty or perhaps a hundred; but for more than an hour I tried it patiently, and
seldom succeeded in scoring more than fifteen or twenty without missing. Long after the play
itself ceased to be amusing to me, he insisted on my going on and trying it some more, and
he would throw himself back and roar with laughter, the tears streaming down his cheeks, to
see me work and fume and fail.

It was very soon after that that Peter Dunne ("Mr. Dooley") came down for luncheon, and after
several games of the usual sort, Clemens quietly--as if the idea had just occurred to him--rolled
out the twelve balls and asked Dunne how, many caroms he thought he could make without a miss.
Dunne said he thought he could make a thousand. Clemens quite indifferently said that he didn't
believe he could make fifty. Dunne offered to bet five dollars that he could, and the wager
was made. Dunne scored about twenty-five the first time and missed; then he insisted on betting
five dollars again, and his defeats continued until Clemens had twenty-five dollars of Dunne's
money, and Dunne was sweating and swearing, and Mark Twain rocking with delight. Dunne went
away still unsatisfied, promising that he would come back and try it again. Perhaps he practised
in his absence, for when he returned he had learned something. He won his twenty-five dollars
back, and I think something more added. Mark Twain was still ahead, for Dunne furnished him
with a good five hundred dollars' worth of amusement.

Clemens never cared to talk and never wished to be talked to when the game was actually in
progress. If there was anything to be said on either side, he would stop and rest his cue on
the floor, or sit down on the couch, until the matter was concluded. Such interruptions happened
pretty frequently, and many of the bits of personal comment and incident scattered along through
this work are the result of those brief rests. Some shot, or situation, or word would strike
back through the past and awaken a note long silent, and I generally kept a pad and pencil
on the window-sill with the score-sheet, and later, during his play, I would scrawl some reminder
that would be precious by and by.

On one of these I find a memorandum of what he called his three recurrent dreams. All of us
have such things, but his seem worth remembering. It is never a pleasant dream, either. I hate
that dream worse than the other.

"My other dream is of being at a brilliant gathering in my night-garments. People don't seem
to notice me there at first, and then pretty soon somebody points me out, and they all begin
to look at me suspiciously, and I can see that they are wondering who I am and why I am there
in that costume. Then it occurs to me that I can fix it by making myself known. I take hold
of some man and whisper to him, 'I am Mark Twain'; but that does not improve it, for immediately
I can hear him whispering to the others, 'He says he is Mark Twain,' and they all look at me
a good deal more suspiciously than before, and I can see that they don't believe it, and that
it was a mistake to make that confession. Sometimes, in that dream, I am dressed like a tramp
instead of being in my night-clothes; but it all ends about the same--they go away and leave
me standing there, ashamed. I generally enjoy my dreams, but not those three, and they are
the ones I have oftenest."

Quite often some curious episode of the world's history would flash upon him--something amusing,
or coarse, or tragic, and he would bring the game to a standstill and recount it with wonderful
accuracy as to date and circumstance. He had a natural passion for historic events and a gift
for mentally fixing them, but his memory in other ways was seldom reliable. He was likely to
forget the names even of those he knew best and saw oftenest, and the small details of life
seldom registered at all.

He had his breakfast served in his room, and once, on a slip of paper, he wrote, for his own
reminder:

The accuracy of your forgetfulness is absolute--it seems never to fail. I prepare to pour my
coffee so it can cool while I shave--and I always forget to pour it.

Yet, very curiously, he would sometimes single out a minute detail, something every one else
had overlooked, and days or even weeks afterward would recall it vividly, and not always at
an opportune moment. Perhaps this also was a part of his old pilot-training. Once Clara Clemens
remarked:

"It always amazes me the things that father does and does not remember. Some little trifle
that nobody else would notice, and you are hoping that he didn't, will suddenly come back to
him just when you least expect it or care for it."

My note-book contains the entry:

    February 11, 1907. He said to-day:

    "A blindfolded chess-player can remember every play and discuss the
    game afterward, while we can't remember from one shot to the next."

    I mentioned his old pilot-memory as an example of what he could do
    if he wished.

    "Yes," he answered, "those are special memories; a pilot will tell
    you the number of feet in every crossing at any time, but he can't
    remember what he had for breakfast."

    "How long did you keep your pilot-memory?" I asked.

    "Not long; it faded out right away, but the training served me, for
    when I went to report on a paper a year or two later I never had to
    make any notes."

    "I suppose you still remember some of the river?"

    "Not much. Hat Island, Helena and here and there a place; but that
    is about all."

FURTHER PERSONALITIES

Like every person living, Mark Twain had some peculiar and petty economies. Such things in
great men are noticeable. He lived extravagantly. His household expenses at the time amounted
to more than fifty dollars a day. In the matter of food, the choicest, and most expensive the
market could furnish was always served in lavish abundance. He had the best and highest-priced
servants, ample as to number. His clothes he bought generously; he gave without stint to his
children; his gratuities were always liberal. He never questioned pecuniary outgoes --seldom
worried as to the state of his bank-account so long as there was plenty. He smoked cheap cigars
because he preferred their flavor. Yet he had his economies. I have seen him, before leaving
a room, go around and carefully lower the gas-jets, to provide against that waste. I have known
him to examine into the cost of a cab, and object to an apparent overcharge of a few cents.

It seemed that his idea of economy might be expressed in these words: He abhorred extortion
and visible waste.

Furthermore, he had exact ideas as to ownership. One evening, while we were playing billiards,
I noticed a five-cent piece on the floor. I picked it up, saying:

"Here is five cents; I don't know whose it is."

He regarded the coin rather seriously, I thought, and said:

"I don't know, either."

I laid it on the top of the book-shelves which ran around the room. The play went on, and I
forgot the circumstance. When the game ended that night I went into his room with him, as usual,
for a good-night word. '"Yes, there is. But it involves the entire recasting of the British Constitution
and the full and complete adoption of the American system.

According to this view you might have five Parliaments, for England,
Scotland, Wales, Ulster, [Footnote: This is the first suggestion of
a scheme under which part of Ireland would be separated from the rest.]
and the three other provinces combined.

Each Parliament to have its own Ministry, responsible to it and dependent on its vote.
 Don't bother to keep account of them."

So it was not miserliness; it was just a peculiarity, a curious attention to a trifling detail.

He had a fondness for riding on the then newly completed Subway, which he called the Underground.
Sometimes he would say:

"I'll pay your fare on the Underground if you want to take a ride with me." And he always insisted
on paying the fare, and once when I rode far up-town with him to a place where he was going
to luncheon, and had taken him to the door, he turned and said, gravely:

"Here is five cents to pay your way home." And I took it in the same spirit in which it had
been offered. It was probably this trait which caused some one occasionally to claim that Mark
Twain was close in money matters. Perhaps there may have been times in his life when he was
parsimonious; but, if so, I must believe that it was when he was sorely pressed and exercising
the natural instinct of self-preservation. He wished to receive the full value (who does not?)
of his labors and properties. He took a childish delight in piling up money; but it became
greed only when he believed some one with whom he had dealings was trying to get an unfair
division of profits. Then it became something besides greed. It became an indignation that
amounted to malevolence. I was concerned in a number of dealings with Mark Twain, and at a
period in his life when human traits are supposed to become exaggerated, which is to say old
age, and if he had any natural tendency to be unfair, or small, or greedy in his money dealings
I think I should have seen it. Personally, I found him liberal to excess, and I never observed
in him anything less than generosity to those who were fair with him. 

No Messieurs of distinguished Torteval families were honoured bearers, but a good man and a bad
man had carried her coffin to the dark place of burial. No weird feasting followed the unconsecrated
ceremony: only Dominic took refuge from sickening terror in a drunken bout.
 Then he sent them, charges paid, to that far Californian
retreat. It was hardly the act of a stingy man.

He had the human fondness for a compliment when it was genuine and from an authoritative source,
and I remember how pleased he was that winter with Prof. William Lyon Phelps's widely published
opinion, which ranked Mark Twain as the greatest American novelist, and declared that his fame
would outlive any American of his time. Phelps had placed him above Holmes, Howells, James,
and even Hawthorne. He had declared him to be more American than any of these--more American
even than Whitman. Professor Phelps's position in Yale College gave this opinion a certain
official weight; but I think the fact of Phelps himself being a writer of great force, with
an American freshness of style, gave it a still greater value.

Among the pleasant things that winter was a meeting with Eugene F. Ware, of Kansas, with whose
penname--"Ironquill"--Clemens had long been familiar.

Ware was a breezy Western genius of the finest type. If he had abandoned law for poetry, there
is no telling how far his fame might have reached. There was in his work that same spirit of
Americanism and humor and humanity that is found in Mark Twain's writings, and he had the added
faculty of rhyme and rhythm, which would have set him in a place apart. I had known Ware personally
during a period of Western residence, and later, when he was Commissioner of Pensions under
Roosevelt. I usually saw him when he came to New York, and it was a great pleasure now to bring
together the two men whose work I so admired. They met at a small private luncheon at The Players,
and Peter Dunne was there, and Robert Collier, and it was such an afternoon as Howells has
told of when he and Aldrich and Bret Harte and those others talked until the day faded into
twilight, and twilight deepened into evening. Clemens had put in most of the day before reading
Ware's book of poems, 'The Rhymes of Ironquill', and had declared his work to rank with the
very greatest of American poetry--I think he called it the most truly American in flavor. I
remember that at the luncheon he noted Ware's big, splendid physique and his Western liberties
of syntax with a curious intentness. I believe he regarded him as being nearer his own type
in mind and expression than any one he had met before. 

I accept the confidence you have reposed in me. I trust that strength may be given to me to
justify that confidence, and I reply--not for a day, nor for a year, but from this day forward,
for better for worse; and thereto I plight my troth.

                       WHIST
        Hour after hour the cards were fairly shuffled,
           And fairly dealt, and still I got no hand;
         The morning came; but I, with mind unruffled,
            Did simply say, "I do not understand."
         Life is a game of whist. From unseen sources
        The cards are shuffled, and the hands are dealt.
         Blind are our efforts to control the forces
        That, though unseen, are no less strongly felt.
         I do not like the way the cards are shuffled,
         But still I like the game and want to play;
       And through the long, long night will I, unruffled,
           Play what I get, until the break of day.
