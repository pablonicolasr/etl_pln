THE PRIEST'S TALE--PÈRE ETIENNE

From "The New Decameron"--Volume III.

By Robert Keable

PÈRE ETIENNE came aboard at Dares-Salaam and did not at once make friends. It was our own fault,
however. He neither obtruded nor effaced himself, but rather went quietly on his own way with
that recollection which the clerical system of the Catholic Church encourages. We few first-class
passengers had already settled down into the usual regularities of shipboard life, from the
morning constitutional in pyjamas on the boat deck, to the Bridge four after dinner in the
smoke-room, and, besides, it was plain that Père Etienne was not likely to have much in common
with any of us. So we were polite at a distance, like Englishmen everywhere. Even I, who, by
virtue of my cloth, might have been supposed to make advances, was shy of beginning. I was
young in those days, and for one thing spelt Rome always with a big capital.

But from the first there was something which attracted me to the priest, the more so as it
was hard to define. In his appearance there was nothing to suggest interest. His age was round
about fifty; his hair brown, though in his beard a white hair or two was to be observed. In
his short black coat and trousers he looked neither mediaeval nor a traveller, and his luggage
was neither romantically minute nor interestingly large. He was booked from Dar-es-Salaam to
Bombay, and the purser professed neither to know whence he came nor whither he went beyond
those two fixed points.

Yet I was attracted. I have no wish to bore you, so that I shall not dwell upon the point,
but in my opinion it was interesting. There are some people who carry an atmosphere with them
as they go their own individual way about the world, and there are others who can instantly
perceive it. I am not speaking of clairvoyance; I dislike that jargon; but I do know that I
was conscious of Père Etienne if he did but pass the smoke-room door when I was about to play
a doubled four in No Trumps.

Well, our old British India tramp lay about for a week in Dar-es-Salaam harbour, rolled up
to Tanga, and finally crossed over to Zanzibar, without further developments. There we passengers
went sweltering about the narrow streets, visited duly the coconut and clove plantations, and
conceived ourselves to be exploring by hiring a car, crossing the island to Chuaka, and spending
a day up the creek. Père Etienne went at once to the Catholic Mission and remained there. Thus
it was not until the evening on which we sailed that we saw him again.

It was half an hour or so before sunset, and a serene beauty lay over land and sea. There was
the gentlest breeze, and at our moorings it was almost cool. We were clustering on the landward
side of the ship, smoking and watching the town and harbour. Close up under the tall white
houses the blue sea broke in tiny creamy ripples on the sand or the low coral rocks, and, with
its green woods to right and left, the city seemed to dream in the sun. One could see, however,
that it was preparing to wake. A flutter of orange or scarlet on the flat roofs here and there
told that the women were already coming up to enjoy the cooler hours; and between the thin
cassuarinas in the square that opened to the sea before the Sultan's Palace, a white-robed
crowd was gathering for the faint excitement of the sunset gun. Between ship and shore, the
brown-timbered rough-hewn native boats came and went on their long oars, and in smarter skiffs
the silk and curio merchants were taking a lingering leave of us. From the south a dozen peaceful
lateen-sailed dhows beat up for the native anchorage behind which, from our view-point, the
twin spires of the Catholic cathedral stood out against an opal sky. Despite travellers' tales,
there is only one mosque with a minaret in Zanzibar, and that so small and hidden that it is
scarcely visible from the sea.

Watching the dhows and sighting the cathedral, suggested, I suppose, Père Etienne. Someone
asked if his reverence had come aboard, but no one knew. Lazily turning the question and answer
over in my mind, I became aware that I was sure he had. The persistent intuition grew on me.
Without speaking of it, I determined, out of sheer curiosity, to go and see. I detached myself
from the group unobtrusively, and strolled off round the deck.

Sure enough on the seaward side I saw him. He was sitting in a deck-chair and looking out across
the water. At first I thought he was gazing intently at nothing, but as I too looked, I made
out, across the strait, the dim outline of the Sham-balla Mountains on the mainland that are
sometimes visible for a little at sunset and dawn. The priest's chair was drawn close to the
bulwark, and almost before I knew what I was doing, I was leaning against it in an attitude
which allowed me, too, to see those distant peaks and at the same time to converse easily,
if it should be permitted.

"Hullo, father," I said; "we were wondering if you had come aboard."

He looked at me, smiling. "I believe I was one of the first," he replied, in his excellent English.

"Saying good-bye to Africa?" I queried, half jocularly.

"Yes, I expect so."

The tone of his voice suggested far more than the words themselves expressed. It aroused my
curiosity. "For long?" I asked.

"Well, I don't suppose I shall see those peaks again. I saw them first twenty-seven years ago,
a young priest on his first mission, and I have not seen them from the sea since. Now I have
been ordered to India to my second mission, and it is not very likely that I shall be moved
again. It is still less likely that I shall return. After so long an acquaintance, it is natural
that I should want to say good-bye."

I think I was slightly incredulous. "Do you mean you have been over twenty-seven years up there
without leave?" I questioned.

"Twenty-seven next month, there and beyond."

I have told you that I was young in those days, and I did not then know of the heroic sacrifices
of Catholic missionaries. Moreover, I too was taking a first leave--after two years' service,
according to our plan. And I was eagerly looking forward to a visit to my married sister in
India, and a journey home after that. Stupidly enough, it took me a few seconds to swallow
those twenty-seven years; but for all that my mind worked quickly. Twenty-seven years of tinned
food, mosquitoes, heat, natives, and packing-case furniture! That was how I read it. "Well,"
I said at last, "I should think you were glad to go anywhere after all that time."

"Eh? Oh, I don't know. No, that's wrong; I do know. I'm sorry, that's the truth."

"You like Africa?"

The Frenchman showed himself in the half-humorous shrug of the shoulders, but the missionary
spoke. "It has become my home, and its people my people," he said.

I turned the saying over in my mind before I spoke again. Then interest and attraction overcame
my hesitation, and I abandoned all pretence of making a chance conversation. "Father," I said,
"I expect you have travelled a good deal up there and seen many things. Tell me a little about
it all. I've seen enough to be very interested in your experiences. May I pull up a chair and
may we talk?"

His brown eyes twinkled, "Certainly," he said, "especially if you will give me a fill of that
English tobacco you're smoking. Years ago I learned to smoke English tobacco, but it hasn't
too often come my way."

I threw him my pouch with a laugh and went to find a chair. That was the beginning of many
conversations, but none of his stories interested me more than the one he told me that night.
He had half hinted of strange happenings away back there in remote districts, as well as of
more commonplace although sufficiently interesting journeys and adventures, and it was to the
less usual that I was drawn that evening. There was that about Père Etienne which made one
feel that the commonplace world was of secondary importance, and that he, like the poet at
Charing Cross, might find Jacob's ladder reaching heavenward in any place. Thus, while the
light died swiftly out of the sky and the stars shone out over that far-off range which runs
up to the Para Mountains and giant Kilimanjaro and that far-flung plain which lies embraced
beyond, between them and the great lakes, I put my question and he answered it. "Tell me the
queerest of all the queer things you have seen, father," I said.

"Queer?"

"Yes," said I. "Unusual, I mean. Not necessarily supernatural, and not horrible. But the thing,
perhaps, that more than all else draws your mind back to Africa."

"You ask a big thing," he said, smiling friendlily.

"And I believe you can answer it," said I, impulsively.

He nodded more gravely. "I believe I can," he said.

"I shall tell you a little story that seems to me singularly arresting and tender. True, I
believe that it may arrest me because it occurred in a village--or perhaps I should say a town--which
I have visited but once though I have often tried to get back to it again. Now I shall never
go. Very likely it is for that reason, then, that it lingers in my memory as a place of great
beauty, though in my opinion there are other causes. However, let me begin by describing it to you.

"From the slopes of Kilimanjaro you can look westwards to Mweru, a still active volcano little
known and rarely visited, and from Mweru a chain of heights runs west once more till they end
abruptly almost in a precipice that descends to the plain. At its foot rises a small river,
bubbling up from half a dozen springs in a slight depression, and flowing swiftly off, very
clear and cool, towards the great lake which is visible on the horizon from the mountain behind.
Just below the pool of the source, on the right bank, shaded with trees, ringed with giant
aloes and set in fields of millet and maize, stands a somewhat remarkable native town. There
is stone in the hills, and the natives have drawn and worked it for their huts--not a usual
thing in tropical Africa. They may, of course, have learned the lore themselves, or some wandering
Arab traders may have taught them; but I have another idea, as you shall hear. Be that as it
may, there the neat houses stand--grey walls, brown thatch, small swept yards of trodden earth
before them within the rings of neat reed fencing. Great willows grow along the bank and trail
their hanging tendrils in the water, and the brown kiddies swing from them and go splashing
into the stream with shouts of delight. The place is remote, and in a corner out of the path
of marauding tribes. Not too easy to find, its folk are peaceable, and I can see it again as
I saw it on my first visit when, from the height of the precipice behind, I could make out
the thin spires of smoke rising on the evening air and just perceive the brown herds of cattle
drifting slowly homewards to the protecting kraals.

"The tribe is a branch of the Bonde, iron workers and a settled folk. How they came to be there,
so far north and west of the main stock of their people, I do not know, but of course one comes
across that kind of thing fairly commonly and the explanation is nearly always the same. Fear
of some kind drove out a family who wandered, like Abram from Charron, until they found a promised
land. These folk knew that they came from the south and east a long long time ago; more they
neither knew nor cared to know. They were not many in number, and although Arab safaris had
passed by, they were not enough to tempt a permanent trader to cross the barren lands north
and south, or dare the mountain way from Mweru. The chief's oldest councillor spoke to me of
a slave-raid that had been defeated when he was a young man, but since then they had dwelt
in peace. No European had been there within living memory.

"Such was, and may be still, the town of Mtakatifuni, as I shall call it. Do you know Ki-Swahili?"

I shook my head.

"Then the name will do, and not spoil my tale. Let me but tell you how I came to be there and
I will make haste about it. I was exploring. Ah, but once in all the years have I been able
to explore! Usually we missionaries hurry from place to place on an unending round till the
circle is as big as we can possibly manage. Then a new centre must be made, and it was because
my Order had determined on a new centre that my opportunity came. The Vicar Apostolic was doubtful
as to the direction in which we should expand. He sent me, therefore, west beyond Mweru to
see what could be seen, and another farther south on the same errand. The folk were few about
Mweru, but I heard a rumour of Mtakatifuni, much exaggerated, and set out to find it. Foolishly
I went west until supplies were so low that it would have been fatal to turn back over the
bare mountains by which we had come, and our only hope lay in pushing on. And so I reached
my hidden town, stayed a while, and returned another way, to find that the other explorer had
a report to make of more peopled and easier lands which found greater favour with his lordship.
And rightly. When labourers are so few and the field is so big, it is necessary to settle where
the work offers most prospect of large returns. So was I permitted to see, but not to enter in."

He leant forward to knock out his pipe, blew down it, refused more tobacco, and re-settled
himself. "Ah, well," he said philosophically, "le Bon Dieu knows best. I do not believe He
has forgotten Mtakatifuni.

"Where was I? Oh yes, I remember. We saw the place then, in the evening, and next morning journeyed
early towards it. You must understand that we were spent. I cannot recall better water than
that at the source of that little river, and the roasted mealies they gave us, and sour milk,
how good it all was! The chief had sent word that we were to be fed and given an empty house,
and after I had eaten I went to see and thank him. I put on my cassock and with it my beads
about my waist, and I carried my breviary in my hand, for I thought he might keep me waiting
in the native fashion and that I could say my office in the meantime.

"But he received me at once. The ground rose a little and was built up too before his group
of huts, terraced roughly and faced with stone, with steps at one end. A big block of stone
stood near the edge of it, so that standing behind one looked east over the town to the mountains,
and it was there, after a little, that I offered the Holy Sacrifice each remaining day of my
stay. There was little linen in the place, and he stood to greet me at the top of the steps,
clad in prepared skins, a youngish man and a fine figure of a savage king. He gave me later
the twisted iron spear of state that he carried that day. It hangs in our church of the Holy
Cross now, behind the altar of the Sacred Heart. Surely the Good God will not forget Mtakatifuni.

"Well, he greeted me courteously, with reserve, but with a suggestion of curious eagerness.
I marked it at once. Not, however, till the usual questions as to my journeys and so on were
over, did I get a clue to the cause of it. But then, when we were seated on stools by the great
stone I have mentioned, big clay beakers of thin, delicious light beer beside us, he put a
question. 'Why have you been so long a time coming, my father?' he asked. 'A little later and
you would have been too late.'

"I was slightly puzzled, but I supposed he referred to the length of my journey. 'The way was
long and rough, chief,' said I.

"'But why were you so long in setting out?' he persisted. 'Mwezi has been expecting you for
many years.' He turned to an old councillor. 'How many years has Mwezi been expecting the father?'

"'Since the days of the Great One, the father of the King,' said the old man. 'Mwezi came first
among us when I was a boy.'

"Now most of this was Greek to me, but the speaker was fifty if he was a day, whatever allowance
was to be made for the early ageing of Africans, and you may imagine that I understood enough
to be surprised. 'How could that be, chief?' I asked. 'When this old man was a boy, I had not
crossed the black water to come to this land, and possibly I had not been born. Truly of this
Mwezi I knew nothing, but how could he expect me whom even my mother had not seen?'

"The chief looked worried, and stared at me for awhile in silence. Then he nodded thoughtfully.
'It is true,' he said. 'The father is doubtless wise and has seen years, but his beard is not
white and the thing is strange. Nevertheless he wears the black robe and the dried beans, and
he carries the book in his hand, even as Mwezi has said. Still, I have sent for Mwezi, and
doubtless he will explain the matter. See, he comes; slowly, for he is very old. Does the father
not remember him at all?'

"He pointed down the path that led up to us from the town, into which had come a small crowd
of natives who were eagerly following three or four figures, jostling each other to get a better
view. It soon became plain that a young man led the way, and that after him came three of whom
I guessed the central person to be Mwezi. I think he was the oldest native I have ever seen,
bent, shrivelled, and stiff-jointed, but with keen dark eyes which, a little later, fixed themselves
inquiringly on my face and then clouded with acute disappointment. On either side his sons
helped him with a hand beneath his arm-pits, and he himself walked by means of a great stick.
The crowd of hangers-on stopped respectfully below, but these four climbed up to the dais.
A stool was brought for the old man, but at first he would not sit. He stood there, staring
at me and shaking his head. 'It is not he,' he said, 'it is not he. Yet he is like, very like.
But it is not he.'

"I was still perplexed at all this, but by this time a little amused. Nevertheless I hid that,
for the old fellow was so plainly disappointed.

"'Come, father,' I said. 'I am very sorry, but will you not explain? Perhaps it is a brother
of mine whom you have seen. Seat yourself and tell me about it.'

"He did not seem at once to comprehend, but when his sons had persuaded him to sit, he made
a peremptory motion with his stick towards the old councillor who had spoken before. This individual
glanced at the chief for permission, and having received it, told me this story at considerable
length.

"He said that, very many years before, in the time of the late king, the village had been one
day thrown into a state of great excitement by the advent of a stranger. This had been Mwezi,
at the time a man of middle age. He had come from the south and west--from Central Africa,
that is--and he had said that he was seeking a white man whom it had been shown him he should
find in that village. Pressed for details, he announced that he had come from a town far away
by a wide river where there were great falls over whose rocks the water thundered night and
day in a perpetual cloud of spray. One night he had awakened in his hut, and had seen a white
man standing before him dressed in a black robe, a string of beads, and carrying a book. Behind
the white man he could see, as it were, the vision of a town, a river, a precipice--in short,
what he now saw to have been Mtakatifuni. The figure had beckoned him solemnly, and he had
sat up in his bed in fear. It had beckoned again, and had then pointed north and east, and
at that the vision had died away before the startled sleeper's eyes. But Mwezi understood.
In his mind there had been no question as to what he must do. In the dawn he had risen, said
good-bye to his wife and family, and set out. For two years he had journeyed, wandering from
place to place, scarcely knowing whither he went save that it was always north and east. The
very wild beasts had respected him, and men, seeing the vision in his eyes, had withheld their
hands from him. At length, then, he had reached Mtakatifuni. There, as always, he had inquired
for his white man, and, hearing that no white man had ever been there but convinced that it
was the place of his dream, he sat down to wait. He had grown old waiting; had married, and
had begotten sons and daughters. Now he was too old to move; all but too old to live; but still
he waited. Still he believed he would see his white man again before he died; indeed, he could
not die until he had seen. My coming had seemed to the whole place the fulfilment of his vision,
but I was not the man. Mwezi was sure of that and no one doubted him. And maybe, now, added
the councillor, he would never see him. That was all.

"Now I had been long enough in Africa to set little store by native dreams as a rule. The affair,
then, seemed to me pathetic rather than interesting.

"My eyes kept straying to the old fellow while the story was being told me, and I marvelled
to think of the simplicity of his faith, the weariness of his journey into the unknown, and
the tenacity with which he had clung to his obsession. That this man should have given his
whole life to such a quest, and should now be so bitterly disappointed when a remote chance
had brought it nearer realisation than had been in the least degree likely, was indeed certainly
cruel. I therefore turned to him to make what amends I could.

"'But, old Mwezi,' I said as kindly as possible, 'doubtless you are mistaken. It was but once
that you saw the figure in your dream, and that years ago. You dreamt of a white man dressed
as I. Well, I belong to a regiment of white men who dress alike, and for many lives it has
been the custom of that regiment to dress so. Doubtless as a boy you had seen one of my brethren,
or perchance a picture of one, and your spirit saw him again in a dream. If I am right, and
your home is on that great river which we white men call the Zambesi, then it is not unlikely
that such a thing happened. Perhaps you have forgotten. Now in me you see him whom you seek.'

"The old fellow's keen eyes flashed angrily. 'The white stranger mocks me,' he said.

"I protested. 'No, father, I do not mean to mock you. Why should I do so? But come now, can
you describe the face of the man you saw?'

"'I can, and easily. His beard was white and not as thine. Moreover, he was bald-headed, and
beneath his right eye was there a little scar such as he had perhaps received in the hunt from
some beast or the other. His face was long and thin, and his nose bigger. Am I a child that
I should not know one man from another? Thou art not he.'

"It was foolish of me, but I was surprised out of all caution. 'How could you see so much in
the dark of your hut?' I exclaimed.

"Mwezi rose to his feet and made a pathetic effort to hold his head erect. With true native
dignity, he ignored me and turned to the chief. 'With the leave of the chief, I go,' he said.
'I am old and would rest in my place. Fare thee well, father of thy people. The Heavens guard
thee. Be in peace.'

"I realised that I had blundered, but at the moment there was nothing to do. We watched the
procession move away again almost in silence, and I noticed curiously that the crowd were even
more interested in Mwezi than in myself, a white stranger. When he was out of sight, I apologised
to the chief, who, however, would not hear that I had done any wrong. He himself showed me
back to the house set apart for us and invited me to feast with him in the evening. He gave
me leave to speak to his people, and I remember that I was so dog-tired that I lay down at
once and slept for the rest of the day.

"In the morning, however, I remembered Mwezi, and told the chief that I would like to go and
call on him. I determined to do what I could for the old fellow's peace of mind, and, with
a guide and one of my own boys, we set out.

"The way led through the native huts and without them. It was downhill going, as the village,
in African fashion, was built on the side of a rise which culminated in the chief's hut, while
Mwezi lived, very close to the source of the river I have mentioned. We emerged through trees
into a grassy open space of perhaps thirty paces wide, and I saw at once the old fellow sitting
at the door of his hut beneath the shade of a wild vine which grew luxuriantly over the porch
and roof. I was too much occupied in greeting him to take note at once of the building, but
when we were seated, and he had been thawed out of his first coolness, I looked more closely
at it. It interested me. It was long in shape, much longer than the usual native hut, and with
three windows narrow and pointed, one of them now roughly blocked with sods. I examined the
stones of the walls, getting up to do so. They struck me as being old and much more carefully
laid than is usual in native work.

"'Did you build this house yourself, old man?' I asked. 'It is well made.'

"'I did not build it,' he said. 'I found it here. When I came to Mtakatifuni, it was empty
and had been empty for long. There was no roof to it in those days, and few came near the place.
But that suited me. My mind was full of him whom I had seen, and my spirit told me that I should
await him here. The father of the chief then gave it me, no councillor knowing aught about it.'

"'And you planted this vine and cleared this space, perhaps?'

"'I did not. I did but train the vine which had blocked the door, and cut down for the wood
of the roof the young trees that had grown here. But some other had cleared the ground before me.'

"'Would you mind if I looked within, Mwezi?' I questioned, for to tell you the truth my curiosity
was thoroughly aroused.

"The old fellow got up courteously. 'Enter, white man,' said he. 'My sons shall bring the stools
and fetch us beer. I am old and poor, but you are welcome. You are at least of the people of
him I saw, and shall I, in my sorrow, forbid you to come in?'

"We entered. The place was divided into two by a sod partition, plainly recent in construction,
and I looked disappointedly at what I could see. There were the usual scant furnishings of
a native hut--a kitanda, some pots, a stool or two, a few spears in a corner. But when I passed
round the partition, my interest increased tenfold. I even cried out in my astonishment.

"I saw what I had not been able to see from the fact of my approach from the west of the clearing.
The eastern end of the hut was not built squarely as the other, but roughly rounded in what
elsewhere I should unhesitatingly have called an apse, and since on either side there were
still visible a couple of those narrow pointed windows, while the floor space was practically
empty, the suggestion of a chapel was complete. I ought, perhaps, to have guessed it before,
but the thought burst on me suddenly. The situation, near the stream rather than up on the
hill, the orientation, the unusual length, the vine, the clearing--everything pointed in the
same direction. And then the old man's story. I was frankly amazed.

"I turned and saw him standing in the doorway, his hand on the mud wall for support, his eyes
peering at me from his bowed head. If I had been momentarily suspicious of a knowledge hitherto
kept from me, all fled at the sight of him. He was transparently honest and eager. 'What is
it, white man?' he quavered.

"'Mwezi,' said I, 'here is a strange thing and a wonder. You tell me that you saw in your vision
a white man, and I know from what you say that he was a priest. You travelled far, and your
spirit sent you here. Well, I do not doubt that this house of yours was once a place of worship,
and I think it was built by white priests. Think now, have you heard of no such thing?'

"He swayed a little as he stood, and did not answer at once. Then he slowly shook his head.
'I have heard nothing, nothing,' he said. 'If it be so, none know of these things, white man.
Art thou sure? Thou wouldst not mock me again.'

"'Mwezi,' I cried eagerly, 'I do not mock you. Why should I do any such thing? I cannot yet
tell certainly, but this place is such as we build for prayers, and we may yet make sure. May
I search more diligently?'

"'Do what thou wilt, my son,' said he, 'and if my hands cannot, my spirit will help thee.'

"There and then I began a close scrutiny. I went outside, measured, tapped, sought, but I found
nothing more. If there had ever been a stoup, a cross, a rude piscina, they had long since
gone. But the more I searched, the more sure grew my conviction that the place had been a chapel.
At last I sat down to rest, and while resting, I had an idea.

"'Mwezi,' I said, 'have you ever dug up the floor?'

"He shook his head. 'Why should I dig it up?' he asked.

"'Would you allow me to do so?' I queried.

"He looked doubtful. 'But why?' he asked again, suspiciously. 'And would you dig even now?'

"I laughed. 'Well, not at once,' I said. 'We must find a new house for you first. But if I
am right, it may be that things are buried here, or that there are stones which will tell me
a tale. See, the floor is higher now than it was. There was a step here at the door, and the
mud has nearly covered it.'

"'It is but the smearing,' he said, half contemptuously.

"That roused me. Of course I know the native habit of cleaning a house by putting down a fresh
layer of mud mixed with a little dung, which in time raises the floor considerably. But I was
not to be put off by that. Below the smearing of the old man's time might be a layer of earth
thrown in to hide something. I glanced round. 'May I borrow a spear?' I asked.

"He nodded, and I selected one from the corner with a long thin blade. Then I went into the
inner room, and he came and stood again to watch me with his peering old eyes. Under his scrutiny,
I began in the apse and thrust downward as far as I could. The blade sank to its hilt fairly
easily, and that was all.

"Thus I stabbed until I came to the string of the apse, and then, almost at once, I made a
discovery. The point of the blade struck a stone. A foot to the left, it touched again, and
a foot more. In a few minutes I was all but certain that a stone slab was buried there. You
may imagine my excitement.

"Mwezi called his sons and sent one for a native hoe. When he returned, we all gathered about
the place while he slowly dug up the trampled mud. In a few minutes a stone slab was being
exposed to view, and with my spear I got to work scraping off the earth while he dug free the
other end. Suddenly, as I scraped, I made out a cross, and to cut the story short, we laid
bare at length what had undoubtedly been an altar-stone. Every one of the five crosses were
plainly visible, and left no room for question.

"We stopped out of breath, and I explained something of its use. At that Mwezi spoke suddenly,
calling our attention to him. 'Lift it, lift it,' he cried. 'Lift it at once.'

"The old man was a striking spectacle. His withered face was simply alive with emotion. He
was kneeling on hands and knees, and his thin fingers worked at the edge of the slab. Something
in his voice compelled us, and we got at once to work. After all it was an easy task, for it
was soon apparent that the stone was fitted into brick, with which the whole place was paved,
and with spade and spear we levered it up a little. Then two of Mwezi's sons got their fingers
under it, and without any great effort raised it completely. They staggered aside with it and
the rest of us peered within. For a second we looked, and then Mwezi gave a great cry.

"'My father, my father! Lo, I have come to thee, as thou didst bid. These many years have I
waited, for my spirit spoke true, bidding me rest above thee. Now will I pass on whither thou
art passed, and as thou hadst understanding, so it shall befall. Lo, I come to thee, seeking
peace!'

"His voice hesitated, and failed, and he fell forward very gently and slowly till his head
rested on his hands on the edge of the tomb. None of us dared to move for a few seconds, for
Mwezi's voice rang so truly and convincingly. Great awe fell on us all, for he had spoken as
one who certainly saw. Then I stretched out my hand and touched him, but he had gone, as he
said. And on his face was peace.

"That is all there is to tell in a way. For inside the grave, if grave it were, there was nothing
at all that it was given to our eyes to see--not a bone, not a shred of a habit, nor book nor
beads. If ever a body or treasures of any sort had been there, the receptacle had been rifled
long before, and entirely forgotten. So there is literally no more to tell. Of course the affair
made great excitement. The chief and all his people came to see, and came once again the day
after when I lowered Mwezi into the grave and replaced the altar stone. After that the door
and the windows were blocked up at my request, against the day of the coming of the Faith once
more to Mtaka-tifuni. For that, the space about the sanctuary is to be kept clear of undergrowth,
by order of the chief. For that old Mwezi waits beneath the altar, and maybe he whom he saw
waits also."

The dinner bugle had sounded a few moments before Père Etienne had finished, and now we rose
to go. We stood a second, and I gazed over the side at the star-shine on the water, for the
night was fine. When I looked up, Père Etienne was staring out into the darkness, a far-away
look on his face, but he must have felt my eyes on him, for he turned quickly and smiled. Possibly
he read a question I rather wanted to ask, but did not dare. Anyway, he smiled, as I say, and
shook his head. "I have lived too long in Africa to have theories, my friend," he said, "but
to me the memory of Mwezi and his chapel is a very precious thing. We are all of us souls on
pilgrimage, and we rarely understand why or how, or remember that we have a Guide. But I like
to think in the end, the Good God willing, we shall find a hidden sanctuary and that we have
been led to a place prepared."
