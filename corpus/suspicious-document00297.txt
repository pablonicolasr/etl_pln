PREFACE.

When I first entered on the business of Distilling, I was totally unacquainted with it. I was
even so ignorant of the process, as not to know that fermentation was necessary, in producing
spirits from grain. I had no idea that fire being put under a still, which, when hot enough,
would raise a vapour; or that vapour when raised, could be condensed by a worm or tube passing
through water into a liquid state. In short, my impressions were, that chop-rye mixed with
water in a hogshead, and let stand for two or three days; and then put into a still, and fire
being put under her, would produce the spirit by boiling up into the worm, and to pass through
the water in order to cool it, and render it palatable for immediate use--and was certain the
whole art and mystery could be learned in two or three weeks, or months at farthest, as I had
frequently met with persons who professed a knowledge of the business, which they had acquired
in two or three months, and tho' those men were esteemed distillers, and in possession of all
the necessary art, in this very abstruse science; I soon found them to be ignorant blockheads,
without natural genius, and often, without principle.

Thus benighted, and with only the above light and knowledge, I entered into the dark, mysterious
and abstruse science of distilling, a business professed to be perfectly understood by many,
but in fact not sufficiently understood by any. For it presents a field for the learned, and
man of science, for contemplation--that by a judicious and systematic appropriation and exercise
of certain elements, valuable and salutary spirits and beverages may be produced in great perfection,
and at a small expense, and little inconvenience, on almost every farm in our country.

The professed chymist, and profound theorist may smile at my ideas, but should any one of them
ever venture to soil a finger in the practical part of distilling, I venture to say, he would
find more difficulty in producing good yeast, than in the process of creating oxygen or hydrogen
gas. Scientific men generally look down on us, and that is principally owing to the circumstance
of so many knaves, blockheads and conceited characters being engaged in the business.--If then,
the subject could be improved, I fancy our country would yield all the necessary liquors, and
in a state of perfection, to gratify the opulent, and please the epicure.

I had no difficulty in finding out a reputed great distiller, whose directions I followed in
procuring every necessary ingredient and material for distilling, &c. He was industrious and
attentive, and produced tolerable yield, but I soon found the quantity of the runs to vary,
and the yield scarcely two days alike. I enquired into the cause, of him, but his answers were,
he could not tell; I also enquired of other distillers, and could procure no more satisfactory
answer--some attributed it to the water, others to witchcraft, &c. &c.

I found them all ignorant--I was equally so, and wandered in the dark; but having commenced
the business, I determined to have light on the subject; I thought there must be books containing
instructions, but to my surprise, after a diligent search of all the book-stores and catalogues
in Pennsylvania, I found there was no American work extant, treating on this science--and those
of foreign production, so at variance with our habits, customs, and mode of economy, that I
was compelled to abandon all hope of scientific or systematic aid, and move on under the instructions
of those distillers of our neighborhood, who were little better informed than myself, but who
cheerfully informed me of their experiments, and the results, and freely communicated their
opinions and obligingly gave me their receipts. In the course of my progress, I purchased many
receipts, and hesitated not to procure information of all who appeared to possess it, and sometimes
at a heavy expense, and duly noted down all such discoveries and communications--made my experiments
from time to time, and in various seasons, carefully noting down the results. Having made the
business my constant and only study, carefully attending to the important branch of making
yeast, and studying the cause and progress of fermentation, proceeding with numerous experiments,
and always studying to discover the cause of every failure, or change, or difference in the
yield. I could, after four years attention, tell the cause of such change, whether in the water,
yeast, fermentation, quality of the grain, chopping the grain, or in mashing, and carefully
corrected it immediately. By a thus close and indefatigable attention, I brought it to a system,
in my mind, and to a degree of perfection, that I am convinced nothing but a long series of
practice could have effected.

From my record of most improved experiments, I cheerfully gave receipts to those who applied,
and after their adoption obtaining some celebrity, I found applications so numerous, as to
be troublesome, and to be impossible for me to furnish the demands gratis, of consequence,
I was compelled to furnish to some, and refuse others; a conduct so pregnant with partiality,
and a degree of illiberality naturally gave rise to murmurs.

My friends strongly recommended a publication of them, the plan requiring the exercise of talents,
order and method, with which I presumed myself not sufficiently versed, I for sometime obstinately
refused, but at length and after reiterated solicitation, I consented to enter on the talk,
under a flattering hope of affording useful information to those of my country engaged in the
distillation of spirits from the growth of our native soil, which together with the following
reasons, I offer as the only apology.

1st. I observed many distillers making fortunes, whilst others exercising an equal share of
industry, and of equal merit were sinking money, owing to a want of knowledge in the business.

2d. In taverns I often observed foreign liquors drank in preference to those of domestic manufacture,
though really of bad quality, possessing pernicious properties acquired from ingredients used
by those in our commercial towns, who brew and compose brandies, spirits, and wines, often
from materials most injurious to health, and this owing to so much bad liquor being made in
our country, from which the reputation of domestic spirit has sunk. Whilst, in fact, we can
make domestic spirits of various materials, which with a little management and age, will be
superior to any of foreign produce.

3d. By making gin, &c. as good if not better, we might in a few years, meet those foreign merchants
in their own markets, and undersell them; which we certainly could do, by making our liquors
good, and giving them the same age. The transportation would of consequence improve them in
an equal degree, for the only advantage their liquors of the same age have over our good liquors,
is the mildness acquired by the friction in the warm hold of the ship in crossing the ocean.

And moreover as liquors will be drank by people of all standings in society, I flattered myself
I could improve our liquors, render them more wholesome to those whose unhappy habits compel
a too free use of ardent spirits, and whose constitutions may have been doubly injured from
the pernicious qualities of such as they were compelled to use. For there are in all societies
and of both sexes, who will drink and use those beverages to excess, even when there exists
a moral certainty, that they will sustain injury from such indulgence, and as an evidence of
my hypothesis, I offer the free use of coffee, tea, &c. so universally introduced at the tables
of people of every grade.

The wise Disposer of worlds, very happily for mankind, permits the exhibition of genius, mind
and talents, from the peasant and lower order, as well as from the monarch, the lord, and the
opulent. To Europe they of course are not confined--Genius has already figured in our hemisphere--The
arts and sciences are becoming familiar, they rise spontaneously from our native soil, and
bid fair to vie with, if not out-shine accomplished Europe. In possession, then, of all the
necessary materials, ingredients and requisites, I would ask why we cannot afford ardent spirits
and wines equal to those imported; and thus raise our character to a standing with other countries,
and retain those millions of dollars at home, which are yearly shipped abroad for those foreign
liquors, so common, so universally in use, and much of which so adulterated, as to be followed,
when freely used, with unhappy consequences. Would men of capital and science, turn their attention
to distillations, from the produce of our own country, preserve the liquor until age and management
would render it equal, if not superior to any imported; is it not probable that it would become
an article of export, and most sensibly benefit our country at large.

Considerations such as those have combined to determine a publication of my work; fully apprised
of the scoffs of pedants, kicks, bites and bruises of critics--but I hope they will find latitude
for the exercise of a share of compassion, when I inform them candidly, that a mill and distillery,
or still house, were substituted for, and the only college and academy in which I ever studied,
and those studies were broken, and during the exercise of my business, as a miller and distiller.

That it contains errors in the diction and perspicuity, I will readily confess--but that it
is in substance true, and contains much useful information, I must declare as an indisputable
fact. And though the road I travelled was a new one, without compass, chart, or even star to
steer by, not even a book to assist me in thinking, or cheer me in my gloomy passage--seeking
from those springs of nature, and inherent endowments for consolatory aid--pressing on a frequently
exhausted mind, for resources and funds, to accomplish the objects of my pursuits--not denying
but that I met many of my fellow-beings, who cheerfully aided me with all the information in
their power, and to whom I now present my thanks--I must acknowledge, I think my labors and
exertions will prove useful to those of less experience than mine, in which event I shall feel
a more ample remuneration for my exertions, than the price asked for one of those volumes.

Could I have witnessed the publication of a similar work by a man of science and education,
mine should never have appeared. But it would seem the learned and scientific have never considered
a work of the kind as meriting their attention; a circumstance deeply to be regretted, as a
finer colouring to a work of the same properties and value often procures celebrity, demand
and currency. My object is to be useful, my style plain, and only laboured to be rendered easy
to be understood, and convey the necessary instruction to those who may honor this work with
a perusal, or resort to it for information, and that it may be useful to my countrymen, is
the sincere wish of

THE AUTHOR.

INTRODUCTION.

It is not more than twenty years since whiskey was first offered for sale in the seaport towns
in large quantities; and then, owing to its badness, at a very low price. Since that period
it has been gaining ground yearly, and at this time, it is the second great article of commerce,
in the states of Pennsylvania and Maryland.

In the interior of these states, it has nearly excluded the use of foreign distilled spirits,
and I fancy might be made so perfectly pure and nice, as to ultimately supersede the use of
any other throughout the United States.

To assist in effecting this, the greatest attention should be paid to cleanliness, which in
a distillery is absolutely necessary, the want of which admits of no excuse, where water is
had without price.

If a distiller does not by a most industrious well-timed care and attention, preserve every
utensil perfectly sweet and clean, he may expect, notwithstanding he has well attended to the
other branches, but indifferent whiskey and not much of it.

If, for instance, every article, or only one article in the composition of yeast be sour or
dirty, that one article will most assuredly injure the whole; which being put into a hogshead
of mashed grain, soon imparts its acidity or filth to the whole mass, and of course will reduce
the quantity and quality of the spirit yielded from that hogshead. Cleanliness in every matter
and thing, in and about a distillery becomes an indispensable requisite, without a strict observance
of which the undertaker will find the establishment unproductive and injurious to his interest.
Purity cannot exist without cleanliness. Cleanliness in the human system will destroy an obstinate
itch, of consequence, it is the active handmaid of health and comfort, and without which, decency
does not exist.

Care is another important and necessary consideration, and a basis necessary, on which to erect
a distillery, in order to ensure it productive of wealth and reputation. Care and industry
will ensure cleanliness; an eye of care must be extended to every thing, that nothing be lost,
that every thing be in its proper place and order, that every thing be done in due time; the
business must be well timed, and time well economised, as it ranks in this, as in every other
business very high. Let a judicious attention be paid to care, cleanliness, and industry, and
when united with a competent knowledge of the different branches of the distilling business,
the character of a compleat practical distiller is perfect.

With such a distiller, and a complete still-house, furnished with every necessary utensil for
carrying on the business--it cannot fail to prove a very productive establishment, and present
to the world, from the materials of our own farms, a spirit as wholesome, and well flavored
and as healthy as any spirit whatever--the produce or yield of any country, provided it be
permitted to acquire the same age.

What a grand and great idea strikes the thinking scientific mind, on entering a complete and
clean distillery, with an intelligent cleanly distiller, performing his duty in it.

To see the four elements, each combining to produce (with the assistance of man) an article
of commerce and luxury, and at the same time, a necessary beverage to man. The earth producing
the grain, hops and utensils, which a combination of fire and water reduces into a liquid by
fermentation, and when placed in the still to see air engaging fire to assist her in reducing
the liquid that fire and water had produced, into a vapour, or air, and afterwards to see fire
abandoning air, and assisting water to reduce it into a liquid by means of the condensing tubes,
and then to consider the number of hands employed in keeping the distillery a going, will present
one other patriotic idea. The farmer with all his domestics and people, engaged in the cultivation
of the rye, corn, &c. The wood choppers--the haling--the coopers engaged in making casks--the
hands engaged in feeding cattle and the pork--haling, barrelling and selling the whiskey, spirits,
pork, &c. The produce of the distillery, presenting subject for commerce, and employ for the
merchant, mechanic and mariner--and all from our own farms.

After seeing the distillery afford employment for so many hands, bread to their families, and
yielding the means of an extensive revenue and increase of commerce--with a flattering prospect
of completely annihilating the use of foreign liquors in our country, and thereby saving the
expenditure of millions of dollars; and ultimately rendering our liquors an article of export
and source of wealth--I presume every mind will be struck with the propriety of encouraging
a branch of business so promising in wealth and comfort.

The following receipts are intended to convey all the instruction necessary in the science
of distilling, and producing from the growth of our own farms, the best spirits of every description,
and such as I flatter myself will supersede the use of all imported liquors, and thereby fulfil
the views and wishes of

THE AUTHOR.

PRACTICAL DISTILLER.

SECTION I.

Observations on Yeast.

That yeast is the main spring in distilling, is acknowledged by all distillers, tho' but few
if them understand it, either in its nature or operation; tho' many pretend a knowledge of
the grand subject of fermentation, and affect to understand the best mode of making stock yeast,
and to know a secret mode unknown to all others--when it is my belief they know very little
about it; but, by holding out the idea of adding some drug, not to be procured at every house,
which has a hard name, and that is little known to people of common capacities: Such as Dragons
blood, &c. frequently retailing their secret, as the best possible mode of making stock yeast,
at ten, twenty, and in some instances one hundred dollars.

Confessing it a subject, abstruse, and a science little understood in Pennsylvania, and notwithstanding
the numerous experiments I have made with care and close observation, yet from a consciousness
of not understanding it, too well, I have in several instances purchased receipts, and made
faithful experiments; but have never yet met the man of science, theory, or practice, whose
mode of making stock yeast, yielded a better preparation for promoting fermentation, than the
simple mode pursued by myself for some years, and which I have uniformly found to be the best
and most productive.

In making yeast, all drugs and witchcraft are unnecessary--Cleanliness, in preserving the vessels
perfectly sweet, good malt, and hops, and an industrious distiller, capable of observation,
and attention to the following receipt, which will be assuredly found to contain the essence
and spirit of the ways and art of making that composition, a knowledge of which I have acquired,
by purchases--consultations with the most eminent brewers, bakers, and distillers in this commonwealth,
and above all, from a long practice and experience, proving its utility and superior merits
to my most perfect satisfaction; and which I with pleasure offer to my fellow-citizens, as
meriting a preference--notwithstanding the proud and scientific chymist, and the flowery declarations
or treatises of the profound theorist, may disapprove this simple mode, and offer those which
they presume to be better, tho' they never soiled a finger in making a practical experiment,
or perhaps witnessed a process of any description.

ARTICLE II.

Receipt for Stock Yeast.

For a stock yeast vessel of two gallons, the size best adapted for that purpose.

Take one gallon good barley malt, (be sure it be of good quality) put it into a clean, well
scalded vessel, (which take care shall be perfectly sweet) pour thereon four gallons scalding
water, (be careful your water be clean) stir the malt and water with a well scalded stick,
until thoroughly mixed together, then cover the vessel close with a clean cloth, for half an
hour; then uncover it and set it in some convenient place to settle, after three or four hours,
or when you are sure the sediment of the malt is settled to the bottom, then pour off the top,
or thin part that remains on the top, into a clean well scoured iron pot, (be careful not to
disturb the thick sediment in the bottom, and that none of it goes into the pot); then add
four ounces good hops, and cover the pot close with a clean scalded iron cover, and set it
on a hot fire of coals to boil--boil it down one third, or rather more, then strain all that
is in the pot through a thin hair sieve, (that is perfectly clean) into a clean well scalded
earthen crock that is glazed--then stir into it, with a clean stirring stick, as much superfine
flour as will make it about half thick, that is neither thick nor thin, but between the two,
stirring it effectually until there be no lumps left in it. If lumps are left, you will readily
perceive that the heart or inside of those lumps will not be scalded, and of course, when the
yeast begins to work, those lumps will sour very soon, and of course sour the yeast--stir it
then till those lumps are all broken, and mixed up, then cover it close for half an hour, to
let the flour stirred therein, be properly scalded, after which uncover and stir it frequently
until it is a little colder than milk warm, (to be ascertained by holding your finger therein
for ten minutes, but beware your finger is clean) then add half a pint of genuine good yeast,[1]
(be certain it is good, for you had better use none, than bad yeast) and stir it effectually,
until you are sure the yeast is perfectly incorporated with the ingredients in the pot--after
which cover it, and set it in a moderately cool place in summer, until you perceive it begin
to work, or ferment--then be careful to stir it two or three times at intervals of half an
hour--then set it past to work--in the winter, place it in a moderately warm part of the still-house--and
in summer, choose a spring house, almost up to the brim of the crock in water--avoiding extremes
of heat or cold, which are equally prejudicial to the spirit of fermentation--of consequence,
it should be placed in a moderately warm situation in the winter, and moderately cool in the
summer.

[Footnote 1: If none can be obtained that is good, the following is a receipt to make it, viz.

Procure three wooden vessels of different sizes and apertures, one capable of holding two quarts,
the other three or four, and the third five or six; boil a quarter of a peck of malt for about
eight or ten minutes in three pints of water; and when a quart is poured off from the grains,
let it stand in a cool place till not quite cold, but retaining that degree of heat which the
brewers usually find to be proper when they begin to work their liquor. Then remove the vessel
into some warm situation near a fire, where the thermometer stands between 70 and 80 degrees
(Fahrenheit,) and here let it remain till the fermentation begins, which will be plainly perceived
within thirty hours; add then two quarts more of a like decoction of malt, when cool, as the
first was; and mix the whole in the larger sized vessel, and stir it well in, which must be
repeated in the usual way, as it rises in a common vat: then add a still greater quantity of
the same decoction, to be worked in the largest vessel, which will produce yeast enough for
a brewing of forty gallons.]

This yeast ought to be renewed every four or five days in the summer, and eight or ten days
in the winter--but it is safer to renew it oftener, or at shorter intervals, than suffering
it to stand longer. In twenty-four hours after it begins to work, it is fit for use.

Between a pint and half a pint of the foregoing stock yeast, is sufficient to raise the yeast
for the daily use of three hogsheads.

ART. III.

The most proper vessel for preserving stock yeast is an earthen crock, that will hold three
gallons at least, with a cover of the same, well glazed--as it will contract no acid from the
fermentation, and is easily scalded and sweetened. There ought to be two of the same size,
that when one is in use, the other may be sweetening--which is effected by exposing them to
frost or fire.

ART. IV.

To know when Yeast is good or bad.

When you perceive your yeast working, observe if it works quick, sharp and strong, and increasing
in bulk nearly double what it was before it began to work, with a sweet sharp taste, and smell,
with the appearance of a honey comb, with pores, and always changing place, with a bright lively
colour, then you may pronounce your yeast good; on the contrary, if it is dead, or flat and
blue looking, with a sour taste, and smell, (if any at all,) then you may pronounce it bad,
and unfit for use, and of course must be renewed.

ART. V.

How to renew Yeast when sour.

About two hours before you begin to make your beer, take one pint of the sour yeast, put it
into a clean dish or vessel, and pour clean cold water over it--changing the water every fifteen
minutes, until the acid be extracted, have it then in readiness to mix with the beer, which
is to be prepared, in the following manner, viz. Take one pint malt, and scald it well in a
clean vessel, with a gallon of boiling water, let it stand half an hour closely covered--then
pour it into a pot with plenty of hops--then strain it into a well scalded earthen jug, when
milk warm--add then a small quantity of the yeast, (sweetened as directed in the first part
of this receipt,) with two or three table spoon fulls of molasses ... set it past for twenty
four hours to ferment ... then pour off the top, or beer that is in the jug, leaving about
a quart in the bottom ... then that which remains in the bottom will be yeast with which to
start your stock yeast.

ART. VI.

The method of procuring and keeping stock yeast, by the generality of distillers, merits in
the mind of the author of this work, most decided disapprobation. They generally procure yeast
once a week, or month, from brewers, and if not convenient to be had in this way, they often
use such as is used by country women, for baking bread, without paying any regard to the quality,
or whether sour; with such, tho' generally bad, they proceed to make their daily yeast, and
often continue the use of it, until the grain will no longer yield a gallon of whiskey to the
bushel, and so often proceed in this miserable and indolent mode of procuring and renewing
yeast, to the great prejudice of their own, and employer's interest ... attributing the small
yield of liquor to the badness of the grain ... the manner in which it is chopped, or some
other equally false cause. Then to the idle and careless habits of distillers, must be attributed
any yield short of three gallons to the bushel of rye.... To ensure this quantity at least
from the bushel, the author discovers the anxiety expressed, and the care recommended in the
foregoing pages, on the subject of preserving and keeping good yeast, and recommends the following
as the best mode of preparing.

ART. VII.

Stock Yeast good for years.

When the weather is moderately warm in autumn or the spring, take of your best stock yeast
that has fermented about twenty four hours, and stir it thick with the coarsest middlings of
wheat flour, add small quantity of whiskey, in which, previously dissolve a little salt, when
you have stirred the middlings with a stick, rub it between your hands until it becomes pretty
dry, then spread it out thin, on a board to dry in the sun ... rubbing once or twice in the
day between your hands until it is perfectly dry, which will be in three or four good days--taking
it in at night before the dew falls--when it is properly dried, put it up in a paper and keep
it in a dry airy place for use.

Thus yeast will keep good, if free from moisture, for any length of time, and it is the only
effectual mode of preserving stock yeast pure and sweet ... when put up conformably to the
foregoing instructions, the distiller may always rely on having it good, and depend on a good
turn out of his grain, provided he manages the other parts of his distilling equally well.

About two hours before you mean to use the dried yeast, the mode is to take two gills, place
it in any convenient vessel, and pour thereon milk-warm water, stir and mix it well with the
yeast, and in two or three hours good working yeast will be produced.

In the spring every distiller ought to make as much as would serve 'till fall, and every fall
as much as will serve thro' the winter, reckoning on the use of one pint per week, three gills
being sufficient to start as much stock yeast as will serve a common distillery one week.

ART. VIII.

To make the best Yeast for daily use.

For three hogsheads take two handfuls of hops, put them into an iron pot, and pour thereon
three gallons boiling water out of your boiler, set the pot on the fire closely covered half
an hour, to extract the strength from the hops, then strain it into your yeast vessel, thicken
it with chopped rye, from which the bran has been sifted ... stir it with a clean stick until
the lumps are all well broken and mixed ... cover it close with a cloth for half an hour, adding
at the time of putting in the chopped rye, one pint of good malt when the rye is sufficiently
scalded, uncover and stir it well until it is milk-warm, then add one pint good stock yeast,
stirring until you are sure it is well mixed with the new yeast. If your stock yeast is good,
this method will serve you ... observing always, that your water and vessels are clean, and
the ingredients of a good quality; as soon as you have cooled off and emptied your yeast vessel,
scald and scour, and expose it to the night air to purify. Tin makes the best yeast vessel
for yeast made daily, in the above mode.

In the course of my long practice in distilling I fully discovered that a nice attention to
yeast is absolutely necessary, and altho' I have in the foregoing pages said a great deal on
the subject, yet from the importance justly to be attached to this ingredient in distilling,
and to shew more fully the advantages and disadvantages arising from the use of good and bad
yeast, I submit the following statement for the consideration of my readers.

Advantages in using good yeast for one month,
  at 5 bushels per day; 30 days at 5 bushels,
  is 150 bushels at 60 cents, costs          $ 90 00

Contra
150 bushels yield 3 gallons per bushel, at
  50 cents per gallon--450 gallons,
                                               225 00
                                             --------
                                     Profit  $ 135 00

Disadvantages sustained during the above period.
  150 bushels at 60 cents,                   $  90 00

Contra
150 bushes yielding 1-1/2 gallons to the
  bushel--225 gallons at 50 cents,             112 50
                                              -------
                                     Profit  $  21 50

Thus the owner or distiller frequently sustains in the distillation of his produce, a loss,
equal and in proportion to the foregoing--from the use of indifferent yeast, and often without
knowing to what cause to attribute it. This statement will shew more forcibly, than any other
mode--and is made very moderate on the side of indifferent yeast, for with bad sour yeast the
yield will be oftener under one gallon to the bushel than above one and an half--whereas with
good yeast the yield will rarely be so low as three gallons to the bushel. It is therefore,
I endeavor so strongly to persuade the distiller to pay every possible attention to the foregoing
instructions, and the constant use of good yeast only, to the total rejection of all which
may be of doubtful quality.

ARTICLE I.

Observations on Wood for Hogsheads.

The cheapest and easiest wrought wood is generally most used for making mashing tubs, or hogsheads,
and very often for dispatch or from necessity, any wood that is most convenient is taken, as
pine or chesnut; indeed I have seen poplar tubs in use for mashing, which is very wrong, as
a distiller by not having his hogsheads of good wood, may lose perhaps the price of two sets
of hogsheads in one season. For instance, a farmer is about to erect a distillery, and is convenient
to a mountain, abounding in chesnut or pine, which from its softness and the ease with which
it may be worked, its convenience for dispatch sake, is readily chosen for his mashing hogsheads.--To
such selection of wood, I offer my most decided disapprobation, from my long experience, I
know that any kind of soft wood will not do in warm weather. Soft porus wood made up into mashing
tubs when full of beer and under fermentation, will contract, receive or soak in so much acid,
as to penetrate nearly thro' the stave, and sour the vessel to such a degree, in warm weather,
that no scalding will take it out--nor can it be completely sweetened until filled with cold
water for two or three days, and then scalded; I therefore strongly recommend the use of, as
most proper

White Oak.

Disapproving of black, tho' next in order to white oak staves for all the vessels about the
distillery ... as being the most durable of close texture, easily sweetened ... and hard to
be penetrated by acids of any kind, tho' sometimes the best white oak hogsheads may sour, but
two or three scaldings will render them perfectly sweet ... if white oak cannot be had, black
oak being of the next best in quality may be used ... and again I enter my protest against
pine, chesnut, poplar, and every kind of soft porus wood.

If possible, or if at all convenient, have the vessels iron bound and painted, to prevent worms
and the weather from injuring them, using one good wood hoop on the bottom to save the chine.

ART. II.

To sweeten Hogsheads by scalding.

When you turn your vessels out of doors (for it is esteemed slothful and a lazy mode to scald
them in the still house,) you must wash them clean with your scrubbing brush, then put in sixteen
or twenty gallons boiling water--cover it close for about twenty minutes, then scrub it out
effectually with your scrubbing broom, then rinse your vessel well with a couple buckets clean
cold water, and set them out to receive the air--this method will do in the winter, provided
they are left out in the frost over night--but in summer, and especially during the months
of July and August, this mode will not do--it is during those extreme warm months in our latitude,
that the vessels are liable to contract putrid particles, which may be corrected by the following
mode of making

Hogsheads perfectly sweet.

Scald them twice, as above directed, then light a brimstone match, flick it on the ground,
turn your hogshead down over it, let it stand until the match quits burning, this operation
is necessary once a week--a method I have found effectual.

ART. III.

To sweeten Hogsheads by burning.

When you have scalded your hogsheads well, put into each, a large handful of oat or rye straw,
set it on fire, and stir it till it is in a blaze, then turn the mouth of the hogshead down;
the smoke will purify and sweeten the cask. This process should be repeated every other day,
especially during summer--it will afford you good working casks, provided your yeast be good,
and your hogsheads are well mashed.

There ought always to be in a distillery more vessels than are necessary for immediate use,
that they may alternately be exposed to the frost and air one night at least before brought
into service, always bearing in mind that the utmost attention to cleanliness is necessary,
in order to afford such yield from the grain, or fruit, as may be requisite to compensate for
the expense and labor of extracting spirits--and moreover, that the exercise of the finest
genius possessed by man is scarcely capable of taking from small grain, all the spirit it contains:....
good materials will not suffice ... the most marked attention is indispensably necessary to
yeast; a mind capable of judging of fermentation in all its stages ... a close adherence to
the manner of using the ingredients ... preparing them, and the use of sweet vessels, with
great industry and a knowledge to apply it at the proper moment, are all necessary to enable
the accomplishment of the desired end.

Note ... In scalding your hogshead I would recommend the use of a shovel full of ashes, which
will scald more sharply.

SECTION III.

ARTICLE I.

To Mash Rye in the common mode.

Take four gallons cold water to each hogshead, add one gallon malt, stir it well with your
mashing stick, until the malt is thoroughly wet--when your still boils, put in about sixteen
gallons boiling water, then put in one and an half bushels of chopped rye, stirring it effectually,
until there is no lumps in it, then cover it close until the still boils, then put in each
hogshead, three buckets or twelve gallons boiling water, stirring it well at the same time--cover
it close--stir it at intervals until you perceive your rye is scalded enough, which you will
know by putting in your mashing stick, and lifting thereon some of the scalded rye, you will
perceive the heart or seed of the rye, like a grain of timothy seed sticking to the stick,
and no appearance of mush, when I presume it will be sufficiently scalded--it must then be
stirred until the water is cold enough to cool off, or you may add one bucket or four gallons
of cold water to each hogshead, to stop the scalding.

I have known this process succeed well with an attentive distiller.

ART. II.

The best method of distilling Rye.

Take four gallons boiling, and two gallons cold water--put it into a hogshead, then stir in
one and a half bushels chopped rye, let it stand five minutes, then add two gallons cold water,
and one gallon malt, stir it effectually--let it stand till your still boils, then add sixteen
gallons boiling water, stirring it well, or until you break all the lumps--then put into each
hogshead, so prepared, one pint coarse salt, and one shovel full of hot coals out of your furnace.
(The coals and salt have a tendency to absorb all sourness and bad smell, that may be in the
hogshead or grain;) if there be a small quantity of hot ashes in the coals, it is an improvement--stir
your hogsheads effectually every fifteen minutes, keeping them close covered until you perceive
the grain scalded enough--when you may uncover, if the above sixteen gallons boiling water
did not scald it sufficiently, water must be added until scalded enough--as some water will
scald quicker than others--it is necessary to mark this attentively, and in mashing two or
three times, it may be correctly ascertained what quantity of the kind of water used will scald
effectually--after taking off the covers, they must be stirred effectually, every fifteen minutes,
till you cool off--for which operation, see "Cooling off." To those who distill all rye, I
recommend this method, as I have found it to answer every kind of water, with one or two exceptions.

Distillers will doubtless make experiments of the various modes recommended and use that which
may prove most advantageous and convenient.

ART. THE FOREST OF VAZON

A GUERNSEY LEGEND OF THE EIGHTH CENTURY.

London: HARRISON & SONS, 59, PALL MALL Booksellers to the Queen and H.R.H the Prince of Wales
1889.

PREFACE.

Nothing authentic is known of the history of Guernsey previously to
its annexation to the Duchy of Normandy in the tenth century.

The only sources of information as to events which may have occurred before that date are references
in monkish chronicles of the usual semi-mythical type, and indications conveyed by cromlechs
and menhirs, fragments of Celtic instruments and pottery, and a few Roman relics. It is unfortunate
that we are thus precluded from acquiring any knowledge of the development of a people as to whom
the soundest among conflicting conjectures seems to be that, coming originally from Brittany, they preserved
the purity of the Celtic race through periods when in other offshoots of the same stock its characteristics
were being obliterated by the processes of crossing and absorption.

If early local records had existed they would hardly have failed to have given minute details
of the convulsion of nature which resulted in the destruction by the sea of the forest lands
on the northern and western sides of the island, and in the separation of tracts of considerable
magnitude from the mainland. Geologists are agreed in assigning to this event the date of March,
709, when great inundations occurred in the Bay of Avranches on the
French coast; they are not equally unanimous as to the cause, but
science now rejects the theory of a raising of the sea-level and that
of a general subsidence of the island.

The most reasonable explanation appears to be that the overpowering
force of a tidal wave suddenly swept away barriers whose resistance
had been for ages surely though imperceptibly diminishing, and that
the districts thus left unprotected proved to be below the sea-level--owing,
as regards the forests, to gradual subsidence easily explicable in
the case of undrained, swampy soil; and, as regards the rocks, to
the fact that the newly exposed surface consisted of accumulations
of already disintegrated deposits.

It is unquestionable that before the inroad of the sea the inlet in the south-west of the island
known as Rocquaine Bay was enclosed by two arms, the northern of which terminated in the point
of Lihou; on which still stand the ruins of an old priory, while the southern ended in the Hanois
rocks, on which a lighthouse has been erected. Lihou is at present an island, accessible only at
low water by a narrow causeway; the Hanois is entirely cut off from the shore, but it is a
noteworthy fact that the signs of old cart-ruts are visible at spring tides, and that an iron
hook was recently discovered attached to a submerged rock which had apparently served as a gatepost;
besides these proofs of the existence of roads now lying under the
waves, it is said that an old order for the repair of Hanois roads
is still extant.

That Vazon and the Braye du Valle were the sites of forests is indisputable, though the former
is now a sandy bay into which the Atlantic flows without hindrance, and the latter, reclaimed
within the present century by an enterprising governor, formed for centuries a channel of the
sea by which the Clos du Valle, on which the Vale Church stands, was separated from the mainland.
A stratum of peat extends over the whole arm of the Braye, while as regards Vazon there is
the remarkable evidence of an occurrence which took place in December, 1847. A strong westerly
gale, blowing into the bay concurrently with a low spring tide, broke up the bed of peat and
wood underlying the sand and gravel, and lifted it up like an ice-floe; it was then carried
landwards by the force of the waves.
 I have found
it to answer best to put in the rye after all the water is in the hogshead, especially if you
always bring the still briskly to a boil--then on your corn put twelve or sixteen gallons boiling
water, (for the last water,) then if you have not already mashed in your rye, put it in with
one gallon good malt to each hogshead, carefully stirring it immediately very briskly, for
fear of the water loosing its heat, and until the lumps are all broken, which you will discover
by looking at your mashing stick; lumps generally stick to it. When done stirring, cover the
hogshead close for half an hour, then stir it to ascertain whether your grain be sufficiently
scalded, and when nearly scalded enough, uncover and stir steady until you have it cool enough
to stop scalding; when you see it is scalded enough, and by stirring that the scalding is stopped,
uncover your hogsheads, and stir them effectually, every fifteen minutes, until they are fit
to cool off--remembering that sweet good yeast, clean sweet hogsheads, with this mode of mashing
carefully, will produce you a good turn out of your grain. The quantity of corn and rye is
generally two stroked half bushels of each, and one gallon malt.

ART. V.

To Mash one third Rye and two thirds Corn.

This I deem the most profitable mashing that a distiller can work, and if he can get completely
in the way of working corn and rye in this proportion, he will find it the easiest process
of mashing. That corn has as much and as good whiskey as rye or any other grain, cannot be
disputed, and the slop or pot ale is much superior to that of any other grain, for feeding
or fattening either horned cattle or hogs--one gallon of corn pot ale being esteemed worth
three of rye, and cattle will always eat it better--and moreover, corn is always from one to
two shillings per bushel cheaper than rye, and in many places much plentier--so that by adopting
this method and performing it well, the distiller will find at the close of the year, it has
advantages over all other processes and mixtures of rye and corn, yielding more profit, and
sustaining the flock better. Hogs fatted on this pot ale, will be found decidedly better than
any fatted on the slops of any other kind of mashing.

Mash as follows.

Have sweet hogsheads, good yeast and clean water in your boiler; when the water is sharp, warm,
or half boiling, put into every hogshead you mean to mash at the same time, six, eight or as
many gallons of the half boiling water, as will completely wet one bushel corn meal--add then
one bushel chopped corn, stir it with your mashing stick till your corn is all wet; it is better
to put in a less quantity of water first, and so add as you may find necessary, until completely
wet (be careful in all mashings, that your mashing stick be clean), this is called soaking
the corn. Then fill up your boiler, bring her quickly to a boil, when effectually boiling,
put into every hogshead, twelve gallons boiling water, stirring it well after putting in each
bucket, until the lumps are quite broken--cover the hogsheads close, after a complete stirring--fill
up your boiler, bring her quickly to boil for the last mashing--stir the corn in the hogshead
every fifteen minutes, till your last water is boiling--put into each hogshead one pint salt,
and a shovel full of red hot coals, stirring it well--then put in each hogshead sixteen gallons
of boiling water, stir it well--cover it close for twenty-five minutes--then put into each
hogshead one half bushel rye meal, and one gallon good chopped malt, stirring it until the
lumps are all broken, then cover it close, stir it every half hour, until you perceive it sufficiently
scalded--then uncover it and stir it as often as your other business will permit, until ready
to cool off.

In this and every other mashing you must use sweet vessels only and good yeast, or your labor
will be in vain; and in all kinds of mashing you cannot stir too much.

ART. VI.

To Mash Corn.

This is an unprofitable and unproductive mode of mashing, but there may be some times when
the distiller is out of rye, on account of the mill being stopped, bad roads, bad weather,
or some other cause; and to avoid the necessity of feeding raw grain to the hogs or cattle,
(presuming every distillery to be depended on for supplying a stock of some kind, and often
as a great reliance for a large stock of cattle and hogs,) in cold weather I have found it
answer very well, but in warm weather it will not do. Those who may be compelled then from
the above causes, or led to it by fancy, may try the following method. To one hogshead, put
twelve gallons boiling water, and one and an half bushels corn, stir it well, then when your
water boils, add twelve gallons more, (boiling hot,) stir it well, and cover it close, until
the still boils the third time, then put in each hogshead, one quart of salt, and sixteen gallons
boiling water, stir it effectually, cover it close until you perceive it nearly scalded enough,
then put in two, or three gallons cold water, (as you will find to answer best,) and two gallons
malt, or more if it can be spared--stir it well, then cover it for half an hour, then uncover
and stir it well, until cold enough to cool off.

ART. VII.

To make four gallons from the bushel.

This is a method of mashing that I much approve of, and recommend to all whiskey distillers
to try it--it is easy in process, and is very little more trouble than the common method, and
may be done in every way of mashing, as well with corn or rye, as also a mixture of each, for
eight months in the year; and for the other four is worth the trouble of following. I do not
mean to say that the quantity of four gallons can be made at an average, in every distillery,
with every sort of grain, and water, or during every vicissitude of weather, and by every distiller,
but this far I will venture to say, that a still house that is kept in complete order, with
good water, grain well chopped, good malt, hops, and above all good yeast; together with an
apt, careful and industrious distiller, cannot fail to produce at an average for eight months
in the year, three and three quarter gallons from the bushel at a moderate calculation. I have
known it sometimes produce four and an half gallons to the bushel, for two or three days, and
sometimes for as many weeks, when perhaps, the third or fourth day, or week, it would scarcely
yield three gallons; a change we must account for, in a change of weather, the water or the
neglect or ignorance of the distiller. For instance, we know that four gallons of whiskey is
in the bushel of rye or corn--certain, that this quantity has been made from the bushel; then
why not always? Because, is the answer, there is something wrong, sour yeast or hogsheads,
neglect of duty in the distiller, change of grain, or change of weather--then of course it
is the duty of the distiller to guard against all these causes as near as he can. The following
method, if it does not produce in every distillery the quantity above mentioned, will certainly
produce more whiskey from the bushel, than any other mode I have ever known pursued.

Mash your grain in the method that you find will yield you most whiskey--the day before you
intend mashing, have a clean hogshead set in a convenient part of the distillery; when your
singling still is run off, take the head off and fill her up with clean water, let her stand
half an hour, to let the thick part settle to the bottom, which it will do when settled, dip
out with a gallon or pail, and fill the clean hogshead half full, let the hogshead stand until
it cools a little, so that when you fill it up with cool water, it will be about milk-warm,
then yeast it off with the yeast for making 4 gallons to the bushel, then cover it close, and
let it work or ferment until the day following, when you are going to cool off; when the cold
water is running into your hogshead of mashed stuff, take the one third of this hogshead to
every hogshead, (the above being calculated for three hogsheads) to be mashed every day, stirring
the hogsheads well before you yeast them off. This process is simple, and I flatter myself
will be found worthy of the trouble.

ART. VIII.

To know when Grain is scalded enough.

Put your mashing stick into your hogshead and stir it round two or three times gently, then
lift it out and give it a gentle stroke on the edge of your hogshead--if you perceive the batter
or musky part fall off your stick, and there remains the heart of the grain on your mashing
stick, like grains of timothy seed, then be assured that it is sufficiently scalded, if not
too much, this hint will suffice to the new beginner, but experience and observation will enable
the most correct judgment.

ART. IX.

Directions for cooling off.

Much observation is necessary to enable the distiller to cool off with judgment--which necessity
is increased by the versatility of our climate, the seasons of the year, and the kinds of water
used. These circumstances prevent a strict adherence to any particular or specific mode; I
however submit a few observations for the guidance of distillers in this branch.--If in summer
you go to cool off with cold spring water, then of course the mashed stuff in your hogsheads
must be much warmer, than if you intended cooling off with creek or river water, both of which
are generally near milk warm, which is the proper heat for cooling off--In summer a little
cooler, and in winter a little warmer.

It will be found that a hogshead of mashed grain will always get warmer, after it begins to
work or ferment.

When the mashed stuff in your hogsheads is brought to a certain degree of heat, by stirring,
which in summer will feel sharp warm, or so warm, that you can hardly bear your hand in it
for any length of time, will do for common water, but for very cold or very warm water to cool
off with, the stuff in the hogsheads must be left colder or warmer, as the distiller may think
most expedient, or to best suit the cooling off water.

When you think it is time to cool off, have a trough or conveyance to bring the water to your
hogsheads ready--let the hogsheads be well stirred, then let the water run into them slowly,
stirring them all the time the water is running in, until they are milk warm, then stop the
water, and after stirring them perfectly, put in the yeast and stir it until completely incorporated
with the mashed stuff, then cover your hogshead until it begins to ferment or work, then uncover
it.

ART. X.

To ascertain when Rye works well in the Hogshead.

When mashed rye begins to work or ferment in the hogsheads, either in a heavy, thick, or light
bubbly top, both of which are unfavorable; when it rises in a thick heavy top, you may be sure
there is something wrong, either in the grain, yeast, or cooling off. When the top (as called
by distillers) appear, with bubbles about the size of a nutmeg, rising and falling alternately,
with the top not too thick nor too thin, and with the appearance of waves, mixed with the grain
in the hogshead, rising and falling in succession, and when you put your head over the steam,
and it flying into your nose, will have a suffocating effect, or when it will instantly extinguish
a candle when held over it, you may feel assured, it is working well.

From these hints and the experience of the distiller, a judgment may be formed of the state
of fermentation and the quality.

ART. XI.

To prevent Hogsheads from working over.

If the stuff is cooled off too warm, or too much yeast is put in the hogsheads, they will work
over, and of course lose a great deal of spirit, to prevent which, take tallow and rub round
the chine of the hogsheads a little higher than they ought to work; it will generally prevent
them from rising any higher, but if they will work over in spite of this remedy, then drop
a little tallow into the stuff, it will immediately sink the stuff to a proper height.

Observations on the quality of Rye for distilling.

The best rye for distilling is that which is thoroughly ripe, before it is cut, and kept dry
till threshed; if it has grown on high or hilly ground, it is therefore to be preferred, being
then sounder and the grain fuller, than that produced on low level land--but very often the
distiller has no choice, but must take that which is most convenient;--great care however ought
to be observed in selecting sound rye, that has been kept dry, is clean and free from cockle,
and all kind of dirt, advantages will result from fanning it, or running it through a windmill
before it is chopped.

ART. II.

Mode of chopping Rye and the proper size.

The mill stones ought to be burrs, and kept very sharp for chopping rye for distillation; and
the miller ought to be careful not to draw more water on the wheel than just sufficient to
do it well, and avoid feeding the stones plentifully; because in drawing a plentiful supply
of water, the wheel will compel a too rapid movement of the stones, of course render it necessary
they should be more abundantly fed, which causes part to be ground dead, or too fine, whilst
part thereof will be too coarse, and not sufficiently broken, so that a difficulty arises in
scalding--for in this state it will not scald equally, and of consequence, the fermentation
cannot be so good or regular; and moreover as part of it will merely be flattened, a greater
difficulty will arise in breaking the lumps, when you mash and stir your hogsheads. If burr
stones are very sharp, I recommend the rye to be chopped very fine, but to guard against over-seeding,
or pressing too much on them; but if the stones are not sharp, I would recommend the rye should
be chopped about half fine. Distillers in general sustain a loss from having their rye chopped
so coarse as I have observed it done in common.

ART. III.

Chopping or Grinding Indian Corn.

Indian corn cannot be ground too fine for distilling.

ART. IV.

Malt

Cannot be ground too coarse, provided it is done even--there ought to be no fine nor coarse
grains in malt, but ground perfectly alike, and of the same grade. If ground too fine, it will
be apt to be scalded too much in mashing. Malt does not require half the scalding necessary
in rye. Let the distiller try the experiment of coarse and then of fine ground malt and judge
for himself.

ART. V.

How to choose Malt.

Malt is chosen by its sweet smell, mellow taste, full flower, round body and thin skin. There
are two kinds used, the pale and the brown--the pale is the best.

ART. VI.

How to build a Malt kiln in every Distillery.

When setting up your stills, leave a space of about nine inches for a small furnace between
the large ones, extend it to your chimney and carry up a funnel, there-from to the loft, then
stop it--here build the kiln on the loft, about 4 or 5 feet square, the walls to be composed
of single brick, 3 feet high--lay the bottom with brick, cover it with a plaster of mortar,
to prevent the floor from taking fire. Turn the funnel of the chimney into, and extend it to
the centre of the kiln, cover the top, leaving vent holes at the sides for the heat to escape
thro'--Place on the top of the kiln, sheet iron or tin punched full of small holes, too small
to admit the passage of malt; lay the malt on the top of the tin, when ready for drying. Put
coals from under the still furnace into the small furnace leading to the kiln, which will heat
the kiln and dry the malt above, by adding to or diminishing the quantity of coals, the heat
may be increased or decreased, as may be found necessary. Malt for distilling ought to be dried
without smoke.

Hops.

Give a preference to hops of a bright green colour, sweet smell, and have a gummy or clammy
effect when rubbed between the hands or fingers.

How to order and fill the Singling still when distilling Rye.

Scrape, clean, and grease the singling still, fill her up with beer, and keep a good fire under
her, till she be warm enough to head, stirring her constantly with a broom, to prevent the
grain from sticking to the bottom or sides, and burning, which it is very apt to do when the
beer is cold, but when it comes to boil there is little danger, prevented by the motion of
boiling; have the head washed clean--when she is ready for the head, clap it on and paste it;
keep up a brisk fire, until she begins to drop from the worm, then put in the damper in the
chimney, and if the fire be very strong, moderate it a little, by throwing ashes or water on
it, to prevent her throwing the head, which she will be very apt to do if very full, and coming
round under a strong fire, (should the head come, or be thrown off, the spirit remaining will
scarcely be worth running off). When fairly round and running moderately, watch her for half
an hour; after which, unless the fire is very strong all danger is over.

Should she happen to throw the head, it is the duty of the distiller to take and (wash the
head and worm--the latter will be found full of stuff) clean, clap on the head, and paste it--but
the moment the head is thrown off, the fire should be drowned out, and water thrown into the
still to prevent her boiling over.

It is important that after every run, or rather before you commence a run, the distiller should
carefully clean out the still, wipe the bottom dry, and grease her well, to prevent her from
burning and singeing the liquor.

ART. II.

Mode of managing the doubling Still when making Whiskey.

Let the doubling still be carefully cleaned and washed out, then be filled with singlings and
low wines left from the run preceding, add thereto half a pint of salt and one quart of clean
ashes, which will help to clear the whiskey, and a handful of Indian meal to prevent the still
from leaking at the cock, or elsewhere--clean the head and worm, put on the head, paste it
well; put fire under and bring her round slowly, and run the spirit off as slow as possible,
and preserve the water in the cooling tub as cold as in your power.

Let the liquor as it runs from the worm pass thro' a flannel to prevent the overjuice from
the copper, and the oil of the grain from mixing with the spirit. The first being poisonous,
and the latter injurious to the liquor.

The doubling still cannot be run too slow for making good whiskey ... observe when the proof
leaves the worm, that is when there is no proof on the liquor as it comes from the worm, if
there be ten gallons in your doubling keg, if so, run out three more, which will make in all
thirteen gallons first proof whiskey. If the proof leaves the worm at eight gallons, then run
till eleven gallons and so on in proportion, to the larger or smaller quantity in your keg
at the time of the ceasing of the proof.

ART. III.

Observations on the advantages of making strong and good Whiskey with stalement, &c.

The distiller who makes whiskey for a market under the government of inspection laws, too weak,
sustains a loss of a cent for each degree it may be under proof ... and the disadvantages are
increased in proportion to the extent of land carriage. If a distance of seventy miles, the
price of carriage per gallon will be about six cents, paying the same price for weak or strong
... not only the disadvantage of paying for the carriage of feints or water, but the loss in
the casks, which tho' small apparently at first view, yet if nicely attended to, will amount
in the course of the year to a sum of moment to every distiller or proprietor. To convey my
ideas, or render a more compleat exposition of my impressions as to the actual loss on one
waggon load (predicated on a distance of seventy miles land carriage) of first proof whiskey,
and that nine degrees under proof. I give the following statement.

300 gallons good first proof whiskey at 50 cents,            $ 150 haling at six cents,   
18

                                   $ 132 00

300 gallons whiskey nine degrees under proof at 41 cents,                           $ 123 haling
18

                                   $ 105 00

                       difference   $ 27 00

This difference of twenty-seven dollars in favor of the distiller, who sends first proof whiskey,
is not the only advantage, but he saves in barrels or casks, what will contain fifty four gallons,
nearly two barrels; which together with the time saved, or gained in running good whiskey only,
of filling and measuring it out, loading, &c. will leave an advantage of I presume, three dollars
in each load. Or to verify more satisfactorily, and I hope my readers will not think me too
prolix, as economy cannot be too much attended to in this business, I add a statement predicated
on a year's work, and on the foregoing principles:

The distiller of weak whiskey, in twelve months, or one year, distils at the rate of 100 gallons
per week, or say in the year, he prepares for a market at the above distance, 5000 gallons,
which ought to command                                   $ 2,500

But he sustains a loss or deduction of 9 cents,           450

Then the first loss may safely be computed at           $   450

150 empty barrels necessary to contain 5000 gallons, at 33-1/3 gallons to the barrel, estimating
the barrel at 7s and 6d, is                                         $   150

This quantity of whiskey, when reduced to proof, is 4,100 gals. which would have occupied only
123 barrels,      123

                                                             -------
                                                               27

Then the second loss may be estimated at                $    27

He ought to have made this quantity of 4100 gallons in nine months and three weeks, but we
will say 10 months, sustaining a loss of two months in the year.

Showing hereby a total annual loss to the careless distiller, of six hundred and thirty dollars,
and a weekly loss of twelve dollars and three cents in the whiskey of nine degrees below proof--our
ninth part of which is seventy dollars, which is the sum of loss sustained on each degree in
this quantity of whiskey.

The foregoing I flatter myself will not only show the necessity of care, cleanliness, industry
and judgment, in the business of distilling; a business professed to be known, by almost every
body--but in reality quite a science, and so abstruse as to be but too imperfectly understood;
and moreover, the value of time, so inestimable in itself, the economy of which is so rarely
attended to.

ART. IV.

Distilling of Buckwheat.

Buckwheat is an unprofitable grain for the distillers when distilled by itself, but when mixed
with rye, it will yield nearly as much as rye; but I would by no means recommend the use of
it when it can be avoided. Tho' sometimes necessity requires that a distiller should mash it
for a day or two, when any thing is the matter, or that grain cannot be procured. In such event,
the directions for distilling rye, or rye and corn may be followed, but it requires a much
larger quantity of boiling water and if distilled by itself; it is necessary some wheat bran
be mixed with it to raise it to the top of the hogshead: but by no means use buckwheat meal
in making yeast.

ART. V.

Distilling of Potatoes.

This is a branch of distilling that I cannot too highly recommend to the attention of every
American--nor can the cultivation of this valuable vegetable be carried to a too great extent,
the value of which ought to be known to every planter and it some times has awakened my surprise
that they are not more cultivated, as it is notorious that they will sustain, and be a tolerable
food for every thing possessing life on this earth--and as they produce a brandy, if properly
made, of fine flavour. I hope yet to see the day when it will take precedence of French brandy
and West-India spirits, and thereby retain in our own country, the immense sums at present
expended on those foreign liquors; which, tho' benefitted by the sea voyage, yet often reaches
us in a most pernicious state, and is frequently adulterated here.

Could the American farmer be brought to raise a larger quantity of potatoes than necessary
for his consumption at home, the price would be lowered, and the distiller might commence the
distillation of them with greater propriety. That they contain a great deal and a very good
spirit, I am certain, and moreover, after distillation will yield as great a quantity of good
wholesome food for cattle or hogs, as rye or any other grain. If distillers could be brought
to try the experiment of distilling ten or twelve bushels annually, I venture to predict that
it would soon become a source of profit to themselves, encouragement to the farmer, and be
of benefit to our country at large.

One acre of ground, if well farmed, will produce from fifty to one hundred bushels of potatoes,
but say sixty on an average. One hundred farmers each planting one acre, would yield six thousand
bushels, which will yield at least two gallons of spirit to each bushel; thus, twelve thousand
gallons of wholesome spirit may be produced, and with care, as good as necessary to be drank.
Each farmer proceeding in this way, would have one hundred and twenty gallons spirit, as much
as he may have occasion to use in the year, which would save the price of some acres of wheat
or one hundred and twenty gallons rye whiskey. Each acre worked in potatoes will be in better
order to receive a crop of wheat, barley, rye, or any kind of grain, than from any other culture.
The farmer often receiving the advantage of a double crop, at the expense of seed and labor.
They grow equally well in every soil and climate, in poor as well as rich ground--provided
the thin soil be manured, and the potatoes plastered with plaster of Paris; and moreover, they
are easier prepared for distilling than either apples, rye or corn, as I shall show hereafter
when I come to treat of the mode of preparation; and in order to demonstrate the advantages
that would arise to the farmer and distiller; I add a statement of the probable profits of
ten acres of potatoes, and that of a like number of acres of rye, to shew which offers the
greatest advantages.

                    Potatoes          DR.

Ten acres at 60 bushels is 600 bushels at 33 cents            $ 198 00

                       Rye.

Ten acres of Rye, at 30 bushels per acre, is 300 bushels at 60 cents                $ 180 00

               CR.
600 bushels yielding 2 gallons

                                       -----
                                       $ 402

               CR.
300 bushels yielding 3 gallons

                                       -----
                                       $ 270

Balance in favor of Potatoes         $ 132

Thus a balance of one hundred and thirty two dollars would appear in favor of the yield of
potatoes.

I would not pretend to say that ten acres of Potatoes will not take more labor than ten acres
of rye, but this far I will venture to say, that the profits arising from the sale of this
brandy, will more than double pay the additional expense of raising them, besides the ground
will be in much better condition to receive a crop of wheat, than the rye ground, nay, will
be enriched from the crop, whilst the rye ground will be greatly impoverished.

ART. VI.

Receipt to prepare Potatoes for Distilling.

Wash them clean, and grind them in an apple mill, and if there be no apple mill convenient,
they may be scalded and then pounded--then put two or three bushels into a hogshead and fill
the hogshead nearly full of boiling water, and stir it well for half an hour, then cover it
close until the potatoes are scalded quite soft, then stir them often until they are quite
cold--then put into each hogshead about two quarts of good yeast and let them ferment, which
will require eight or ten days--the beer then may be drawn off and distilled, or put the pulp
and all into the still, and distill them as you do apples. I have known potatoes distilled
in this way to yield upwards of three gallons to the bushel.

ART. VII.

Pumpions

May be prepared by the same process used in preparing potatoes, with the exception of not scalding
them so high, nor do they require so much yeast.

ART. VIII.

Turnips

Will produce nearly as much spirit as potatoes, but not so good. They must be prepared in the
same manner.

ART. IX.

How to distil Apples.

Apples ought to be perfectly ripe for distillation, as it has been ascertained from repeated
trials, that they produce more and better spirit, (as well as cider), when fully ripe than
if taken green, or the ripe and unripe mixed--if taken mixed it will not be found practicable
to grind them evenly, or equally fine; those fully ripe will be well ground, whilst those hard
and unripe will be little more than broken or slightly bruised--and when this coarse and fine
mixture is put into a hogshead to work or ferment, that fully ripe and fine ground, will immediately
begin, and will be nearly if not quite done working before the other begins, and of course
nearly all the spirit contained in the unripe fruit will be lost--and if it is left standing
until the ill ground unripe fruit is thoroughly fermented, and done working, you will perceive
that a large portion of the spirit contained in the ripe well ground fruit is evaporated and
of course lost.

But if the fruit be all ripe and evenly ground, of course then it will work regularly and can
be distilled in due and right order, and will produce the greatest quantity of spirit, and
much superior to that produced from uneven, ill-ground or unripe fruit.

Apples cannot be ground too fine.

ART. X.

How to order Apples in the Hogsheads.

When the apples are ground put them into open hogsheads to ferment, taking care not to fill
them too full, or they will work over; set them under cover, as the sun will sour them too
soon, if permitted to operate on them, and by his heat extract a considerable quantity of the
spirit, if the weather be warm they will work fast enough, provided you have a sufficient supply
of hogsheads to keep your stills agoing in due time and order; about twenty hogsheads are sufficient
to keep one singling still of one hundred and ten gallons agoing, if you distil the pumice
with the juice, but if you press off the apples after they are done working, you must have
three times that number.

In warm weather five or six days is long enough for apples to work, as it is always better
to distil them before they are quite done working, then to let them stand one hour after the
fermentation ceases.

ART. XI.

How to work Apples slow or fast.

If the hogsheads ripens too fast for your stills, add every day to each hogshead four gallons
cold spring water, putting it into a hole made in the centre of the apples, with a large round
stick of wood; by thus putting it into the centre of the hogshead, it will chill the fermentation,
and thereby prevent the fruit from becoming ripe sooner than it may suit the convenience of
the distiller. But I think it advisable that distillers should take in no more apples than
they can properly manage in due time.

If the weather be cold, and the apples do not ripen so fast as you wish, then add every twelve
hours, four gallons boiling, or warm water, which will ripen them if the weather be not too
cold in four days at farthest.

ART. XII.

How to judge when Apples are ready for distilling.

Put your hand down into the hogsheads amongst the apples as far as you can, and bring out a
handful of pugs--squeeze them in your hand, through your fingers, observe if there be any core,
or lumps of apples un-digested, if none, you may consider them as sufficiently fermented and
quite ready for distilling. It may also be ascertained by tasting and smelling the cider or
juice, which rises in the hole placed in the centre; if it tastes sweet and smells strong,
it is not yet ready, but when quite fermented, the taste will be sour, and smell strong, which
is the proper taste for distilling. A nice discriminating attention is necessary to ascertain
precisely, when the fermentation ceases, which is the proper moment for distillation, and I
would recommend, rather to anticipate, than delay one hour after this period.

ART. XIII.

How to fill and order the singling Still, when running Apple singlings.

When you perceive your apples ready for distilling, fill the singling still with apples and
water; using about half a hogshead apples in a still of 110 gallons, the residue water, first
having cleaned the still well, and greased her previous to filling--put fire under her and
bring her ready to head, as quick as possible, stirring the contents well with a broom until
ready to head, of which you can judge by the warmth of the apples and water, which must be
rather warm to bear your hand in it any length of time. Wash the still head and worm clean,
put on the head, paste it, keeping a good fire until she runs at the worm; run off 14 gallons
briskly, and catch the feints in a bucket to throw into the next still full, if the singling
still too fast, provided she does not smoke at the worm. When the first still full is off,
and before you go to fill her the second time, draw or spread the coals that may be under her,
in the furnace, and fill the furnace with wood. Shut up your furnace door and put in your damper;
by proceeding thus, you cool the still and avoid burning her; this plan I deem preferable to
watering out the fire. When empty, rinse the still round with cold water, scrape and grease
her, then she will be ready to receive a second charge.

Care is necessary in scraping and greasing your still every time she is emptied, if this is
neglected, the brandy may be burnt and the still injured.

ART. XIV.

How to double Apple Brandy.

Fill the doubling still with singlings, and add a quart of lime, (which will clear it) put
fire under her and bring her to a run briskly--after she runs, lessen the fire and run her
as slow as possible. Slow running will prevent any of the spirit from escaping, and make more
and better brandy, than fast running.--Let the liquor filter thro a flannel cloth from the worm.

ART. XV.

How to prepare Peaches.

Peaches like apples ought to be equally ripe, in order to insure an equal and regular fermentation--for
where ripe and unripe fruit are thrown into the same hogshead, and ordered for distillation
in this way a disadvantage is sustained. I therefore recommend to farmers and distillers, when
picking the peaches to assort them when putting them in hogsheads, all soft ripe peaches may
go together, as also those which are hard and less ripe--this will enable a more regular fermentation,
and though the hard and less ripe, will take a longer time, than the soft and ripe to ferment,
and yield less, yet the disadvantage will not be so great, as if mixed.

They ought to be ground in a mill with metal nuts, that the stone and kernel may be well broken.
The kernel when thus broken will give a finer flavor to the brandy, and increase the quantity.

When they are ground they must be placed in hogsheads and worked in the same way with apples,
but distilled sooner or they will lose much more spirit by standing any time after fermentation
than apples. It is therefore better to distil them a short time before they are done working
than at any period after.

ART. XVI.

How to double and single Peach Brandy.

The same process must be observed in running off peaches as in apples, except that the singling
still ought not to be run so fast, nor so much fire kept under her, and more water used to
prevent burning.

The best method of setting Stills.

If stills are not set right, great injury may accrue to them, in burning and damaging the sides,
singeing the whiskey, and wasting of fuel too, are not the only disadvantages; but more damage
may be done in six months, than would pay a man of judgment for putting up twenty pair.

If they are set with their bottoms to the fire, they are very apt to burn, without the utmost
care of the distiller, in stirring her when newly filled with cold beer, until she is warm,
and by previously greasing the bottom well when empty. If wood be plenty, stills ought to be
set on an arch, but if scarce, the bottom ought to be set to the fire. The following method
is calculated for a furnace of either two or four feet long, and with the bottoms exposed,
or on an arch as the distiller may fancy.

Make up a quantity of well worked mortar, composed of the greater proportion of good clay,
a little lime and cut straw.

Lay the bottom of the furnace with flag stones, or good brick, from two to four feet long,
as may be deemed most proper, let it be from twelve to sixteen inches wide, and from twelve
to fourteen high. Then if it is designed to turn an arch, set the end of a brick on each wall
of the furnace, leaning them over the furnace, till they meet in the middle--so continue the
range on each side, until the furnace is completely covered in, leaving a small hole for the
flue leading to the chimney behind, leaning towards the side, from which the flue is to be
started, to proceed round the bilge of the still, which passage must be ten by four inches wide.

After completing the arch as described, lay thereon a complete bed of mortar, well mixed with
cut straw, set the still thereon, levelling her so that she will nearly empty her self by the
stoop towards the cock; then fill up all round her with mortar to the lower rivets, carefully
preventing any stone or brick from touching her, (as they would tend to burn her) ... then
build the fender or fenders; being a wall composed of brickbats and clay well mixed with cut
straw, build it from the commencement of the flue, and continue it about half round the still
... this is to prevent the flames from striking the still sides, in its hot state, immediately
after it leaves the furnace, presuming that it will terminate before it reaches the end of
this little wall or fender, between which, and the still, a space of two inches ought to be
left for the action of the heat, which space preserves, and prevents the wall or fender, from
burning the still; the mode in common practice, being to place it against the still, which
will certainly singe or burn her. When this defender is finished, commence a wall, which continue
round, laying a brick for a foundation, about four inches from the lower rivets; thus raising
this wall for the flue, continuing it at an equal distance from the still, leaving a concave
to correspond with the bilge of the still, and to be of precisely the same width and height
all round the still. This precaution is absolutely necessary in building the wall of the flue
exactly to correspond with the form of the still, and equally distant all round, for reasons
1st. The fire acts with equal force on every part of the still, and a greater heat may be applied
to her, without burning. 2d. It has a great tendency to prevent the still house from smoking.

When the wall of the flue is completed round the still, and raised so high, that a brick when
laid on the top of the wall will extend to the rivets in the breast of the still or upper rivets,
then completely plaster very smooth and even, the inside of the flue, and then cover the flue
with a layer of brick, with a slight fall, or leaning a little from the still outwards, so
that if water were dropped thereon, it would run off outwardly, carefully laying a layer of
clay on the top of the wall, on which the brick may rest, and thereby prevent the brick from
burning the still; carefully forming the brick with the trowel, so as to fit the wall and rest
more safely--cautiously covering them well with clay, &c. and closing every crevice or aperture,
to prevent smoak from coming thro' or the heat from deserting the flue till it passes to the
chimney from the flue; then fill the still with water, and put a flow fire under her to dry
the work. When the wall begins to dry, lay on a coat of mortar, (such as the next receipt directs),
about two inches thick, when this begins to dry, lay a white coat of lime and sand-mortar,
smoothing well with a trowel; rubbing it constantly and pressing it severely with the trowel
to prevent it from cracking.

There are many modes of setting stills and bringing the fire up by flues variously constructed,
but I have found the foregoing plan to afford as great a saving of fuel, and bringing the still
to a boil as early as any other.

ART. II.

How to prevent the Plastering round Stills from cracking.

This method of making water proof plastering on stills, is done entirely in making the mortar,
and putting it on, in making which, good clay and lime are absolutely necessary.

When the mortar for the first coat is thoroughly worked, put as much brock of rye straw into
it, as can be worked in, so that when the coat is put on, it may have a greater appearance
of straw than mortar, when dry, and covered with the second coat composed of lime mortar, well
rubbed and pressed with the trowel until it be dry. A covering put on of those materials, will
be found to continue firm and compact without cracking, as in the common mode.

The best method of boiling two, three or more Stills or Kettles with one fire or furnace.

This method has been found to answer in some instances, and may perhaps do generally if properly
managed. I will here give the result of my own experiments.

I set a singling still holding 180 gallons on a furnace of 18 by 14 inches, and 4 feet six
inches long, with the bottom to the fire, she had a common head and worm with scrapers and
chains in her. I extended the flue, (or after passing it round her), to the doubling still
which it likewise went round--but to prevent too much heat from passing to the doubling still,
I fixed a shutter in the flue of the singling still, immediately above the intersection of
the flue of the doubling still, to turn all the heat round her, and another shutter in the
flue of the doubling still at the intersection of the flue of the singling still, to shut the
heat off from the doubling still if necessary.

With this fixture I run six hogsheads off in every twenty four hours and doubled the same,
with the same heat and fire. I likewise had a boiler under which I kept another fire, which
two fires consumed about three cords and an half of wood per week, distilling at the rate of
sixty-five bushels of grain per week, and making about one hundred and ninety gallons in the
same time.

Before I adopted this method I kept four fires agoing, and made about the same quantity of
whiskey, consuming about four and an half cords of wood per week, and was obliged to have the
assistance of an additional distiller per week.

I have since heard of the adoption of this plan with more success than I experienced.

ART. III.

To set a doubling Still.

As spirits can hardly be burned or singed in a doubling still, if not before done in singling,
all the precaution necessary is to set them in the best method for saving fuel, and preserving
the still. The instructions given for setting a singling still, is presumed to be adequate
to setting a doubling still.

How to prevent the singling Still from burning.

If the singling still be well set, and is carefully greased with a piece of bacon, tallow or
hard soap, every time she is filled, she will seldom burn, but if she does burn or singe notwithstanding
these precautions, it will be advisable to take her down and set her up a new ten times, rather
than have her burned.

How to clarify Whiskey, &c.

Take any vessel of convenient size, take one end out and make it clean, by scalding or otherwise;
bore the bottom full of holes, a quarter of an inch in diameter--lay thereon three folds of
flannel, over which spread ground maple charcoal and burnt brick-dust, made to the consistence
of mortar, with whiskey, about two inches thick, pour your whiskey or brandy thereon, and let
it filter thro' the charcoal, flannel, &c. after which you will find the spirit to have scarcely
any taste or smell of whiskey.--Elevate the filtering cask so as to leave room to place a vessel
to receive the spirit under it.

How to make a Brandy resembling French Brandy, from Rye Whiskey or Apple Brandy.

Clarify the whiskey as the above receipt directs, after thus purifying, add one third or one
fourth of French brandy, and it will be then found strongly to resemble the French brandy in
taste and smell--and if kept a few years, will be found more salutary and healthful than French
brandy alone. This mode of clarifying rids the spirit of any unpleasant flavour received in
the process of distillation or from bad materials, and moreover, from all those vicious, poisonous
properties contracted in the still or worm from copper; such as foetid oil from the malt, which
frequently unites with the verdigris, and combines so effectually with whiskey, that it may
possible require a frequent repetition of this mode of clarifying, to rid it completely of
any unpleasant taste or property contracted as above stated.

ART. IV.

How to make a resemblance of Holland Gin out of Rye Whiskey.

Put clarified whiskey, with an equal quantity of water, into your doubling still, together
with a sufficient quantity of juniper berries, prepared; take a pound of unflacked lime, immerse
it in three pints of water, stir it well--then let it stand three hours, until the lime sinks
to the bottom, then pour off the clear lime water, with which boil half an ounce of isinglass
cut small, until the latter is dissolved--then pour it into your doubling still with a handful
of hops, and a handful of common salt, put on the head and set her a running; when she begins
to run, take the first half gallon (which is not so good), and reserve it for the next still
you fill--as the first shot generally contains something that will give an unpleasant taste
and colour to the gin. When it looses proof at the worm, take the keg away that contains the
gin, and bring it down to a proper strength with rain water, which must previously have been
prepared, by having been evaporated and condensed in the doubling still and cooling tub.

This gin when fined, and two years old, will be equal, if not superior to Holland gin.

The isinglass, lime water and salt, helps to refine it in the still, and the juniper berries
gives the flavor or taste of Holland gin.

About thirteen pounds of good berries, are sufficient for one barrel.

Be careful to let the gin as it runs from the worm, pass thro' a flannel cloth, which will
prevent many unpleasant particles from passing into the liquor, which are contracted in the
condensation, and the overjuice imbibed in its passage thro' the worm.

ART. V.

The best method of making common country Gin.

Take of singlings a sufficient quantity to fill the doubling still, put therein ten or twelve
pounds of juniper berries, with one shovel full of ashes, and two ounces alum--put on the bead,
and run her off, as is done in making whiskey. This is the common mode of making country gin;
but is in this state little superior to whiskey, save as to smell and flavor.

It is therefore in my mind, that the mode of clarifying, prescribed, ought to be pursued in
all distilleries, so far as necessary to make a sufficient quantity of good spirit for any
market convenient--the supply of respectable neighbors, who may prefer giving a trifle more
per gallon, than for common stuff and for domestic use. And moreover, I think the distiller
will meet a generous price for such clarified, and pure spirit, as he may send to a large mercantile
town for sale--as brewers and others, frequently desire such for mixing, brewing, making brandies
in the French and Spanish mode, and spirits after the Jamaica custom. And after the establishment
of a filtering tub or hopper, prepared as before described, with holes, flannel or woollen
cloth, and plenty of maple charcoal, and burnt brick-dust, a distiller may always find leisure
to attend to the filtration; indeed it will be found as simple and easy, as the process for
making ley from ashes in the country for soap. But I would suggest that spirit prepared and
clarified in this way, should be put into the sweetest and perfectly pure casks.

New barrels will most certainly impart color, and perhaps some taste, which would injure the
sale, if intended for a commercial town market, and for brewing, or mixing with spirits, from
which it is to receive its flavor.

For my own use, I would put this spirit into a nice sweet cask, and to each barrel I would
add a pint of regularly, and well browned wheat, not burned but roasted as much as coffee.

The taste of peach brandy may be imparted to it by a quantity of peach stone kernels, dried,
pounded and stirred into the cask; in this way, those who are fond of the peach brandy flavor,
may drink it without becoming subject to the pernicious consequences that arise from the constant
use of peach brandy. Peach brandy, unless cleansed of its gross and cloying properties, or
is suffered to acquire some years of age, has a cloying effect on the stomach, which it vitiates,
by destroying the effect of the salival and gastric juices, which have an effect on aliment,
similar to that of yeast on bread, and by its singular properties prevents those juices from
the performance of their usual functions in the fermentation of the food taken into the stomach--producing
acid and acrimonious matter, which in warm climates generates fevers and agues. Apple brandy
has not quite a similar but equally pernicious effect, which age generally removes--indeed,
age renders it a very fine liquor, and when diluted with water, makes a very happy beverage,
gives life and animation to the digesting powers, and rarely leaves the stomach heavy, languid
and cloyed. Then both those, (indeed, all liquors,) ought to be avoided when new, by persons
of delicate habit, and those who do not exercise freely. A severe exercise and rough life,
generally enables the stomach to digest the most coarse food, by liquor, however new.

On fining Liquors.

Isinglass is almost universally used in fining liquors. Take about half an ounce to the barrel--beat
it fine with a hammer, lay it in a convenient vessel, pour thereon two gallons whiskey, or
a like quantity of the liquor you are about to fine, let it soak two or three days, or till
it becomes soft enough to mix--then stir it effectually, and add the white and shells of half
a dozen eggs--beat them up together and pour them into the cask that is to be fined, then stir
it in the cask, bung it slightly, after standing three or four days it will be sufficiently
fine, and may be drawn off into a clean cask.

ART. VI.

On colouring Liquors.

One pound of brown sugar burnt in a skillet almost to a cinder, add a quart of water, which
when stirred, will dissolve the sugar--when dissolved, this quantity will color three barrels.

A pint of well parched wheat put into a barrel will colour it, and give more the appearance
of a naturally acquired colour, and an aged taste or flavor.

ART. VII.

To correct the taste of singed Whiskey.

Altho' this cannot be done effectually without clarifying, as prescribed, but Bohea tea will
in a great measure correct a slight singe--a quarter of a pound may be tried to the barrel.

ART. VIII.

To give an aged flavor to Whiskey.

This process ought to be attended to by every distiller, and with all whiskey, and if carefully
done, would raise the character, and add to the wholesomeness of domestic spirits.

It may be done by clarifying the singlings as it runs from the still--let the funnel be a little
broader than usual, cover it with two or more layers of flannel, on which place a quantity
of finely beaten maple charcoal, thro' which let the singlings filter into your usual receiving
cask. When doubling, put some lime and charcoal in the still, and run the liquor thro' a flannel--when
it loses proof at the worm, take away the cask, and bring it to proof with rain water that
has been distilled. To each hogshead of whiskey, use a pound of Bohea tea, and set it in the
sun for two weeks or more, then remove it to a cool cellar, and when cold it will have the
taste and flavor of old whiskey. If this method was pursued by distillers and spirits made
2d and 3d proof, it would not only benefit the seller, but would be an advantage to the buyer
and consumer--and was any particular distiller to pursue this mode and brand his casks, it
would raise the character of his liquor, and give it such an ascendancy as to preclude the
sale of any other, beyond what scarcity or an emergency might impel in a commercial city.

If distillers could conveniently place their liquor in a high loft, and suffer it to fall to
the cellar by a pipe, it would be greatly improved by the friction and ebullition occasioned
in the descent and fall.

SECTION VIII.

ARTICLE I.

Observations on Weather.

Some seasons are better for fermentation than others. Should a hail storm occur in the summer,
the distiller should guard against cooling off with water in which hail is dissolved, for it
will not work well.

If a thundergust happens when the hogsheads are in the highest state of fermentation, the working
will nearly cease, and the stuff begin to contract an acidity. And when in the spring the frost
is coming out of the ground, it is unfortunate when the distiller is obliged to use water impregnated
with the fusions of the frost, such being very injurious to fermentation--Those changes and
occurrences ought to be marked well, to enable a provision against their effects. This will
be found difficult without the assistance of a barometer, to determine the changes of the weather--a
thermometer, to ascertain correctly the heat of the atmosphere, and to enable a medium and
temperature of the air to be kept up in the distillery; and from observation to acquire a knowledge
of the degree of heat or warmth, in which the mashing in the hogsheads ferments to the greatest
advantage, and when this is ascertained, a distiller may in a close house sufficiently ventilated,
and provided with convenient windows, always keep up the degree or temperature in the air,
most adapted to the promotion of fermentation, by opening his windows or doors to admit air,
as a corrective; or by keeping them closed in proportion to the coldness of the weather:--And
a hydrometer, useful in measuring and ascertaining the extent of water. Instructions for the
management of those instruments generally attend them, it is therefore unnecessary for me to
go into a detail on this subject.--But it is absolutely necessary that the careful and scientific
distiller should possess them, especially the two former, to guard against the changes of the
weather, and preserve the atmosphere in the distillery, always equally warm.

ART. II.

Observations on Water.

Distillers cannot be too particular in selecting good water for distilling, when about to erect
distilleries.

Any water will do for the use of the condensing tubs or coolers, but there are many kinds of
water that will not answer the purpose of mashing or fermenting to advantage; among which are
snow and limestone water, either of which possess such properties, as to require one fifth
more of grain to yield the same quantity of liquor, that would be produced while using river water.

Any water will answer the distillers purpose, that will dissolve soap, or will wash well with
soap, or make a good lather for shaving.

River or creek water is the best for distilling except when mixed with snow or land water from
clay or ploughed ground. If no river or creek water can be procured, that from a pond, supplied
by a spring, if the bottom be not very muddy will do, as the exposure to the sun, will generally
have corrected those properties inimical to fermentation. Very hard water drawn from a deep
well, and thrown into a cistern, or reservoir and exposed to the sun and air for two or three
days, has been used in mashing with success, with a small addition of chop grain or malt. I
consider rain water as next in order to that from the river, for mashing and fermentation.
Mountain, slate, gravel and running water, are all preferable to limestone, unless impregnated
with minerals--many of which are utterly at variance with fermentation. With few exceptions,
I have found limestone, and all spring water too hard for mashing, scalding or fermenting.

ART. III.

Precautions against Fire

Cannot be too closely attended to. The store house, or cellar for keeping whiskey in, ought
to be some distance from the distillery, and the liquor deposited, and all work necessary in
it done by day, to avoid all possible danger arising from candles or lamps, from which many
serious calamities have occurred. Suppose the cellar or place of deposit to be entered at night
by a person carrying a lamp or candle, and a leaking cask takes his attention, in correcting
the leak, he may set his lamp on the ground covered with whiskey, or he may drop by chance
one drop of burning oil on a small stream of whiskey, which will communicate like gun powder,
and may cause an explosion, which may in all likelihood destroy the stock on hand, the house,
and the life of the individual.--On this subject it is not necessary I should say much, as
every individual employed about a distillery must have some knowledge of the value of life
and property.

The duty of the owner of a Distillery.

The main and first object of the proprietor of a distillery, is gain or profit--and the second,
it is natural, should be the acquiring a character or reputation for his liquor, and a desire
to excel neighboring distilleries--in both of which, neglect and sloth will insure disappointment.

The active, cleanly, industrious and attentive proprietor uses the following means.

First. He provides his distillery with good sound grain, hogsheads, barrels, kegs, funnels,
brooms, malt, hops, wood, &c. of all of which he has in plenty, nicely handled, and in good
order. He also provides an hydrometer, thermometer, and particularly a barometer, duly observing
the instructions accompanying each, their utility and particular uses.

Secondly. He is careful that his distiller does his duty, of which he can be assured only,
by rising at four o'clock, winter and summer, to see if the distiller is up and at his business,
and that every thing is going well--and to prepare every thing and article necessary--to attend
and see the hogs fed, and that the potale or slop be cold when given, and that the cattle be
slopped--that the stills are not burning, nor the casks leaking, &c. &c. He observes the barometer,
points out any changes in the weather, and pays an unremitted attention, seeing that all things
are in perfect order, and enforcing any changes he may deem necessary.

On the other hand, indolence begets indolence--The proprietor who sleeps till after sun rise,
sets an example to his distiller and people, which is too often followed--the distillery becomes
cold from the want of a regular fire being kept up in her--the hogsheads cease to work or ferment,
of consequence, they will not turn out so much whiskey--and there is a general injury sustained.
And it may often occur, that during one, two or three days in the week, the distiller may want
grain, wood, malt, hops or some necessary--and perhaps all those things may be wanting during
the same day ... and of course, the distiller stands idle. The cattle, hogs, &c. suffer; and
from this irregular mode of managing, I have known the proprietor to sink money, sink in reputation,
and rarely ever to attribute the effect to the right cause.

System and Method.

A well timed observance of system and method are necessary in all the various branches of business
pursued, and without which none succeeds so well.

And whilst the industrious, attentive and cleanly proprietor, may with certainty, calculate
on a handsome profit and certain advantages to result from this business. He who conducts carelessly,
may as certainly reckon on sustaining a general loss.

ART. II.

The duty of an hired Distiller

Is to rise at four o'clock every morning. Wash and clean out the boiler, fill her up with clean
water, put fire under her, and to clean, fill and put fire under the singling still--to collect
and put in order for mashing, his hogsheads--and as soon as the water is warm enough in the
boiler to begin mashing, which he ought to finish as early in the day as possible; for when
the mashing is done, he will have time to scald and clean his vessels, to attend his doubling
and singling still, to get in wood for next day, and to make his stock yeast, if new yeast
is wanting. In short, the distiller ought to have his mashing finished by twelve o'clock every
day, to see and have every thing in the still house, under his eye at the same time; but he
ought never to attempt doing more than one thing at once--a distiller ought never to be in
a hurry, but always busy. I have always remarked that the bustling unsteady distiller attempts
doing two or three things at once, and rarely ever has his business in the same state of forwardness
with the steady methodical character.

To do the business of a patent distillery or to carry her on to advantage, requires a little
more capital to start with--but either the patent or common distillery, when they have run
two or three months, managed by an attentive and brisk dealing man, will maintain, or keep
themselves agoing.

Where wood is scarce and money plenty, the patent distillery is certainly to be recommended,
indeed, in all cases, I would recommend it, where the proprietor has money enough. It is by
far the most profitable, and will sooner or later become in general use in this country.

ART. III.

Of Hogs.

Raising, feeding and fattening hogs on potale, a business pursued and highly spoken of, but
from my experience I have discovered that few good pigs can be raised entirely on potale--as
it has a tendency to gripe and scour too much; but after they are weaned and a little used
with slop, they will thrive well.

If a hog in a cold morning comes running to a trough full of slop, that is almost boiling,
and is very hungry--their nature is so gluttonous & voracious, that it will take several mouthfuls
before it feels the effects of the heat, and endangers the scalding of the mouth, throat and
entrails--and which may be followed by mortification and death;--moreover, hot feeding is the
cause of so many deaths, and ill-looking unhealthy pigs, about some distilleries--which inconvenience
might be avoided by taking care to feed or fill the troughs before the boiling slop is let
out from the still.

A distiller cannot be too careful of his hogs--as with care, they will be found the most productive
stock he can raise--and without care unproductive.

The offals of distilleries and mills cannot be more advantageously appropriated than in raising
of hogs--they are prolific, arrive at maturity in a short period, always in demand. Pork generally
sells for more than beef, and the lard commands a higher price than tallow; of the value of
pork and every part of this animal, it is unnecessary for me to enter into detail; of their
great value and utility, almost every person is well acquainted.

The hog pens and troughs ought to be kept clean and in good order, the still slop salted two
or three times a week; when fattening, hogs should be kept in a close pen, and in the summer
a place provided to wallow in water.

Hogs that are fed on potale, ought not to lie out at night, as dew, rain and snow injures them--indeed
such is their aversion to bad weather, that when it comes on, or only a heavy shower of rain,
away they run, full speed, each endeavoring to be foremost, all continually crying out, until
they reach their stye or place of shelter.

At the age of nine months, this animal copulates first, and frequently earlier, but it is better
engendering should be prevented, till the age of eighteen months--for at an earlier age, the
litter is uniformly small, and weakly, and frequently do not survive, besides the growth is
injured. It is therefore better not to turn a sow to breeding, till from 18 to 24 months old.

The sow goes four months with pig, and yields her litter at the commencement of the fifth;
soon after encourages and receives the boar, and thus produces two litters in the year. I have
known an instance of three litters having been produced in the year from one female.

A sow ought not to be permitted to suckle her pigs more than two or three weeks, after which
eight or nine only should be left with her, the rest sold, or sent to market, or killed for
use--at the age of three weeks they are fit for eating, if the sow is well fed. A few sows
will serve, and those kept for breeding, well selected from the litter, the residue, cut and
splayed. Care and pains is due in the choice of the breed of hogs--the breeder had then better
procure good ones, and of a good race at once, tho' the expense and trouble may seem material
in the outset, yet the keeping will be the same, and the produce perhaps fifty per cent more.

After the pigs are weaned, they ought to be fed for the first two weeks on milk, water and
bran, after which potale may be used in the room of milk. I would recommend a little mixed
potale from an early period, and increase it, so as to render them accustomed to the slop gradually.

ART. IV.

Of the Diseases of Hogs.

The only disease that I know of which seems to be peculiar to hogs, is a kind of leprosy, commonly
called measles, when it seizes them, they become dull and sleepy, if the tongue is pulled out,
the palate and throat will be found full of blackish spots, which appear also on the head,
neck, and on the whole body--the creature is scarce able to stand, and the roots of its bristles
are bloody. As this disorder proceeds chiefly from their gluttony and filth, and hot drinking
of potale and slop; to remedy which, it would be commendable to feed on cold potale, or scarcely
milk warm, to keep them clean, to mix salt occasionally with the potale--tar their trough once
a month, and give them a little ground antimony.

In fattening hogs I have known them improve rapidly, after eating the warm ashes from a fresh
burned brush heap. Hickory or willow ashes will have an effect to destroy worms, and I think
ought to be used, they will eat it dry, when put in their troughs.

ART. V.

On feeding Cattle and Milch Cows.

Potale is a great creator of milk, and will increase the quantity greatly in cows yielding
milk, but no so good. Young cattle thrive very well, that get hay or straw during the night.
To fatten cattle there ought to be mixed with the slop, a little oil meal, or chopped flaxseed,
or chopped corn. The cattle kept on still slop ought to get plenty of salt. Warm potale injures
their teeth.

Observations on erecting Distilleries.

Those who are about to erect distilleries, have a handsome subject for consideration; the advantages,
and the probable disadvantages that may arise from building on a particular site, or seat.
The contiguity to a chopping mill is a material consideration--Wood forming an important article,
should be taken into view--Grain merits also a great share of attention. The water which forms,
by no means, the least important ingredient should be well analyzed; and a share of thought
is due to the subject of a market for the whiskey, spirits and pork, produced from the establishment.--And
should the water then prove good, soft and proper for fermentation, can be bro't over head,
and the chopping mill is not very inconvenient, and wood convenient and cheap, and grain plenty
and at reasonable prices, and a market within one hundred miles, I have little doubt but that
with proper economy and observance of system, the establishment will prove very productive;
and may be progressed in with cheerfulness, and a reasonable hope of a fair retribution to
the owner.

A proper seat being fixed on, with sufficient fall to bring the water over head, for it is
very material, and an immense saving of labor--material, because it prevents a loss, in running
the stills, from pumping or want of water in the cooling tubs. The size of the house follows,
as requiring some more than usual calculation--houses are generally made too small, giving
great inconvenience, and preventing that nice attention to cleanliness, which forms a very
important item in the process of distilling. I would recommend a size sufficiently large for
three stills, and to mash six hogsheads per day--one of col. Anderson's patent improved stills,
I would consider, in many situations, as most desirable; at all events, I would recommend the
preparation of room enough for three stills, if even it should be the intention of the owner
to erect but two--for it is very probable, that after some experience, he may determine to
pursue the business more extensively, and add the patent still.

The size then established, I would recommend the lower story to be 10 feet high, this will
leave room for the heated, or rarefied air to ascend in the summer above the cooler, and more
necessary air in the warm season of the year, and prevent the unpleasant effect of a too warm
air on the mashing hogsheads, and the sowing of the stuff in fermentation--and moreover, prevent
the unpleasant effects of smoak on the distillers eyes. But it is important that the house
should be erected on level ground with doors opposite each other, with plenty of windows to
afford a draft and recourse of air, at pleasure, during the warm season; and so that in the
winter it may be closed and preserved perfectly warm--to which end it is most expedient the
lower story should be well built with stone and lime, and neatly plastered--the windows well
glazed, with shutters &c. Thus provided, and a thermometer placed in the centre of the house,
a proper temperature may be kept up in the air of the house--for there is a certain degree
of warmth which exceeds for fermentation--this degree of heat, then correctly ascertained by
the distiller, he may by a close attention to his duties, fires and the thermometer, always
keep the air of the house in nearly that same and most approved state; and even by a well timed
observation guard against storms and casualties. To effectuate this grand and important object,
some have divided the stills, placing the boiler at one end, and a singling and doubling still
at the other; this mode will ensure, in cold weather, the success of the measure more fully--others
have placed all the stills in the centre of the building--a plan that will do better in the
winter than in the summer, and one I think less favourably of than that of dividing them.

During the winter, the north or northwest side of the house should be kept quite close, permitting
the house to be lighted from the more temperate southward exposure. To calculate the window
sashes to open by hinges, or to be taken entirely out in the summer, at pleasure, is in my
mind advisable.

On Wines.

Presuming this work may be rendered more desirable to farmers, from the introduction of some
receipts for making domestic wine from the common hedge grapes, or such as are common on fence
rows and on high rich grounds, and which are pleasantly flavored after receiving frost, and
also for making cider in the best mode for preservation. I have extracted a few from various
author's.

Receipt for making Domestic Wine from the Autumn Blue Grape.

About the latter end of September or about the first white frosts, gather the grapes which
with us grow along old fences and hedges--pick all the grapes from the stems that are juicy,
allowing two bushels thus picked a little heaped, to the barrel. Mash them well between your
hands in small parcels, either in earthen pans, or some convenient small vessels--put them
when mashed into a tub together, and add a little water so as to soak the pumice.... After
stirring them well together, squeeze the pumice out from the liquor with your hands, as clean
as you can--then strain the juice through a hair sieve. If the juice seems not all extracted
from the pumice at one soaking and squeezing, put water to the pumice and squeeze them over
again; take care not to add too much water, lest there should be more than the cask will hold.
If after all the ingredients are added, the cask is not full, it may then be filled up with
water. To the liquor thus prepared, add two pounds of good, clean, rich low priced brown sugar,
per gallon, stirring it in the tub till all the sugar be dissolved; let it remain in the tub,
and in a day or two it will ferment, and the scum rise to the top, which must be carefully
skimmed off--then put the wine into a clean nice barrel--do not bung it up tight. There is
generally a fermentation in it the spring following, when the grape vines are in blossom, but
racking it off just before that season will prevent its working too much. If it is wanted to
be soon ripe for use, put a quart of good old brandy after it is racked off, to the barrel,
and give it air by leaving the bung quite loose.

This mode of manufacturing wine for domestic use, is convenient and not expensive to those
who have it in their power to manufacture maple sugar. But the nice housewife or husbandmen
of ingenuity, will, I fancy, devise some more neat mode of compressing the juice from the grape--as
pressing it by the hand, would seem less cleanly, though the fermentation generally cleanses
sufficiently.

Currant Wine

Is managed in the same way. The same quantity of sugar is presumed to answer--The juice is
generally well strained thro' cloths, and when well stirred, &c. with the sugar, and neatly
racked off, is put by in a loft to ripen, in sweet casks.

ART. II.

Directions for making Cider, British mode.

The apples after being thrown into a heap should always be covered from the weather. The later
the cider is made the better, as the juice is then more perfectly ripened, and less danger
to be feared from fermentation. Nothing does more harm to cider than a mixture of rotten apples
with the sound. The apples ought to be ground so close as to break the seeds which gives the
liquor an agreeable bitter. The pumice should be pressed through hair bags, and the juice strained
through two sieves, the uppermost of hair, the lower of muslin. After this the cider should
be put into open casks, when great attention is necessary to discover the exact time in which
the pumice still remaining in the juice, rises on the top, which happens from the third to
the tenth day, according as the weather is more or less warm. This body does not remain on
top more than two hours; consequently, care should be taken to draw off the cider before it
sinks, which may be done by means of a plug. When drawn off, the cider is put into casks. Particular
attention is again required to prevent the fermentation, when the least inclination towards
it is discovered. This may be done by a small quantity of cider spirits, about one gallon to
the hogshead. In March the cider should be again drawn off, when all risque of fermentation
ceases. Then it should be put into good sweet casks, and in three years from that time, it
will be fit for bottling. Old wine casks are to be preferred; those which contain rum are ruinous
to cider. Large earthen vessels might be made with or without glazing, which would be preferable
to any wooden vessel whatever. When we compare this with the hasty American mode of making
cider, it is not to be wondered at that the English cider so infinitely excels ours.

ART. III.

The following is a very highly approved American mode of making Cider.

Take care to have every necessary utensil to be made use of in the whole process, perfectly
clean and free from every foreign smell. For this purpose, before you begin your work, let
your mill, trough and press be made perfectly clean, by thoroughly washing, and if necessary,
with scalding water. The casks are another material object, and if musty, or any other bad
smell, one end should be taken out, and with shavings burn the inside; then scrub them clean,
and put in the head, scald them well afterwards, and drain them perfectly; when dry, bung them
tight and keep them in a cool shady place until wanted for use.--The apples should be quite
ripe, and all the unripe and rotten ones, leaves, and every other thing that can tend to give
the cider any disagreeable taste, carefully separated from them. I have found from careful
attention and many experiments, that it is a great advantage to the cider to be separated from
the gross parts as soon as possible; for this purpose, I tried several methods: that which
I found succeeded the best, I shall now relate, as by following it, I was able to preserve
my cider in a sound state, though made in the early part of the season. I took a large pipe,
of about 150 gallons, had one of the heads taken out, and on the inside of the other laid on
edge, four strips of boards, two inches wide, and on these strips placed a false bottom, filled
with gimlet holes, three inches a part. On this false bottom, I put a hair cloth, (old blanket
or swingline tow will do) so as to prevent any sand from washing into the space between the
true and false bottoms; I procured a quantity of coarse sand, which was carefully washed in
repeated waters, until it would not discolor the clean water--then dried the sand, put it in
the pipe, on the hair cloth, (coarse blanket or swingline tow,) about 9 inches thick.

Thus having every thing in readiness, I went through the process of making, as quick as possible,
by having the apples ground fine early in the morning, putting them in the press as fast as
they were ground; and then in sufficient quantities pressed out the juice, and put it over
the sand in the cask, (having previously bored a gimlet hole in the side of the cask), between
the true and false bottoms, in which I introduced a large goose-quill, stopped with another.
The pipe was placed so high, as to admit of a cask under it, to receive the liquor as it ran
from the quill, which, if rightly managed, will be perfectly fine, and being put away in a
cool cellar, and stopped close, will keep well, and prove of an excellent quality.

This process is easy, and in every person's power to execute, as the liquor, by being cleared,
from its gross feculences, will not run into that violent fermentation, so destructive to the
fine vinous flavor, which renders good cider so pleasing a drink.

Query. Would not a quart of good apple brandy to each barrel of cider, made in this way, prevent
any fermentation?

But it is generally believed that cider is the better for having undergone a fermentation,
becoming then more active and light; cider that has undergone condensation, or has been boiled
down until strong, has been found to keep sound some length of time, but it is too heavy and
destructive to the appetite, cloying the digesting powers.--And by too frequent use, I fancy,
will ultimately produce ague and fevers; and I fear, cider made according to the foregoing
receipt, would have a similar effect, but in a lesser degree.

I would recommend after a due attention to cleanliness, in the apple mill, trough, press and
casks, that the apples be assorted, and having been exposed to the air, under a roof or shed
some time, selecting the sound only, that they be ground fine, and let stand soaking in the
pumice twelve hours, and then pressed off, through a clean rye straw cheese (being the most
common and convenient in the country,) and when flowing from the press, a vessel should be
provided, with the bottom full of gimlet holes, in the style of a riddle, on which lay a coarse
cloth, then a layer of clean sand, over which a parcel of coarse rye straw, and suffer it to
filter thro' this vessel into the large receiving tub; the rye straw will intercept the coarser
pieces of pumice, and may be changed frequently--This mode will rid the liquor of all the coarser
pieces of pumice--then I would recommend that the cider should be placed in open hogsheads,
such as are used for mashing grain in distilleries; those being raised about two feet and an
half high on logs or a scaffolding, under a shade or covering--a spile hole bored near the
bottom of each, so as to admit a barrel to stand under the spile--in this state, I would recommend
it to stand until it undergoes a fermentation, carefully watching the top, and when the pumice
is found to have risen, to skim it off carefully, then having previously provided sweet barrels,
draw it off by the spile hole, adding from a pint to a quart of apple brandy to each barrel
of strong cider, bung it up tight, and store it where the frost will not injure it. In this
way, I presume it will keep well--and if the party be so disposed, I would recommend any bottling
to be done in April, and during clear weather, though it is safe to bottle immediately after
having undergone a thorough fermentation.

The following Receipt to make an excellent American Wine,

Was communicated to the Burlington Society for promoting domestic manufactures, by Joseph Cooper,
Esq. of Gloucester county, state of New Jersey, and ordered to be published;--which, from its
extreme simplicity, and economy, shewing the convenience with which a very pleasant, healthful
beverage, may be kept by every family in our country, is published in this work. And moreover,
as it may have, in some degree, the happy effects of correcting the baneful and pernicious
effects of coffee, which is so commonly used for breakfast in our state at present.

Coffee, when first introduced, was used as a medicine only, and given only in a well clarified
state, and sparingly--both from its soothing and pleasant effect, it become common, and now
it is almost the only beverage used at breakfast by the farmers of Pennsylvania, and indeed,
people suppose the morning repast is not genteel, unless the board is decorated with this foreign
beverage. If it was used in a moderately strong well clarified state, it would be less injurious,
but it is too frequently set down in a non descript state, difficult to be named, mixed with
the grounds, and so far from clear, as to be entitled to the epithet of muddy, and sweetened
with bad sugar, carrying with it to the simply ignorant family, using it in this state, the
cause in a great measure of destroying the tone of the stomach, overloading it, and by and
by, the introduction of a kind of dumb ague, or chill, followed with a fever, and often creating
intermitting and remitting fevers--consequences arising out of the free use of bad provisions--which
diseases are oftentimes kept up by the use of this infamously prepared coffee, for when the
country people get sick, coffee is too frequently used as the only diet.

It is particularly injurious to bilious habits--souring on the stomach, becoming acid, creating
acidity, and preventing the glandular juicy supplies from producing the usual fermentation
of the food in the stomach--rendering the chyle vitiated, which in its usual route, imparts
from the intestines, nourishment to the blood. Thus conveying its baneful properties by this
active vehicle, chyle to the blood, rendering it foetid, discoloured and by and by, often as
difficult to be named in its adulterated state as the composition which gave rise to it. Had
we not very many instances of new diseases--complaints which the most eminent of the medical
faculty can with difficulty name, or treat with judgment, without first having made many essays
and experiments fatal to the lives of hundreds, which are increasing with every approaching
season, and all since the adoption of coffee. (True, the free use of ardent spirits and other
luxuries operating on the effects of indolence--of habits, produced by the wealth and independence
of our agricultural and commercial people, and growing out of an imitation of the elevated,
affluent of society, born to fortune, and the successful professional characters;) a doubt
might present itself as to the propriety of attributing many of those new complaints to coffee
... but to a too plentiful use of bad provisions, and an indulgence of bad habits, we must
attribute to them. And as badly made coffee is among the most pernicious kinds of food, and
particularly when taken in the morning on an empty stomach, and that too made from very green
coffee, (dreadfully poisonous when used too frequently before it acquires age and a whiter
colour,) it may be condemned with greater propriety. And whilst this beverage is condemned
and so highly to be disapproved of, it is well if we can invent a light, pure, active and healthful
beverage to be taken freely, between or at meals, calculated in its nature to correct in some
degree, the unhappy effects of bad provisions--it is therefore I mention the

Receipt for making Honey Wine.

I put a quantity of the comb from which the honey had been drained, into a tub, to which I
add a barrel of cider, immediately from the press; this mixture was well stirred, and left
to soak for one night. It was then strained before a fermentation took place, and honey was
added until the weight of the liquor was sufficient to bear an egg. It was then put into a
barrel, and after the fermentation commenced, the cask was filled every day for three or four
days, with water, that the filth might work out of the bung hole. When the fermentation moderated,
I put the bung in loosely, lest stopping it tight, might cause the cask to burst.--At the end
of five or six weeks the liquor was drawn off into a tub, and the white of eight eggs well
beaten up, with a pint of clean sand, were put into it--I then added a gallon of cider spirit,
and after mixing the whole well together, I returned it into the cask, which was well cleaned,
bunged it tight and placed it in a proper situation for racking it off when fine. In the month
of April following, I drew it off for use, and found it equal in my opinion, to almost any
foreign wine--in the opinion of many good judges it was superior.

This success has induced me to repeat the experiments for three years, and I am persuaded that
by using the clean honey, instead of the comb, as above described; such an improvement might
be made as would enable the citizens of the United States, to supply themselves with a truly
federal and wholesome wine, which would not cost more than twenty cents per gallon, were all
the ingredients procured at the market prices, and would have the peculiar advantage over all
other wines, hitherto attempted in this country, that it contains no foreign mixture whatever,
but is made from ingredients produced on our own farms.

We find it at the coronations of Edward II. and Richard II.; also in the time of Henry IV., Richard

any of your readers explain the origin of the name curtana, a sword
so famous that it carries us back to the days of ancient chivalry,
when it was wielded by the Dane Uggiero, or by the still more famed
Orlando.

IS THE DOMBEC THE DOMESDAY OF ALFRED?

I beg to propose the following "Query":--Is the Dombec, a work referred to in the Laws of Edward
the Elder, the same as what has been called the Domesday or Winchester Book of Alfred the Great?
I incline to think that it is not, and shall be much obliged to any of your correspondents,
learned in the Anglo-Saxon period of our history, who will give himself
the trouble of resolving my doubts.

Sir Henry Spelman, in his Glossary voce Dombec, calls it the Liber Judicialis of the Anglo-Saxons;
and says it is mentioned in the first chapter of the laws of Edward the Elder, where the king
directs his judges to conduct themselves in their judicial proceedings
as on [Old English: thaere dom bec stand], that is, as is enjoined
in their Dome Book.--"Quod," he continues, "an de præcedentium Regum
legibus quæ hodie extant, intelligendum sit: an de alio quopiam libro
hactenus non prodeunte, incertum est."

But notwithstanding this, it appears to me by no means conclusive, that the Dombec referred to in
the Laws of Edward the Elder and the Liber Judicialis of Alfred are the same; on the contrary,
Alfred's Liber Judicialis seems to have been known not under the name of Dombec, but under that
of the Winchester Roll, from the circumstance of its having been principally kept at Winchester:
and Sir Henry Spelman says, the Domesday Book of William the Conqueror
was sometimes called Rotulus Wintoniæ, a similitudine antiquoris,
from its resemblance to an older document preserved at Winchester.

And he quotes Ingulphus Abbot of Croyland, who says, "Iste rotulus (i.e. the Domesday Book of William)
vocatus est Rotulus Wintoniæ, et ab Anglicis pro sua generalitate,
omnia tenementa totius terræ integre continente Domesday cognominatur."

And the he proceeds, "Talem rotulum et multum similem; ediderat quondam
Rex Alfredus, in quo totam terram Angliæ per comitatus, centurias,
et decurias descripserat, sicut prænotatur.

Qui quidem Rotulus Wintoniæ vocatus est, quia deponebatur apud Wintoniam
conservandus," &c.

Here is nothing said of this work being called
[Old English: dom bec]: neither does Spelman, in his enumeration of
the works of Alfred, give the least intimation that any one of his
collections of laws was called [Old English: dom bec].

We know, indeed, that Alfred compiled a code of laws for his subjects; but whether any part of
them has been preserved, or how much of them is embodied in subsequent codes, cannot now be
determined. Asser mentions that he frequently reprimanded the judges for wrong judgments; and Spelman,
that he wrote "a book against unjust magistrates," but any complete body of laws, if such was
ever framed by Alfred, is now lost; and that attributed to him in Wilkin's Leges Anglo-Saxon, is
held in suspicion by most writers

To a copper that holds 36 gallons, the mash-tub ought to be at least big enough to contain
six bushels of malt, and the copper of liquor, and room for mashing or stirring it: The under
back, coolers and working tubs, may be rather fitted for the conveniency of the room, than
to a particular size; for if one vessel be not sufficient to hold your liquor, you may take
a second.

Of cleaning and sweetening Casks & Brewing Vessels.

If a cask, after the beer is drank out, be well stopt to keep out the air, and the lees remaining
in it till you want to use it again, you will need only to scald it well, and take care of
the hoops before you fill it; but if air gets into a foul empty cask, it will contract an ill
scent in spight of scalding. A handful of bruised pepper boiled in the water you scald with,
will take out a little musty smell; but the surest way is to take out the head of the cask,
and let the cooper shave and burn it a little, and then scald it for use; if you cannot conveniently
have a cooper to the cask, get some stone lime, and put about three pound into a barrel, (and
proportionally to smaller or bigger vessels) and put to it about six gallons of cold water,
bung it up, and shake it about for some time, and afterwards scald it well; or for want of
lime, take a linen rag, and dip it in melted brimstone, and fasten one end to the bung, and
light the other, and let it hang on the cask. You must give it a little air, else it will not
burn; but keep in as much of the sulphur as you can. Scald it afterwards, and you will find
no ill smell.

If you have new casks, before you fill them, dig places in the earth, and lay them half their
depth with their bung holes downward, for a week; and after well scalding them, you may venture
to fill them.

Another way to proceed, if your brewing vessels are tinged with any ill smell, is to take unflacked
lime and water, and with an old broom scrub the vessel whilst the water is hissing, with the
lime; and afterwards take all this lime and water away, and put fresh water into the vessel,
and throw some bay or common salt into each, and let it stand a day or two; and when you come
to brew, scald your vessels, throw into them a little malt-dust or bran; and this will not
only finish their sweetening, but stop them from leaking.

But since there is so much trouble in getting vessels sweet after they have been neglected,
you ought to make all thorough clean after brewing, and once a month to fill your vessels with
fair water, and let it off again in two or three days.

Of mashing or raking your Liquors.

Suppose you take six bushels of malt, and two pounds of hops, and would make of it one barrel
of strong, and two barrels of small beer.

Heat your first copper of liquor for mashing, and strew over it a double handful of bran or
malt; by which you will see when it begins to boil; for it will break and curl, and then it
is fit to be let off into the mash tub, where it must remain till the steam is quite spent,
and you can see your face in it, before you put in your malt; and then you begin to mash, stirring
it all the while you are putting in the malt: but keep out about half a bushel dry, which you
are to strew over the rest, when you have done stirring it, which will be as soon as you have
well mixed it with the liquor, and prevented it from clodding.

After the dry malt is laid on, cover your mash tub with cloths, to prevent losing any spirit
of the malt, and let it so remain for two hours. Meanwhile have another copper of liquor hot;
and at two hours end begin to let off your first wort into the under-back. Receive a pailful
of the first running, and throw it again upon the malt.--You will find that the malt has sucked
up half of your first copper of liquor; and therefore to make up your quantity of wort for
your strong beer, you must gradually lade out of the second copper, and strew bowl after bowl
over the malt, giving it time to soak thro', and keeping it running by an easy stream, till
you perceive you have about forty gallons, which in boiling and working will be reduced to
thirty-six.

If you throw into the under-back (whilst you are letting off) about half a pound of hops, it
will preserve it from foxing, or growing sour or ropy.

Your first wort being all run off, you must soften the tap of the mash tub; and take a copper
of hot liquor for your second mashing, stirring up the malt as you did at first, and then cover
it close for two hours more. Meanwhile you fill your copper with the first wort, and boil it
with the remainder of the two pounds of hops, for an hour and an half, and then lade it off
into the coolers.

Contrive to receive the hops in a sieve, basket, or thin woolen bag that is sweet and clean;
then immediately fill your copper with cold liquor, renew your fire under it, and begin to
let off your second wort, throw a handful of hops into the under-back, for the same reason
as before: you will want to lade a few bowls full of liquor over the malt to make up the copper
full of second wort; and when you have enough, fasten the tap and mash a third time after the
same manner, and cover it close for another two hours; and then charge your copper with the
second wort, boiling it for an hour with the same hops.

By this time you may shift your first wort out of the coolers into a working tub, to make room
for the second wort to come into the coolers; and then your copper being empty, you may heat
as much liquor as will serve you to lade over the malt, or, by this time, rather grains, to
make up your third and last copper of wort, which must be bottled with the same hops over again;
and then your coolers are discharged of your second wort, to make room for the third; and when
they are both of a proper coolness, they may be put together before you set them a working.

During the time of shifting your liquors out of the copper, it is of consequence to take care
to preserve it from receiving damage by burning: you should always contrive to have the fire
low, or else to damp it at the time of emptying, and be very expeditious to put in fresh liquor.

Of working the Liquor.

In this, regard must be had to the water: liquor naturally grows warm in working; therefore,
in mild weather, it should be cold before it be set on, but a little warm in cold weather.
The manner of doing it, is to put some good sweet yeast into a hand-bowl or piggin, with a
little warm wort; then put the hand-bowl to swim upon the wort in the working tub, and in a
little while it will work out, and leisurely mix with the wort, and when you find the yeast
is gotten hold of the wort, you must look after it frequently; and if you perceive it begins
to heat and ferment too fast, lade some of it out into another tub; and when grown cold, it
may be put back again; or if you reserve some of the raw wort, you may check it leisurely,
by stirring it in with a hand-bowl. The cooler you work your liquor, the better, provided it
does but work well.

If you happen to check it too much, you may forward its working, by filling a gallon stone
bottle with boiling water, cork it close and put the bottle into the working tub.--An ounce
or two of powdered ginger will have the same effect.

There are a variety of methods in managing liquors whilst they are working.--Some people beat
the yeast of strong beer and ale, once in two or three hours, for two or three days together.

This they reckon makes the drink more heady, but withal hardens it so as to be drinkable in
two or three days; the last day of beating it in, (stirring the yeast and beer together) the
yeast, as it rises, will thicken; and then they take off part of the yeast, and beat in the
rest, which they repeat as often as it rises thick; and when it has done working, they tun
it up, so as it may just work out of the barrel.

Others again do not beat it in at all, but let their strong drink work about two days, or till
they see the ferment is over; and then they take off the top yeast, and either by a tap near
the bottom, let it off sine, or else lade it out gently, to leave the sediment and yeast at
the bottom.

This way is proper for liquor that is to be drank soon: but if it be to keep, it will want
the sediment to feed upon, and may probably grow stale, unless you make artificial lees: This
you may make of a quart of brandy, and as much flour of wheat as will make it into dough; put
them in lumps into the bung hole as soon as it has done working. Or else take a pound of the
powder of oyster shells and mix it with a pound of treacle or honey, and put it in soon after
it has done working.

It would add to the goodness, as well as sining of your malt liquor, if you took two quarts
of wheat, and make them very dry and crisp in an oven, or before the fire, and boil them in
your first copper of wort.--They would strain off with your hops, and might be put with them
into the second copper.

Of the fining of Malt Liquors.

It is most desirable to have beer fine of itself, which it seldom fails to do in due time,
if rightly brewed and worked; but as disappointments some times happen, it will be necessary
to know what to do in such cases.

Ivory shavings boiled in your wort, or hartshorn shavings put into your cask just before you
bung it down, will do much towards fining and keeping your liquor from growing stale.

Isinglass is the most common thing made use of in fining all sorts of liquors; they first beat
it well with a hammer or mallet, and lay it in a pail, and then draw off about two gallons
of the liquor to be fined upon it, and let it soak two or three days; and when it is soft enough
to mix with the liquor, they take a whisk, and stir it about till it is all of a ferment, and
white froth; and they frequently add the whites and shells of about a dozen of eggs, which
they beat in with it, and put altogether into the cask; then with a clean mop-stick, or some
such thing, stir the whole together; and then lay a cloth, or piece of paper over the bung-hole,
till the ferment is over; and then bung it up close, in a few days it will fall fine.

But if you want to fine only a small quantity, take half an ounce of unflacked lime, and put
it into a pint of water, and stir it well together, and let it stand for two or three hours,
or till the lime settle to the bottom; then pour the water off clear, and throw away the sediment;
then take half an ounce of isinglass cut small, and boil it in the lime water till it dissolves;
then let it cool, and pour it into the vessel, &c.

Of the season for Brewing.

The season for brewing keeping-beer is certainly best before Christmas, for then your malt
is in perfection, not having time to contract either a musty smell, dust or weavels, (an insect
that eats out the heart of the malt) and the waters are then seldom mixed with snow; and then
four pounds of hops will go as far as five in the spring of the year: For you must increase
in the quantity of hops as you draw towards summer. But, in short, chuse moderate weather as
much as you can for brewing, and if you have a kindly cellar besides to keep your liquor in,
that will not be much affected by extremity of heat or cold, you may reasonably expect great
satisfaction in your brewery.

Avoid as much as possible brewing in hot weather; but if you are necessitated to brew, make
no more than present drinking, for it will not keep.

To make Elderberry-Beer or Ebulum.

Take a hogshead of the first and strong wort, and boil in the same one bushel of picked Elderberries,
full ripe; strain off, and when cold, work the liquor in the hogshead, and not in an open tun
or tub; and after it has lain in the cask about a year, bottle it; and it will be a good rich
drink, which they call ebulum; and has often been preferred to portwine, for its pleasant taste,
and healthful quality.

N. B. There is no occasion for the use of sugar in this operation; because the wort has strength
and sweetness enough in itself to answer that end; but there should be an infusion of hops
added to the liquor, by way of preservation and relish.

Some likewise hang a small bag of bruised spices in the vessel.

To make improved and excellent wholesome Purl.

Take Roman wormwood two dozen, gentian-root six pounds; calamus aromatics (or the sweet flag
root) two pounds; a pound or two of the galen gale-root; horse radish one bunch; orange peal
dried, and juniper berries, each two pounds; seeds or kernels of Seville oranges cleaned and
dried, two pounds.

These being cut and bruised, put them into a clean butt, and start your mild brown, or pale
beer upon them, so as to fill up the vessel, about the beginning of November, and let it stand
till the next season; and make it thus annually.

To brew Strong Beer.

To a barrel of beer take two bushels of wheat just cracked in the mill, and some of the flour
sifted out of it; when your water is scalding hot, put it into your mash-vat, there let it
stand till you can see your face in it; then put your malt upon that, and do not stir it; let
it stand two hours and an half; then let it run into a tub that has two pounds of hops in it,
and a handful of rosemary flowers; and when it is all run, put it into the copper, and boil
it two hours; then strain it off, setting it a cooling very thin, and setting it a working
very cool; clear it very well before you put it a working; put a little yeast to it; when the
yeast begins to fall, put it into your vessel, put in a pint of whole grain, and six eggs,
then stop it; Let it stand a year, and then bottle it.

A good table-beer may be made, by mashing again, after the preceding is drawn off; then let
it stand two hours, and let that run, and mash again, and stir it as before; be sure to cover
your mashing-vat well; mix the first and second running together.

To make China Ale.

To six gallons of ale, take a quarter of a pound or more of China root, thin sliced, and a
quarter of a pound of coriander seeds, bruised--hang these in a tiffany, or coarse linen bag,
in the vessel, till it has done working; and let it stand fourteen days before you bottle.

To make Ale, or any other liquor, that is too new, or sweet, drink stale.

To do this to the advantage of health, put to every quart of ale, or other liquor, 10 or 12
drops of the true spirit of salt, and let them be well mixed together, which they will soon
do it by the subtile spirits penetrating into all parts, and have proper effect.

To recover sour Ale.

Scrape fine chalk a pound, or as the quantity of liquor requires, more; put it into a thin
bag into the ale.

To recover Liquor that is turned bad.

If any liquor be pricked or fading, put to it a little syrup of clay, and let it ferment with
a little barm, which will recover it; and when it is well settled, bottle it up, put in a clove
or two, with a lump of loaf sugar.

Directions for Bottling.

You must have firm corks, boiled in wort, or grounds of beer; fill within an inch of the cork's
reach, and beat it in with a mallet; then, with a small brass wire, bind the neck of the bottle,
bring up the ends, and twist them over with a pair of pincers.

To make a quarter of a hogshead of Ale, and a hogshead of Beer, of cooked Malt.

Take five strike of malt not ground too small; put in some boiling water, to cover the bottom
of your mashing-vat before you put in your malt; mash it with more boiling water, putting in
your malt at several times, that it may be sure to be all wet alike; cover it with a peck of
wheat bran, then let it stand thus mashed four hours, then draw off three gallons of wort,
and pour it upon that you have mashed, so let it stand half an hour more, till it runs clear,
then draw of all that will run, and take two quarts of it to begin to work up with the barm,
which must be about a pint and a half--put in the two quarts of wort at three times to the
barm; you need not stir it till you begin to put in the boiled wort.

You will not have enough to fill your vessel at first; wherefore you must pour on more boiling
water, immediately after the other has done running, till you have enough to fill a quarter
of a hogshead, and then pour on water for a hogshead of beer.

As soon as the ale wort has run off, put a third part into the boiler--when it boils up, take
off the scum, which you may put upon the grains for the small beer--when it is skimmed, put
in a pound and an half of hops, having first sifted out the seeds, then put in all the wort,
and let it boil two hours and an half, afterwards strain into two coolers, and let it stand
to cool and settle, then put it to cool a little at a time, to the barm, and two quarts of
wort, and beat it well together: every time you put the wort in, be sure you keep the settling out.

Suppose you brew early on Thursday morning, you may tun it at 9 or 10 on Saturday morning. 

Trunks of full-sized trees were seen, accompanied by meadow plants and roots of rushes and weeds,
surrounded by those of grasses and mosses; the perfect state of the
trees showed that they had been long buried under the sand.



To make Treacle Beer.

Boil two quarts of water, put into it one pound of treacle or molasses, stir them together
till they are well mixed; then put six or eight quarts of cold water to it, and about a tea
cup full of yeast or barm, put it up in a clean cask or stein, cover it over with a coarse
cloth, two or three times double, it will be fit to drink in two or three days.

The second and third time of making, the bottom of the first beer will do instead of yeast.

If you make a large quantity, or intend it for keeping, you must put in a handful of hops and
another of malt, for it to feed on, and when done working, stop it up close.

The above is the best and cheapest way of making treacle beer, tho' some people add raisins,
bran, wormwood, spices, such fruit, &c. as are in season, but that is just as you fancy.

Indeed many pleasant, cheap, and wholesome drinks may be made from fruits, &c. if they are
bruised and boiled in water, before the treacle is added.

The plan of manufacturing domestic wines, mead and small beer, once established and understood
in a family, becomes easy--is considered a duty--and the females prepare as regularly for renewing
them, as for baking, and doing every other branch of business. Many families amidst plenty
of ingredients and means, rarely have a comfortable beverage under their roof--this is attributable
to indolence, stupidity and want of knowledge.--A little well timed, planning and system, with
little more than usual labour, by the intelligent housewife, will cause comfort and plenty
to reign throughout, and prove a fine and salutary example to society. Besides, the pleasure
a lady derives from presenting a glass of good wine, in a nice clean glass to her welcome visitants,
will always amply compensate for the trouble of manufacturing, and preparing it; but when the
more intelligent pass a handsome and well merited compliment on the neatness and quality of
her fare--she derives happiness from her industry, and a degree of pleasure approaching to
exquisite. She may be esteemed one "who hath used her active faculties for the benefit of her
family and society, and not only deserves well of society, but of heaven, for the judicious
and liberal exercise of the mind, that god-like intellect, among the finest gifts of the munificent
creator of worlds." But of her, who sitteth still and inactive, and doth not exercise those
intellectual powers, it may be said "she is of an estrayed soul," and "hath buried her talent."
And neither merits the attention of society, or the grateful love of her husband and family--and
throws herself on the mercy of her God for forgiveness, for her numerous omissions, in withholding
the exercise of her active faculties--presuming the being or individual, who is capable of
the neglect of one duty, is capable of neglecting all--and tho' some little appearance may
be kept up, yet conviction is eternally in the eye of the great judge--and not to be evaded.

Thus then the laws of society, morality and religion, requiring the active exercise of our
person and faculties--offering the finest and most inducing rewards, the words of our language
are capable of describing, in the health afforded from exercise; the example, from which society
is benefitted; the pleasure derived from the approbation of our neighbors, and a conscientiousness
of having performed our duties here, and living by the exercise of a proper system of economy,
in a constant state of independence, always in possession of the means of alleviating the condition
of the indigent and unfortunate in society--and relieving the wants of our friends--and above
all, the hope of eternal happiness in the approbation of heaven hereafter.
