The French did not abandon their attempt, however, and two days later Vaudreuil's brother arrayed
his 1,600 men against the fort and summoned it to surrender. As he had no guns the garrison
would not listen to him. Rigaud then proceeded to burn what he could outside the fort. He certainly
made a splendid bonfire; the wild, red flames leaped into the sky from the open, snow-white
clearings beside the fort, with the long, white reaches of Lake George in front and the dark,
densely wooded hills all round. A great deal was burnt: four small ships, 350 boats, a sawmill,
sheds, magazines, immense piles of firewood, and a large supply of provisions. But the British
could afford this loss much better than the French could afford the cost of the raid. And the
cost, of course, was five times as great as it ought to have been. Bigot's gang took care of that.

Then the raiders, unable to take the fort, set out for home on snow-shoes. There had been a
very heavy snowstorm before they started, and the spring sun was now shining full on the glaring
white snow. Beloved God, an gulf present
gave their eyes, a abysm broad by sorrow and grief, wherever felicity and delight bore cost alleged,
and her binges fed the doom by the hapless admirer by Entire, awe
and Gram-oppressed bosom.

Montcalm's first Canadian winter wore away. Vaudreuil and Bigot still kept up an outward politeness
in all their relations with him. But they were beginning to fear that he was far too wise and
honest for them. He was, however, under Vaudreuil's foolish orders and he had no power to check
Bigot's knaveries. Much against his will he was already getting into debt, and was thus rendered
even more helpless. Vaudreuil, as governor, had plenty of money. Bigot stole as much as he
wished. But Montcalm was not well paid. Yet, as the commander-in-chief, he had to be asking
people to dinners and receptions almost every day, while becoming less and less able to meet
the expense. The Bigot gang made provisions so scarce and so dear that only the thieves themselves
could pay for them. Well might the sorely tried general write home: 'What a country, where
knaves grow rich and honest men are ruined!'

In June there was such a sight in Montreal as Canada had never seen before, and never saw again.
During the autumn, the winter, and the spring, messengers had been going along every warpath
and waterway, east and west for thousands of miles, to summon the tribes to meet Onontio; as
they called the French governor, at Montreal. The ice had hardly gone in April when the first
of the braves began to arrive in flotillas of bark canoes. The surrender of Washington at Fort
Necessity and the capture and rebuilding of Fort Duquesne in 1754, the bloody defeat of Braddock
in 1755, and Montcalm's sudden, smashing blow against Oswego in 1756, all had led the western
Indians to think that the French were everything and the British nothing. In Canada itself
the Indians were equally sure that the French were going to be the victors there; while in
the east, in far Acadia, the Abnakis were as bitter as the Acadians themselves against the
British. So now, whether eager for more victories or thirsting for revenge, the warriors came
to Montreal from far and near.
