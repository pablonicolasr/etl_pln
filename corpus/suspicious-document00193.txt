Magazine for their courtesy in permitting the publication in this volume of certain essays

HUMANLY SPEAKING

"Humanly speaking, it is impossible." So the old theologian would say when denying any escape
from his own argument. His logical machine was going at full speed, and the grim engineer had
no notion of putting on the brakes. His was a non-stop train and there was to be no slowing-down
till he reached the terminus.

But in the middle of the track was an indubitable fact. By all the rules of argumentation it
had no business to be there, trespassing on the right of way. But there it was! We trembled
to think of the impending collision.

But the collision between the argument and the fact never happened. The "humanly speaking"
was the switch that turned the argument safely on a parallel track, where it went whizzing
by the fact without the least injury to either. Many things which are humanly speaking impossible
are of the most common occurrence and the theologian knew it.

It is only by the use of this saving clause that one may safely moralize or generalize or indulge
in the mildest form of prediction. Strictly speaking, no one has a right to express any opinion
about such complex and incomprehensible aggregations of humanity as the United States of America
or the British Empire. Humanly speaking, they both are impossible. Antecedently to experience
the Constitution of Utopia as expounded by Sir Thomas More would be much more probable. It
has a certain rational coherence. If it existed at all it would hang together, being made out
of whole cloth. But how does the British Empire hold together? It seems to be made of shreds
and patches. It is full of anomalies and temporary makeshifts. Why millions of people, who
do not know each other, should be willing to die rather than to be separated from each other,
is something not easily explained. Nevertheless the British Empire exists, and, through all
the changes which threaten it, grows in strength.

The perils that threaten the United States of America are so obvious that anybody can see them.
So far as one can see, the Republic ought to have been destroyed long ago by political corruption,
race prejudice, unrestricted immigration and the growth of monopolies. The only way to account
for its present existence is that there is something about it that is not so easily seen. Disease
is often more easily diagnosed than health. But we should remember that the Republic is not
out of danger. It is a very salutary thing to bring its perils to the attention of the too
easy-going citizens. It is well to have a Jeremiah, now and then, to speak unwelcome truths.

But even Jeremiah, when he was denouncing the evils that would befall his country, had a saving
clause in his gloomy predictions. All manner of evils would befall them unless they repented,
and humanly speaking he was of the opinion that they couldn't repent. Nevertheless this did
not prevent him from continually exhorting them to do good, and blaming them when they didn't
do it. Like all great moral teachers he acted on the assumption that there is more freedom
of will than seemed theoretically possible. It was the same way with his views of national
affairs. Jeremiah's reputation is that of a pessimist. Still, when the country was in the hands
of Nebuchadnezzar and he was in prison for predicting it, he bought a piece of real estate
which was in the hands of the enemy. He considered it a good investment. Then he put the deeds
in an earthen vessel, "that they may continue many days." For in spite of the panic that his
own words had caused, he believed that the market would come up again. "Houses and vineyards
shall yet be bought in this land." If I were an archæologist with a free hand, I should like
to dig in that field in Anathoth in the hope of finding the earthen jar with the deed which
Hanameel gave to his cousin Jeremiah, for a plot of ground that nobody else would buy.

It is the moralists and the reformers who have after all the most cheerful message for us.
They are all the time threatening us, yet for our own good. They see us plunging heedlessly
to destruction. They cry, "Look out!" They often do not themselves see the way out, but they
have a well-founded hope that we will discover a way when our attention is called to an imminent
danger. The fact that the race has survived thus far is an evidence that its instinct for self-preservation
is a strong one. It has a wonderful gift for recovering after the doctors have given it up.

The saving clause is a great help to those idealists who are inclined to look unwelcome facts
in the face. It enables them to retain faith in their ideals, and at the same time to hold
on to their intellectual self-respect.

There are idealists of another sort who know nothing of their struggles and self-contradictions.
Having formed their ideal of what ought to be, they identify it with what is. For them belief
in the existence of good is equivalent to the obliteration of evil. Their world is equally
good in all its parts, and is to be viewed in all its aspects with serene complacency.

Now this is very pleasant for a time, especially if one is tired and needs a complete rest.
But after a while it becomes irksome, and one longs for a change, even if it should be for
the worse. We are floating on a sea of beneficence, in which it is impossible for us to sink.
But though one could not easily drown in the Dead Sea, one might starve. And when goodness
is of too great specific gravity it is impossible to get on in it or out of it. This is disconcerting
to one of an active disposition. It is comforting to be told that everything is completely
good, till you reflect that that is only another way of saying that nothing can be made any
better, and that there is no use for you to try.

Now the idealist of the sterner sort insists on criticizing the existing world. He refuses
to call good evil or evil good. The two things are, in his judgment, quite different. He recognizes
the existence of good, but he also recognizes the fact that there is not enough of it. This
he looks upon as a great evil which ought to be remedied. And he is glad that he is alive at
this particular juncture, in a world in which there is yet room for improvement.

       *       *       *       *       *

Besides the ordinary Christian virtues I would recommend to any one, who would fit himself
to live happily as well as efficiently, the cultivation of that auxiliary virtue or grace which
Horace Walpole called "Serendipity." In case the reader does not understand, Walpole goes on
to define "Serendipity" as "accidental sagacity (for you must know that no discovery you are
looking for comes under this description)."

I am inclined to think that in such a world as this, where our hold on all good is precarious,
a man should be on the lookout for dangers. Eternal vigilance is the price we pay for all that
is worth having. But when, prepared for the worst, he goes forward, his journey will be more
pleasant if he has also a "serendipitaceous" mind. He will then, by a sort of accidental sagacity,
discover that what he encounters is much less formidable than what he feared. Half of his enemies
turn out to be friends in disguise, and half of the other half retire at his approach. After
a while such words as "impracticable" and "impossible" lose their absoluteness and become only
synonyms for the relatively difficult. He has so often found a way out, where humanly speaking
there was none, that he no longer looks upon a logical dilemma as a final negation of effort.

The following essays were written partly at home and partly abroad. They therefore betray the
influence of some of the mass movements of the day. Anyone with even a little leisure from
his own personal affairs must realize that we are living in one of the most stirring times
in human history. Everywhere the old order is changing. Everywhere there are confused currents
both of thought and feeling.

That the old order is passing is obvious enough. That a new order is arising, and that it is
on the whole beneficent, is not merely a pious hope. It is more than this: it is a matter of
observation to any one with a moderate degree of "Serendipity."

IN THE HANDS OF A RECEIVER

It sometimes happens that a business man who is in reality solvent becomes temporarily embarrassed.
His assets are greater than his liabilities, but they are not quick enough to meet the situation.
The liabilities have become mutinous and bear down upon him in a threatening mob. If he had
time to deal with them one by one, all would be well; but he cannot on the instant mobilize
his forces.

Under such circumstances the law allows him to surrender, not to the mob, but to a friendly
power which shall protect the interests of all concerned. He goes into the hands of a receiver,
who will straighten out his affairs for him. I can imagine the relief which would come to one
who could thus get rid, for a while, of his harassing responsibilities, and let some one else
do the worrying.

In these days some of the best people I know are in this predicament in regard to their moral
and social affairs. These friends of mine have this peculiarity, that they are anxious to do
their duty. Now, in all generations, there have been persons who did their duty, according
to their lights. But in these days it happens that a new set of lights has been turned on suddenly,
and we all see more duties than we had bargained for. In the glare we see an army of creditors,
each with an overdue bill in hand. Each demands immediate payment, and shakes his head when
we suggest that he call again next week. We realize that our moral cash in hand is not sufficient
for the crisis. If all our obligations must be met at once, there will be a panic in which
most of our securities will be sacrificed.

We are accustomed to grumble over the increase in the cost of living. But the enhancement of
price in the necessities of physical life is nothing compared to the increase in the cost of
the higher life.

There are those now living who can remember when almost any one could have the satisfaction
of being considered a good citizen and neighbor. All one had to do was to attend to one's own
affairs and keep within the law. He would then be respected by all, and would deserve the most
eulogistic epitaph when he came to die. By working for private profit he could have the satisfaction
of knowing that all sorts of public benefits came as by-products of his activity.

But now all such satisfactions are denied. To be a good citizen you must put your mind on the
job, and it is no easy one. You must be up and doing. And when you are doing one good thing
there will be keen-eyed critics who will ask why you have not been doing other things which
are much more important; and they will sternly demand of you, "What do you mean by such criminal
negligence?"

What we call the awakening of the social conscience marks an important step in progress, But,
like all progress, it involves hardship to individuals. For the higher moral classes, the saints
and the reformers, it is the occasion of wholehearted rejoicing. It is just what they have,
all the while, been trying to bring about. But I confess to a sympathy for the middle class,
morally considered, the plain people, who feel the pinch. They have invested their little all
in the old-fashioned securities, and when these are depreciated they feel that there is nothing
to keep the wolf from the door. After reading a few searching articles in the magazines they
feel that, so far from being excellent citizens, they are little better than enemies of society.
I am not pleading for the predatory rich, but only for the well-meaning persons in moderately
comfortable circumstances, whose predatoriness has been suddenly revealed to them.

Many of the most conscientious persons go about with an habitually apologetic manner. They
are rapidly acquiring the evasive air of the conscious criminal. It is only a very hardened
philanthropist, or an unsophisticated beginner in good works, who can look a sociologist in
the eye. Most persons, when they do one thing, begin to apologize for not doing something else.
They are like a one-track railroad that has been congested with traffic. They are not sure
which train has the right of way, and which should go on the siding. Progress is a series of
rear-end collisions.

There is little opportunity for self-satisfaction. The old-fashioned private virtues which
used to be exhibited with such innocent pride as family heirlooms are now scrutinized with
suspicion. They are subjected to rigid tests to determine their value as public utilities.

Perhaps I may best illustrate the need of some receivership by drawing attention to the case
of my friend the Reverend Augustus Bagster.

Bagster is not by nature a spiritual genius; he is only a modern man who is sincerely desirous
of doing what is expected of him. I do not think that he is capable of inventing a duty, but
he is morally impressionable, and recognizes one when it is pointed out to him. A generation
ago such a man would have lived a useful and untroubled life in a round of parish duties. He
would have been placidly contented with himself and his achievements. But when he came to a
city pulpit he heard the Call of the Modern. The multitudinous life around him must be translated
into immediate action. His conscience was not merely awakened: it soon reached a state of persistent
insomnia.

When he told me that he had preached a sermon on the text, "Let him that stole steal no more,"
I was interested. But shortly after, he told me that he could not let go of that text. It was
a live wire. He had expanded the sermon into a course on the different kinds of stealing. He
found few things that did not come under the category of Theft. Spiritual goods as well as
material might be stolen. If a person possessed a cheerful disposition, you should ask, "How
did he get it?"

"It seems to me," I said, "that a cheerful disposition is one of the things where possession
is nine tenths of the law. I don't like to think of such spiritual wealth as ill-gotten."

"I am sorry," said Bagster, "to see that your sympathies are with the privileged classes."

Several weeks ago I received a letter which revealed his state of mind:--

"I believe that you are acquainted with the Editor of the 'Atlantic Monthly.' I suppose he
means well, but persons in his situation are likely to cater to mere literature. I hope that
I am not uncharitable, but I have a suspicion that our poets yield sometimes to the desire
to please. They are perhaps unconscious of the subtle temptation. They are not sufficiently
direct and specific in their charges. I have been reading Walt Whitman's 'Song of Joys.' The
subject does not attract me, but I like the way in which it is treated. There is no beating
around the bush. The poet is perfectly fearless, and will not let any guilty man escape.

        "'O the farmer's joys!
  Ohioans, Illinoisans, Wisconsonese, Kanadians,
  Iowans, Kansans, Oregonese joys.'

"That is the way one should write if he expects to get results. He should point to each individual
and say, 'Thou art the man.'

"I am no poet,--though I am painfully conscious that I ought to be one,--but I have written
what I call, 'The Song of Obligations.' I think it may arouse the public. In such matters we
ought to unite as good citizens. You might perhaps drop a postal card, just to show where you
stand."

            THE SONG OF OBLIGATIONS

  "O the citizen's obligations.
  The obligation of every American citizen to see that
     every other American citizen does his duty, and
     to be quick about it.
  The janitor's duties, the Board of Health's duties, the
     milkman's duties, resting upon each one of us individually
     with the accumulated weight of every
     cubic foot of vitiated air, and multiplied by the
     number of bacteria in every cubic centimeter of
     milk.
  The motorman's duties, and the duty of every spry citizen
     not to allow himself to be run over by the motorman.
  The obligation of teachers in the public schools to supply
     their pupils with all the aptitudes and graces
     formerly supposed to be the result of heredity and
     environment.
  The duty of each teacher to consult daily a card catalogue
     of duties, beginning with Apperception and
     Adenoids and going on to Vaccination, Ventilation,
     and the various vivacious variations on the
     three R's.
  The obligation resting upon the well-to-do citizen not
     to leave for his country place, but to remain in the
     city in order to give the force of his example, in
     his own ward, to a safe and sane Fourth of July.
  The obligation resting upon every citizen to write to
     his Congressman.
  The obligation to speak to one's neighbor who may
     think he is living a moral life, and who yet
     has never written to his Congressman.
  The obligation to attend hearings at the State House.
  The obligation to protest against the habit of employees
     at the State House of professing ignorance
     of the location of the committee-room where
     the hearings are to be held; also to protest against
     the habit of postponing the hearings after one has
     at great personal inconvenience come to the State
     House in order to protest.
  The duty of doing your Christmas shopping early
     enough in July to allow the shop-girls to enjoy
     their summer vacation.
  The duty of knowing what you are talking about, and
     of talking about all the things you ought to know
     about.
  The obligation of feeling that it is a joy and a privilege
     to live in a country where eternal vigilance is
     the price of liberty, and where even if you have
     the price you don't get all the liberty you pay for."

I was a little troubled over this effusion, as it seemed to indicate that Bagster had reached
the limit of elasticity. A few days later I received a letter asking me to call upon him. I
found him in a state of uncertainty over his own condition.

"I want you," he said, "to listen to the report my stenographer has handed me, of an address
which I gave day before yesterday. I have been doing some of my most faithful work recently,
going from one meeting to another and helping in every good cause. But at this meeting I had
a rare sensation of freedom of utterance. I had the sense of liberation from the trammels of
time and space. It was a realization of moral ubiquity. All the audiences I had been addressing
seemed to flow together into one audience, and all the good causes into one good cause. Incidentally
I seemed to have solved the Social Question. But now that I have the stenographic report I
am not so certain."

"Read it," I said.

He began to read, but the confidence of his pulpit tone, which was one of the secrets of his
power, would now and then desert him, and he would look up to me as if waiting for an encouraging
"Amen."

"Your secretary, when she called me up by telephone, explained to me the object of your meeting.
It is an object with which I deeply sympathize. It is Rest. You stand for the idea of poise
and tranquillity of spirit. You would have a place for tranquil meditation. The thought I would
bring to you this afternoon is this: We are here not to be doing, but to be.

"But of course the thought at once occurs to us, How can we be considering the high cost of
the necessaries of life? It will be seen at once that the question is at bottom an economic
one. You must have a living wage, and how can there be a living wage unless we admit the principle
of collective bargaining. It is because I believe in the principle of collective bargaining
that I have come here to-night to say to you working-men that I believe this strike is justifiable.

"I must leave to other speakers many interesting aspects of this subject, and confine myself
to the aspect which the committee asked me to consider more in detail, namely, Juvenile Delinquency
in its relation to Foreign Immigration. The relation is a real one. Statistics prove that among
immigrants the proportion of the juvenile element is greater than among the native-born. This
increase in juvenility gives opportunity for juvenile delinquency from which many of our American
communities might otherwise be free. But is the remedy to be found in the restriction of immigration?
My opinion is that the remedy is to be found only in education.

"It is our interest in education that has brought us together on this bright June morning.
Your teacher tells me that this is the largest class that has ever graduated from this High
School, You may well be proud. Make your education practical. Learn to concentrate, that is
the secret of success. There are those who will tell you to concentrate on a single point.
I would go even further. Concentrate on every point.

"I admit, as the gentleman who has preceded me has pointed out, that concentration in cities
is a great evil. It is an evil that should be counteracted. As I was saying last evening to
the Colonial Dames,--Washington, if he had done nothing else, would be remembered to-day as
the founder of the Order of the Cincinnati. The figure of Cincinnatus at the plough appeals
powerfully to American manhood. Many a time in after years Cincinnatus wished that he had never
left that plough. Often amid the din of battle he heard the voice saying to him, 'Back to the
Land!'

"It was the same voice I seemed to hear when I received the letter of your secretary asking
me to address this grange. As I left the smoke of the city behind me and looked up at your
granite hills, I said, 'Here is where they make men!' As I have been partaking of the bountiful
repast prepared by the ladies of the grange, your chairman has been telling me something about
this community. It is a grand community to live in. Here are no swollen fortunes; here industry,
frugality, and temperance reign. These are the qualities which have given New England its great
place in the councils of the nation. I know there are those who say that it is the tariff that
has given it that place; but they do not know New England. There are those at this table who
can remember the time when eighty-two ruddy-cheeked boys and girls trooped merrily to the little
red schoolhouse under the hill. In the light of such facts as these, who can be a pessimist?

"But I must not dwell upon the past; the Boy Scouts of America prepare for the future. I am
reminded that I am not at this moment addressing the Boy Scouts of America,--they come to-morrow
at the same hour,--but the principle is the same. Even as the Boy Scouts of America look only
at the future, so do you. We must not linger fondly on the days when cows grazed on Boston
Common. The purpose of this society is to save Boston Common. That the Common has been saved
many times before is true; but is that any reason why we should falter now? 'New occasions
teach new duties.' Let us not be satisfied with a supetficial view. While fresh loam is being
scattered on the surface, commercial interests and the suburban greed to get home quick are
striking at the vitals of the Common. Citizens of Boston, awake!

"Your pastor had expected to be with you this evening, but he has at the last moment discovered
that he has two other engagements, each of them of long standing. He has therefore asked me
to take his place in this interesting course of lectures on Church History. The subject of
the lecture for the evening is--and if I am mistaken some one will please correct me--Ulphilas,
or Christianity among the Goths. I cannot treat this subject from that wealth of historical
information possessed by your pastor; but I can at least speak from the heart. I feel that
it is well for us to turn aside from the questions of the day, for the quiet consideration
of such a character as Ulphilas.

"Ulphilas seems to me to be one of those characters we ought all to know more about. I shall
not weary you by discussing the theology of Ulphilas or the details of his career. It would
seem more fitting that these things should be left for another occasion. I shall proceed at
once to the main lesson of his life. As briefly as possible let me state the historical situation
that confronted him. It is immaterial for us to inquire where the Goths were at that time,
or what they were doing. It is sufficient for us to know that the Goths at that time were pagans,
mere heathen. Under those circumstances what did Ulphilas do? He went to the Goths. That one
act reveals his character. If in the remaining moments of this lecture I can enforce the lesson
for us of that one act, I shall feel that my coming here has not been in vain.

"But some one who has followed my argument thus far may say, 'All that you have said is true,
lamentably true; but what has it to do with the Advancement of Woman?' I answer, it is the
Advancement of Woman."

"How do you make that out?" I asked.

Bagster looked vaguely troubled. "There is no such thing as an isolated moral phenomenon,"
he said, as if he were repeating something from a former sermon; "when you attempt to remedy
one evil you find it related to a whole moral series. But perhaps I did not make the connection
plain. My address doesn't seem to be as closely reasoned as it did when I was delivering it.
Does it seem to you to be cogent?"

"Cogent is not precisely the word I would use. But it seems earnest."

"Thank you," said Bagster. "I always try to be earnest. It's hard to be earnest about so many
things. I am always afraid that I may not give to all an equal emphasis."

"And now that you have stopped for a moment," I suggested, "perhaps you would be willing to
skip to the last page. When I read a story I am always anxious to get to the end. I should
like to know how your address comes out,--if it does come out."

Bagster turned over a dozen pages and read in a more animated manner.

"Your chairman has the reputation of making the meetings over which he presides brisk and crisp.
He has given me just a minute and a half in which to tell what the country expects of this
Federation of Young People. I shall not take all the time. I ask you to remember two letters--E
and N. What does the country expect this Federation to do? E--everything. When does the country
expect you to do it? N--now. Remember these two letters--E and N. Young people, I thank you
for your attention.

"The hour is late. You, my young brother, have listened to a charge in which your urgent duties
have been fearlessly declared to you. When you have performed these duties, others will be
presented to you. And now, in token of our confidence in you, I give you the right hand of
fellowship.

"And do you know," said Bagster, "that when I reached to give him the right hand of fellowship,
he wasn't there."

We sat in silence for some time. At last he asked, hesitatingly, "What do you think of it?
In your judgment is it organic or functional?"

"I do not think it is organic. I am afraid that your conscience has been over-functioning of
late, and needs a rest. I know a nook in the woods of New Hampshire, under the shadow of Mount
Chocorua, where you might go for six months while your affairs are in the hands of a receiver.
I can't say that you would find everything satisfactory, even there. The mountain is not what
it used to be. It is decadent, geologically speaking, and it suffered a good deal during the
last glacial period. But you can't do much about it in six months. You might take it just as
it is,--some things have to be taken that way.

"You will start to-morrow morning and begin your life of temporary irresponsibility. You will
have to give up your problems for six months, but you may rest assured that they will keep.
You will go by Portsmouth, where you will have ten minutes for lunch. Take that occasion for
a leisurely meal. A card will be handed to you assuring you that 'The bell will ring one minute
before the departure of the train. You can't get left.' Hold that thought: you can't get left;
the railroad authorities say so."

"Did you ever try it," asked Bagster.

"Once," I answered.

"And did you get left?"

"Portsmouth," I said, "is a beautiful old town. I had always wanted to see it. You can see
a good deal of Portsmouth in an afternoon."

       *       *       *       *       *

The predicament in which my friend Bagster finds himself is a very common one. It is no longer
true that the good die young; they become prematurely middle-aged. In these days conscience
doth make neurasthenics of us all. Now it will not do to flout conscience, and by shutting
our eyes to the urgencies and complexities of life purchase for ourselves a selfish calm. Neither
do we like the idea of neurasthenia.

My notion is that the twentieth-century man is morally solvent, though he is temporarily embarrassed.
He will find himself if he is given sufficient time. In the mean time it is well for him to
consider the nature of his embarrassment. He has discovered that the world is "so full of a
number of things," and he is disappointed that he is not as "happy as kings"--that is, as kings
in the fairy books. Perhaps "sure enough" kings are not as happy as the fairy-book royalties,
and perhaps the modern man is only experiencing the anxieties that belong to his new sovereignty
over the world.

There are tribes which become confused when they try to keep in mind more than three or four
numbers. It is the same kind of confusion which comes when we try to look out for more than
Number One. We mean well, but we have not the facilities for doing it easily. In fact, we are
not so civilized as we sometimes think.

For example, we have never carried out to its full extent the most important invention that
mankind has ever made--money. Money is a device for simplifying life by providing a means of
measuring our desires, and gratifying a number of them without confusion.

Money is a measure, not of commodities, but of states of mind. The man in the street expresses
a profound philosophy when he says, "I feel like thirty cents." That is all that "thirty cents"
means. It is a certain amount of feeling.

You see an article marked "$1.50." You pass by unmoved. The next day you see it on the bargain
counter marked "98 cents," and you say, "Come to my arms," and carry it home. You did not feel
like a dollar and a half toward it, but you did feel exactly like ninety-eight cents.

It is because of this wonderful measure of value that we are able to deal with a multitude
of diverse articles without mental confusion.

I am asked to stop at the department store and discover in that vast aggregation of goods a
skein of silk of a specified shade, and having found it bring it safely home. Now, I am not
fitted for such an adventure. Left to my own devices I should be helpless.

But the way is made easy for me. The floorwalker meets me graciously, and without chiding me
for not buying the things I do not want, directs me to the one thing which would gratify my
modest desire. I find myself in a little place devoted to silk thread, and with no other articles
to molest me or make me afraid. The world of commodities is simplified to fit my understanding.
I feel all the gratitude of the shorn lamb for the tempered wind.

At the silken shrine stands a Minerva who imparts her wisdom and guides my choice. The silk
thread she tells me is equivalent to five cents. Now, I have not five cents, but only a five-dollar
bill. She does not act on the principle of taking all that the traffic will bear. She sends
the five-dollar bill through space, and in a minute or two she gives me the skein and four
dollars and ninety-five cents, and I go out of the store a free man. I have no misgivings and
no remorse because I did not buy all the things I might have bought. No one reproached me because
I did not buy a four-hundred-dollar pianola. Thanks to the great invention, the transaction
was complete in itself. Five cents represented one choice, and I had in my pocket ninety-nine
choices which I might reserve for other occasions.

But there are some things which, as we say, money cannot buy. In all these things of the higher
life we have no recognized medium of exchange. We are still in the stage of primitive barter.
We must bring all our moral goods with us, and every transaction involves endless dickering.
If we express an appreciation for one good thing, we are at once reproached by all the traffickers
in similar articles for not taking over bodily their whole stock in trade.

For example, you have a desire for culture. You haven't the means to indulge in very much,
but you would like a little. You are immediately beset by all the eager Matthew Arnolds who
have heard of your desire, and they insist that you should at once devote yourself to the knowledge
of the best that has been known and said in the world. All this is very fine, but you don't
see how you can afford it. Isn't there a little of a cheaper quality that they could show you?
Perhaps the second best would serve your purpose. At once you are covered with reproaches for
your philistinism.

You had been living a rather prosaic life and would like to brighten it up with a little poetry.
What you would really like would be a modest James Whitcomb Riley's worth of poetry. But the
moment you express the desire the University Extension lecturer insists that what you should
take is a course of lectures on Dante. No wonder that you conclude that a person in your circumstances
will have to go without any poetry at all.

It is the same way with efforts at social righteousness. You find it difficult to engage in
one transaction without being involved in others that you are not ready for. You are interested
in a social reform that involves collective action. At once you are told that it is socialistic.
You do not feel that it is any worse for that, and you are quite willing to go on. But at once
your socialistic friends present you with the whole programme of their party. It is all or
nothing. When it is presented in that way you are likely to become discouraged and fall back
on nothing.

Now, if we had a circulating medium you would express the exact state of your desires somewhat
in this way: "Here is my moral dollar. I think I will take a quarter's worth of Socialism,
and twelve and a half cents' worth of old-time Republicanism, and twelve and a half cents of
genuine Jeffersonian democracy, if there is any left, and a quarter's worth of miscellaneous
insurgency. Let me see, I have a quarter left. Perhaps I may drop in to-morrow and see if you
have anything more that I want."

The sad state of my good friend Bagster arises from the fact that he can't do one good thing
without being confused by a dozen other things which are equally good. He feels that he is
a miserable sinner because his moral dollar is not enough to pay the national debt.

But though we have not yet been able adequately to extend the notion of money to the affairs
of the higher life, there have been those who have worked on the problem.

That was what Socrates had in mind. The Sophists talked eloquently about the Good, the True,
and the Beautiful; but they dealt in these things in the bulk. They had no way of dividing
them into sizable pieces for everyday use. Socrates set up in Athens as a broker in ideas.
He dealt on the curb. He measured one thing in terms of another, and tried to supply a sufficient
amount of change for those who were not ashamed to engage in retail trade.

Socrates draws the attention of Phædrus to the fact that when we talk of iron and silver the
same objects are present to our minds, "but when any one speaks of justice and goodness, there
is every sort of disagreement, and we are at odds with one another and with ourselves."

What we need to do he says is to have an idea that is big enough to include all the particular
actions or facts. Then, in order to do business, we must be able to divide this so that it
may serve our convenience. This is what Socrates called Philosophy.

Even in the Forest of Arden life was not so simple as at first it seemed. The shepherd's life
which "in respect of itself was a good life" was in other respects quite otherwise. Its unity
seemed to break up into a confusing plurality. Honest Touchstone, in trying to reconcile the
different points of view, blurted out the test question, "Hast any philosophy in thee, Shepherd?"
After Bagster has communed with Chocorua for six months, I shall put that question to him.

THE CONTEMPORANEOUSNESS OF ROME

I

"You here, Bagster?" I exclaimed, as in the Sistine Chapel I saw an anxious face gazing down
into a mirror in which were reflected the dimmed glories of the ceiling. There was an anxiety
as of one who was seeking the Truth of Art at the bottom of the well.

One who is in the habit of giving unsolicited advice is likely to take for granted that his
advice has been acted upon, even though experience should teach him that this is seldom the
case. I had sagely counseled Bagster to go to the New Hampshire woods, in order to recuperate
after his multifarious labors. I was therefore surprised to find him playing truant in Rome.

My salutation did not at first cause him to look up. He only made a mysterious sign with his
hand. It was evidently a gesture which he had recently learned, and was practiced as a sort
of exorcism.

"I am not going to sell you cameos or post cards," I explained.

When he recognized a familiar face, Bagster forgot all about the Last Judgment, and we were
soon out-of-doors and he was telling me about himself.

"I meant to go to Chocorua as you suggested, but the congregation advised otherwise, so I came
over here. It seemed the better thing to do. Up in New Hampshire you can't do much but rest,
but here you can improve your taste and collect a good deal of homiletic material. So I've
settled down in Rome. I want to have time to take it all in."

"Do you begin to feel rested?" I asked.

"Not yet. It's harder work than I thought it would be. There's so much to take in, and it's
all so different. I don't know how to arrange my material. What I want to do, in the first
place, is to have a realizing sense of being in Rome. What's the use of being here unless you
are here in the spirit?

"What I mean is that I should like to feel as I did when I went to Mount Vernon. It was one
of those dreamy autumn days when the leaves were just turning. There was the broad Potomac,
and the hospitable Virginia mansion. I had the satisfying sense that I was in the home of Washington.
Everything seemed to speak of Washington. He filled the whole scene. It was a great experience.
Why can't I feel that way about the great events that happened down there?"

We were by this time on the height of the Janiculum near the statue of Garibaldi. Bagster made
a vague gesture toward the city that lay beneath us. There seemed to be something in the scene
that worried him. "I can't make it seem real," he said. "I have continually to say to myself,
'That is Rome, Italy, and not Rome, New York.' I can't make the connection between the place
and the historical personages I have read about. I can't realize that the Epistle to the Romans
was written to the people who lived down there. Just back of that new building is the very
spot where Romulus would have lived if he had ever existed. On those very streets Scipio Africanus
walked, and Cæsar and Cicero and Paul and Marcus Aurelius, and Epictetus and Belisarius, and
Hildebrand and Michelangelo, and at one time or another about every one you ever heard of.
And how many people came to get emotions they couldn't get anywhere else! There was Goethe.
How he felt! He took it all in. And there was Shelley writing poetry in the Baths of Caracalla.
And there was Gibbon."

"But we can't all expect to be Shelleys or even Gibbons," I suggested.

"I know it," said Bagster, ruefully. "But if one has only a little vessel, he ought to fill
it. But somehow the historical associations crowd each other out. When I left home I bought
Hare's 'Walks in Rome.' I thought I would take a walk a day as long as they lasted. It seemed
a pleasant way of combining physical and intellectual exercise. But do you know, I could not
keep up those walks. They were too concentrated for my constitution. I wasn't equal to them.
Out in California they used to make wagers with the stranger that he couldn't eat a broiled
quail every day for ten days. I don't see why he couldn't, but it seemed that the thought of
to-morrow's quail, and the feeling that it was compulsory, turned him against what otherwise
might have been a pleasure. It's so with the 'Walks.' It's appalling to think that every morning
you have to start out for a constitutional, and be confronted with the events of the last twenty-five
centuries. The events are piled up one on another. There they are, and here you are, and what
are you going to do about them?"

"I suppose that there isn't much that you can do about them," I remarked.

"But we ought to do what we can," said Bagster. "When I do have an emotion, something immediately
turns up to contradict it. It's like wandering through a big hotel, looking for your room,
when you are on the wrong floor. Here you are as likely as not to find yourself in the wrong
century. In Rome everything turns out, on inquiry, to be something else. There's something
impressive about a relic if it's the relic of one thing. But if it's the relic of a dozen different
kinds of things it's hard to pick out the appropriate emotion. I find it hard to adjust my
mind to these composite associations."

"Now just look at this," he said, opening his well-thumbed Baedeker: "'Santa Maria Sopra Minerva
(Pl. D. 4), erected on the ruins of Domitian's temple of Minerva, the only mediæval Gothic
church in Rome. Begun A.D., 1280; was restored and repainted in 1848-55. It contains several
admirable works of art, in particular Michelangelo's Christ.'"

"It's that sort of thing that gets on my nerves. The Virgin and Minerva and Domitian and Michelangelo
are all mixed together, and then everything is restored and repainted in 1848. And just round
the corner from Santa Maria Sopra Minerva is the Pantheon. The inscription on the porch says
that it was built by Agrippa, the son-in-law of Augustus. I try to take that in. But when I
have partially done that, I learn that the building was struck by lightning and entirely rebuilt
by the Emperor Hadrian.

"That information comes like the call of the conductor to change cars, just as one has comfortably
settled down on the train. We must forget all about Agrippa and Augustus, and remember that
this building was built by Hadrian. But it turns out that in 609 Boniface turned it into a
Christian church. Which Boniface? The Pantheon was adorned with bronze columns. If you wish
to see them you must go to St. Peter's, where they are a part of the high altar. So Baedeker
says, but I'm told that isn't correct either. When you go inside you see that you must let
by-gones be by-gones. You are confronted with the tomb of Victor Emmanuel and set to thinking
on the recent glories of the House of Savoy. Really to appreciate the Pantheon you must be
well-posted in nineteenth-century history. You keep up this train of thought till you happen
to stumble on the tomb of Raphael. That, of course, is what you ought to have come to see in
the first place.

"When you look at the column of Trajan you naturally think of Trajan, you follow the spiral
which celebrates his victories, till you come to the top of the column; and there stands St.
Peter as if it were his monument. You meditate on the column of Marcus Aurelius, and look up
and see St. Paul in the place of honor.

"I must confess that I have had difficulty about the ruins. Brick, particularly in this climate,
doesn't show its age. I find it hard to distinguish between a ruin and a building in the course
of construction. When I got out of the station I saw a huge brick building across the street,
which had been left unfinished as if the workmen had gone on strike. I learned that it was
the remains of the Baths of Diocletian. Opening a door I found myself in a huge church, which
had a long history I ought to have known something about, but didn't.

"Now read this, and try to take it in: 'Returning to the Cancelleria, we proceed to the Piazza
Campo de' Fiori, where the vegetable market is held in the morning, and where criminals were
formerly executed. The bronze statue of the philosopher Giordano Bruno, who was burned here
as a heretic in 1600, was erected in 1889. To the east once lay the Theatre of Pompey. Behind
it lay the Porticus of Pompey where Cæsar was murdered, B.C. 44.'

"It economizes space to have the vegetable market and the martyrdom of Giordano Bruno and the
assassination of Julius Cæsar all close together. But they are too close. The imagination hasn't
room to turn round. Especially as the market-women are very much alive and cannot conceive
that any one would come into the Piazza unless he intended to buy vegetables. Somehow the great
events you have read about don't seem to have impressed themselves on the neighborhood. At
any rate, you are conscious that you are the only person in the Piazza Campo de' Fiori who
is thinking about Giordano Bruno or Julius Cæsar; while the price of vegetables is as intensely
interesting as it was in the year 1600 A.D. or in 44 B.C.

"How am I to get things in their right perspective? When I left home I had a pretty clear and
connected idea of history. There was a logical sequence. One period followed another. But in
these walks in Rome the sequence is destroyed. History seems more like geology than like logic,
and the strata have all been broken up by innumerable convulsions of nature. The Middle Ages
were not eight or ten centuries ago; they are round the next block. A walk from the Quirinal
to the Vatican takes you from the twentieth century to the twelfth. And one seems as much alive
as the other. You may go from schools where you have the last word in modern education, to
the Holy Stairs at the Lateran, where you will see the pilgrims mounting on their knees as
if Luther and his protest had never happened. Or you can, in five minutes, walk from the Renaissance
period to 400 B.C.

"When I was in the theological seminary I had a very clear idea of the difference between Pagan
Rome and Christian Rome. When Constantine came, Christianity was established. It was a wonderful
change and made everything different. But when you stroll across from the Arch of Titus to
the Arch of Constantine you wonder what the difference was. The two things look so much alike.
And in the Vatican that huge painting of the triumph of Constantine over Maxentius doesn't
throw much light on the subject. Suppose the pagan Maxentius had triumphed over Constantine,
what difference would it have made in the picture?

"They say that seeing is believing, but here you see so many things that are different from
what you have always believed. The Past doesn't seem to be in the past, but in the present.
There is an air of contemporaneousness about everything. Do you remember that story of Jules
Verne about a voyage to the moon? When the voyagers got a certain distance from the earth they
couldn't any longer drop things out of the balloon. The articles they threw out didn't fall
down. There wasn't any down; everything was round about. Everything they had cast out followed
them. That's the way Rome makes you feel about history. That which happened a thousand years
ago is going on still. You can't get rid of it. The Roman Republic is a live issue, and so
is the Roman Empire, and so is the Papacy.

"The other day they found a ruined Arch of Marcus Aurelius in Tripoli, and began to restore
it. New Italy is delighted at this confirmation of its claims to sovereignty in North Africa.
The newspapers treat Marcus Aurelius as only a forerunner of Giolitti. By the way, I never
heard of Giolitti till I came over here. But it seems that he is a very great man. But when
ancient and modern history are mixed up it's hard to do any clear thinking. And when you do
get a clear thought you find out that it isn't true. THE TEN VIRGINS

or

THE MIDNIGHT CRY

Matthew xxv:1-13

The study of this most solemn parable spoken by our Lord is very opportune.

It is also necessary because certain wrong interpretations are being made of this parable, which
have been accepted by not a few of God's people.

We find the parable of the ten virgins exclusively in the Gospel of Matthew, and here it is a part
of the great discourse of our Lord, generally known as the Olivet discourse. The Gospel of Matthew
is the Gospel of the King and His Kingdom. Three great discourses of the Lord are recorded by
the Holy Spirit in the Gospel of Matthew. The first is the so-called
"sermon on the mount."

This contains the proclamation of the King concerning His Kingdom. The second discourse is found in
the 13th chapter; this is composed of seven parables in which the
Lord makes known the mysteries of the Kingdom.

In the last great discourse He reveals the future of His Kingdom. First He reveals the future
of the Jews, how the Jewish age will close, what great events are
yet to take place in the land of Israel.

  He speaks of the great tribulation,
  which is yet in store for the Jews and immediately after the days
of that great tribulation He will come in power and great glory.

At the close of His discourse He reveals the future of the Gentile nations, who are on earth
when He comes again. He will take His place upon His own glorious
throne and all nations will be gathered before Him.

They will be separated by the King, as a shepherd separates the sheep and the goats. Between these
two predictions concerning the future, the beginning and the end of this discourse He gives three
parables. These parables do not relate to the Jews, nor to the Gentile nations nor do they refer
to the period of time, the end of the age, of which He speaks in the first part of Matthew
xxiv. In these three parables the Lord shows the conditions which will prevail during the time
of His absence from this earth.

This period of time is the present Christian age. The three parables of the prudent and evil servant,
the wise and the foolish virgins and the faithful and the slothful servants, give us a picture
of the state of the entire Christian profession. This is seen in the very beginning of this parable.
The parable of the ten virgins is one, which relates to the kingdom
of heaven.

The kingdom of heaven has here the same meaning as in Matthew xiii, that is, it means the entire
sphere of Christian profession.

And now before we follow the different stages of this important parable I want to mention very
briefly the two wrong interpretations, which like all other errors in our day, became more and
more widespread.

The first claims that the virgins do not represent Christians at all, but that they represent
the Jewish remnant during the end of the age. The parable, according to this interpretation, will
be fulfilled in the future. I am not going to enter into the different arguments which are
advanced to support this view, but only wish to point out one fact, which is sufficient to disprove
this theory. The ten virgins fell asleep, which, as we shall see later, means that they no longer
expected the coming of the Bridegroom. Is it possible to conceive that the believing Jews during
the great tribulation, when everything points to the rapid consummation
of the age, can go to sleep?

This to my mind is sufficient to overthrow this theory, not to speak of other reasons.

Another interpretation holds that the ten virgins represent indeed Christians. However, the foolish
virgins are looked upon as true Christians, only they lacked a maturity
of growth, depth of consecration, were not baptized with the Holy
Spirit, or had not the so-called "second blessing."

All this the wise virgins possessed. This is the favoured view with a certain class of holiness
people. Others try to prove from it the theory of a first fruit rapture. The wise virgins are
the first fruits and they are taken first. The foolish will have to pass through the tribulation
and will be taken later. Against such teaching we simply hold up the words of the Lord, when He
as Bridegroom tells the foolish virgins "I know you not."

They were never His, they never knew Him and therefore they do not represent true Christians.
Never will the Lord say this word to any one who has truly trusted in Him, no matter how weak
and ignorant, how imperfect and erring that one may be.

And now let us look at the details of this parable, which gives us a picture of the attitude
and character of professing Christendom up to the time when the Bridegroom comes.

Four historic stages can be easily traced in this parable. Three of them are passed and the fourth
is imminent. At any moment the fourth may become actual history. They are the following:

1. A description of the Christian profession in its beginning and its characteristics. 2. The
falling asleep of the virgins. 3. The Midnight cry. 4. The Coming of the Bridegroom. We are
living in the days when the midnight cry is heard and are facing
the fourth great event of this parable, the Coming of the Bridegroom,
the entrance of the wise virgins to be with Him and the shutting out
of the foolish.

And this it is which makes this parable so very solemn in the days in which we are living.
In 2nd Corinthians we read that the virgin is used as a type of the church. "I have espoused you
to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ." The Lord in the parable uses
the figure of ten virgins, because the parable does not altogether refer to the true church,
His Bride, but because He had in mind the conditions of that which professes to be the church.
The number ten is the number of testimony and responsibility.

Nevertheless we learn from the beginning of this parable what true Christianity is. The characteristics
of the Christian calling are three-fold: separation, manifestation and expectation. Separation
from the world; going forth with lamps, which are for giving light, to shine as lights while the
Bridegroom is not here; and then to go forth to meet the Bridegroom. One can read in these statements
the very words and thoughts with which the Holy Spirit describes the Thessalonian Christians, "How ye turned
to God from idols to serve the true and the living God and to wait for His Son from heaven." The
emphasis in this parable is upon the last of these characteristics.

The whole body of Christians in the beginning went out to meet the Bridegroom. The blessed
Hope of the coming of the Lord was the Hope and the expectation of the church in the very
start. It was the original attitude of the true church and bears witness to the heavenly hope
and heavenly calling of the church.

In the next two verses the spiritual condition of the ten virgins is laid bare. It is noteworthy
that the condition is stated first, the demonstration of it comes later; after the midnight
cry had been sounded the foolishness of the five becomes manifested. The division of these
virgins in five wise and five foolish brings out the fact that in the professing church two
classes of people are found, the true and the false, saved and unsaved,
professing and possessing.

The wise represent such who have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who have personal knowledge
of Christ and are sealed with the Spirit; they have the unction of the Holy One, who is represented
by the oil. The foolish are such who have the form of godliness and deny the power thereof.
They represent such who have taken the outward profession but lack the reality. As they never
truly trusted in Christ they have not the oil, the Holy Spirit. The objection has been made that
the foolish virgins can hardly represent unsaved persons, because they are called virgins
and went out to meet the Bridegroom. In their profession they were virgins, and in profession
they had gone out to meet the Bridegroom.

Another objection is raised. Did they not later say "Give us of your oil, for our lamps are
gone out?" Then they must have had some oil, else how could they say that their lamps were gone
out? There is no proof at all in this that they had a certain supply of oil. It is distinctly
said that they only took lamps, but they did not take oil. They may have made an attempt to light the
wick of their lamps only to see that they did not give light and
went out.

No, they never possessed the oil, just as the great mass of professing Christians in our days
have lamps, an outward form, but no reality. Christ was never accepted and therefore the Holy
Spirit and His power is lacking. A fearful condition it is! Alas, the thousands and hundreds
of thousands who are in that condition to-day!

2. A second stage historically is seen in the fifth verse. "While the Bridegroom tarried, they
all slumbered and slept." Both the foolish and the wise grew heavy, became drowsy and then
slept. This has been interpreted in different ways.

However, the meaning of it is not hard to discover. The Bridegroom tarried and they no longer
expected Him. As the centuries went on the professing church gave up the blessed Hope and ceased
looking for the Lord. This is an historic fact. The Coming of the Bridegroom was forgotten and
all, the most earnest believers as well as the mere professing ones
slept, and for long centuries nothing was heard of the Bridegroom
and His Coming.

Darkness and confusion prevailed in dispensational truths; the writings extending over hundreds
of years witness to this fact. Of the end of the world, a universal judgment day, and the Day
of wrath something was heard occasionally, but the blessed Hope as it was known in the beginning
was completely forgotten. Nothing is heard of it for many, many centuries. This is the second
great historic event. The Lord was no longer expected.

3. And now we come to the third. "And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold the Bridegroom!
go out to meet Him." The question is has this period been reached, or are we still to wait
for such a startling cry, reaching the ears of both the wise and the foolish, the professing
and the possessing? Some teach in our day that that cry is the same as the shout which is mentioned
in 1 Thess. iv, the shout which the descending Lord will give to call His own into His presence.
But that is incorrect. The midnight cry and the shout of the Lord have no connection. The shout
of the Lord is the first word which He will utter. His last word was, "Behold I come quickly."
The next word will be His shout. The midnight cry is not uttered
by Himself, but it is given by the Holy Spirit.

And has the midnight cry been given by the Holy Spirit? Has there been a revival of the blessed
Hope of the Coming of the Lord? Did anything like this of which the Lord here speaks take place? We
unhesitatingly answer it with, Yes. We all know of the Coming of the Lord. Most of us are
cherishing the blessed Hope and are waiting for Himself. We sing precious hymns full of hope
and expectation. Over the entire Christian profession the preaching has gone forth of the
Coming of the Bridegroom.

This is sufficient evidence that this stage in the parable has been reached. The midnight cry
has been given. When was it given? We do not hear anything about the Bridegroom and His nearness
during the great reformation period. The great instruments which were used in the reformation
had no light on the Coming of the Lord. Luther, for instance, spoke occasionally of the great
universal judgment day, which he believed was near, because he believed the Pope to be the Antichrist.
In this conception he was followed by all his contemporaries.

It was not given to the great reformers to be used in the revival of the prophetic Word and
to give the midnight cry. Nor do we hear anything like the midnight cry immediately after the
reformation; we go back to the first half of the last century and there we meet with a revival
of the blessed Hope, the coming of the Lord. The Holy Spirit flashed forth this blessed truth
once more and ever since then the midnight cry has been heard, and it is still being heard.
We live in the fulfillment of this period of the parable of our Lord.

But what is indicated by these words? You noticed we left out the word "cometh." The authorized
version reads, "Behold the Bridegroom cometh." The revised version has left out the word "cometh"
and that is the right way to read it, "Behold the Bridegroom! Go ye forth to meet Him." This
tells us that the midnight cry is more than a mere announcement of
the coming of the Lord.

It is, of course, indicated, but the Holy Spirit in the midnight cry calls attention to the
person of the Bridegroom. He unfolds His glorious person anew and brings out the fact that His church,
whom He has loved, is His Bride and that He is the Bridegroom. And along with this message
of the Bridegroom there is a call to go forth to meet Him. What else is it than a call to the
original position? It demands a return to that as it was in the beginning. It is a call to separation
from all that is false and unscriptural. How can any one, or how could any one honestly believe
that that adorable Person, the Bridegroom, is near, soon Coming,
without turning away from all that is displeasing to Him, without
turning the back upon all which dishonors both His Person and His
Word?

This then is the significant meaning of the midnight cry. Exactly this took place and still
takes place in out present day. Along with the revival of the blessed Hope, the preaching of His
imminent Coming, we have a return to other great truths, such as the teaching concerning the
church. Just as the giving up of the blessed Hope affected the other great doctrines of the
Bible and became in part responsible for the fearful decline, confusion and departure from
the faith once and for all delivered unto the saints, so the recovery of the blessed Hope,
the imminent Coming of the Lord, results in the recovery of these same blessed doctrines which
were given up and leads to a return to the true position. All this
has come to pass.

All is still coming to pass. The midnight cry, "Behold the Bridegroom, go ye forth to meet Him,"
stands in closest connection with the church message to Philadelphia, in the third chapter of Revelation.
There the person of Christ, as the Holy One and the True One, is in the foreground. Once more
a company of His people at the very last days are keeping His Word and are not denying His name
as well as keeping the Word of His patience, which has reference to His Coming, and to His
Philadelphia remnant He gives the encouraging message, "I will keep thee out of the hour of
trial which is to come upon all the earth." Philadelphia assuredly
originates with the midnight cry. The two are inseparably connected.

But
to return to the parable of the Lord. We notice that the midnight
cry discovers the true condition of the wise and the foolish. They
all arose and trimmed their lamps. The message has an effect upon
the entire Christian profession. Of the wise we read but little, but
the foolish now discover that they have no oil and further demonstrate
their foolishness by appealing to the wise to give them oil. But the gold on the ceiling was a different
matter. That was romantically historical. It came from America in the heroic age. I thought
of the Spanish galleons that brought it over, and of Columbus and Cortés and Alvarado. After
that, to go into the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore was like taking a trip to Mexico.

In the course of my daily walks, I passed the Church of Santa Pudenziana, said to be the oldest
in Rome, and recently modernized. It is on the spot where Pudens, the host of St. Peter, is
said to have lived with his daughters Praxedis and Pudentiana. This is interesting, but the
English-speaking traveler is likely to pass by Pudaentiana's church, and seek out the church
of her sister St. Praxed. And this not for the sake of St. Praxed or her father Pudens or even
of his guest St. Peter, but for the sake of a certain English poet who had visited the church once.

Close to the Porta San Paolo is the great tomb of the Roman magnate, Gaius Cestius, which was
built before the birth of Christ. One can hardly miss seeing it, because it is near one of
the most sacred pilgrimage places of Rome, the grave of John Keats.

Each traveler makes his own Rome; and the memories which he takes away are the memories which
he brought with him.

III

As for my friend Bagster, now that he has come to Rome, I hope he may stay long enough to allow
it to produce a more tranquilizing effect upon him. When he gives up the attempt to take it
all in by an intellectual and moral effort, he may, as the saying is, "relax."

There is no other place in which one may so readily learn the meaning of that misused word
"urbanity." Urbanity is the state of mind adapted to a city, as rusticity is adapted to the
country. In each case the perfection of the adaptation is evidenced by a certain ease of manner
in the presence of the environment. There is an absence of fret and worry over what is involved
in the situation. A countryman does not fret over dust or mud; he knows that they are forms
of the good earth out of which he makes his living. He may grumble at the weather, but he is
not surprised at it, and he is ready to make the best of it.

This adaptation to nature is easy for us, for we are rustics by inheritance. Our ancestors
lived in the open, and kept their flocks and were mighty hunters long before towns were ever
thought of. So when we go into the woods in the spring, our self-consciousness leaves us and
we speedily make ourselves at home. We take things for granted, and are not careful about trifles.
A great many things are going on, but the multiplicity does not distract us. We do not need
to understand.

For we have primal sympathies which are very good substitutes for intelligence. We do not worry
because nature does not get on faster with her work. When we go out on the hills on a spring
morning, as our forbears did ten thousand years ago, it does not fret us to consider that things
are going on very much as they did then. The sap is mounting in the trees; the wild flowers
are pushing out of the sod; the free citizens of the woods are pursuing their vocations without
regard to our moralities. A great deal is going on, but nothing has come to a dramatic culmination.

Our innate rusticity makes us accept all this in the spirit in which it is offered to us. It
is nature's way and we like it, because we are used to it. We take what is set before us and
ask no questions. It is spring. We do not stop to inquire as to whether this spring is an improvement
on last spring or on the spring of the year 400 B.C. There is a timelessness about our enjoyment.
We are not thinking of events set in a chronological order, but of a process which loses nothing
by reason of repetition.

Our attitude toward a city is usually quite different. We are not at our ease. We are querulous
and anxious, and our interest takes a feverish turn. For the cities of our Western world are
new-fangled contrivances which we are not used to, and we are worried as we try to find out
whether they will work. These aggregations of humanity have not existed long enough to seem
to belong to the nature of things. It is exciting to be invited to "see Seattle grow," but
the exhibition does not yield a "harvest of a quiet eye." If Seattle should cease to grow while
we are looking at it, what should we do then?

But with Rome it is different. Here is a city which has been so long in existence that we look
upon it as a part of nature. It is not accidental or artificial. Nothing can happen to it but
what has happened already. It has been burned with fire, it has been ravaged by the sword,
it has been ruined by luxury, it has been pillaged by barbarians and left for dead. And here
it is to-day the scene of eager life. Pagans, Christians, reformers, priests, artists, soldiers,
honest workmen, idlers, philosophers, saints, were here centuries ago. They are here to-day.
They have continuously opposed each other, and yet no species has been exterminated. Their
combined activities make the city.

When one comes to feel the stirring of primal sympathies for the manifold life of the city,
as he does for the manifold life of the woods, Rome ceases to be distracting. The old city
is like the mountain which has withstood the hurts of time, and remains for us, "the grand
affirmer of the present tense."

THE AMERICAN TEMPERAMENT

I

Stopping at some selected spot on the mountain road, the stage-driver will direct the stranger's
attention to a projecting mass of rock which bears some resemblance to a human countenance.
There is the "Old Man of the Mountains," or the "Old Woman," as the case may be.

If the stranger be of a docile disposition he will see what he is told to see. But he will
be content with the vague suggestion and will not push the analogy too far. The similitude
is strictly confined to the locality. It is enough if from a single point the mountain seems
almost human. From any other point it will seem to be merely mountainous.

A similar caution is necessary in regard to the resemblances between a nation and an individual.
When we talk of a national character or temperament, we are using an interesting and bold figure
of speech. We speak of millions of people as if they were one. Of course, a nation is not one
kind of person; it is composed of many kinds of persons. These persons are diverse in character.
All Scotchmen are not canny, nor all Irishmen happy-go-lucky. Those who know a great many Chinamen
are acquainted with those who are idealists with little taste for plodding industry. It is
only the outsider who is greatly impressed by the family resemblance. To the more analytic
mind of the parent each child is, in a most remarkable degree, different from the others.

When we take such typical characters as John Bull and Brother Jonathan as representing actual
Englishmen or Americans, we put ourselves in the way of contradiction. They are not good likenesses.
An English writer says: "As the English, a particularly quick-witted race, tinged with the
colors of romance, have long cherished a false pride in their reputed stolidity, and have accepted
with pleasant equanimity the figure of John Bull as their national signboard, though he does
not resemble them, so Americans plume themselves on the thought that they are dying of nervous
energy."

There is much truth in this. One may stand at Charing Cross and watch the hurrying crowds and
only now and then catch sight of any one who suggests the burly John Bull of tradition. The
type is not a common one, at least among city dwellers.

But when we attribute a temperament to a nation, we do not necessarily mean that all the people
are alike. We only mean that there are certain ways of thinking and feeling that are common
to those who have had the same general experience. The national temperament is manifested not
so much in what the people are as in what they admire and instinctively appreciate.

Let us accept the statement that the English are a quick-witted and romantic people who have
accepted with pleasant equanimity the reputation for being quite otherwise. Why should they
do this? Why should they take pride in their reputed stolidity rather than in their actual
cleverness. Here is a temperamental peculiarity that is worth looking into.

John Bull may be a myth, but Englishmen have been the mythmakers. They have for generations
delighted in picturing him. He represents a combination of qualities which they admire. Dogged,
unimaginative, well-meaning, honest, full of whimsical prejudices, and full of common sense,
he is loved and honored by those who are much more brilliant than he.

John Bull is not a composite photograph of the inhabitants of the British Isles. He is not
an average man. He is a totem. When an Indian tribe chooses a fox or a bear as a totem, they
must not be taken too literally. But the symbol has a real meaning. It indicates that there
are some qualities in these animals that they admire. They have proved valuable in the tribal
struggle for existence.

Those who belong to the cult of John Bull take him as the symbol of that which has been most
vital and successful in the island story. England has had more than its share of men of genius.
It has had its artists, its wits, its men of quick imagination. But these have not been the
builders of the Empire, or those who have sustained it in the hours of greatest need. Men of
a slower temper, more solid than brilliant, have been the nation's main dependence. "It's dogged
as does it." On many a hard-fought field men of the bull-dog breed have with unflinching tenacity
held their own. In times of revolution they have maintained order, and never yielded to a threat.
Had they been more sensitive they would have failed. Their foibles have been easily forgiven
and their virtues have been gratefully recognized.

When we try to form an idea of that which is most distinctive in the American temperament,
we need not inquire what Americans actually are. The answer to that question would be a generalization
as wide as humanity. They are of all kinds. Among the ninety-odd millions of human beings inhabiting
the territory of the United States are representatives of all the nations of the Old World,
and they bring with them their ancestral traits.

But we may ask, When these diverse peoples come together on common ground, what sort of man
do they choose as their symbol? There is a typical character understood and appreciated by
all. In every caricature of Uncle Sam or Brother Jonathan we can detect the lineaments of the
American frontiersman.

James Russell Lowell, gentleman and scholar that he was, describes a type of man unknown to
the Old World:--

  "This brown-fisted rough, this shirt-sleeved Cid,
  This backwoods Charlemagne of Empires new.
  Who meeting Cæsar's self would slap his back,
  Call him 'Old Horse' and challenge to a drink."

Mr. Lowell bore no resemblance to this brown-fisted rough. He would not have slapped Cæsar
on the back, and he would have resented being himself greeted in such an unconventional fashion.
Nevertheless he was an American and was able to understand that a man might be capable of such
improprieties and at the same time be a pillar of the State. It tickled his fancy to think
of a fellow citizen meeting the imperial Roman on terms of hearty equality.

  "My lungs draw braver air, my breast dilates
  With ampler manhood, and I face both worlds."

Dickens, with all his boisterous humor and democratic sympathies, could not interpret Jefferson
Brick and Lafayette Kettle and the other expansive patriots whom he met on his travels. Their
virtues were as a sealed book to him. Their boastful familiarity was simply odious.

To understand Lowell's exhilaration one must enter into the spirit of American history. It
has been the history of what has been done by strong men who owed nothing to the refinements
of civilization. The interesting events have taken place not at the centre, but on the circumference
of the country. The centrifugal force has always been the strongest. There has been no capital
to which ambitious youths went up to seek their fortune. In each generation they have gone
to the frontier where opportunities awaited them. There they encountered, on the rough edges
of society, rough-and-ready men in whom they recognized their natural superiors. These men,
rude of speech and of manner, were resourceful, bold, far-seeing. They were conscious of their
power. They were laying the foundations of cities and of states and they knew it. They were
as boastful as Homeric heroes, and for the same reason. There was in them a rude virility that
found expression in word as well as in deed.

Davy Crockett, coon-hunter, Indian fighter, and Congressman, was a great man in his day. It
does not detract from his worth that he was well aware of the fact. There was no false modesty
about this backwoods Charlemagne. He wrote of himself, "If General Jackson, Black Hawk, and
me were to travel through the United States we would bring out, no matter what kind of weather,
more people to see us than any other three people now living among the fifteen millions now
inhabiting the United States. And what would it be for? As I am one of the persons mentioned
I would not press the question further. What I am driving at is this. When a man rises from
a low degree to a place he ain't used to, such a man starts the curiosity of the world to know
how he got along."

Davy Crockett understood the temper of his fellow citizens. A man who rises by his own exertions
from a low position to "a place he ain't used to" is not only an object of curiosity, but he
elicits enthusiastic admiration. Any awkwardness which he exhibits in the position which he
has achieved is overlooked. We are anxious to know how he got along.

Every country has its self-made men, but usually they are made to feel very uncomfortable.
They are accounted intruders in circles reserved for the choicer few. But in America they are
assured of a sympathetic audience when they tell of the way they have risen in the world. There
is no need for them to apologize for any lack of early advantages, for they are living in a
self-made country. We are in the habit of giving the place of honor to the beginner rather
than to the continuer. For the finisher the time is not ripe.

II

The most vivid impressions of Americans have always been anticipatory. They have felt themselves
borne along by a resistless current, and that current has, on the whole, been flowing in the
right direction. They have never been confronted with ruins that tell that the land they inhabit
has seen better days. Yesterday is vague; To-day may be uncertain; To-morrow is alluring; and
the Day after to-morrow is altogether glorious. George Herbert pictured religion as standing
on tiptoe waiting to pass to the American strand. Not only religion but every other good thing
has assumed that attitude of expectant curiosity.

Even Cotton Mather could not avoid a tone of pious boastfulness when he narrated the doings
of New England. Everything was remarkable. New England had the most remarkable providences,
the most remarkable painful preachers, the most remarkable heresies, the most remarkable witches.
Even the local devils were in his judgment more enterprising than those of the old country.
They had to be in order to be a match for the New England saints.

The staid Judge Sewall, after a study of the prophecies, was of the opinion that America was
the only country in which they could be adequately fulfilled. Here was a field large enough
for those future battles between good and evil which enthralled the Puritan imagination. To
be sure, it would be said, there isn't much just now to attract the historian whose mind dwells
exclusively on the past. But to one who dips into the future it is thrilling. Here is the battlefield
of Armageddon. Just when that might take place might be uncertain but where it would take place
was to them more obvious.

In the days of small things the settlers in the wilderness had large thoughts. They felt themselves
to be historical characters, as indeed they were. They were impressed by the magnitude of the
country and by the importance of their relation to it. Their language took on a cosmic breadth.

Ethan Allen could not have assumed a more masterful tone if he had had an Empire at his back
instead of undisciplined bands of Green Mountain Boys. Writing to the Continental Congress,
he declares that unless the demands of Vermont are complied with "we will retire into the fastnesses
of our Green Mountains and will wage eternal warfare against Hell, the Devil, and Human Nature
in general." And Ethan Allen meant it.

The love of the superlative is deeply seated in the American mind. It is based on no very careful
survey of the existing world. It is a conclusion to which it is easy to jump. I remember one
week, traveling through the Mississippi Valley, stopping every night in some town that had
something which was advertised as the biggest in the world. On Friday I reached a sleepy little
village which seemed the picture of contented mediocrity. Here, thought I, I shall find no
bigness to molest me or make me afraid. But when I sat down to write a letter on the hotel
stationery I was confronted with the statement, "This is the biggest little hotel in the State."

When one starts a tune it is safer to start it rather low, so as not to come to grief on the
upper notes. In discussing the American temperament it is better to start modestly. Instead
of asking what excellent qualities we find in ourselves, we should ask what do other nations
most dislike in us. We can then have room to rise to better things. There is a family resemblance
between the worst and the best of any national group. Kipling, in his lines "To an American,"
may set the tune for us. It is not too high. His American is boastful, careless, and irrationally
optimistic.

A person who would offer to shake hands with Fate is certainly lacking in a fine sense of propriety.
His belief in equality makes him indifferent to the note of distinction. "He dubs his dreary
brethren kings." Of course they are not kings, but that makes no difference. It makes little
difference whether anything corresponds to the name he chooses to give to it. For there is

       "A cynic devil in his blood
  That bids him mock his hurrying soul."

This impression of a mingling of optimism, cynicism, and hurry is one which is often made upon
those who are suddenly plunged into American society. In any company of Americans who are discussing
public affairs the stranger is struck by what seems the lack of logical connection between
the statements of facts and the judgments passed upon them. The facts may be most distressing
and yet nobody seems much distressed, still less is any one depressed. The city government
is in the hands of grafters, the police force is corrupt, the prices of the necessaries of
life are extortionate, the laws on the statute book are not enforced, and new laws are about
to be enacted that are foolish in the extreme. Vast numbers of undesirable aliens are coming
into the country and bringing with them ideas that are opposed to the fundamental principles
of the republic. All this is told with an air of illogical elation. The conversation is interspersed
with anecdotes of the exploits of good-natured rascals. These are received with smiles or tolerant
laughter. Everyone seems to have perfect confidence that the country is a grand and glorious
place to live in, and that all will come out well in the end.

Is this an evidence of a cynic humor in the blood, or is it a manifestation of childish optimism?
Let us frankly answer that it may be one or the other or both. There are cynics and sentimentalists
who are the despair of all who are seriously working for better citizenship. But the chances
are that the men to whom our stranger was listening were neither cynics nor sentimentalists,
but idealists who had the American temperament.

Among those who laughed good-naturedly over the temporary success of the clever rascal may
have been those who had been giving their energies to the work of prevention of just such misdeeds.
They are reformers with a shrewd twinkle in their eyes. They take a keen intellectual pleasure
in their work, and are ready to give credit to any natural talent in their antagonist. If they
are inclined to take a cheerful view of the whole situation it is because they are in the habit
of looking at the situation as a whole. The predominance of force is actually on their side
and they see no reason to doubt the final result. They have learned the meaning of the text,
"Fret not thyself because of evildoers." In fact the evildoer may not have done so much harm
as one might think. Nor is he really such a hopeless character. There is good stuff in him,
and he yet may be used for many good purposes. They laugh best who laugh last, and their good-natured
laughter was anticipatory. There are forces working for righteousness which they have experienced.
On the whole things are moving in the right direction and they can afford to be cheerful.

This is the kind of experience which comes to those who are habitually dealing with crude materials
rather than with finished products. They cannot afford to be fastidious; they learn to take
things as they come and make the best of them. The doctrine that things are not as they seem
is a cheerful one, to a person who is accustomed to dealing with things which turn out to be
better than at first they seemed. The unknown takes on a friendly guise and awakens a pleasant
curiosity. That is the experience of generations of pioneers and prospectors. They have found
a continent full of resources awaking men of courage and industry. The opportunities were there;
all that was needed was the ability to recognize them when they appeared in disguise.

III

And the human problem has been the same as the material one. Europe has sent to America not
the finished products of her schools and her courts, but millions of people for whom she had
no room. They were in the rough; they had to be made over into a new kind of citizen. This
material has often been of the most unpromising appearance. It has often seemed to superficial
observers that little could be made of it. But the attempt has been made. And those who have
worked with it, putting skill and patience into their work, have been agreeably surprised.
They have come to see the highest possibilities in the commonest lumps of clay.

The satisfaction that is taken in the common man is not in what he is at the present moment,
but in what he has shown himself capable of becoming. Give him a chance and all the graces
may be his. The American idealist admits that many of his fellow citizens may be rather dreary
brethren, but so were many of the kings of whom nothing is remembered but their names and dates.
Only now and then is one seen who is every inch a king. But such a person is a proof of what
may be accomplished. It may take a long time for the rank and file to catch up with their leaders.
But where the few are to-day the many will be to-morrow; for they are all travelling the same road.

The visitor in the United States, especially if he has spent his time in the great cities of
the East, may go away with the idea that democracy is a spent force. He will see great inequalities
in wealth and position. He will be struck by the fact that autocratic powers are wielded which
would not be tolerated in many countries of Europe. He will notice that it is very difficult
to give direct expression to the will of the people.

But he will make a mistake if he attributes these things to the growth of an aristocratic sentiment.
They are a part of an evolution that is thoroughly democratic. The distinctive thing in an
aristocracy is not the fact that certain people enjoy privileges. It lies in the fact that
these privileged people form a class that is looked upon as superior. An aristocratic class
must not only take itself seriously; it must be taken seriously by others.

In America there are groups of persons more successful than the average. They are objects of
curiosity, and, if they are well-behaved, of respect. Their comings and goings are chronicled
in the newspapers, and their names are familiar. But it does not occur to the average man that
they are anything more than fortunate persons who emerged from the crowd, and who by and by
may be lost in the crowd again. What they have done, others may do when their time comes. The
inequalities are inequalities of circumstance and not of nature.

The commonplace American follows unworthy leaders and has admiration for cheap success. But
he cherishes no illusions in regard to the objects of his admiration. They have done what he
would like to do, and what he hopes to be able to do sometime. He thinks of the successful
men as being of the same kind with himself. They are more fortunate, that is all.

IV

The same temperamental quality is seen in the American idealist. His attitude toward his spiritual
leaders is seldom that of meek discipleship. It is rather that of frank, outspoken comradeship.
No mysterious barrier separates the great man from the common man. One has more, the other
has less, that is all.

The men who have cherished the finest ideals have insisted that these should be shared by the
multitude. In a newspaper of sixty years ago there is this contemporary character sketch: "Ralph
Waldo Emerson is the most erratic and capricious man in America. He is emphatically a democrat
of the world, and believes that what Plato thought, another man may think. What Shakespeare
sang, another man may know as well. As for emperors, kings, queens, princes, or presidents,
he looks upon them as children in masquerade. He has no patience with the chicken-hearted who
refer to mouldy records or old almanacs to ascertain if they may say that their souls are their
own. Mr. Emerson is a strange compound of contradictions. Always right in practice, and sometimes
in theory. He is a sociable, accessible, republican sort of man, and a great admirer of nature."

Could any better description be given of the kind of man whom Americans delight to honor? This
"sociable, accessible, republican sort of man" happened to be endowed with gifts denied in
such full measure to his countrymen. But they were gifts which they understood and appreciated.
He was one of them, and expressed and interpreted their habitual thought. Luther used to declare
that no one who had never had trials and temptations could understand the Holy Scriptures.
And one might say that no one who had never taken part in a town meeting, or listened to the
talk of neighbors at the country store, or traveled in an "accommodation train" in the Middle
West, can fully understand Emerson.

Critics have often written of the optimism of Emerson as if he were one of those who did not
perceive the darker side of things. Nothing could be more untrue to his temper of mind. Emerson
was cheerful, but he never pretended that the world was an altogether cheerful place to live
in. Indeed, it distinctly needed cheering up, and that, according to him, is what we are here for.

It might be possible to make out a list of matters of fact treated by Emerson and his friend
Carlyle. They would be essentially the same. When it came to hard facts, one was as unflinching
in his recognition as the other. There was nothing smug in Emerson's philosophy. He never took
an apologetic attitude nor attempted to minimize difficulties. There was no attempt to justify
the ways of God to man. But while agreeing in regard to the facts the friends differed as to
their conclusions. In reading Carlyle one seems to stand at the end of a world struggle that
has proved unavailing. Everything has been tried, and everything has failed. Alas! Alas!

Emerson sees the same facts, but he seems to be standing at the beginning. The moral world
is still without form and void, but the creative spirit is brooding upon it. "Sweet is the
genesis of things." Emerson is pleased with the world, not because he thinks its present condition
is very good, but because he sees so much room for it to become better. It is a most promising
experiment. It furnishes an abundance of the raw materials of righteousness.

Nor does he flatter himself that the task of betterment is an easy one, or that the end is
in sight. It is not a world where wishes, even good wishes, are fulfilled without effort. There
are inexorable laws not of our making. The whims of good people are not respected.

  "For Destiny never swerves
     Nor yields to man the helm."

The struggle is stem and unrelenting. It taxes all our energies. And yet it is exhilarating.
There is a moral quick-wittedness which sees the smile behind the threatening mask of Fate.
Destiny is after all a good comrade for the brave and the self-reliant.

  "He forbids to despair,
     His cheeks mantle with mirth,
   And the unimagined good of man
     Is yeaning at the birth."

The riddle of existence is seen not from the Old World point of view, but from that of the
new. It is of the nature of a surprise. The Sphinx of Emerson is not carved in stone. It is
not silent and motionless, waiting for answers that do not come.

It is the American Sphinx leading in a game of hide-and-seek. The mystery of existence baffles
us, not because there is no answer, but because there are so many. They are infinite in number,
and all of them are true. They wait for the mind large enough to harbor them in all their variety,
and serene enough not to be annoyed because their contradictions are not at once reconciled.

The catalogue of ills may be never so long, but it fails to depress one who sees everything
in the making.

This conception of the merry Sphinx may seem strange to the dyspeptic philosopher pondering
on the inscrutableness of the universe. But the prospectors in the mining camps of the Far
West, and the builders of new cities understand what Emerson meant. Their experience of the
ups and downs of fortune has taught them how to find pleasure in uncertainty. You never can
tell how anything will turn out till you try. That's the fun of it. They are quite ready to
believe that the same thing holds good in the higher life.

Or take the lines on "Worship." How can Worship be personified? Emerson's picture is not that
of a patriarch on bended knee; it is that of a vigorous youth picking himself up after he has
been knocked down by his antagonist.

  "This is he, who, felled by foes,
   Sprung harmless up, refreshed by blows."

Religion is a kind of spiritual resilience. It is that which makes a man come back with new
vigor to his work after his first failure. It is the ability to make a new beginning.

In Emerson the American hurry is transformed into something of spiritual significance. A new
commandment is given to the good man--Be quick! Keep moving!

  "Trenchant Time behoves to hurry,

       *       *       *       *       *

  O wise man, hearest thou the least part,
  Seest them the rushing metamorphosis,

  Dissolving all that fixture is,
  Melts things that be to things that seem."

Morality and religion must be speeded up if they are to do any useful work in this swift world.

If the ideals of the saints and reformers were criticized, so were those of the scholars. Matthew
Arnold's definition of culture was that of a man of books. It was the knowledge of the best
that had been said and known in the past. Emerson's lines entitled "Culture" begin with a characteristic
question and end with an equally characteristic affirmation. The question is--

  "Can rules or tutors educate
   The semigod whom we await?"

According to this definition Abraham Lincoln, with his slight knowledge of the best things
of the past, but with the power to fuse such knowledge as he had and to recast it in his own
mould, was a man of culture. And all true Americans would agree with him.

Emerson, like the "sociable, accessible, republican sort of man" that he was, was the foe of
special privilege. The best things were, in his judgment, the property of all. He would take
religion from the custody of the priests, and culture from the hands of schoolmasters, and
restore them to their proper place, among the inalienable rights of man. They were simply forms
of the pursuit of happiness of which the Declaration of Independence speaks. It is a right
of which no potentates can justly deprive the citizen.

Above all, he would protest against everything which tends to deprive anyone of the happiness
of the forward look. There was a cheerful confidence that the great forces are on our side.

This is the American doctrine of "Manifest Destiny" spiritually discerned.

V

But one need not go so far back as Emerson to see the higher reaches of the American temperament.
Perhaps in no one have they been revealed with more distinctness than in William James. There
are those who consider it dispraise of a philosopher to suggest that his work has local color.
However that may be, William James thought as an American as certainly as Plato thought as
a Greek. His way of philosophizing was one that belonged to the land of his birth.

He was as distinctly American as was Daniel Boone. Daniel Boone was no renegade taking to the
woods that he might relapse into savagery. He was a civilized man who preferred to be the maker
of civilization rather than to be its victim. He preferred to blaze his own way through the
forest. When he saw the smoke of a neighbor's chimney it was time for him to move on. So William
James was led by instinct from the crowded highways to the dim border-lands of human experience.
He preferred to dwell in the debatable lands. With a quizzical smile he listened to the dignitaries
of philosophy. He found their completed systems too stuffy. He loved the wildernesses of thought
where shy wild things hide--half hopes, half realities. They are not quite true now,--but they
may be by and by.

As other men are interested in the actual, so he was interested in the possible. The possibilities
are not so highly finished as the facts that have been proved, but there are a great many more
of them, and they are much more important. There are more things in the unexplored forest than
in the clearing at its edge. Truth to him was not a field with metes and bounds. It was a continent
awaiting settlement. First the bold pathfinders must adventure into it. Its vast spaces were
infinitely inviting, its undeveloped resources were alluring. And not only did the path-finder
interest him but the path-loser as well. But for his heedless audacity the work of exploration
would languish. Was ever a philosopher so humorously tender to the intellectual vagabonds,
the waifs and strays of the spiritual world!

Their reports of vague meanderings in the border-land were listened to without scorn. They
might be ever so absent-minded and yet have stumbled upon something which wiser men had missed.
No one was more keen to criticize the hard-and-fast dogmas of the wise and prudent or more
willing to learn what might, by chance, have been revealed unto babes. The one thing he demanded
was space. His universe must not be finished or inclosed. After a rational system had been
formulated and declared to be the Whole, his first instinct was to get away from it. He was
sure that there must be more outside than there was inside. "The 'through-and-through' universe
seems to suffocate me with its infallible, impeccable all-pervasiveness. Its necessity with
no possibilities, its relations with no subjects, make me feel as if I had entered into a contract
with no reserved rights."

Formal philosophy seemed to him to be "too buttoned-up and white-chokered and clean-shaven
a thing to speak for the vast, slow-breathing, unconscious Kosmos with its dread abysses and
its unknown tides. The freedom we want is not the freedom, with a string tied to its leg and
warranted not to fly away, of that philosophy. Let it fly away, we say, from us. What then?"

To this American there must be a true democracy among the faculties of the mind. The logical
understanding must not be allowed to put on priggish airs. The feelings have their rights also.
"They may be as prophetic and as anticipatory of truth as anything else we have." There must
be give and take; "what hope is there of squaring and settling opinions unless Absolutism will
hold parley on this common ground and admit that all philosophies are hypotheses, to which
all our faculties, emotional as well as logical, help us, and the truest of which will in the
final integration of things be found in possession of the men whose faculties on the whole
had the best divining power?"

Do not those words give us a glimpse of the American mind in its natural working. Its genius
is anticipatory. It is searching for a common ground on which all may meet. It puts its trust
not in the thinker who can put his thoughts in the most neat form, but the man whose faculties
have on the whole the best divining power.

To listen to William James was to experience an illogical elation--and to feel justified in
it. He was an unsparing critic of things as they are, but his criticism left us in no mood
of depression. Our interest is with things as they are going to be. The universe is growing.
Let us grow with it.

THE UNACCUSTOMED EARS OF EUROPE

I

When, as a child, I learned the Westminster Catechism by heart I found the Ten Commandments
easy to remember. There was something straightforward in these prohibitions. Once started in
the right direction one could hardly stray from the path. But I stumbled over the question,
in regard to certain Commandments, "What are the reasons annexed?"

That a commandment should be committed to memory seemed just. I was prepared to submit to the
severest tests of verbal accuracy. But that there should be "reasons annexed," and that these
also should be remembered, seemed to my youthful understanding a grievance. It made the path
of the obedient hard. To this day there is a haziness about the "reasons" that contrasts with
the sharp outlines of the commandments.

I fancy that news-gatherers have the same experience. They are diligent in collecting items
of news and reporting them to the world, but it is a real hardship to them to have to give
any rational account of these bits of fact. They tell what is done in different parts of the
world, but they forget to mention "the moving why they did it." The consequence is that, in
this age of instantaneous communication, we know what is going on in other countries, but it
seems very irrational. The rational elements have been lost in the process of transmission.

There has, for example, been no lack of news cabled across the Atlantic in regard to the nominations
for President of the United States. The European reader is made aware that a great deal of
strong feeling has been evoked, and strong language used. When a picturesque term of reproach
has been hurled by one candidate at another it is promptly reported to a waiting world. But
the "reasons annexed" are calmly ignored. The consequence is that the reader is confirmed in
his exaggerated idea of the nervous irritability of the American people. There seems to be
a periodicity in their seizures. At intervals of four years they indulge in an orgy of mutual
recrimination, and then suddenly return to their normal state of money-getting. It is all very
unaccountable. Doubtless the most charitable explanation is the climate.

It was after giving prominence to an unusually vivid bit of political vituperation that a conservative
London newspaper remarked, "All this is characteristically American, but it shocks the unaccustomed
ears of Europe."

As I read the rebuke I felt positively ashamed of my country and its untutored ways. I pictured
Europe as a dignified lady of mature years listening to the screams issuing from her neighbor's
nursery. She had not been used to hearing naughty words called out in such a loud tone of voice.
Instead of discussing their grievances calmly, they were actually calling one another names.

It was therefore with a feeling of chastened humility that I turned to the columns devoted
to the more decorous doings of Europe. Here I should find examples worthy of consideration.
They are drawn from the homes of ancient civility. Would that our rude politicians might be
brought under these refining influences and learn how to behave!

But alas! When we drop in upon our neighbors, unannounced, things are sometimes not so tidy
as they are on the days "at home." The hostess is flustered and evidently has troubles of her
own. So, as ill-luck would have it, it is with Dame Europe's household. The visitor from across
the Atlantic is surprised at the obstreperousness of the more vigorous members of the family.
Evidently a great many interesting things are going on, but the standard of deportment is not high.

While the unaccustomed ears of Europe were shocked at the shrill cries from the rival conventions
at Chicago and Baltimore, there was equal turbulence in the Italian Parliament at Rome. There
were shouts and catcalls and every sign of uncontrollable violence. What are the "reasons annexed"
to all this uproar? I do not know. In Budapest such unparliamentary expressions as "swine,"
"liar," "thief," and "assassin" were freely used in debate. An honorable member who had been
expelled for the use of too strong language, returned to "shoot up" the House. The chairman,
after dodging three shots, declared that he must positively insist on better order.

In the German Reichstag a member threatens the Kaiser with the fate of Charles the First, if
he does not speedily mend his ways. He suggests as a fit Imperial residence the castle where
the Mad King of Bavaria was allowed to exercise his erratic energies without injury to the
commonweal. At the mention of Charles the First the chamber was in an uproar, and amid a tumult
of angry voices the session was brought to a close.

In Russia, unseemly clamor is kept from the carefully guarded ears of the Czar. There art conspires
with nature to produce peace. We read of the Czar's recent visit to his ancient capital: "The
police during the previous night made three thousand arrests. The Czar and Czarina drove through
the city amid the ringing of bells, and with banners flying."

On reading this item the American reader plucks up heart. If, during the Chicago convention,
the police had made three thousand arrests the sessions might have been as quiet as those of
the Duma.

Even the proceedings of the British House of Commons are disappointing to the pilgrim in search
of decorum. The Mother of Parliaments has trouble with her unruly brood.

We enter the sacred precincts as a Member rises to a point of order.

"I desire to ask your ruling, Mr. Speaker, as to whether the honorable gentleman is entitled
to allude to Members of the House as miscreants."

The Speaker: "I do not think the term 'miscreant' is a proper Parliamentary expression."

This is very elementary teaching, but it appears that Mr. Speaker is not infrequently compelled
to repeat his lesson. It is "line upon line and precept upon precept."

The records of the doings of the House contain episodes which would be considered exciting
in Arizona. We read: "For five minutes the Honorable George Lansbury defied the Speaker, insulted
the Prime Minister, and scorned the House of Commons. He raved in an ecstasy of passion; challenging,
taunting, and defying." The trouble began with a statement of Mr. Asquith's. "Then up jumped
Mr. Lansbury, his face contorted with passion, and his powerful rasping voice dominating the
whole House. Shouting and waving his arms, he approached the Government Front Bench with a
curious crouching gait, like a boxer leaving his corner in the ring. One or two Liberals on
the bench behind Mr. Asquith half rose, but the Prime Minister sat stolidly gazing above the
heads of the opposition, his arms folded, and his lips pursed. Mr. Lansbury had worked himself
up into a state of frenzy and, facing the Prime Minister, he shouted, 'You are beneath my contempt!
Call yourself a gentleman! You ought to be driven from public life.'"

I cannot remember any scene like this in Disraeli's novels. The House of Commons used to be
called the best club in Europe. But that, says the Conservative critic, was before the members
were paid.

II

But certain changes, like the increased cost of living, are going on everywhere. The fact seems
to be that all over the civilized world there is a noticeable falling-off in good manners in
public discussion. It is useless for one country to point the finger of scorn at another, or
to assume an air of injured politeness. It is more conducive to good understanding to join
in a general confession of sin. We are all miserable offenders, and there is little to choose
between us. The conventionalities which bind society together are like the patent glue we see
advertised on the streets. A plate has been broken and then joined together. The strength of
the adhesive substance is shown by the way it holds up a stone of considerable weight attached
to it. The plate thus mended holds together admirably till it is put in hot water.

I have no doubt but that a conservative Chinese gentleman would tell you that since the Republic
came in there has been a sad falling-off in the observance of the rules of propriety as laid
down by Confucius. The Conservative newspapers of England bewail the fact that there has been
a lamentable change since the present Government came in. The arch offender is "that political
Mahdi, Lloyd George, whose false prophecies have made deluded dervishes of hosts of British
workmen, and who has corrupted the manners of Parliament itself."

This wicked Mahdi, by his appeals to the passions of the populace, has destroyed the old English
reverence for Law.

I do not know what may be the cause, but the American visitor does notice that the English
attitude towards the laws of the realm is not so devout as he had been led to expect. We have
from our earliest youth been taught to believe that the law-abidingness of the Englishman was
innate and impeccable. It was not that, like the good man of whom the Psalmist speaks, he meditated
on the law day and night. He didn't need to. Decent respect for the law was in his blood. He
simply could not help conforming to it.

And this impression is confirmed by the things which the tourist goes to see. The stately mansions
embowered in green and guarded by immemorial oaks are accepted as symbolic of an ordered life.
The multitudinous rooks suggest security which comes from triumphant legality. No irresponsible
person shoots them. When one enters a cathedral close he feels that he is in a land that frowns
on the crudity of change. Here everything is a "thousand years the same." And how decent is
the demeanor of a verger!

When the pilgrim from Kansas arrives at an ancient English inn he feels that he must be on
his good behavior. Boots in his green apron is a lesson to him. He is not like a Western hotel
bell-boy on the way to becoming something else. He knows his place. Everybody, he imagines,
in this country knows his place, and there is no unseemly crowding and pushing. And what stronger
proof can there be that this is a land where law is reverenced than the demeanor of a London
policeman. There is no truculence about him, no show of physical force. He is so mild-eyed
and soft of speech that one feels that he has been shielded from rude contact with the world.
He represents the Law in a land where law is sacred. He is instinctively obeyed. He has but
to wave his hand and traffic stops.

When the traveler is told that in the vicinity of the House of Commons traffic is stopped to
allow a Member to cross the street, his admiration increases. Fancy a Congressman being treated
with such respect! But the argument which, on the whole, makes the deepest impression is the
deferential manners of the tradesmen with their habit of saying, "Thank you," apropos of nothing
at all. It seems an indication of perpetual gratitude over the fact that things are as they are.

But when one comes to listen to the talk of the day one is surprised to find a surprising lack
of docility. I doubt whether the Englishman has the veneration for the abstract idea of Law
which is common among Americans. Indeed, he is accustomed to treat most abstractions with scant
courtesy. There is nothing quite corresponding to the average American's feeling about a decision
of the Supreme Court. The Law has spoken, let all the land keep silent. It seems like treason
to criticize it, like anarchy to defy it.

Tennyson's words about "reverence for the laws ourselves have made" needs to be interpreted
by English history. It is a peculiar kind of reverence and has many limitations. A good deal
depends on what is meant by "ourselves." An act of Parliament does not at once become an object
of reverence by the members of the opposition party. It was not, they feel, made by them, it
was made by a Government which was violently opposed to them and which was bent on ruining
the country.

It is only after a sufficient time has elapsed to allow for the partisan origin to be forgotten,
and for it to become assimilated to the habits of thought and manner of life of the people
that it is deeply respected. The English reverence is not for statute law, but for the common
law which is the slow accretion of ages. A new enactment is treated like the new boy at school.
He must submit to a period of severe hazing before he is given a place of any honor.

To the American when an act of Congress has been declared constitutional, a decent respect
for the opinion of mankind seems to suggest that verbal criticism should cease. The council
of perfection is that the law should be obeyed till such time as it can be repealed or explained
away. If it should become a dead letter, propriety would demand that no evil should be spoken
of it. Since the days of Andrew Jackson the word "nullification" has had an ugly and dangerous
sound.

But to the Englishman this attitude seems somewhat superstitious. The period of opposition
to a measure is not ended when it has passed Parliament and received the royal assent. The
question is whether it will receive the assent of the people. Can it get itself obeyed? If
it can, then its future is assured for many generations. But it must pass through an exciting
period of probation.

If it is a matter that arouses much feeling the British way is for some one to disobey and
take the consequences. Passive resistance--with such active measures as may make the life of
the enforcers of the law a burden to them--is a recognized method of political and religious
propagandism.

In periods when the national life has run most swiftly this kind of resistance to what has
been considered the tyranny of lawmakers has always been notable. Emerson's "the chambers of
the great are jails" was literally true of the England of the seventeenth century. Every one
who made any pretension to moral leadership was intent on going to jail in behalf of some principle
or another.

John Bunyan goes to jail rather than attend the parish church, George Fox goes to jail rather
than take off his hat in the presence of the magistrate. Why should he do so when there was
no Scripture for it? When it was said that the Scripture had nothing to say about hats, he
was ready with his triumphant reference to Daniel III, 21, where it is said that the three
Hebrew children wore "their coats, their hosen, their hats and their other garments" in the
fiery furnace. If Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego wore their hats before Nebuchadnezzar and
kept them on even in the fiery furnace, why should a free-born Englishman take his hat off
in the presence of a petty Justice of the Peace? Fervent Fifth Monarchy men were willing to
die rather than acknowledge any king but King Jesus who was about to come to reign. Non-juring
bishops were willing to go to jail rather than submit to the judgment of Parliament as to who
should be king in England. Puritans and Covenanters of the more logical sort refused to accept
toleration unless it were offered on their own terms. They had been a "persecuted remnant"
and they proposed to remain such or know the reason why.

Beneath his crust of conformity the Briton has an admiration for these recalcitrant individuals
who will neither bow the knee to Baal nor to his betters. He likes a man who is a law unto
himself. Though he has little enthusiasm for the abstract "rights of man," he is a great believer
in "the liberty of prophesying." The prophet is not without honor, even while he is being stoned.

Just at this time things are moving almost as rapidly as they did in the seventeenth century.
There is the same clash of opinion and violence of party spirit. All sorts of non-conformities
struggle for a hearing. One is reminded of that most stirring period, which is so delightful
to read about, and which must have been so trying for quiet people to live through.

A host of earnest and wide-awake persons are engaged in the task of doing what they are told
not to do. Their enthusiasm takes the form of resistance to some statute made or proposed.

The conscientious women who throw stones through shop windows, and lay violent hands on cabinet
ministers, do so, avowedly, to bring certain laws into disrepute. They go on hunger-strikes,
not in order to be released from prison, but in order to be treated as political prisoners.
They insist that their methods should be recognized as acts of legitimate warfare. They may
be extreme in their actions, but they are not alone in their theory.

The Insurance Law, by which all workers whose wages are below a certain sum are compulsorily
insured against sickness and the losses that follow it, is just going into effect. Its provisions
are necessarily complicated, and its administration must at first be difficult. The Insurance-Law
Resisters are organized to nullify the act. Its enormities are held up before all eyes, and
it is flouted in every possible way. According to this law, a lady is compelled to pay three-pence
a week toward the insurance fund for each servant in her employ. Will she pay that three-pence?
No! Though twenty acts of Parliament should declare that it must be done, she will resist.
As for keeping accounts, and putting stamps in a book, she will do nothing of the kind. What
is it about a stamp act that arouses such fierceness of resistance?

High-born ladies declare that they would rather go to jail than obey such a law. At a meeting
at Albert Hall the Resisters were addressed by a duchess who was "supported by a man-servant."
What can a mere Act of Parliament do when confronted by such a combination as that? Passive
resistance takes on heroic proportions when a duchess and a man-servant confront the Law with
haughty immobility.

In the mean time, Mr. Tom Mann goes to jail, amid the applause of organized labor, for advising
the British soldier not to obey orders when he is commanded to fire on British working-men.

Mr. Tom Mann is a labor agitator, while Mr. Bonar Law is the leader of the Conservative party;
but when it comes to legislation which he does not like, Mr. Bonar Law's language is fully
as incendiary. He is not content with opposing the Irish Home Rule Bill: he gives notice that
when it has become a law the opposition will be continued in a more serious form. The passage
of the bill, he declares, will be the signal for civil war. Ulster will fight. Parliament may
pass the Home Rule Bill, but when it does so its troubles will have just begun. Where will
it find the troops to coerce the province?

One of the most distinguished Unionist Members of Parliament, addressing a great meeting at
Belfast says, "You are sometimes asked whether you propose to resist the English army? I reply
that even if this Government had the wickedness (which, on the whole, I believe), it is wholly
lacking in the nerve required to give an order which in my deliberate judgment would shatter
for years the civilization of these islands." If the Government does not have the nerve to
employ its troops, "It will be for the moon-lighters and the cattle-maimers to conquer Ulster
themselves, and it will be for you to show whether you are worse men, or your enemies better
men, than the forefathers of you both. But I note with satisfaction that you are preparing
yourselves by the practice of exercises, and by the submission to discipline, for the struggle
which is not unlikely to test your determination. The Nationalists are determined to rule you.
You are determined not to be ruled. A collision of wills so sharp may well defy the resources
of a peaceful solution.... On this we are agreed, that the crisis has called into existence
one of those supreme issues of conscience amid which the ordinary landmarks of permissible
resistance to technical law are submerged."

When one goes to the Church to escape from these sharp antagonisms, he is confronted with huge
placards giving notice of meetings to protest against "The Robbery of God." The robber in this
case is the Government, which proposes to disendow, as well as disestablish, the Church in
Wales. Noble lords denounce the outrage. Mr. Lloyd George replies by reminding their lordships
that their landed estates were, before the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII,
Church property. If they wish to make restitution of the spoil which their ancestors took,
well and good. But let them not talk about the robbery of God, while their hands are "dripping
with the fat of sacrilege."

The retort is effective, but it does not make Mr. Lloyd George beloved by the people to whom
it is addressed. Twitting on facts has always been considered unmannerly.

III

When we hear the acrimonious discussions and the threats of violence, it is well to consider
the reason for it all. I think the reason is one that is not discreditable to those concerned.
These are not ordinary times, and they are not to be judged by ordinary standards. England
is at the present time passing through a revolution, the issues of which are still in doubt.
Revolutionary passions have been liberated by the rapid course of events. "Every battle of
the warrior is with confused noise." The confused noise may be disagreeable to persons of sensitive
nerves, but it is a part of the situation.

When we consider the nature of the changes that have been made in the last few years, and the
magnitude of those which are proposed, we do not wonder at the tone of exasperation which is
common to all parties.

It is seldom that a constitutional change, like that which deprived the House of Lords of powers
exercised for a thousand years, has been made without an appeal to arms. But there was no civil
war. Perhaps the old fashion of sturdy blows would have been less trying to the temper.

A revolution is at the best an unmannerly proceeding. It cannot be carried on politely, because
it involves not so much a change of ideas and methods as a change of masters. A change of ideas
may be discussed in an amiable and orderly way. The honorable gentlemen who have the responsibility
for the decision are respectfully asked to revise their opinions in the light of new evidence
which, by their leave, will be presented.

But a change of masters cannot be managed so inoffensively. The honorable gentlemen are not
asked to revise their opinions. They are told that their opinions are no longer important.
The matter is severely personal. The statement is not, "We do not believe in your ideas"; it
is, "We do not believe in you."

When political discussion takes this turn, then there is an end to the amenities suited to
a more quiet time. It is no longer a question as to which is the better cause, but as to which
is the better man.

Mr. Asquith, who has retained in this revolutionary period the manners of the old school, recently
said in his reply to a delegation of his opponents, "When people are on opposite sides of a
chasm they may be courteous to one another, and regret the impossibility of their shaking hands,
or doing more than wave a courteous gesture across so wide a space."

These are the words of a gentleman in politics, and express a beautiful ideal. But they hardly
describe the present situation. As to waving a courteous salutation to the people on the other
side,--that depends on who the people are. If you know them and have been long familiar with
their good qualities, the courteous salutation is natural. They are, as you know, much better
than their opinions.

But it is different when they are people whom you do not know, and with whom you have nothing
in common. You suspect their motives, and feel a contempt for their abilities. They are not
of your set. The word "gentleman" is derived from the word gens. People of the same gens learn
to treat each other in a considerate way. Even when they differ they remember what is due to
gentle blood and gentle training.

It is quite evident that the challenge of the new democracy to the old ruling classes has everywhere
produced exasperation. It is no longer easy to wave courteous salutations across the chasms
which divide parties. Political discussion takes a rude turn. It is no longer possible to preserve
the proprieties. We may expect the minor moralities to suffer while the major moralities are
being determined by hard knocks.

Good manners depend on the tacit understanding of all parties as to their relations to one
another. Nothing can be more brutal than for one to claim superiority, or more rude than for
another to dispute the claim. Such differences of station should, if they exist, be taken for
granted.

Relations which were established by force may, after a time, be made so beautiful that their
origin is forgotten. There must be no display of unnecessary force. The battle having been
decided, victor and vanquished change parts. It pleases the conqueror to sign himself, "Your
obedient servant," and to inquire whether certain terms would be agreeable. Of course they
would be agreeable. So says the disarmed man looking upward to his late foe, now become his
protector.

And the conqueror with grave good will takes up the burden which Providence has imposed upon
him. Is not the motto of the true knight, Ich dien? Such service as he can render shall be
given ungrudgingly.

Now, this is not hypocrisy. It may be Christianity and Chivalry and all sorts of fine things.
It is making the best of an accepted situation. When relations which were established by force
have been sanctioned by custom, and embodied in law, and sanctified by religion, they form
a soil in which many pleasant things may grow. In the vicinity of Vesuvius they will tell you
that the best soils are of volcanic origin.

Hodge and Sir Lionel meet in the garden which one owns, and in which the other digs with the
sweat of his brow. There is kindly interest on the one hand, and decent respect on the other.
But all this sense of ordered righteousness is dependent on one condition. Neither must eat
of the fruit of the tree of knowledge that grows in the midst of the garden. A little knowledge
is dangerous, a good deal of knowledge may be even more dangerous, to the relations which custom
has established.

What right has Sir Lionel to lay down the law for Hodge? Why should not Hodge have a right
to have his point of view considered? When Hodge begins seriously to ponder this question his
manners suffer. And when Sir Lionel begins to assert his superiority, instead of taking it
for granted, his behavior lacks its easy charm. It is very hard to explain such things in a
gentlemanly way.

Now, the exasperation in the tone of political discussion in Great Britain, as elsewhere in
the world, is largely explained by the fact that all sorts of superiorities have been challenged
at the same time. Everywhere the issue is sharply made. "Who shall rule?"

Shall Ireland any longer submit to be ruled by the English? The Irish Nationalists swear by
all the saints that, rather than submit, they will overthrow the present Government and return
to their former methods of agitation.

If the Home Rule Bill be enacted into law, will Ulster submit to be ruled by a Catholic majority?
The men of Ulster call upon the spirits of their heroic sires, who triumphed at the Boyne,
to bear witness that they will never yield.

Will the masses of the people submit any longer to the existing inequalities in political representation?
No! They demand immediate recognition of the principle, "One man, one vote." The many will
not allow the few to make laws for them.

Will the women of England kindly wait a little till their demands can be considered in a dignified
way? No! They will not take their place in the waiting-line. Others get what they want by pushing;
so will they.

Will the Labor party be a little less noisy and insistent in its demands? All will come in
time, but one Reform must say to another, "After you." Hoarse voices cry, "We care nothing
for etiquette, we must have what we demand, and have it at once. We cannot stand still. If
we are pushing, we are also pushed from behind. If you do not give us what we ask for, the
Socialists and the Syndicalists will be upon you." There is always the threat of a General
Strike. Laborers have hitherto been starved into submission. But two can play at that game.

IV

This is not the England of Sir Roger de Coverley with its cheerful contentment with the actual,
and its deference for all sorts of dignitaries. It is not, in its present temper, a model of
propriety. But, in my judgment, it is all the more interesting, and full of hope. To say that
England is in the midst of a revolution is not to say that some dreadful disaster is impending.
It only means that this is a time when events move very rapidly, and when precedents count
for little. But it is a time when common sense and courage and energy count for a great deal;
and there is no evidence that these qualities are lacking. I suspect that the alarmists are
not so alarmed as their language would lead us to suppose. They know their countrymen, and
that they have the good sense to avoid most of the collisions that they declare to be inevitable.

I take comfort in the philosophy which I glean from the top of a London motor-bus. From my
point of vantage I look down upon pedestrian humanity as a Superman might look down upon it.
It seems to consist of a vast multitude of ignorant folk who are predestined to immediate annihilation.
As the ungainly machine on which I am seated rushes down the street, it seems admirably adapted
for its mission of destruction. The barricade in front of me, devoted to the praise of BOVRIL,
is just high enough to prevent my seeing what actually happens, but it gives a bloodcurdling
view of catastrophes that are imminent. I have an impression of a procession of innocent victims
rushing heedlessly upon destruction. Three yards in front of the onrushing wheels is an old
gentleman crossing the street. He suddenly stops. There is, humanly speaking, no hope for him.
Two nursemaids appear in the field of danger. A butcher's boy on a bicycle steers directly
for the bus. He may be given up for lost. I am not able to see what becomes of them, but I
am prepared for the worst. Still the expected crunch does not come, and the bus goes on.

Between Notting Hill Gate and Charing Cross I have seen eighteen persons disappear in this
mysterious fashion. I could swear that when I last saw them it seemed too late for them to
escape their doom.

But on sober reflection I come to the conclusion that I should have taken a more hopeful view
if I had not been so high up; if, for example, I had been sitting with the driver where I could
have seen what happened at the last moment.

There was much comfort in the old couplet:--

  "Betwixt the saddle and the ground,
  He mercy sought and mercy found."

And betwixt the pedestrian and the motor-bus, there are many chances of safety that I could
not foresee. The old gentleman was perhaps more spry than he looked. The nursemaids and the
butcher's boy must assuredly have perished unless they happened to have their wits about them.
But in all probability they did have their wits about them, and so did the driver of the motor-bus.

THE TORYISM OF TRAVELERS

I

When we think of a thorough-going conservative we are likely to picture him as a stay-at-home
person, a barnacle fastened to one spot. We take for granted that aversion to locomotion and
aversion to change are the same thing. But in thinking thus we leave out of account the inherent
instability of human nature. Everybody likes a little change now and then. If a person cannot
get it in one way, he gets it in another. The stay-at-home gratifies his wandering fancy by
making little alterations in his too-familiar surroundings. Even the Vicar of Wakefield in
the days of his placid prosperity would occasionally migrate from the blue bed to the brown.
A life that had such vicissitudes could not be called uneventful.

When you read the weekly newspaper published in the quietest hill-town in Vermont, you become
aware that a great deal is going on. Deacon Pratt shingled his barn last week. Miss Maria Jones
had new shutters put on her house, and it is a great improvement. These revolutions in Goshenville
are matters of keen interest to those concerned. They furnish inexhaustible material for conversation.

The true enemy to innovation is the traveler who sets out to see historic lands. His natural
love of change is satiated by rapid change of locality. But his natural conservatism asserts
itself in his insistence that the places which he visits shall be true to their own reputations.
Having journeyed, at considerable expense, to a celebrated spot, he wants to see the thing
it was celebrated for, and he will accept no substitute. From his point of view the present
inhabitants are merely caretakers who should not be allowed to disturb the remains intrusted
to their custody. Everything must be kept as it used to be.

The moment any one packs his trunk and puts money in his purse to visit lands old in story
he becomes a hopeless reactionary. He is sallying forth to see things not as they are, but
as they were "once upon a time." He is attracted to certain localities by something which happened
long ago. A great many things may have happened since, but these must be put out of the way.
One period of time must be preserved to satisfy his romantic imagination. He loves the good
old ways, and he has a curiosity to see the bad old ways that may still be preserved. It is
only the modern that offends him.

The American who, in his own country, is in feverish haste to improve conditions, when he sets
foot in Europe becomes the fanatical foe to progress. The Old World, in his judgment, ought
to look old. He longs to hear the clatter of wooden shoes. If he had his way he would have
laws enacted forbidding peasant folk to change their ancient costumes. He would preserve every
relic of feudalism. He bitterly laments the division of great estates. A nobleman's park with
its beautiful idle acres, its deer, its pheasants, and its scurrying rabbits, is so much more
pleasant to look at than a succession of market-gardens. Poachers, game-keepers, and squires
are alike interesting, if only they would dress so that he could know them apart. He is enchanted
with thatched cottages which look damp and picturesque. He detests the model dwellings which
are built with a too obvious regard for sanitation. He seeks narrow and ill-smelling streets
where the houses nod at each other, as if in the last stages of senility, muttering mysterious
reminiscences of old tragedies. He frequents scenes of ancient murders, and places where bandits
once did congregate. He leaves the railway carriage, to cross a heath where romantic highwaymen
used to ask the traveler to stand and deliver. He is indignant to find electric lights and
policemen. A heath ought to be lonely, and fens ought to be preserved from drainage.

He seeks dungeons and instruments of torture. The dungeons must be underground, and only a
single ray of light must penetrate. He is much troubled to find that the dungeon in the Castle
of Chillon is much more cheerful than he had supposed it was. The Bridge of Sighs in Venice
disappoints him in the same way. Indeed, there are few places mentioned by Lord Byron that
are as gloomy as they are in the poetical description.

The traveler is very insistent in his plea for the preservation of battlefields. Now, Europe
is very rich in battlefields, many of the most fertile sections having been fought over many
times. But the ravages of agriculture are everywhere seen. There is no such leveler as the
ploughman. Often when one has come to refresh his mind with the events of one terrible day,
he finds that there is nothing whatever to remind him of what happened. For centuries there
has been ploughing and harvesting. Nature takes so kindly to these peaceful pursuits that one
is tempted to think of the battle as merely an episode.

Commerce is almost as destructive. Cities that have been noted for their sieges often turn
out to be surprisingly prosperous. The old walls are torn down to give way to parks and boulevards.
Massacres which in their day were noted leave no trace behind. One can get more of an idea
of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Eve by reading a book by one's fireside than by going
to Paris. For all one can see there, there might have been no such accident.

Moral considerations have little place in the traveler's mind. The progressive ameliorations
that have taken place tend to obscure our sense of the old conflicts. A reform once accomplished
becomes a part of our ordinary consciousness. We take it for granted, and find it hard to understand
what the reformer was so excited about.

As a consequence, the chief object of an historical pilgrimage is to discover some place where
the old conditions have not been improved away. The religious pilgrim does not expect to find
the old prophets, but he has a pious hope of finding the abuses which the prophets denounced.

I have in mind a clergyman who, in his own home, is progressive to a fault. He is impatient
of any delay. He is all the time seeking out the very latest inventions in social and economic
reforms. But several years ago he made a journey to the Holy Land, and when he came back he
delivered a lecture on his experiences. A more reactionary attitude could not be imagined.
Not a word did he say about the progress of education or civil-service reform in Palestine.
There was not a sympathetic reference to sanitation or good roads. The rights of women were
not mentioned. Representative government seemed to be an abomination to him. All his enthusiasm
was for the other side. He was for Oriental conservatism in all its forms. He was for preserving
every survival of ancient custom. He told of the delight with which he watched the laborious
efforts of the peasants ploughing with a forked stick. He believed that there had not been
a single improvement in agriculture since the days of Abraham.

The economic condition of the people had not changed for the better since patriarchal times,
and one could still have a good idea of a famine such as sent the brothers of Joseph down into
Egypt. Turkish misgovernment furnished him with a much clearer idea of the publicans, and the
hatred they aroused in the minds of the people, than he had ever hoped to obtain. In fact,
one could hardly appreciate the term "publicans and sinners" without seeing the Oriental tax-gatherers.
He was very fortunate in being able to visit several villages which had been impoverished by
their exactions. The rate of wages throws much light on the Sunday-School lessons. A penny
a day does not seem such an insufficient minimum wage to a traveler, as it does to a stay-at-home
person. On going down from Jerusalem to Jericho he fell among thieves, or at least among a
group of thievish-looking Bedouins who gave him a new appreciation of the parable of the Samaritan.
It was a wonderful experience. And he found that the animosity between the Jews and the Samaritans
had not abated. To be sure, there are very few Samaritans left, and those few are thoroughly
despised.

The good-roads movement has not yet invaded Palestine, and we can still experience all the
discomforts of the earlier times.

To most people Shamgar is a mere name. But after you have walked for hours over those rocky
by-ways, never knowing at what moment you may be attacked by a treacherous robber, you know
how Shamgar felt. He becomes a real person. You are carried back into the days when "there
was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes."

The railway between Joppa and Jerusalem is to be regretted, but fortunately it is a small affair.
There are rumors of commercial enterprises which, if successful, would change the appearance
of many of the towns. Fortunately they are not likely to be successful, at least in our day.
The brooding spirit of the East can be trusted to defend itself against the innovating West.
For the present, at least, Palestine is a fascinating country to travel in.

A traveler in Ceylon and India writes to a religious paper of his journey. He says, "Colombo
has little to interest the tourist, yet it is a fine city." One who reads between the lines
understands that the fact that it is a fine city is the cause of its uninterestingness. His
impression of Madura was more satisfactory. There one can see the Juggernaut car drawn through
the streets by a thousand men, though it is reluctantly admitted that the self-immolation of
fanatics under the wheels is no longer allowed. "The Shiva temple at Madura is the more interesting
as its towers are ornamented with six thousand idols."

The writer who rejoiced at the sight of six thousand idols in Madura, would have been shocked
at the exhibition of a single crucifix in his meeting-house at home.

I confess that I have not been able to overcome the Tory prejudice in favor of vested interests
in historical places. If one has traveled to see "the old paths which wicked men have trodden,"
it is a disappointment to find that they are not there. I had such an experience in Capri.
We had wandered through the vineyards and up the steep, rocky way to the Villa of Tiberius.
On the top of the cliff are the ruins of the pleasure-house which the Emperor in his wicked
old age built for himself. Was there ever a greater contrast between an earthly paradise and
abounding sinfulness? Here, indeed, was "spiritual wickedness in high places." The marvelously
blue sea and all the glories of the Bay of Naples ought to have made Tiberius a better man;
but apparently they didn't. We were prepared for the thrilling moment when we were led to the
edge of the cliff, and told to look down. Here was the very place where Tiberius amused himself
by throwing his slaves into the sea to feed the fishes. Cruel old monster! But it was a long
time ago. Time had marvelously softened the atrocity of the act, and heightened its picturesque
character. If Tiberius must exhibit his colossal inhumanity, could he have anywhere in all
the world chosen a better spot? Just think of his coming to this island and, on this high cliff
above the azure sea, building this palace! And then to think of him on a night when the moon
was full, and the nightingales were singing, coming out and hurling a shuddering slave into
the abyss!

When we returned to the hotel, our friend the Professor, who had made a study of the subject,
informed us that it was all a mistake. The stories of the wicked doings of Tiberius in Capri
were malicious slanders. The Emperor was an elderly invalid living in dignified retirement.
As for the slaves, we might set our minds at rest in regard to them. If any of them fell over
the cliff it was pure accident. We must give up the idea that the invalid Emperor pushed them off.

All this was reassuring to my better nature, and yet I cherished a grudge against the Professor.
For it was a stiff climb to the Villa of Tiberius, and I wanted something to show for it. It
was difficult to adjust one's mind to the fact that nothing had happened there which might
not have happened in any well-conducted country house.

I like to contrast this with our experience in Algiers. We knew beforehand what Algiers was
like in the days of its prime. It had been the nest of as desperate pirates as ever infested
the seas. For generations innocent Christians had been carried hither to pine in doleful captivity.
But the French, we understood, had built a miniature Paris in the vicinity and were practicing
liberty, fraternity, and equality on the spot dedicated to gloomily romantic memories. We feared
the effect of this civilization. We had our misgivings. Perhaps Algiers might be no longer
worth visiting.

Luckily our steamer was delayed till sunset. We were carefully shepherded, so that we hardly
noticed the French city. We were hurried through the darkness into old Algiers. Everything
was full of sinister suggestion. The streets were as narrow and perilous as any which Haroun
Al Raschid explored on his more perilous nights. Here one could believe the worst of his fellow
men. Suspicion and revenge were in the air. We were not taking a stroll, we were escaping from
something. Mysterious muffled figures glided by and disappeared through slits in the walls.
There were dark corners so suggestive of homicide that one could hardly think that any one
with an Oriental disposition could resist the temptation. In crypt-like recesses we could see
assassins sharpening their daggers or, perhaps, executioners putting the finishing touches
on their scimitars. There were cavernous rooms where conspirators were crouched round a tiny
charcoal fire. Groups of truculent young Arabs followed us shouting objurgations, and accepting
small coins as ransom. We had glimpses of a mosque, the outside of a prison, and the inside
of what once was a harem. On returning to the steamer one gentleman fell overboard and, swimming
to the shore, was rescued by a swarthy ruffian who robbed him of his watch and disappeared
in the darkness. When the victim of Algerian piracy stood on the deck, dripping and indignant,
and told his tale of woe, we were delighted. Algiers would always be something to remember.
It was one of the places that had not been spoiled.

I am afraid that the sunlight might have brought disillusion. Some of the stealthy figures
which gave rise to such thrilling suspicions may have turned out to be excellent fathers and
husbands returning from business. As it is, thanks to the darkness, Algiers remains a city
of vague atrocities. It does not belong to the commonplace world; it is of such stuff as dreams,
including nightmares, are made of.

It is not without some compunction of conscience that I recall two historical pilgrimages,
one to Assisi, the other to Geneva. Assisi I found altogether rewarding, while in Geneva I
was disappointed. In each case my object was purely selfish, and had nothing in common with
the welfare of the present inhabitants. I wanted to see the city of St. Francis and the city
of John Calvin.

In Assisi one may read again the Franciscan legends in their proper settings. I should like
to think that my pleasure in Assisi arose from the fact that I saw some one there who reminded
me of St. Francis. But I was not so fortunate. If one is anxious to come in contact with the
spirit of St. Francis, freed from its mediæval limitations, a visit to Hull House, Chicago,
would be more rewarding.

But it was not the spirit of St. Francis, but his limitations, that we were after. Assisi has
preserved them all. We see the gray old town on the hillside, the narrow streets, the old walls.
We are beset by swarms of beggars. They are not like the half-starved creatures one may see
in the slums of northern cities. They are very likable. They are natural worshipers of my Lady
Poverty. They have not been spoiled by commonplace industrialism or scientific philanthropy.
One is taken back into the days when there was a natural affinity between saints and beggars.
The saints would joyously give away all that they had, and the beggars would as joyously accept
it. After the beggars had used up all the saints had given them, the saints would go out and
beg for more. The community, you say, would be none the better. Perhaps not. But the moment
you begin to talk about the community you introduce ideas that are modern and disturbing. One
thing is certain, and that is that if Assisi were more thrifty, it would be less illuminating
historically.

St. Francis might come back to Assisi and take up his work as he left it. But I sought in vain
for John Calvin in Geneva. The city was too prosperous and gay. The cheerful houses, the streets
with their cosmopolitan crowds, the parks, the schools, the university, the little boats skimming
over the lake, all bore witness to the well-being of to-day. But what of yesterday? The citizens
were celebrating the anniversary of Jean Jacques Rousseau. I realized that it was not yesterday
but the day before yesterday that I was seeking. Where was the stern little city which Calvin
taught and ruled? The place that knew him knows him no more.

Disappointed in my search for Calvin, I sought compensation in Servetus. I found the stone
placed by modern Calvinists to mark the spot where the Spanish heretic was burned. On it they
had carved an inscription expressing their regret for the act of intolerance on the part of
the reformer, and attributing the blame to the age in which he lived. But even this did not
satisfy modern Geneva. The inscription had been chipped away in order to give place I was told,
to something more historically accurate.

But whether Calvin was to blame, or the sixteenth century, did not seem to matter. The spot
was so beautiful that it seemed impossible that anything tragical could ever have happened
here. A youth and maiden were sitting by the stone, engaged in a most absorbing conversation.
Of one thing I was certain, that the theological differences between Calvin and Servetus were
nothing to them. They had something more important to think about--at least for them.

II

After a time one comes to have a certain modesty of expectation. Time and Space are different
elements, and each has its own laws. At the price of a steamship ticket one may be transported
to another country, but safe passage to another age is not guaranteed. It is enough if some
slight suggestion is given to the imagination. A walk through a pleasant neighborhood is all
the pleasanter if one knows that something memorable has happened there. If one is wise he
will not attempt to realize it to the exclusion of the present scene. It is enough to have
a slight flavor of historicity.

It was this pleasure which I enjoyed in a ramble with a friend through the New Forest. The
day was fine, and it would have been a joy to be under the greenwood trees if no one had been
before us. But the New Forest had a human interest; for on such a day as this, William Rufus
rode into it to hunt the red deer, and was found with an arrow through his body. And to this
day no man knows who killed William Rufus, or why. Though, of course, some people have their
suspicions.

Many other things may have happened in the New Forest in the centuries that have passed, but
they have never been brought vividly to my attention. So far as I was concerned there were
no confusing incidents. The Muse of History told one tragic tale and then was silent.

On the other side of the Forest was the Rufus stone marking the spot where the Red King's body
was found. At Brockenhurst we inquired the way, which we carefully avoided. The road itself
was an innovation, and was infested with motor-cars, machines unknown to the Normans. The Red
King had plunged into the Forest and quickly lost himself; so would we. There were great oaks
and wide-spreading beeches and green glades such as one finds only in England. It was pleasant
to feel that it all belonged to the Crown. I could not imagine a county council allowing this
great stretch of country to remain in its unspoiled beauty through these centuries.

We took our frugal lunch under a tree that had looked down on many generations. Then we wandered
on through a green wilderness. We saw no one but some women gathering fagots. I was glad to
see that they were exercising their ancestral rights in the royal domain. They looked contented,
though I should have preferred to have their dress more antique.

All day we followed William Rufus through the Forest. I began to feel that I had a real acquaintance
with him, having passed through much the same experience. The forest glades have been little
changed since the day when he hunted the red deer. Nature is the true conservative, and repeats
herself incessantly.

Toward evening my friend pointed out the hill at the foot of which was the Rufus stone. It
was still some two miles away. Should we push on to it?

What should we see when we got there? The stone was not much. There was a railing round it
as a protection against relic-hunters. And there was an inscription which, of course, was comparatively
modern. That settled it. We would not go to the stone with its modern inscription. The ancient
trees brought us much nearer to William Rufus. Besides, there was just time, if we walked briskly,
to catch the train at Brockenhurst.

III

A week which stands out in my memory as one of perfect communion with the past was spent with
another English friend in Llanthony Abbey, in the Vale of Ewyas, in the Black Mountains of
Wales. We had gone prepared for camping with a tent of ethereal lightness, which was to protect
us from the weather.

For the first night we were to tarry amid the ruins of the twelfth-century abbey, some parts
of which had been roofed over and used as an inn. When we arrived, the rain was falling in
torrents. Soon after supper we took our candles and climbed the winding stone stairs to our
rooms in the tower. The stones were uneven and worn by generations of pious feet. Outside we
could see the ruined nave of the church, with all the surrounding buildings. We were in another
age.

Had the sun shined next morning we should have gone on our gypsy journey, and Llanthony Abbey
would have been only an incident. But for five days and five nights the rain descended. We
could make valiant sallies, but were driven back for shelter. Shut in by "the tumultuous privacy
of storm," one felt a sense of ownership. Only one book could be obtained, the "Life and Letters"
of Walter Savage Landor. I had always wanted to know more of Landor and here was the opportunity.

A little over a hundred years ago he came to the vale of Ewyas and bought this estate, and
hither he brought his young bride. They occupied our rooms, it appeared. In 1809, Landor writes
to Southey, "I am about to do what no man hath ever done in England, plant a wood of cedars
of Lebanon. These trees will look magnificent on the mountains of Llanthony." He planted a
million of them, so he said. How eloquently he growled over those trees! He prophesied that
none of them would live.

After reading, I donned my raincoat and started out through the driving storm to see how Landor's
trees were getting on. It seemed that it was only yesterday that they were planted. It was
worth going out to see what had become of them. They were all gone. I felt that secret satisfaction
which all right-minded persons feel on being witnesses to the fulfilment of prophecy.

And then there was the house which Landor started to build when he and his wife were living
in our tower. "I hope," he writes, "before the close not of the next but of the succeeding
summer, to have one room to sit in with two or three bedrooms." Then he begins to growl about
the weather and the carpenters. After a while he writes again of the house: "It's not half
finished and has cost me two thousand pounds. I think seriously of filling it with straw and
setting fire to it. Never was anything half so ugly."

I inquired about the house and was told that it was not far away on the hillside, and was yet
unfinished. I was pleased with this, and meant to go up and see it when the spell of bad weather
of which Landor complained had passed by.

Beside Landor there was only one other historic association which one could enjoy without getting
drenched--that was St. David. In wading across the barnyard, I encountered "Boots," an intelligent
young man though unduly respectful. He informed me that the old building just across from the
stable was the cell of St. David.

I was not prepared for this. All I knew was that St. David was the patron saint of Wales and
had a cathedral and a number of other churches dedicated to him. Without too grossly admitting
my ignorance, I tried to draw out from my mentor some further biographical facts that my imagination
might work on during my stay. He thought that St. David was some relation to King Arthur, but
just what the relation was, and whether he was only a relative by marriage, he didn't know.
It wasn't very much information, but I was profoundly grateful to him.

I have since read a long article on St. David in the "Cambrian Plutarch." The author goes into
the question of the family relations between King Arthur and St. David with great thoroughness,
but what conclusion he comes to is not quite evident. He thinks that the people are wrong who
say that St. David was a nephew, because he was fifty years older than Arthur. That would make
him more likely his uncle. But as he admits that King Arthur may possibly be another name for
the constellation Ursa Major, it is difficult to fix the dates exactly. At any rate, the "Cambrian
Plutarch" is sure that King Arthur was a Welshman and a credit to the country--and so was St.
David. The author was as accurate in regard to the dates as the nature of his subject would
allow. He adds apologetically, "It will appear that the life of St. David is rather misplaced
with respect to chronological order. But as he was contemporary with all those whose lives
have already been given, the anachronism, if such it may be called, can be of no great importance."

That is just the way I feel about it. After living for a whole week in such close contact with
the residence of St. David, I feel a real interest in him. Just who he was and when he lived,
if at all, is a matter of no great importance.

       *       *       *       *       *

Yet there are limits to the historical imagination. It must have something to work on, even
though that something may be very vague. We must draw the line somewhere in our pursuit of
antiquity. A relic may be too old to be effective. Instead of gently stimulating the imagination
it may paralyze it. What we desire is not merely the ancient but the familiar. The relic must
bring with it the sense of auld lang-syne. The Tory squire likes to preserve what has been
a long time in his family. The traveler has the same feeling for the possessions of the family
of humanity.

The family-feeling does not go back of a certain point. I draw the line at the legendary period
when the heroes have names, and more or less coherent stories are told of their exploits, People
who had a local habitation, but not a name, seem to belong to Geology only. For all their flint
arrow-heads, or bronze instruments, I cannot think of them as fellow men.

It was with this feeling that I visited one of the most ancient places of worship in Ireland,
the tumulus at Newgrange. It was on a day filled with historic sight-seeing. We started from
Drogheda, the great stronghold of the Pale in the Middle Ages, and the scene of Cromwell's
terrible vengeance in 1649. Three miles up the river is the site of the Battle of the Boyne.
It was one of the great indecisive battles of the world, it being necessary to fight it over
again every year. The Boyne had overflowed its banks, and in the fields forlorn hay-cocks stood
like so many little islands. We stopped at the battle monument and read its Whiggish inscription,
which was scorned by our honest driver. We could form some idea of how the field appeared on
the eventful day when King William and King James confronted each other across the narrow stream.
Then the scene changed and we found ourselves in Mellefont Abbey, the first Cistercian monastery
in Ireland, founded by St. Malachy, the friend of St. Bernard of Clairvaux. King William and
King James were at once relegated to their proper places among the moderns, while we went back
to the ages of faith.

Four miles farther we came to Monasterboice, where stood two great Celtic crosses. There are
two ruined churches and a round tower. Here was an early religious establishment which existed
before the times of St. Columba.

This would be enough for one day's reminiscence, but my heart leaped up at the sight of a long
green ridge. "There is the hill of Tara!"

Having traversed the period from King William to the dwellers in the Halls of Tara, what more
natural than to take a further plunge into the past?

We drive into an open field and alight near a rock-strewn hill. Candles are given us and we
grope our way through narrow passages till we come to the centre of the hill. Here is a chamber
some twenty feet in height. On the great stones which support the roof are mystic emblems.
On the floor is a large stone hollowed out in the shape of a bowl. It suggests human sacrifices.
My guide did not encourage this suggestion. There was, he thought, no historical evidence for
it. But it seemed to me that if these people ever practised such sacrifices this was the place
for them. A gloomier chamber for weird rites could not be imagined.

Who were the worshipers? Druids or pre-Druids? The archæologists tell us that they belonged
to the Early Bronze period. Now Early Bronze is a good enough term for articles in a museum,
but it does not suggest a human being. We cannot get on terms of spiritual intimacy with the
Early Bronze people. We may know what they did, but there is no intimation of "the moving why
they did it." What spurred them on to their feats of prodigious industry? Was it fear or love?
First they built their chapel of great stones and then piled a huge hill on top of it. Were
they still under the influence of the glacial period and attempting to imitate the wild doings
of Nature? The passage of the ages does not make these men seem venerable, because their deeds
are no longer intelligible. Mellefont Abbey is in ruins, but we can easily restore it in imagination.
We can picture the great buildings as they were before the iconoclasts destroyed them. The
prehistoric place of worship in the middle of the hill is practically unchanged. But the clue
to its meaning is lost.

I could not make the ancient builders and worshipers seem real. It was a relief to come up
into the sunshine where people of our own kind had walked, the Kings of Tara and their harpers,
and St. Patrick and St. Malachy and Oliver Cromwell and William III. After the unintelligible
symbols on the rocks, how familiar and homelike seemed the sculptures on the Celtic crosses.
They were mostly about people, and people whom we had known from earliest childhood. There
were Adam and Eve, and Cain slaying Abel, and the Magi. They were members of our family.

But between us and the builders of the under-ground chapel there was a great gulf. There was
no means of spiritual communication across the abyss. A scrap of writing, a bit of poetry,
a name handed down by tradition, would have been worth all the relics discovered by archæologists.

There is justification for the traveler's preference for the things he has read about, for
these are the things which resist the changes of time. Only he must remember that they are
better preserved in the book than in the places where they happened. The impression which any
generation makes on the surface of the earth is very slight. It cannot give the true story
of the brief occupancy. That requires some more direct interpretation.

The magic carpet which carries us into any age not our own is woven by the poets and historians.
Without their aid we may travel through Space, but not through Time.

THE OBVIOUSNESS OF DICKENS

In the college world it is a point of honor for the successive classes to treat each other
with contumely. The feud between freshman and sophomore goes on automatically. Only when one
has become a senior may he, without losing caste, recognize a freshman as a youth of promise,
and admit that a sophomore is not half bad. Such disinterested criticism is tolerated because
it is evidently the result of the mellowing influence of time.

The same tendency is seen in literary and artistic judgments. It is never good taste to admit
the good taste of the generation that immediately precedes us. Its innocent admirations are
flouted and its standards are condemned as provincial. For we are always emerging from the
dark ages and contrasting their obscurity with our marvelous light. The sixteenth century scorned
the fifteenth century for its manifold superstitions. Thomas Fuller tells us that his enlightened
contempories in the seventeenth century treated the enthusiasms of the sixteenth century with
scant respect. The price of martyrs' ashes rises and falls in Smithfield market. At a later
period Pope writes,--

  "We think our fathers fools, so wise we grow:
  Our wiser sons, perhaps, will think us so."

He need not have put in the "perhaps." 

The illustrations differ little as regards the types shown from those given in the works of Evans
and Hawkins. There is, however, one point to be observed that is interesting and noteworthy--i.e.,
Gaulish and Roman coins have been found enclosed together in the same urn, thus indicating
that the two coinages had concurrently come into the possession of the same person before being
hidden. This appears proof of concurrent circulation. The small urn found by Mr. George Amy,
of Rozel, close to the spot where the landslip occurred in 1875, is in the Jersey Museum.
It is, of course, hand-made pottery, and burnt nearly black. It contained both Gaulish and Roman
coins--the former, both of billon and silver, being mainly of the
smaller or more rare sort, and each weighing only from 18 to 28 grains.

The urn was a small one, the top having been covered by a flat stone, with a larger stone keeping
this down in its place.

By consideration of the metal values of Gaulish and Roman coins turned up in the same "find,"
we might arrive at the relative current values as regulated and assigned
at the period.

ROMAN COINS IN THE CHANNEL ISLANDS

After conquest and occupation by the Romans, the Gaulish currency, as well as that of ancient Britain,
was superseded by Roman issues. Mr. Edward Hawkins, in his standard work on the Silver Coins
of England[C] (page 22), tersely and precisely explains what happened in England; and the Channel
Islands came within the same provisions and action.

[C] "The Silver Coins of England." By Edward Hawkins, F.R.S., F.A.S. Published by Bernard Quaritch,
15, Piccadilly, London.

"It is natural to suppose that when the Roman power had become established in Britain, the ordinary
money of that empire would form the general circulation of this country, and that British money would
be for the most part, if not entirely, superseded. Gildas asserts that an edict was actually
issued and enforced, ordaining that all money current in this island should bear the image and superscription
of the Roman Emperor; and the circumstance of Roman coins being almost daily turned up in every
part of the country amply confirms his statement. It is quite unnecessary to enter here into
any description of that money, as it is perfectly well known to everyone, and numerous treatises and
descriptions of it have been published in all languages."

Just as stated above, it would be but going over ground already thoroughly well trodden to treat
of the different Roman coins discovered in the Channel islands. They are similar to those
which have come to light on the south coast of England and in Normandy and Brittany. I will, however,
append at length the following note from William Nicolle, Esq., Jurat, of Bosville, King's
Cliff, Jersey, who has favoured me with particulars of Roman coins
found in Jersey, and now in his possession:--

"The Roman coins in
my possession are 342 in number, and form part of a find which was
made in February, 1848, in the district of 'Les Quenvais,' in the
parish of St. Brelade's, Jersey.

They were described in a paper which was contributed to the Worcester Congress in the summer of
1848, by the late Mr. F. C. Lukis, F.S.A., the eminent Guernsey archæologist, and which was
published in the 'Journal of the Archæological Association,' Vol. IV., page 272.

"Mr. Lukis says:--'By a series of sections the accumulation of sand in Les Quenvais bears marks
of several inundations, quite distinct in their appearance, and varying
somewhat in their directions.

The soil and clay beneath this sandy mass exhibit Roman vestiges of pottery and other articles,
so that we cannot be far wrong in attributing the change in this supposed fertile district to
a period not far removed from the Roman subjugation of western Europe. Fragments of Roman pottery
from beneath the sandy hillocks of Les Quenvais, in the possession of Col. Le Couteur, of
Jersey, Aide-de-camp to Her Majesty, present indubitable marks of the possession of this district
by those conquerors. And, as if a further proof were wanting, in February last a jar[D] of coarse earthenware,
which contained 400 brass coins in excellent state of preservation, was dug out from the substratum,
where it may have been lodged at the time of the Roman occupation
of Jersey.'

[D] This jar is in my possession.

"Mr. Lukis then proceeds to describe at length the different varieties of coins in this find under
the respective emperors, though his details are not always correct.

"Of the 342 brass coins in my possession 208 are coins of Constantine the Great, or his son,
86 of Licinius, 16 of Maximinus, 14 of Maxentius, 11 of Maximianus, and 7 of Constantius Chlorus.

"Two
emperors had the common name of Maximianus. The elder reigned from 286 to 310, and the younger from
305 to 311. Of the 11 coins of these emperors, there are 7 of the elder and 4 of the younger.
The first bear on the obverse the legend D. N. Maximiano P. F. S. Aug., and the second the
words Imp. C. Val. Maximianus P. F. Aug.

"Constantius I., or Constantius Chlorus, reigned one year, from the first of May, 305, to July 25th,
306, when he died at Eboracum, now York. During the whole of this period he remained in Gaul and
Britain. The 7 coins of this emperor are all of the same mintage. An exact facsimile of them
is given on page 262 of Stevenson's 'Dictionary of Roman Coins,'

"Constantine the Great reigned from 306
to 337.

He was the son of Constantius Chlorus, and was with him at Eboracum at the time of his death, and
there assumed the purple. His son, Constantius II., or Junior, was named Cæsar by his father
in 317, and died in 340. There is no proper criterion by which to distinguish the coins of these
two emperors. Of the 208 coins of Constantine in my collection there are about 30 varieties.

"Maximinus
II. reigned from 305 to 313; Maxentius from 306 to 312; and Licinius
from 307 to 324.

"It is probable that all, or almost all, the 342 coins of this collection were minted during
the first quarter of the 4th century--in fact, during the ten years between A.D. 305 and 315."

ON
EARLY IMPORTED COINS AND THEIR VALUES.

In preceding "General Observations on Coinages for the Channel Islands," I have noted that from
the time of the Romans the currency continued to be by introduced or foreign coins. Naturally
enough, the islanders would have only to do with coins which would be accepted by those on the neighbouring
mainland with whom they had commercial transactions.

There was not sufficient interior traffic to make requisite any local coinage of their own.

It would be uninteresting and of no practical utility to treat in detail of coins thus imported
for temporary and outside, as well as home, convenience and necessity, but I will now give notes
and extracts which will, I believe, clearly indicate the nature of currency arrangements which
obtained from the days of the early kings of England.

I am indebted to Le Quesne's "History of Jersey"[E] for interesting information recorded of the
coinages and currency of that island, and to the Rev. G. E. Lee for the Guernsey records. The
original states documents from which these particulars were collated are still preserved. The
denominations of coins officially in use at various periods appear
thereby.

[E] "A Constitutional History of Jersey." By Charles Le Quesne. Published by Longmans and Co.,
London, 1856.

"An order of King John, dated 25th March, 1208, directs the Exchequer to reckon to the bailiffs
of Southampton twenty sols which they paid for a ship in which Stephen de Oxford sailed to
Guernsey and Jersey by order of the king."--Le Quesne, page 476.

"Orders from the English Crown in the early part of the 13th century
specified coins as follows for payment in Jersey:--An order from King
John of the 11th of November, 1212, directed that the Treasury should
pay to Philip d'Albigny, going to the island of Jersey, of which Hasculfus
de Soligny was governor, 40 marks for fortifying the island."--Le
Quesne, page 476.

"In the 8th year of the reign of King Henry III., 1224, there was
an order on the Treasury to deliver to the Governor of Jersey, Galpidus
de Lucy, 400 livres for the payment of eight knights, each knight
to receive two solidos per diem; for the pay of thirty-five cavalry
soldiers, each to receive twelve deniers per diem; and for the pay
of sixty foot soldiers, each to receive seven deniers per diem."--Le
Quesne, page 476.

There were also similar grants in the two following years.

"The only direct tax which the Dukes of Normandy had the right to levy was called moneyage,
or fouage, or hearth money. From the Extent of the Royal Revenue in Jersey, prepared by Commissioners
in the year 1331, this tax was also due to the Crown in Jersey. It was to be levied every three
years, and consisted of 12 deniers, or one sol, for every hearth in the Duchy."--Le Quesne,
page 79.

"There is a valuable Extent of the Royal Revenues in Jersey drawn
up in the year 1331 by Robert de Norton and William de la Rue, commissioners
specially appointed for the purpose.

In this Extent we find that William de Barentin held the manor and fief of Rozel by homage;
that this fief owed sixty sols one denier relief; and that whenever the King of England paid
a visit to this island, the seigneur of this fief was bound to meet his sovereign on horseback
in the sea, to the depth of the girths of the saddle; and during the residence of the king
in Jersey he was to be his butler, and to enjoy the known emoluments of that office. The seigneur
de Rozel, as also all the other seigneurs holding in capite, owed suite de cour at the chief
pleas of the Royal Court, as they do still to this day. For the fief de Meleches and other fiefs,
held by Geffray de Carteret, there was due annually, by the seigneur to the Crown, the sum of
forty livres one sol. The fief de Meleches reverted to the Crown as an escheat from Thomas Pinel,
in the time of King John, and was granted by Edward III. to Renault de Cartaret, father of
the then holder. The fief and manor of St. Ouen was held by Renault de Carteret by homage;
and the relief, when due, was nine livres. The seigneur of this fief was bound to serve the
king, in time of war, at Gouray Castle, at his own expense, for the term of two parts of forty
days, and had to provide horses and armour.

The wardship of this fief and manor, during the minority of the seigneur, was in the Crown.
The manor and fief of Saumarez was held by homage by William de St. Hillaire, and owed, as relief,
the sum of ten livres. The seigneur of the fief des Augrès was in the hands of William Bras de Fer; and he had
to meet the king, when he arrived in Jersey, on horseback, to the girths of his saddle, in
the sea; and the fief owed, as relief, the sum of seven livres.

Besides the services due by the fiefs de haubert, we find that a great number of persons owed
stated sums annually to the Crown for the lands held by them. The names of the persons are mentioned,
together with the quantity of land, for which a fixed annual sum was due. For instance, several
persons owed for a bovata of land the sum of eight sols annually. This was the usual amount; but
we find that in some cases the charge was six sols, seven sols, nine
sols, ten sols, and in a few cases as low as three sols.

The bovata terræ is the same as an oxgauge or an oxgate of land, or as much as an ox can till;
but being a compound word, it may contain meadow, pasture, and wood necessary for such tillage.

"Raulin
le François owed for forty-two acres of land--twelve in Trinity parish, and thirty in that of
St. Laurens--an annual dinner to the king at Michaelmas, which was, however, partaken by the
bailli, the vicomte, and the clerk of the king. This dinner could be commuted for the payment
of twelve deniers, which does not raise any extravagant notions of the style of living in those
days. The abbot of St. Saviour's, however, for the priory of Bonnenuit, owed to the king annually
an apparently better dinner, for it was estimated at eleven sols. There were also due to the
Crown, as there are still to this day, by various persons, a quantity of geese, fowls, eggs, and
chickens. The tenants of the Crown had various personal services to perform, such as carting the
wine, hay, and wood belonging to the king, and keeping the royal mills in repair. The right of wardship,
usually considered as incidental to feudal tenures, does not appear to have obtained in Jersey,
except in the case of St. Ouen's manor. The right of marriage, or maritagium, which was accompanied
in some cases with considerable hardships, does not appear to have prevailed or to have been
exercised in this island.

This claim, when admitted, was often the source of large fines paid by individuals to the Crown,
and of much vexation and tyranny."--Le Quesne, page 82.

"In a grant of Sir Richard Harliston, dated 15th September, 1479, there is mention of both
corn and money rents--the former to the amount of 8 qrs., 7 cabots, 2 sexrs., and the latter
to 12 groats, 13 sous, 6 deniers. The grant was for services rendered during the siege for
the recovery of Mount Orgueil Castle."--Le Quesne, page 125.

"On the 26th of January, 1534, the value of the current coinage was regulated, and the same
thing took place about this time as regards coins in Guernsey."--Le
Quesne, page 191.

"On the 20th February, 1561, the price of cider in Jersey was fixed at one Esterlin the Pot; and
the brewers were ordered to make beer (servoise) for the use of the sick, the price of which
was to be fixed by the constables and principal parishioners."--Le Quesne, page 192.

In the reign of King James I., under date the 20th July, 1607, a commission
was appointed, under presidency of Sir Robert Gardiner, knight, for
the determination of differences in Jersey; it also had scope as regards
Guernsey.

"The first article of complaint by the governor was relative to the value of the French coins.
At these times there was very little, if any, English coin in circulation, and there was, strictly
speaking, no fixed standard of value in Jersey. The livre tournois could scarcely be called a
standard of value, and yet it was that by which the market price
of commodities was known.

It was the ideal currency of the island, that in which accounts were kept. The actual current
money was French; and any variation in its value compared to the livre tournois would have,
of course, to be regulated in Jersey.

"Any change in the value or denomination of coins is attended with
serious inconveniences, and it may, in some cases, be highly injurious
to a large class of the community.

This is more likely to be the case when the coins of two countries are adopted; when two different
currencies are in circulation; when any variation in the value of the coins of one of these
countries takes place, and the relative value, owing to that change, has to be ascertained and
determined by a legislative or administrative body. Great caution is required in these matters;
and, at a later period, the greatest discontent was caused in Jersey, and even a riot ensued,
from an alteration in the value of the currency.

"The States of Jersey, a few years before the arrival of the commissioners,
perceiving that the King of France had altered and advanced his several
coins, established what they considered an equivalent value between
these coins and the moneys in Jersey after the old rates.

The difference was about seven per cent. The French crown was advanced to four sous more, the
guardesen from fifteen sous to sixteen sous, the teston from fourteen sous and a half to fifteen
sous and a half, and the franc from twenty sous to twenty-one sous
four deniers tournois.

The only money in circulation was French; and the governor claimed the payments due to the Crown in
moneys at the old rate.

The commissioners were of a different opinion; they said that it would be no prejudice to his
Majesty or to the governor if the moneys were received after the new advancements or alteration;
and besides, it would be a great contentment to the people of the island to pay the same after
the rate or value at which they had received it; but as the commissioners considered that it
was a prerogative of the Crown to diminish, alter, or advance any moneys current among his own
subjects, they ordered that the relative value of the moneys should continue as regulated by the
States, 'until his Majesty's pleasure be known what other course
and order in times to come shall be held and kept therein.' This decision
of the commissioners was confirmed by the lords; but it is added in
the Order, 'that in time to come, because it is a prerogative of his
Majesty, and only appertaineth to royal right, to diminish, alter,
or advance any moneys current among his subjects, we require that
this be not until his Majesty's express consent be thereunto first
had and obtained.'"--Le Quesne, page 225.

The following two interesting extracts are from "Charles the Second in the Channel Islands," by S.
Elliott Hoskins.[F]

[F] "Charles the Second in the Channel Islands," by S. Elliott Hoskins,
M.D., F.R.S. Published by Richard Bentley, London.

"The Prince of Wales, driven out of England without resources, having nevertheless, at his own
cost, to maintain soldiers and sailors; to provide for a host of needy followers; to build fortifications
for his protection; and to defray the travelling expenses of the
numerous messengers going and coming from all parts, was reduced to
great straits at this period.

Jersey could supply him but inadequately, and from France he could obtain but slender and uncertain
assistance. In order, therefore, to improve the state of his finances, and in some measure to provide
for current expenses, it was resolved, at the recommendation of the council, that an establishment
for coining bullion should at once be set up.[G] A house was accordingly
hired in Trinity parish, Jersey, from one Michael le Guerdain, which
was speedily fitted up with furnaces for fusing the precious metals,
and with presses and dies for striking and stamping coin, under the
direction and superintendence of one Colonel Smith, who was appointed
Master of the Mint.

[G] NOTE 1.--"In the year 1684 Charles the Second
is said to have issued tin coinage; had he made it a legal tender
in 1646, when it was plentiful and precious as an article of barter,
the speculation might have proved profitable."

"Chevalier goes on
to state that the money herein coined consisted chiefly of pieces
resembling English half-crowns, which passed current at thirty sous
each. The obverse of these pieces, called St. Georges, was stamped
with an effigy of the king on horseback holding a drawn sword in his
hand; and the reverse impressed with roses and harps, proper to the
royal arms, interlaced with fillets, crosses, and other devices. Some
shillings were likewise coined, and besides these a small number of
Jacobuses, said to be worth twenty shillings apiece."--Hoskins, Vol.
I., page 416.

"Our journalist reverts to the subject of the mint
set up in Jersey some twelvemonths before, which at that time promised
to become a profitable financial speculation. The manager, Colonel
Smyth, he informs us, originally a landed proprietor, and a man of
good family in England, had been, before the troubles, master of one
of his Majesty's provincial mints, and by virtue of his office an
honorary privy councillor.

In making such a confession he would be in good company. Even Shakespeare, with all his dramatic
genius, confessed that he could not avoid monotony in his praise of true love. Its ways were
ways of pleasantness, but did not afford much incentive to originality.

  "Since all alike my songs and praises be
  To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
  Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
  Still constant in a wondrous excellence;
  Therefore my verse to constancy confined,
  One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
  'Fair, kind, and true' is all my argument,
  'Fair, kind, and true' varying to other words;
  And in this change is my invention spent."

But the novelist, when he takes himself too seriously as the man who is to show us "life as
it is," is not content to acknowledge his limitations. When he pictures a situation in which
there is nothing but a succession of problems and misunderstandings, he asks us to admire his
austere faithfulness. Faithful he may be to his Art, as he understands it, but he is not faithful
to reality, unless he is able to make us see ordinary people in the act of enjoying themselves.

The most obvious thing in life is that people are seldom as unhappy as their circumstances
would lead us to expect. Nobody is happy all the time, and if he were, nobody is enough of
a genius to make his undeviating felicity interesting. But a great many people are happy most
of the time, and almost everybody has been happy at some time or other. It may have been only
a momentary experience, but it was very real, and he likes to think about it. He is excessively
grateful to any one who recalls the feeling. The point is that the aggregate of these good
times makes a considerable amount of cheerfulness.

Dickens does not attempt the impossible literary feat of showing us one person who is happy
all the time, but he does what is more obvious, he makes us see a great many people who have
snatches of good cheer in the midst of their humdrum lives. He lets us see another obvious
fact, that happiness is more a matter of temperament than of circumstance. It is not given
as a reward of merit or as a mark of distinguished consideration. There is one perennial fountain
of pleasure. Any one can have a good time who can enjoy himself. Dickens was not above celebrating
the kind of happiness which comes to the natural man and the natural boy through what we call
the "creature comforts." He could sympathize with the unadulterated self-satisfaction of little
Jack Horner when

  "He put in his thumb
  And pulled out a plum,
  And said, 'What a great boy am I!'"

The finding of the plum was not a matter of world-wide importance, but it was a great pleasure
for Jack Horner, and he did not care who knew it.

What joy Mr. Micawber gets out of his own eloquence! We cannot begrudge him this unearned increment.

And R. Wilfer, despite his meagre salary, and despite Mrs. Wilfer, enjoys himself whenever
he gets a chance. When he goes to Greenwich with Bella he finds everything as it should be.
If that was not happiness, what was it?

It is a matter of common observation that those who have allotted to them the most solemn music
do not always keep time with it. In the "ordinary run of domestic transactions" they find many
little alleviations. In the aggregate these amount to a considerable blessing. The world may
be rough, and many of its ways may be cruel, but for all that it is a joyful sensation to be
alive, and the more alive we are, the better we like it. All of which is very obvious, and
it is what we want somebody to point out for us again and again.

THE SPOILED CHILDREN OF CIVILIZATION

To spoil a child is no easy task, for Nature is all the time working in behalf of the childish
virtues and veracities, and is gently correcting the abnormalities of education. Still it can
be done. The secret of it is never to let the child alone, and to insist on doing for him all
that he would otherwise do for himself--and more.

In that "more" lies the spoiling power. The child must be early made acquainted with the feeling
of satiety. There must be too much of everything. If he were left to himself to any extent,
this would be an unknown experience. For he is a hungry little creature, with a growing appetite,
and naturally is busy ministering to his own needs. He is always doing something for himself,
and enjoys the exercise. The little egoist, even when he has "no language but a cry," uses
that language to make known to the world that he wants something and wants it very much. As
his wants increase, his exertions increase also. Arms and legs, fingers and toes, muscles and
nerves and busy brain are all at work to get something which he desires. He is a mechanic fashioning
his little world to his own uses. He is a despot who insists on his divine right to rule the
subservient creatures around him. He is an inventor devising ways and means to secure all the
ends which he has the wit to see. That these great works on which he has set his heart end
in self is obvious enough, but we forgive him. Altruism will come in its own time.

In natural play a boy will be a horse or a driver. Either occupation gives him plenty to do.
But the role of an elderly passenger, given a softly cushioned seat and deposited respectfully
at the journey's end, he rejects with violent expressions of scorn. It is ignominious. He will
be a policeman or robber or judge or executioner, just as the exigencies of the game demand.
These are honorable positions worthy of one who belongs to the party of action. But do not
impose upon him by asking him to act the part of the respectable citizen who is robbed and
who does nothing but telephone for the police. He is not fastidious and will take up almost
anything that is suggested, if it gives him the opportunity of exerting himself. The demand
for exertion is the irreducible minimum.

Now to spoil all this fine enthusiasm you must arrange everything in such a manner that the
eager little worker shall find everything done before he has time to put his hand to it. There
must be no alluring possibilities in his tiny universe. The days of creation, when "the sons
of God shouted for joy," must be passed before he is ushered in. He must be presented only
with accomplished facts. There must be nothing left for him to make or discover. He must be
told everything. All his designs must be anticipated, by nurses and parents and teachers. They
must give him whatever good things they can think of before he has time to desire them. From
the time when elaborate mechanical toys are put into his reluctant hands, it is understood
that he is to be amused, and need not amuse himself His education is arranged for him. His
companions are chosen for him. There is nothing for him to do, and if there were, there is
no incentive for him to do it. In the game of life he is never allowed to be the horse. It
is his fate to be the passenger.

A child is spoiled when he accepts the position into which fond, foolish parents thrust him.
Being a passenger on what was presumably intended to be a pleasure excursion, he begins to
find fault as soon as the journey becomes a little wearisome. He must find fault, because that
is the only thing left for him to find. Having no opportunity to exercise his creative faculties,
he becomes a petulant critic of a world he can neither enjoy nor understand. Taking for granted
that everything should be done for him, he is angry because it is not done better. His ready-made
world does not please him--why should it? It never occurs to him that if he does not like it
he should try and make it better.

Unfortunately, the characteristics of the spoiled child do not vanish with childhood or even
with adolescence. A university training does not necessarily transform petulance into ripe
wisdom. Literary ability may only give fluent expression to a peevish spirit.

Among the innumerable children of an advanced civilization there are those who have been spoiled
by the petting to which they have been subjected. Life has been made so easy for them that
when they come upon hard places which demand sturdy endurance they break forth into angry complaints.
They have been given the results of the complicated activities of mankind, without having done
their share in the common tasks. They have not through personal endeavor learned how much everything
costs. They are not able, therefore, to pay cheerfully for any future good. If it is not given
to them at once they feel that they have a grievance. For friendly coöperation they are not
prepared. They must have their own way or they will not play the game. Their fretful complaints
are like those of the children in the old-time market-places: "We have piped unto you and you
have not danced, we have mourned unto you and you have not lamented."

There is a fashionable attitude of mind among many who pride themselves on their acute intellectualism.
It manifests itself in a supercilious compassion for the efforts and ambitions of the man of
action. He, poor fellow, is well-meaning, but unilluminated. He is eager and energetic because
he imagines that he is accomplishing something. If he were a serious thinker he would see that
all effort is futile. We are here in an unintelligible world, a world of mighty forces, moving
we know not whither. We are subject to passions and impulses which we cannot resist. We are
never so helpless as when we are in the midst of human affairs. We have great words which we
utter proudly. We talk of Civilization, Christianity, Democracy, and the like. What miserable
failures they all are. Civilization has failed to produce contentment. It has failed to secure
perfect justice between man and man, or to satisfy the hungry with bread. Christianity after
all these centuries of preaching leaves mankind as we see it to-day--an armed camp, nation
fighting nation, class warring against class. The democratic movement about which we hear so
much is equally unsuccessful. After its brilliant promises it leaves us helpless against the
passion and stupidity of the mob. Popular education adds to the tribulations of society. It
rapidly increases the number of the discontented. The half-educated are led astray by quacks
and demagogues who flourish mightily. The higher technical education increases that intellectual
proletariat which Bismarck saw to be a peril. Science, which once was hailed as a deliverer,
is now perceived to bring only the disillusioning knowledge of our limitations. The bankruptcy
of Science follows closely upon the bankruptcy of Faith. Mechanical inventions, instead of
decreasing the friction of life, enormously increase it. We are destined to be dragged along
by our own machines which are to go faster and faster. Philanthropy increases the number of
the unfit. The advances of medicine are only apparent, while statistics show that tuberculosis,
a disease of early life, decreases, cancer and diseases of later life increase.

As for the general interest in social amelioration, that is the worst sign of all. "Coming
events cast their shadows before," and we may see the shadow of the coming Revolution. Is there
any symptom of decadence more sure than when the moral temperature suddenly rises above normal?
Watch the clinical charts of Empire. In the period of national vigor the blood is cool. But
the time arrives when the period of growth has passed. Then a boding sense comes on. The huge
frame of the patient is feverish. The social conscience is sensitive. All sorts of soft-hearted
proposals for helping the masses are proposed. The world rulers become too tenderhearted for
their business. Then comes the end.

Read again the history of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. How admirable were the
efforts of the "good emperors," and how futile! Consider again the oft-repeated story of the
way the humanitarianism of Rousseau ushered in the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror.

With such gloomy forebodings do the over-civilized thinkers and writers try to discourage the
half-civilized and half-educated workers, who are trying to make things better. How shall we
answer the prophets of ill?

Not by denying the existence of the evils they see, or the possibility of the calamities which
they fear. What we object to is the mental attitude toward the facts that are discovered. The
spoiled child, when it discovers something not to its liking, exaggerates the evil, and indulges
its ill-temper.

The well-trained man faces the evil, studies it, measures it, and then sets to work. He is
well aware that nothing human is perfect, and that to accomplish one thing is only to reveal
another thing which needs to be done. There must be perpetual readjustment, and reconsideration.
What was done yesterday must be done over again to-day in a somewhat different way. But all
this does not prove the futility of effort. It only proves that the effort must be unceasing,
and that it must be more and more wisely directed.

He compares, for example, Christianity as an ideal with Christianity as an actual achievement.
He places in parallel columns the maxims of Jesus, and the policies of Christian nations and
the actual state of Christian churches. The discrepancy is obvious enough. But it does not
prove that Christianity is a failure; it only proves that its work is unfinished.

A political party may adopt a platform filled with excellent proposals which if thoroughly
carried out would bring in the millennium. But it is too much to expect that it would all be
accomplished in four years. At the end of that period we should not be surprised if the reformers
should ask for a further extension of time.

The spoiled children of civilization eliminate from their problem the one element which is
constant and significant--human effort. They forget that from the beginning human life has
been a tremendous struggle against great odds. Nothing has come without labor, no advance has
been without daring leadership. New fortunes have always had their hazards.

Forgetting all this, and accepting whatever comforts may have come to them as their right,
they are depressed and discouraged by their vision of the future with its dangers and its difficulties.
They habitually talk of the civilized world as on the brink of some great catastrophe which
it is impossible to avoid. This gloomy foreboding is looked upon as an indication of wisdom.

It should be dismissed, I think, as an indication of childish unreason, unworthy of any one
who faces realities. It is still true that "the morrow shall take thought for the things of
itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."

The notion that coming events cast shadows before is a superstition. How can they? A shadow
must be the shadow of something. The only events that can cast a shadow are those which have
already taken place. Behind them is the light of experience, shining upon actualities which
intercept its rays.

The shadows which affright us are of our own making. They are projections into the future of
our own experiences. They are sharply denned silhouettes, rather than vague omens. When we
look at them closely we can recognize familiar features. We are dealing with cause and effect.
What is done foreshadows what remains to be done. Every act implies some further acts as its
results. When a principle is recognized its practical applications must follow. When men begin
to reason from new premises they are bound to come to new conclusions.

It is evident that in the last half-century enough discoveries have been made to keep us busy
for a long time. Every scientific advance upsets some custom and interferes with some vested
interest. You cannot discover the truth about tuberculosis without causing a great deal of
trouble to the owners of unsanitary dwellings. Some of them are widows whose little all is
invested in this kind of property. The health inspectors make life more difficult for them.

Scholarly research among ancient manuscripts is the cause of destructive criticism. The scholar
with the most peaceable intentions in the world disturbs some one's faith. His discovery perhaps
involves the reconstruction of a whole system of philosophy.

A law is passed. The people are pleased with it, and then forget all about it. But by and by
a conscientious executive comes into office who thinks it his duty to enforce the law. Such
accidents are liable to happen in the most good-humored democracy. When he tries to enforce
it there is a burst of angry surprise. He is treated as a revolutionist who is attacking the
established order. And yet to the moderately philosophic observer the making of the law and
its enforcement belong to the same process. The difficulty is that though united logically
they are often widely separated chronologically.

The adjustment to a new theory involves changes in practice. But the practical man who has
usually little interest in new theories is surprised and angry when the changes come. He looks
upon them as arbitrary interferences with his rights.

Even when it is admitted that when considered in a large way the change is for the better,
the question arises, Who is to pay for it? The discussion on this point is bound to be acrimonious,
as we are not saints and nobody wants to pay more than his share of the costs of progress.
Even the price of liberty is something which we grumble over.

You have noticed how it is when a new boulevard is laid in any part of the city. There is always
a dispute between the municipality and the abutters. Should the abutters be assessed for betterments
or should they sue for damages? Usually both actions are instituted. The cost of such litigation
should be included in the price which the community pays for the improvement.

If people always knew what was good for them and acted accordingly, this would be a very different
world, though not nearly so interesting. But we do not know what is good for us till we try;
and human life is spent in a series of experiments. The experiments are costly, but there is
no other way of getting results. All that we can say to a person who refuses to interest himself
in these experiments, or who looks upon all experiments as futile which do not turn out as
he wished, is that his attitude is childish. The great commandment to the worker or thinker
is,--Thou shalt not sulk.

       *       *       *       *       *

Sulking is no more admirable in those of great reputation than it is in the nursery. Thackeray
declared that, in his opinion, "love is a higher intellectual exercise than hate." And looked
at as an exercise of mental power courage must always be greater than the most highly intellectualized
form of fear or despair.

I cannot take with perfect seriousness Matthew Arnold's oft-quoted lines:--

  "Achilles ponders in his tent,
  The kings of modern thought are dumb.
  Silent they are, though not content,
  And wait to see the future come.
  They have the grief men had of yore,
  But they contend and cry no more."

If that is ever the attitude of the best minds, it is only a momentary one of which they are
quickly ashamed. Achilles sulked in his tent when he was pondering not a big problem, but a
small grievance. The kings of modern thought who are described seem like kings out of a job.
We are inclined to turn from them to the intellectual monarchs de facto. They are the ones
who take up the hard job which the representatives of the old régime give up as hopeless. For
when the king has abdicated and contends no more--Long live the King!

The real thinkers of any age do not remain long in a blue funk. They always find something
important to think about. They always point out something worth doing. They cannot passively
wait to see the future come. They are too busy making it.

Matthew Arnold struck a truer note in Rugby Chapel. The true leaders of mankind can never be
mere intellectualists. There must be a union of intellectual and moral energy like that which
he recognized in his father.

When those whom we have looked upon as our intellectual leaders grow disheartened, we must
remember that a lost leader does not necessarily mean a lost cause. When those whom we had
called the kings of modern thought are dumb, we can find new leadership. "Change kings with
us," replied an Irish officer after the panic of the Boyne; "change kings with us, and we will
fight you again."

ON REALISM AS AN INVESTMENT

From a Real-Estate Dealer to a Realistic Novelist

Dear Sir:--

I have been for some time interested in your projects for the improvement of literature. When
I saw your name in the newspapers, I looked you up in "Who's Who," and found that your rating
is excellent What pleased me was the bold way you attacked the old firms which have been living
on their reputations. The way you showed up Dickens, Thackeray & Co. showed that you know a
thing or two. As for W. Scott and the other speculators who have been preying on the credulity
of the public, you gave them something to think about. You showed conclusively that instead
of dealing in hard facts, they have been handing out fiction under the guise of novels.

Our minds run in the same channel: you deal in reality and I deal in realty, but the principle
is the same. I inclose some of the literature which I am sending out. You see, I warn people
against investing in stocks and bonds. These are mere paper securities, which take to themselves
wings and fly away. But if you can get hold of a few acres of dirt, there you are. When a panic
comes along, and Wall Street goes to smash, you can sit on your front porch in South Canaan
without a care. You have your little all in something real.

You followed the same line of argumentation. You showed that there was nothing imaginative
about your work. You could give a warranty deed for every fact which you put on the market.
I was so pleased with your method that I bought a job lot of your books, so that I could see
for myself how you conducted your business. Will you allow me, as one in the same line, to
indulge in a little criticism? I am afraid that you are making the same mistake I made when
I first went into real estate. I was so possessed with the idea of the value of land that I
became "land poor." It strikes me that a novelist may become reality poor in the same way;
that is, by investing in a great many realities that are not worth what he pays for them.

You see, there is a fact which we do not mention in our circulars. There is a great deal of
land lying out of doors. Some land is in great demand, and the real trick is to find out what
that land is. You can't go out on the plains of Wyoming and give an acre of land the same value
which an acre has in the Wall Street district. I speak from experience, having tried to convince
the public that if the acres are real, the values I suggested must be real also. People wouldn't
believe me, and I lost money.

And the same thing is true about improvements. They must be related to the market value of
the land on which they are placed. A forty-story building at Goshenville Corners would be a
mistake. There is no call for it.

This is the mistake which I fear you have been making. Your novel is a carefully prepared structure,
and must have cost a great deal, but it is built on ground which is not worth enough to justify
the investment. It has not what we call "site value." You yourself declare that you have no
particular interest in the characters you describe at such length. All that you have to say
for them is that they are real. It is as if I were to put up an expensive apartment-house on
a vacant lot I have at North Ovid. North Ovid is real, and so would be the apartment-house;
but what of it?

There are ninety millions of people in this country, all with characters which might be carefully
studied, if we had time. But we haven't the time. So we have to choose our intimates. We prefer
to know those who seem to us most worth knowing. You should remember that the novelist has
no monopoly on realism. The newspapers are full of all sorts of realities. The historian is
a keen competitor.

Do you know that when I went to the bookstore to get your works I fell in with a book on Garibaldi
by a man named Trevelyan. When I got home I sat down with it and couldn't let it go. Garibaldi
was all the time doing things, which you never allow your characters to do because you think
they would not be real. He was acting in the most romantic and heroic manner possible. And
his Thousand trooped after him as gayly as if they were in a melodrama. And yet I understand
that Garibaldi was a real person, and that his exploits can be authenticated.

The competition in your line of business is fierce. You try to hold the reader's attention
to the states of mind of a few futile persons who never did anything in particular that would
make people want to know them exhaustively. And then along comes the historian who tells all
about some one who does things they are interested in.

You can't wonder at the result. People who ought to be interested in fiction are carried away
by biography, and the chances are that some of them will never come back. When they once get
a taste for highly spiced intellectual victuals, you can't get them to relish the breakfast
food you set before them. It seems to them insipid.

I know what you will say about Garibaldi. He was not your kind. You wouldn't touch such a character
if it was offered to you at a bargain. After looking over that expedition to Sicily you would
say that there was nothing in it for you. The motives weren't complicated enough. It was just
plain heroics. You don't care so much for passions as for problems. You want something to analyze.

Well, what do you say to Cavour? When I was deep in Garibaldi I found I couldn't understand
what he was driving at without knowing something about Cavour who was always mixed up with
what was going on in that section of the world.

So I took up a Life of Cavour by a man named Thayer. It's the way I have; one thing suggests
another. Once I went up to Duluth and invested in some corner lots on Superior Street. That
suggested Superior City, just across the river. The two towns were running each other down
at a great rate just then, so I stopped at West Superior to see what it had to say for itself.
The upshot of the matter was that I sized up the situation about like this. A big city has
got to grow up at the head of Lake Superior. If Duluth grows as much as it thinks it will,
it's bound to take in Superior. And if Superior grows as much as it thinks it will, it can't
help taking in Duluth. So I concluded that the best thing for me was to take a flier in both.

When I saw what a big proposition the Unification of Italy was, I knew that there was room
for the development of some mighty interesting characters before they got through with the
business. So I plunged into the Life of Cavour, and I've never regretted it.

Talk about problems! That hero of yours in your last book--I know you don't believe in heroes,--at
any rate, the leading man--was an innocent child walking with his nurse along Easy Street,
when compared with Cavour. Cavour had fifty problems at the same time, and all of them were
insoluble to every one except himself.

His project, as I have just told you, was the unification of Italy. But he hadn't any regulated
monopoly in the business. A whole bunch of unifiers were ahead of him; each one of them was
trying to unify Italy in his own way. They were all working at cross-purposes.

Now Cavour didn't try, as you might have expected, to reconcile these people. He saw that it
couldn't be done. He didn't mind their hating one another; when they got too peaceable he would
make an occasion for them to hate him. He kept them all irreconcilably at work, till, in spite
of themselves, they got to working together. And when they began to do that, Cavour would encourage
them in it. As long as they were all working for Italy he didn't care what they thought of
each other or of him. He had his eye on the main chance--for Italy.

I notice that in your novel, when your man got into trouble he threw up the sponge. That rather
turned me against him and I wished I hadn't wasted so much time on his affairs. That wasn't
the way with Thayer's hero. One of the largest deals Cavour ever made was with Napoleon III,
who at that time had the reputation of being the biggest promoter of free institutions in Europe.
He was a regular wizard in diplomacy. Whatever he said went. You see they hadn't realized then
that he was doing business on borrowed capital.

Well, Napoleon agreed to underwrite, for Cavour, the whole project of Italian Unity. Everybody
thought it was going through all right, when suddenly Napoleon, from a place called Villafranca,
wired that the deal was off.

That floored Cavour. He was down and out. He couldn't realize ten cents on the dollar on his
securities. If he had been like your man, Thayer would have had to bring his book to an end
with that chapter. He would have left the reader plunged in gloom.

Cavour was mad for awhile and went up to Switzerland to cool off. Thayer describes the way
he went up to a friend's house, near Lake Geneva, with his coat on his arm. "Unannounced, he
strode into the drawing-room, threw himself into an easy-chair, and asked for a glass of iced
water."

Then he poured out his wrath over the Villafranca incident, but he didn't waste much time over
that. In a few moments he was enthusiastically telling of the new projects he had formed. "We
must not look back, but forward," he told his friends. "We have followed one road. It is blocked.
Very well, we will follow another."

That's the kind of man Cavour was. You forgot that he was a European statesman. When you saw
him with his coat off, drinking ice-water and talking about the future, you felt toward him
just as you would toward a first-rate American who was of Presidential size.

Now, I'm not saying that there's any more realism to the square inch in a Life of Cavour than
in a Life of Napoleon III. It would take as much labor on the part of a biographer to tell
what Napoleon III really was as to tell what Cavour really was--perhaps more. But you come
up against the law of supply and demand. You can't get around that. There isn't much inquiry
for Napoleon, now that his boom is over.

The way Thayer figured it was, I suppose, something like this. It would take eight or ten years
to assemble the materials for a first-rate biography such as he wished to make. If he chose
Napoleon there would be steady deterioration in the property, and when the improvements were
put on there would be no demand. If he put the same work on Cavour, he would get the unearned
increment. I think he showed his sense.

Of course the biographer has the advantage of you in one important particular. He knows how
his story is coming out In a way, he's betting on a certainty. Now you, as I judge, don't know
how your story is coming out, and if it doesn't come out, all you have to do is to say that
is the way you meant it to be. You cut off so many square feet of reality, and let it go at
that. Now that is very convenient for you, but from the reader's point of view, it's unsatisfactory.
It mixes him up, and he feels a grudge against you whenever he thinks how much better he might
have spent his time than in following a plot that came to nothing. You see you are running
up against that same law of supply and demand. There are so many failures in the world that
the market is overstocked with them. There is a demand for successes.

When I was in an old house which I took on the foreclosure of a mortgage the other day, I came
upon a little old novel, of a hundred years ago. It was the sentimental kind that you despise.
It was called "Alonzo and Melissa," which was enough to condemn it in your eyes. But the preface
seemed to me to have some sense.

The author says: "It is believed that this story contains no indecorous stimulants, nor is
it filled with inexplicated incidents imperceptible to the understanding. When anxieties have
been excited by involved and doubtful events, they are afterwards elucidated by their consequences.
In this the writer believes that he has generally copied Nature."

I have a feeling that those inexplicated incidents in your novel might have been elucidated
by their consequences if you had chosen a person whose actions were of the kind to have some
important consequences. In tying up to an inconsequential person you lost that chance.

I don't mean to discourage you, because I believe you have it in you to make a novel that would
be as interesting as half the biographies that are written. But you must learn a trick from
the successful biographers, and not invest in second-rate realities. The best is none too good.
You have to exercise judgment in your initial investment.

Now, if I were going to build a realistic novel, and had as much skill in detail as you have,
and as much intellectual capital to invest, I would go right down to the business centre, so
to speak, and invest in a really valuable piece of reality; and then I would develop it. The
first investment might seem pretty steep, but it would pay in the end. If you could get a big
man, enthusiastic over a big cause, in conflict with big forces, and bring in a lot of worth-while
people to back him up, and then bring the whole thing to some big conclusion, you would have
a novel that would be as real as the biographies I have been reading, and as interesting. I
think it would be worth trying.

Respectfully yours,

R.S. LANDMANN.

P.S. If you don't feel that you can afford to make such a heavy investment as I have suggested,
why don't you put your material into a short story?

TO A CITIZEN OF THE OLD SCHOOL

Our talk last night set me to thinking. It was the first time during all the years of our acquaintance
that I had ever heard you speak in a discouraged tone. You have always been healthy to a fault,
and your good-humor has been contagious. Especially has it been pleasant to hear you talk about
the country and its Manifest Destiny.

I remember, some years ago, how merrily you used to laugh about the "calamity-howler," whose
habitat at that time was Kansas. The farmers of Kansas were not then as prosperous as they
are now. When several bad years came together they didn't like it, and began to make complaints.
Their raucous cries you found very amusing.

The calamity-howler, being ignorant of the laws of political economy and of the conditions
of progress, did not take his calamities in the spirit in which they were offered to him by
the rest of the country. He did not find satisfaction in the thought that other people were
prosperous though he was not. Instead of acting reasonably and voting the straight ticket from
motives of party loyalty, he raised all sorts of irrelevant issues. He treated Prosperity as
if it were a local issue, instead of a plank in the National Platform.

Now, all this was opposed to your good-natured philosophy of progress. You were eminently practical,
and it was a part of your creed never to "go behind the returns." As to Prosperity, it was
"first come, first served." In this land of opportunity the person who first sees an opportunity
should take it, asking no questions as to why he came by it. It is his by right of discovery.

You were always a great believer in the good old American doctrine of Manifest Destiny. This
was a big country and destined to grow bigger. To you bigness was its own excuse for being.
Optimism was as natural as breathing. It was manifest destiny that cities and corporations
and locomotives and armies and navies and national debts and daily newspapers, with their Sunday
supplements, and bank clearances and tariffs and insurance companies and the price of living
should go up. It was all according to a beautiful natural law, "as fire ascending seeks the
sun." Besides these things, it was manifest destiny that other things not so good should grow
bigger also,--graft and slums and foolish luxury. They were all involved in the increasing
bigness of things.

Sometimes you would grumble about them, but in a good-natured way, as one who recognized their
inevitability. Just as you said, boys will be boys, so you said, politicians will be politicians,
and business is business. If one is living in a growing country he must not begrudge the cost
of the incidentals.

In your talk there was a cheerful cynicism which amazed the slower-witted foreigner. You talked
of the pickings and stealings of your elected officers as you would of the pranks of a precocious
youngster. It was all a part of the day's growth. Yet you were really public-spirited. You
would have sprung to arms in a moment if you had thought that your country was in danger or
that its institutions were being undermined.

Your good-natured tolerance was a part of your philosophy of life. It was bound up in your
triumphant Americanism. You were a hero-worshipper, and you delighted in "big men." The big
men who gained the prizes were efficient and unscrupulous and unassuming; that is, they never
assumed to be better than their neighbors. They looked ahead, they saw how things were going,
and went with them. And on the whole, things, you believed, were going well. Though they were
not scrupulously just, these big men were generous, and were willing to give away what they
had acquired. Though grasping, they were not avaricious. They grasped things with the strong
prehensile grasp of the infant, rather than with the clutch of the miser. They took them because
they were there, and not because they had any well-defined idea as to whether they belonged
to them or not.

These big men were very likable. They were engrossed in big projects, and they were doing necessary
work in the development of the country. They naturally took the easiest and most direct methods
to get at results. They would not go out of the way to corrupt a legislature any more than
they would go out of the way to find a range of mountains. But if the mountain stood in the
way of the railroad, they would go through it regardless of expense. If the legislature was
in their way, they would deal with it as best they could. They were willing to pay what it
cost to accomplish a purpose which they believed was good.

Their attitude toward the Public was one which you did not criticize, for it seemed to you
to be reasonable. The Public was an abstraction, like Nature. We are all under the laws of
Nature. But Nature doesn't mind whether we consciously obey or not. She goes her way, and we
go ours. We get all she will let us have. So with the Public. The Public was not regarded as
a person or as an aggregate of persons, it was the potentiality of wealth. They never thought
of the Public as being starved or stunted, or even as being seriously inconvenienced because
of what they took from it, any more than they thought of Nature being the poorer because of
the electricity which they induced to run along their wires. A public franchise was a plum
growing on a convenient tree. A wise man would wait till it was ripe and then, when no one
was looking, would pick it for himself The whole transaction was a trial of wits between rival
pickers. A special privilege, according to this view, involved no special obligations; it was
a reward for special abilities. Once given, it was property to be enjoyed in perpetuity.

This was the code of ethics which you, in common with multitudes of American citizens, accepted.
You have yourself prospered. Indeed, things had gone so well with you in this best of all countries
that any fundamental change seemed unthinkable.

But that a change has come seems evident from your conversation last night. All that fine optimism
which your friends have admired seemed to have deserted you. There was a querulous note which
was strangely out of keeping with your usual disposition. It was what you have been accustomed
to stigmatize as un-American. When you discussed the present state of the country, you talked--you
will pardon me for saying it--for all the world like a calamity-howler.

The country, you said, is in a bad way, and it must be awakened from its lethargy. After a
period of unexampled prosperity and marvelous development, something has happened. Just what
it is you don't really know, but it's very alarming. Instead of working together for Prosperity,
the people are listening to demagogues, and trying all sorts of experiments, half of which
you are sure are unconstitutional. The captains of industry who have made this the biggest
country in the world are thwarted in their plans for further expansion.

There are people who are criticizing the courts, and there are courts which are criticizing
business enterprises that they don't understand. There are so-called experts--mere college
professors--who are tinkering the tariff. There are over-zealous executives who are currying
favor with the crowd by enforcing laws which are well enough on the statute books, but which
were never meant to go further. As if matters were not bad enough already, there are demagogues
who are stirring up class feeling by proposing new laws. Party loyalty is being undermined,
and the new generation doesn't half understand the great issues which have been settled for
all time. It is rashly interested in new issues. For the life of you, you say, you can't understand
what these issues are.

New and divisive questions which lead only to faction are propounded so that the voters are
confused. The great principle of Representative Government, on which the Republic was founded,
is being attacked. Instead of choosing experienced men to direct public policy, there is an
appeal to the passions of the mob. The result of all this agitation is an unsettlement that
paralyzes business. The United States is in danger of losing the race for commercial supremacy.
Germany will forge ahead of us. Japan will catch us. Socialism and the Yellow Peril will be
upon us. The Man on Horseback will appear, and what shall we do then?

I did not understand whether you looked for these perils to come together, or whether they
were to appear in orderly succession. But I came to the conclusion that either the country
is in a bad way, or you are. You will pardon me if I choose the latter alternative, for I too
am an optimistic American, and I like to choose the lesser of two evils. If there is an attack
of "hysteria," I should like to think of it as somewhat localized, rather than having suddenly
attacked the whole country.

Now, my opinion is that the American people were never minding their own business more good-humoredly
and imperturbably than at the present moment. They have been slowly and silently making up
their minds, and now they are beginning to express a deliberate judgment. What you take to
be the noise of demagogues, I consider to be the sober sense of a great people which is just
finding adequate expression.

You seem to be afraid of an impending revolution, and picture it as a sort of French Revolution,
a destructive overturn of all existing institutions. But may not the revolution which we are
passing through be something different,--a great American revolution, which is being carried
through in the characteristic American fashion?

Walt Whitman expresses the great characteristic of American history: "Here is what moves in
magnificent masses careless of particulars."

It is this mass movement, slow at first, but swift and irresistible when the mass has come
to consciousness of its own tendency, which has always confounded astute persons who have been
interested only in particulars. It is a movement like that of the Mississippi at flood-time.
The great river flows within its banks as long as it can. But the time comes when the barriers
are too frail to hold back the mighty waters. Then the river makes, very quickly, a channel
for itself. You cannot understand what has happened till you take into account the magnitude
of the river itself.

Now, the successful man of affairs, who has been intent on the incidents of the passing day,
is often strangely oblivious of the mass movements. You, for example, are disturbed by the
unrest which is manifest, and you look for some one whom you can blame for the disturbance.
But perhaps no one is to blame.

I think that what is happening may be traced to a sufficient cause. We are approaching the
end of one great era in American history and we are preparing, as best we may, for a new era.
The consciousness of the magnitude of the change has come to us rather suddenly. One big job
which has absorbed the energies and stimulated the ambition of Americans for three hundred
years is practically finished. Some work still remains to be done on it, but it no longer demands
the highest ability. The end is in sight.

This work has been the settlement of a vast territory, lying between the Atlantic and Pacific,
with a population of white men. It was a task so big in itself that it fired the imagination
and developed that peculiar type of character which we call American. In its outlines the task
was so broad and simple that it could be comprehended by the most ordinary intelligence. It
was so inevitable that it impressed upon all those engaged in it the belief in Manifest Destiny.

What has been treated by incompetent critics as mere boastfulness has in reality been practical
sagacity and foresight. Sam Slick was only expressing a truth when he said, "The Yankees see
further than most folks." This was not because of any innate cleverness but because of their
advantage in position. Americans have had a more unobstructed view of the future than had the
people of the overcrowded Old World. The settlers on the shores of the Atlantic had behind
them a region which belonged to them and their children. They soon became aware of the riches
of this hinterland and of its meaning for the future. This vast region must be settled. Roads
must be built over the mountains, the forests must be felled, mines must be opened up, farms
must be brought under the plow, great cities must be built by the rivers and lakes, there must
be schools and churches and markets established where now the tribes of Indians roam. The surplus
millions of Europe must be transported to this wilderness.

It was a big task and yet a simple one. The movement was as obvious as that of Niagara--Niagara
is wonderful but inevitable. A great deal of water flowing over a great deal of rock, that
is all there is of it. The destiny of America was equally obvious from the beginning. Here
was a great deal of land which was destined to be inhabited by a great many people. It didn't
matter very much what kind of people they were so that they were healthy and industrious. The
greatness of the country was assured if only there were enough of them.

From the very first the future greatness of the land was seen by open-eyed explorers. They
all were able to appreciate it. Captain John Smith does not compare Virginia with Great Britain;
he compares it to the whole of Europe. After mentioning the natural resources of each country,
he declares that the new land had all these and more, and needed only men to develop them.
And Captain John Smith's forecast has proved to be correct.

In the first half of the last century, a party of twenty young men from Cambridge, Massachusetts,
started on what at that time was a great adventure, the overland journey to Oregon. The preface
to Wyeth's "Oregon Expedition" throws light on the ideas of those who were not statesmen or
captains of industry, but only plain American citizens sharing the vision which was common.

"The spot where our adventurer was born and grew up had many peculiar and desirable advantages
over most others in the County of Middlesex. Besides rich pasturage, numerous dairies, and
profitable orchards, it possessed the luxuries of well-cultivated gardens of all sorts of culinary
vegetables, and all within three miles of Boston Market House, and two miles of the largest
live-cattle market in New England." Besides these blessings there is enumerated "a body of
water commonly called Fresh Pond."

"But Mr. Wyeth said, 'All this availeth me nothing, so long as I read books in which I find
that by going only about four thousand miles overland, from the shore of our Atlantic to the
shore of the Pacific, after we have there entrapped and killed the beavers and otters, we shall
be able, after building vessels for the purpose, to carry our most valuable peltry to China
and Cochin China, our sealskins to Japan, and our superfluous grain to various Asiatic ports,
and lumber to the Spanish settlements on the Pacific; and to become rich by underworking and
underselling the people of Hindustan; and, to crown all, to extend far and wide the traffic
in oil, by killing tame whales on the spot, instead of sailing around the stormy region of
Cape Horn.'

"All these advantages and more were suggested to divers discontented and impatient young men.
Talk to them of the great labor, toil, risk, and they would turn a deaf ear to you; argue with
them and you might as well reason with a snowstorm."

If you would understand the driving power of America, you must understand "the divers discontented
and impatient young men" who in each generation have found in the American wilderness an outlet
for their energies. In the rough contacts with untamed Nature they learned to be resourceful.
Emerson declared that the country went on most satisfactorily, not when it was in the hands
of the respectable Whigs, but when in the hands of "these rough riders--legislators in shirt-sleeves--Hoosier,
Sucker, Wolverine, Badger--or whatever hard-head Arkansas, Oregon, or Utah sends, half-orator,
half-assassin, to represent its wrath and cupidity at Washington."

The men who made America had an "excess of virility." "Men of this surcharge of arterial blood
cannot live on nuts, herb-tea, and elegies; cannot read novels and play whist; cannot satisfy
all their wants at the Thursday Lecture and the Boston Athenæum. They pine for adventure and
must go to Pike's Peak; had rather die by the hatchet of the Pawnee than sit all day and every
day at the counting-room desk. They are made for war, for the sea, for mining, hunting, and
clearing, and the joy of eventful living."

In Emerson's day there was ample scope for all these varied energies on the frontier. "There
are Oregons, Californias, and Exploring Expeditions enough appertaining to America to find
them in files to gnaw and crocodiles to eat."

But it must have occurred to some one to ask, "What will happen when the Oregons and Californias
are filled up?" Well, the answer is, "See what is happening now." Instead of settling down
to herb-tea and elegies, Young America, having finished one big job, is looking for another.
The noises which disturb you are not the cries of an angry proletariat, but are the shouts
of eager young fellows who are finding new opportunities. They have the same desire to do big
things, the same joy in eventful living, that you had thirty years ago. Only the tasks that
challenge them have taken a different form.

When you hear the words "Conservation," "Social Service," "Social Justice," and the like, you
are apt to dismiss them as mere fads. You think of the catchwords of ineffective reformers
whom you have known from your youth. But the fact is that they represent to-day the enthusiasms
of a new generation. They are big things, with big men behind them. They represent the Oregons
and Californias toward which sturdy pioneers are moving, undeterred by obstacles.

The live questions to-day concern not the material so much as the moral development of the
nation. For it is seen that the future welfare of the people depends on the creation of a finer
type of civic life. Is this still to be a land of opportunity? Ninety millions of people are
already here. What shall be done with the next ninety millions? That wealth is to increase
goes without saying. But how is it to be distributed? Are we tending to a Plutocracy, or can
a real Democracy hold its own? Powerful machinery has been invented. How can this machinery
be controlled and used for truly human ends? We have learned the economies that result from
organization. Who is to get the benefit of these economies?

So long as such questions were merely academic, practical persons like yourself paid little
attention to them. Now they are being asked by persons as practical as yourself who are intent
on 'getting results.' And what is more, they employ the instruments of precision furnished
by modern science.

You have been pleased over the millions of dollars which have been lavished on education. The
fruits of this are now being seen. Hosts of able young men have been studying Government and
Sociology and Economics and History. These have been the most popular courses in all our colleges.
And they have been studied in a new way. The old formulas and the old methods have been fearlessly
criticized. New standards of efficiency have been presented. The scientific method has been
extended to the sphere of moral relations. It has been demonstrated to these young men that
the resources of the country may be indefinitely increased by the continuous application of
trained intelligence to definite ends. The old Malthusian doctrine has given way before applied
science. The population may be doubled and the standard of living increased at the same time,
if we plan intelligently. The expert can serve the public as efficiently as he has served private
interests, if only the public can be educated to appreciate him, and persuaded to employ him.

This is what the "social unrest" means in America. It is not the unrest of the weak and the
unsuccessful. It is the unrest of the strong and ambitious. You cannot still it by talking
about prosperity: of course we are prosperous, after a fashion, but it is a fashion that no
longer pleases us. We want something better and we propose to get it. What disturbs you is
the appearance in force of a generation that has turned its attention to a new set of problems,
and is attempting to solve them by scientific methods. It is believed that there is a Science
of Government as well as an Art of Politics. The new generation has a respect, born of experience,
for the expert. It seeks the man who knows rather than the clever manager. It demands of public
servants not simply that they be honest, but that they be efficient.

Its attitude to the political boss is decidedly less respectful than that to which you were
accustomed. You looked upon him as a remarkably astute character, and you attributed to him
an uncanny ability to forecast the future. These young men have discovered that his ability
is only a vulgar error. Remove the conditions created by public indifference and ignorance,
and he vanishes. In restoring power to the people, they find that a hundred useful things can
be done which the political wiseacres declared to be impossible.

When I consider the new and vigorous forces in American life I cannot agree with your apprehensions;
but there is one thing which you said with which I heartily agree. You said that you wished
we might settle down to sound and constructive work, and get rid of the "muck-raker."

I agree with you that the muck-raker stands in the way of large plans for betterment. But it
might be well to refresh our minds in regard to what is really meant by the man with the muck-rake.
He is not the man who draws our attention to abuses which can be abolished by determined effort.
He is the man who apologizes for abuses that are profitable to himself. He prefers his petty
interests to any ideal good.

The man with the muck-rake, then, is one who can look no way but downward, and is so intent
on collecting riches for himself that he does not see or regard any higher interests. I agree
with you that if we are to have any constructive work in American society the first thing is
to get rid of the man with the muck-rake, and to put in his place the Man with a Vision.

"Common sense enriched by culture describes everything which Dean, or, as he ought now to be
called, President, Briggs says or writes. The genius of sanity, sound judgment, and high aim
seems to preside over his thought, and he combines in an unusual degree the faculty of vision
and the power of dealing with real things in a real way."--The Outlook, New York.

"With the soundest good sense and with frequent humorous flashes, Dean Briggs takes students

World's Work, New York. 

He is the Heir of God.

The same is said of us as believers.

       We are heirs of God and joint heirs with the Lord Jesus Christ.

God has put us, according to the good pleasure of His will in Christ,
in the place of sons and because He has made us sons He has made us
heirs.

 It is full of wisdom and of
beauty, of delicate delineation, and of inspiring sentiment" New York Times.

throughout." The Outlook, New York.
