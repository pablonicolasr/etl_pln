The Young Wireless Operator--As A Fire Patrol. While the
father drank the wind by setting the wheel of fortune at the gaming room of the Olive, multiplied
girls, real peddlers of themselves, always with the merchandise her beauty slopes squares,
churches, walks, dances and theater. So do boys and trees. When a boy gets to love the forest and
can live in it, that is best of all. For the forest makes real boys and real men.

Not only does the forest do that, but it keeps the Nation alive. No one can eat a meal without
the help of the forest, for it takes more than half the wood cut every year in the United States
to enable the farmer to grow the food and the fibres to feed and clothe the Nation. 

Refugio believed that he visited Mrs. Bringas, yielding at last to their bodies, to view the
articles in your industry.

"You've come a bit late - he said -. Do you know that I'm selling everything? I'm no good for
this. Do not know what I was thinking about my sister when I did I could get Trader ... For you
to take charge ... since I'm in, I have not done more than lose money, just pay, and I have no
genius to bother ... So quit sooner of these rags, the better.

Many women have come, and go taking what little I have left. "

- However - Rosalie said, pulling a box number and aigrettes marabouts and other links and cords
- there are still some very nice here.

- Do you like you said these aigrettes ?...-- Refugio, joyful to be
lavish with it -.

You can take them ... is the gift.

- Oh, no ... missing no more ...

- Yes, yes, I have much pleasure in it.

For some I buy it and not
pay, it is better ... Look here - said going to the room - I also
give this hat is not fixed, but can you take the tape you want.

Rosalia,
this generosity astonished and somewhat willing to look with eyes
more Refugio benevolent, insisted on rejecting the gifts.

"Do I snubs
you because I am poor?" - He said with steely counterclaim. For the men and boys who love the forest and understand it are of the kind
without whom great nations are impossible.

The Young Wireless Operator--As a Fire Patrol

Chapter I

Vacation Plans

Charley Russell sat before a table in the workshop in his father's back yard. In front of him
were the shining instruments of his wireless outfit--his coupler, his condenser, his helix,
his spark-gap, and the other parts, practically all of which he had made with his own hands.
Ordinarily he would have looked at them fondly, but now he gave them hardly a thought. He was
waiting for his chum, Lew Heinsling, and his mind was busy with the problem of his own future.
Charley was a senior in high school and was pondering over the question of what the world had
in store for him. While he sat meditating, Lew arrived. In his hand was a copy of the <i>New
York Sun and Herald</i>. He held it out to Charley and pointed to the marine news.

"The <i>Lycoming</i> reaches New York to-day," he said. "Roy will send us a wireless message
to-night. Gee! I wish we had a battery strong enough to talk back."

But Charley paid slight heed to the suggestion. Instead he said: "Roy Mercer's a lucky dog.
Think of being the wireless man on a big ocean steamer when you're only nineteen. I wish I
knew what I am going to do after I graduate from high school."

Roy Mercer, like Charley and Lew, was a member of the Camp Brady Wireless Patrol. With his
fellows he had taken part in the capture of the German spies who were trying to dynamite the
Elk City reservoir and so wreck a great munitions centre during the war; and with three other
members of the Wireless Patrol, especially selected for their skill in wireless, he had later
gone to New York with their leader, Captain Hardy, to assist the government Secret Service
in its search for the secret wireless that was keeping the German Admiralty informed of the
movements of American vessels. This was the false prophet who had started the hope
of being a parent, to reach the dignity that seemed higher. Outside and wants, Don Venancio came,
as usual, shouting, scolding, saying she did not respond to anything because it was called later.
 It was always a one-sided
conversation, however, because none of the boys in the Wireless Patrol owned a battery powerful
enough to carry a message from Central City to New York. Just now each lad was engaged in trying
to earn money so that the club could buy a battery or dynamo strong enough for this purpose.
So each boy was working at any job he could pick up after school, and saving all he earned.
Both Charley and Lew had already earned more than their share of the purchase money.

"You never can tell what will happen," said Lew presently. "Who ever expected Roy to get the
job he has? You may land in another just as good. You stand pretty near the head of your class,
and everybody knows you're a corking good wireless operator."

"I can tell well enough what will happen, Lew. The minute I'm out of high school, I'll have
to go to work with Dad in Miller's factory. Gee! How I hate the place! Think of working nine
hours a day in such a dirty, smoky, noisy old hole, where you can't get a breath of fresh air,
or see the sky, or hear the birds. Just to think about it is enough to make a fellow feel blue."

"But maybe you won't have to go into the factory at all," argued Lew. Sailing
to Barcelona ... In short, the last straw. "

This was on 19. Bringas went home more dead than alive. All day and the following was as parallel,
not eating, not sleeping, not to ask for more news, embracing almost crying that brought the friendly,
fire shrift to the related conditions. The poor man, oblivious of all, they forgot how to managing
your home. If those days saw his wife Empress of Golconda, looks
and runs so cool.

With the loss of appetite trastornose nature. Frankly, there was reason to fear it a serious disturbance.
He walked with difficulty pronouncing some words clumsily, and the
organ of vision had returned to its old tricks, changing and coloring
in a strange objects. He says he's supported me for more than
eighteen years and now I have to help him for a year or two anyway."

"That's a shame!" cried Lew.

"No, it isn't, Lew," explained Charley. "It's all right about helping Dad. He's been mighty
good to me, and he's in the hole now. You see, Dad and Mother have been married twenty years
and Dad's worked hard all this time and saved his money to build a house. And just about the
time Dad was ready to begin building, prices began to go up. Dad held off, thinking they would
drop. But they got higher instead, and finally Dad told the carpenters to go ahead, lest prices
should go higher still. Now the house is going to cost almost double what Dad expected it would,
and the awful prices of everything else take every cent Dad can earn. With such a big mortgage
on the place, Dad says he's just got to have my help or he may lose the house and all he has
saved in those twenty years. It's all right about helping Dad, Lew. I want to do that, but
I can't bear to think of going to work in that factory."

"It's too bad, Charley. Said a gentleman I
know that this is a carnival every day, in which the poor are rich dress. And here, except half
a dozen, all are poor. Facha, ma'am, and nothing more than facade. These people knows no indoor
facilities. But Dad will need every
cent I can earn until I am twenty-one, and I can't see how I can possibly go to college."

"Never mind, Charley. You never can tell what will happen. Look at Roy. He was worse off than
you are, for his father died suddenly and Roy had to care for both himself and his mother.
And see what came of it. He isn't much older than we are, yet he's got a fine job. Just keep
your eyes open and you may pick up something, too."

"It'll have to come quick, then," sighed Charley. "Here it is almost Easter vacation, and I
am to graduate in June. This will probably be the last vacation I shall have in a long time."

"Then let's enjoy this vacation. I've been thinking what we could do, and it occurred to me
that it would be lots of fun for the Wireless Patrol to make a trip up the river to that old
camp of ours. It won't be too cold to camp out if we take out our tents and our little collapsible
stoves. Suckers ought to be running good and we can catch a fine mess of fish, take a hike
or two, and have a bully trip up the river and back. Let's go tell the rest of the fellows."

Lew jumped up and started for the door. Then he stopped suddenly and a look of disappointment
came over his face. "I'll bet none of 'em can go," he said. "They've all got jobs for the vacation.
I'm glad we've got our money earned."

"I just thought of another difficulty," sighed Charley. "Not one of us owns a boat."

"We can borrow one," said Lew.

"I hate to borrow things," replied Charley. "You remember how I borrowed old man Packer's bob-sled
and broke it and then had to pay to have it remade. No more borrowing for me."

"Why can't we make a boat? There's plenty of time between now and vacation. If we do the work
ourselves, it oughtn't to cost more than two or three dollars and then we'd have a boat of
our own."

"Bully!" cried Charley. "We can make it as good as anybody. We'll do it."

"All right. I'll go down-town and find the price of oars and rowlocks, and you go over to Hank
Cooley's and find out how his father made that boat of his. It's a dandy and just what we need."

The two boys rushed off in opposite directions, each full of enthusiasm over the plan to build
a new boat and make a trip up the river during their Easter vacation.

Chapter II

What Came of Them

A few hours later Charley Russell again sat before the bench in the little wireless house in
his father's yard. Minghetti
Whenever he returned to the scene, the Kings rehearsed repetition of the set that had known
him well, and more often with success, for, outside chance, or the singer had the habit of
looking far to the boxes and look at who admired him, and Flirting all kinds of roles and circumstances
scenic, it was requested that pleasure Twins Emma and renewed in several of the most serious perils
and worries of the opera and that that would not stop nagging baritone with the Queen, always
desperate to escape to France on the other.

Bonis not get over his amazement to notice, much to his delight, that Emma could not speak because
of the treble or boots, a true anachronism, as he put it very well, or anything that remotely could
refer to what he called "the powder of rice."

After the opera, they returned home the Valcárcel, or if you like the Kings, but more typical
is the Valcárcel for the little master of his house that was Bonifacio, bye marriage Nepomuceno,
who lay maturing his plans for the future that, or he saw wrong, or had inklings of a change had
not without dangers. And when Reyes was going to ask permission his wife to retire to his
room also, Emma is the idea of ​​making use ... what relations that
marriage could be called the royal prerogative.

- Look, Bonis, I
have no dream, and the sound of music has put me head like a drum
... I will be unveiled, and wakes up alone and nervous, I fear.

There was a moment of silence, and then continued:

- Stay with you.

Were in the cabinet of the queen. She was stripped of her jewels before the mirror of her dressing
table, lighting by two pink candles. Her husband saw her portrayed by the glass background
mysterious and moving shadows. Without that he would realize how and why, that "Stick you" suddenly
made him look his wife with eyes of a judge of beauty. Strange! Until that moment I had not noticed
that Emma had taken over many years that night, especially at that time, did not seem like a
beautiful woman, fresh, and there was no factions perfection or vigor, but had a lot of expression,
the same weariness of the face; some kind of elegy that sings the face of a nervous, passionate
woman who loses the smoothness of the skin and seems to mourn alone the weight of years, the
complicated history revealing the emerging sentimental grooves temples and starting to take shape
under eyes, the intensity of this letter, deep and painful look, which contrasts with the tension
of certain factions, with the inertia of the lips and cheeks dry: these and other signs seemed to
Bonis romantic attractions of his wife at the time, and the imperative to stay you flattered him
the esteem and the senses, after a long time had happened without Emma exercises the royal prerogative.

For
the second time lover Serafina had remorse for his infidelity in sin.

His great passion excused in the eyes of those Bonis illicit relations with the comic, but
from the time he missed a Serafina, leaving interest by fiendishly faded charms, but expressive
and melancholy, full of fire concentrated, their legitimate wife, it was proved that the alleged
passion was not so great, and, likewise, was less excusable. Be that as it happened that Bonis began
to take off his suit English in the cabinet of his wife was left without coat or vest, wearing
braces silk and white shirt front and smooth, with three coral buttons, and in this prosaic
but familiar attire, turned to Emma smiling, licking his dry lips, fuming through the eyes,
and looked serious and quiet and sturdy neck color milk from her husband. Bonis he was desired,
it was explained, as in the light of lightning, the scene of that Night of the rice powder; read
his wife's face periodic weakness, a weakness female, as female passenger submission to the
male, also a mysterious and strange corruption no name: all this took to flight, confusingly,
was the sudden awareness of a certain Acting superiority, shooting, and fired by his own whim, for
the excitations interesting that beautiful sunset, or rather, desire, is illuminated with Emma, ​​produced
on it, threw a daring outrageous, and it was that suddenly dropped to his knees front of his
wife, he embraced the starched whiteness, which creaked against his chest, and his voice faltering
with emotion, choppy and deaf, said a thousand follies of passion talkative, that overflows first
by the words slang words of lust in love, in diminutives, as he had learned with all my heart
in dealing with the Gorgheggi.


"They'll do all right," assented Charley, after examining the boards. "What do they cost a
hundred?"

"Ten dollars."

"Ten dollars!" cried Charley in consternation. Then a smile came on his face. "Quit your kidding,"
he said. "What <i>do</i> they come at?"

"Ten dollars," replied the lumber dealer soberly.

The two boys stared at him incredulously.

"Impossible!" cried Lew. "What are they <i>really</i> worth?"

"Ten dollars," replied the man. His voice was sharp and a frown had gathered on his forehead.
"Ten dollars, and cheap at that."

Charley turned to his companion with a look of dismay. "We can never build our boat with wood
at such a price," he cried. "With five dollars to pay for oars, and two dollars for paint,
and some more for nails and rowlocks, and lock and chain, the boat would cost eighteen or twenty
dollars just for the materials. That's three times as much as we have got."

After an instant the look on Charley's face changed to one of intense indignation. He had a
quick temper, and now he turned to the lumber dealer in anger.

"I guess the sugar profiteers are not the only ones who ought to be in the penitentiary," he
said hotly. "You can keep your old boards. And I hope they rot for you."

Then he turned on his heel and started toward the gate, followed by Lew.

"Come back here!"

The words rang out sharp and sudden. The voice was commanding and compelling. Involuntarily
the two boys turned back. The lumber dealer stood before them, his face ablaze with indignation.
Under his fiery glances the boys were speechless. For a moment the man said nothing. Evidently
he was struggling with his temper. When he had gotten control of himself he spoke. His voice
was deep and low, but harsh and cutting.

"Before you make a fool of yourself again, young man," he said, speaking directly to Charley,
"you had better know what you are talking about. You called me a profiteer for asking $100
a thousand feet for those cedar boards. Young man, those boards cost me $90 a thousand in the
cars at the station. That leaves me a margin of $10 a thousand for handling them. Out of that
I have to pay to have the boards hauled from the station, pay for insurance on them, pay their
proportionate share of overhead expense, and pay for hauling them to customers. How much of
that $10 do you think is left for profit? So little it almost requires a microscope to see
it. I have to handle a good many hundred feet of lumber to make as much as the cheapest sort
of laborer gets for a day's pay. The fact is, young man, that far from profiteering on that
lumber, I am selling it at a smaller profit than I ever sold any lumber before in my life.
Some lumber I am handling at a loss. But in these critical days, with factories closing everywhere,
and men by the thousands being thrown out of work, the best thing a man can do, either for
himself or for his country, is to keep business moving. That's why I am selling lumber without
profit."

Charley was suddenly abashed. "I'm awfully sorry I called you a profiteer," he said humbly.
"I beg your pardon."

"It's all right, young man," said the lumber dealer, a smile once more lighting up his face.
"You are too young to understand how critical the business situation really is. But be careful
in future how you call people names."

"I certainly will," agreed Charley. "But I'd like to know this. Who <i>is</i> profiteering
in lumber? Who is responsible for such terrible prices?"

"Well, there <i>has</i> been profiteering in lumber, as in everything else. But there is a
real reason why the price of lumber is so high, and that is the scarcity of timber."

"Scarcity!" cried Charley incredulously. "Why, the forests are full of timber."

"And what is it like?" demanded the lumber dealer. "Go out to the forests and look at it. There's
nothing but little poles that will scarcely make six-inch boards. We don't produce one-fourth
of the lumber we use in this state, and we are using wood ten times as fast as our forests
are growing it."

"I thought Pennsylvania was a great lumbering state," protested Lew.

"For a good many years it led the nation in the production of lumber, young man, but now it
ranks twentieth among the states. If only fire could be kept out of the forests, we might some
day raise our own timber again. But the lumbermen chopped down the big trees and fire has destroyed
the little ones and even burned the forest soil so that nothing grows in it again. We have
not only destroyed our forests, but we have so injured the land that new trees do not grow
to take the place of those we cut."

The two boys stared at the lumberman in amazement. "Where <i>do</i> we get our lumber from?"
demanded Lew.

"Practically all of it comes from the South. That's one reason lumber costs so much here. The
people of Pennsylvania pay $25,000,000 a year in freight charges on the lumber they use. That's
one of the reasons those cedar boards you were looking at cost so much. When the new freight
rates go into effect the cost of hauling our lumber to us will be something like $40,000,000
a year."

The two boys were very thoughtful as they made their way back to Charley's shop.

"What are people going to do for wood pretty soon?" Lew inquired of his companion. "If we can't
build a little boat because the wood costs too much, how are people going to get homes and
furniture and wagons and motor-cars and a thousand other things? Seems to me pretty much everything
we use is made of wood."

"I don't know," replied Charley. "But what bothers me more just now is to know what we are
going to do during Easter vacation. It may be the last vacation I shall ever have, and I'd
like to have a good time."

"Why not follow the lumber dealer's suggestion and go out to the forests? Easter doesn't come
this year until after the trout season opens. We could go out to our old camp in the mountains
and spend the vacation there, fishing and hiking."

"That's a mighty good suggestion, Lew. If we have our packs ready, we can start from high school
the minute it is dismissed. We can make that early afternoon train and get off at that little
flag-station at the foot of Stone Mountain. Then we can hike through the notch and reach the
far slope of Old Ironsides before dark. We shall have to camp overnight along the run from
the spring there, as it is the only water for miles around. Then the next day we can go on
into that little valley where we saw so many trout. That is so hard to reach that not many
fishermen ever go there. The little stream from the spring on Old Ironsides runs into that
brook. Do you remember what lots of little trout we saw not far below the spring? They will
have become big fellows by this time and moved down into the larger stream. There ought to
be some fine fishing there this spring."

"They say it's an ill wind that blows nobody good. I'm sorry we can't build the boat, but we
shall have just as good a time in the mountains as we should have had on the river. We'll borrow
that little pup tent of Johnnie Lee's, and take our blankets, hatchets, fishing-rods, and grub."

"I'd rather leave the tent at home and build a lean-to after we get there. Then we could take
a portable wireless outfit and talk to the fellows at home here in the evening. Half a dozen
dry cells would give us one-sixth of a kilowatt of current, and that ought to carry a message
twenty-five or thirty miles easily. At night we might be able to talk fifty miles. We can carry
six cells easily. The remainder of the outfit won't weigh much. We'll have to go as light as
we can, for it's a mighty tough hike over Old Ironsides and on into that little valley."

"Shall we take our pistols?" asked Charley.

"We'd better have at least one. You never can tell when you're going to need a pistol in the
forest. Remember the time that bear treed me on the first hike of the Wireless Patrol? I don't
ever want to get into another situation like that without something to shoot with."

Charley chuckled. "It wasn't a pistol that saved you then," he smiled, "but Willie Brown and
his spark-gap."

"Then we'll be doubly armed," replied Lew. "Since you have so much faith in wireless, you can
carry the outfit. I'll pack the gun. We're almost certain to have some kind of adventure, for
every time the Wireless Patrol or any of its members venture into the woods, something exciting
happens."

Chapter III

Off to the Mountains

Busy, indeed, were the succeeding ten days. It was all kinds of rogues nerves, those devils that play in disturbing the ladies who,
if not help them in their dissimulation. The unease positive Bringas was that of sadness, fear
of everything and the slightest cause, loss of appetite, mainly a special and very new to consider
your husband. If the estimate that he felt there was a considerable decrease, the outward forms
of respect and accused some refinement study. A number of trials are given this, but unable
to put in light of evidence the causes of such sybaritic external affections, we must resort to the
hypothesis, and see in them something akin to the blandishments that are used for religious
instruction to an employee of Customs when you want to smuggle. Rosalia proved peaceful and venal
system for the stash their rags. Was gradually displaying them. Every day repairing D. Francisco
something new, locking a discussion that she was trying to appease with graceful touch and lies and
sweetish terms. But not always succeed, and the honest gentleman came to be seriously worried those
going out to scuttle luxuries, such as theaters surprises. More than once he said inflexible
demand explanations, ready to hear them with an array of logic shaking device to which the
wife as a criminal before testing. But she went gradually tanning, or rather, shielding against
that control irrelevant.
 Then all were stowed away in the pack bags, together
with the food supplies. The two blankets were tightly folded and tied, ready to be slung over
the shoulders. Long before that last session of school, everything was in readiness. When finally
that last session was over, the two lads had only to strap their packs on their backs, sling
their blankets into place, and pick up their little fishing-rods, unjointed and compactly packed
in cloth cases. Lew buckled the pistol to his belt and suspended the canteen from his shoulder,
while Charley sheathed his little axe and hung it on his hip. Then, completely ready, the two
lads waved farewell to their envious comrades and hastened away to the train. In less than
an hour the train stopped to let them off at the little flag-station at the foot of Stone Mountain.
In a moment more it had gone whistling around the shoulder of the hill, leaving the two boys
alone on the edge of the wilderness.

Quickly they adjusted their packs and started back along the railroad-track toward the gap
through which they were to pass to Old Ironsides. Rapidly they made their way along the road-bed.

"We'd better hustle while the going's good," commented Lew, glancing at the heavy clouds that
obscured the sun, "for it will get dark early to-night. It'll be slow enough going once we
leave the track."

"There's one thing sure," replied Charley. "We won't be bothered with wet ground. I think I
never saw the earth so dry at this season of the year. There was almost no snow last winter
and we've hardly had a rain this spring. Usually it rains every day at this time of year."

Charley's prediction proved true. When the boys at last reached the notch in the mountains
and left the railroad-track, they found the way almost as dry as a village street. Years before,
the timber had been cut from Stone Mountain, and a logging trail had passed up the very gap
through which the boys were now traveling. But brush and brambles had come in soon after the
lumbermen left and now a thick stand of saplings also helped to choke the path. The briars
tore at the boys' clothing and blankets. The bushy growths caught in their packs and straps
and wrapped themselves about their feet and legs. Very quickly it became evident that a hard
struggle lay before them.

Back from the trail, in the forest proper, there was little underbrush, but the stand of young
trees was dense and the way underfoot was so rough and uneven that it was almost impossible
to make any headway there. For Stone Mountain was a stone mountain in very truth. It appeared
to be just one enormous heap of rocks and boulders. In a very little while both boys were perspiring
profusely from their efforts, and both were conscious that they were tiring fast; for the grade
up the notch was steep.

"Gee!" said Lew, at last. You try with all the knights of the human race. Is there
no one you pull, a slap, all your remaining teeth, and which, incidentally, they are beautiful?
".

- Yes, it is now - he said confidently Refuge - a change of scenery
... Go with God. As they rested, they looked sharply
about them. They could see for some distance through the naked forest. The tree trunks stood
straight and tall, and seemed to be crowded as close together as pickets on a fence.

"This sure is a fine stand of poles," remarked Lew, "but it's just as that lumber dealer said.
There isn't a tree in it that would make a board wider than six inches. But there's some good
timber farther back in the mountains. Do you remember the fine stand of pines in that little
valley we're heading for? When we were there three years ago there hadn't been a tree cut in
that valley. There must be millions and millions of feet of lumber there."

"And do you remember," replied Charley, "how dark it was under those pines, and how cold the
water in the run was, and what schools of trout we saw? Gee! I wish it had been trout season
then! Having
qualms before this girl ...!». Finally, both struggled, the words came stumbling. The poor are
fanned, feigning lack of interest in the matter, and made efforts to appear calm and drive
away from her cheeks with the gush of blood.

"Well ... For now, Refugio, let's talk about something else.

I have come to ask a favor. "

- A favor? - Said the other with vivid curiosity.

- A favor, yes
- added Bringas, whom curiosity that puzzled a bit -.

Ie if you can, if not, do not talk.
- You say ...

- Well ... that is, if you can - continued the lady,
swallowing the bile that troubled him -. I need a number. Charley took a good drink and passed the canteen silently back to his chum.

"If you didn't really know it was the brook," said Lew, "you'd be willing to swear you could
hear somebody talking. You can hear voices just as plain as can be. And you can almost make
out what they say. Many a time I've caught myself listening hard to try to make out the words,
when I heard a brook talking."

"It's no wonder people get scared and pretty nearly go crazy when they are lost in the forest,"
replied Lew. "Without half trying, you can imagine the forest is full of people or spooks or
animals or something, creeping up behind your back."

Lew bent down and once more filled the canteen. He corked it tight and dipped it bodily into
the run to wet the cloth cover, so that the water within would be kept cool by evaporation.
Then he slung the canteen over his shoulder.

"I never saw a mountain stream so low at this time of the year," he remarked, as he followed
his companion up the trail. "You might think it was August. But with no snow to melt and no
rainfall this spring, it isn't to be wondered at."

On they went up the trail. For a long time neither boy spoke. The brambles still tore at their
clothes and the bushes tripped them. In places the young saplings were so dense that to force
a way among them was a difficult task. Their packs began to grow very heavy. But they had one
advantage. As Charley had suggested, the ground was perfectly dry. 

The maid, indeed, had his reasons for not wonder as much as others, first because the lady was
crazy for her day our daily bread, and some crazy things of a kind intimate, secret, others did
not know, and also was amazed least because know some background. Boards had been to the theater
nights ago, to the pan, dressed the two craft.

This was what I knew Bonis; this, and what he had seen, heard and felt that his wife night of the
escape, and had then imagined, and desired, and projected.

They arrived at the theater, and the entry of Emma in her box was
much more effect than it could have figured. Moreover, she had not
thought of that. Practically nothing grew in
this deep shade, so that the space above the spring was open and free from bushes. On the trunk
of this giant hemlock, where it could be seen by all who came to the spring, was a white sign
that read:

  <i>Everybody loses when timber burns.</i>
  Pennsylvania Department of Forestry.

"After our fight with the forest fire, when we were in camp at Fort Brady, they don't need
to tell any member of the Wireless Patrol to be careful with fire," observed Lew. "But there
are lots of people who do need to be warned."

At first it was choked with briars and bushes. But suddenly they found the trail open. It had
been cleared of all obstructions and enlarged until it was several feet wide. Even the roots
of the bushes had been grubbed out, so that the path was smooth and clean. The cut saplings
and brush had been burned in the trail itself, but the work had been done so carefully that
never a tree had been scorched. Even the marks of fire had been obliterated by the subsequent
grubbing of the roots. I called D. Maj. Benito Don Benito to distinguish the Lesser another scribe,
