"Glucose," by Geo. W. Rolfe (Scientific American Supplement, May 15 or November 6, 1915, and
in Boger's "Industrial Chemistry").

On making ethyl alcohol from wood, see Bulletin No. 110, Special Agents' Series, Department
of Commerce (10 cents), and an article by F.W. Kressmann in Metallurgical and Chemical Engineering,
July 15, 1916. On the manufacture and uses of industrial alcohol the Department of Agriculture
has issued for free distribution Farmer's Bulletin 269 and 424, and Department Bulletin 182.

On the "Utilization of Corn Cobs," see Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, Nov.,
1918. For John Winthrop's experiment, see the same Journal, Jan., 1919.

CHAPTER XI

President Scherer's "Cotton as a World Power" (Stokes, 1916) is a fascinating volume that combines
the history, science and politics of the plant and does not ignore the poetry and legend.

In the Yearbook of the Department of Agriculture for 1916 will be found an interesting article
by H.S. Bailey on "Some American Vegetable Oils" (sold separate for five cents), also "The
Peanut: A Great American Food" by same author in the Yearbook of 1917. "The Soy Bean Industry"
is discussed in the same volume. See also: Thompson's "Cottonseed Products and Their Competitors
in Northern Europe" (Part I, Cake and Meal; Part II, Edible Oils. Department of Commerce, 10
cents each). "Production and Conservation of Fats and Oils in the United States" (Bulletin
No. 769, 1919, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture). "Cottonseed Meal for Feeding Cattle" (U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Farmer's Bulletin 655, free). "Cottonseed Industry in Foreign Countries," by
T.H. Norton, 1915 (Department of Commerce, 10 cents). "Cottonseed Products" in Journal of the
Society of Chemical Industry, July 16, 1917, and Baskerville's article in the same journal
(1915, vol. 7, p. 277). Dunstan's "Oil Seeds and Feeding Cakes," a volume on British problems
since the war. Ellis's "The Hydrogenation of Oils" (Van Nostrand, 1914). Copeland's "The Coconut"
(Macmillan). Barrett's "The Philippine Coconut Industry" (Bulletin No. 25, Philippine Bureau
of Agriculture). "Coconuts, the Consols of the East" by Smith and Pope (London). "All About
Coconuts" by Belfort and Hoyer (London). Numerous articles on copra and other oils appear in
U.S. Commerce Reports and Philippine Journal of Science. "The World Wide Search for Oils" in
The Americas (National City Bank, N.Y.). "Modern Margarine Technology" by W. Clayton in Journal
Society of Chemical Industry, Dec. 5, 1917; also see Scientific American Supplement, Sept.
21, 1918. A court decision on the patent rights of hydrogenation is given in Journal of Industrial
and Engineering Chemistry for December, 1917. The standard work on the whole subject is Lewkowitsch's
"Chemical Technology of Oils, Fats and Waxes" (3 vols., Macmillan, 1915).

CHAPTER XII

A full account of the development of the American Warfare Service has been published in the
Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry in the monthly issues from January to August,
1919, and an article on the British service in the issue of April, 1918. See also Crowell's
Report on "America's Munitions," published by War Department. Scientific American, March 29,
1919, contains several articles. A. Russell Bond's "Inventions of the Great War" (Century)
contains chapters on poison gas and explosives.

Lieutenant Colonel S.J.M. Auld, Chief Gas Officer of Sir Julian Byng's army and a member of
the British Military Mission to the United States, has published a volume on "Gas and Flame
in Modern Warfare" In May, 1888, Mr. C. J. Jones again visited this region for the purpose
of capturing buffaloes alive.

His party found, from first to last, thirty-seven buffaloes, of which
they captured eighteen head, eleven adult cows and seven calves; the
greatest feat ever accomplished in buffalo-hunting.

It is highly probable that Mr. Jones and his men saw about all the buffaloes now living in the Pan-handle
country, and it therefore seems quite certain that not over twenty-five individuals remain.
 "Applications of Electrolysis in
Chemical Industry" by A.F. Hall (Longmans). For recent work on artificial diamonds see Scientific
American Supplement, Dec. 8, 1917, and August 24, 1918. On acetylene see "A Storehouse of Sleeping
Energy" by J.M. Morehead in Scientific American, January 27, 1917.

CHAPTER XIV

Spring's "Non-Technical Talks on Iron and Steel" (Stokes) is a model of popular science writing,
clear, comprehensive and abundantly illustrated. Tilden's "Chemical Discovery in the Twentieth
Century" must here again be referred to. The Encyclopedia Britannica is convenient for reference
on the various metals mentioned; see the article on "Lighting" for the Welsbach burner. The
annual "Mineral Resources of the United States, Part I," contains articles on the newer metals
by Frank W. Hess; see "Tungsten" in the volume for 1914, also Bulletin No. 652, U.S. Geological
Survey, by same author. Foote-Notes, the house organ of the Foote Mineral Company, Philadelphia,
gives information on the rare elements. Interesting advertising literature may be obtained
from the Titantium Alloy Manufacturing Company, Niagara Falls, N.Y.; Duriron Castings Company,
Dayton, O.; Buffalo Foundry and Machine Company, Buffalo, N.Y., manufacturers of "Buflokast"
acid-proof apparatus, and similar concerns. The following additional references may be useful:

journal, Feb., 1918; Welsbach mantles in Journal Franklin Institute, v. 14, p. 401, 585; pure
