Note.

The probability that the most accurate method of determining the solar parallax now available
is that resting on the measurement of the velocity of light, has led to the acceptance of the
following paper as one of the series having in view the increase of our knowledge of the celestial
motions. They saw the guns of that little army come from their shoulders to a slanting position
across the breast--arms aport! It was the habit of the Guard to go into action at arms aport.
What had Dorsenne, Le Beau Dorsenne, said on that famous day? At the suggestion of the writer, the paper was reconstructed with a
fuller general discussion of the processes, and with the omission of some of the details of
individual experiments.

To prevent a possible confusion of this determination of the velocity of light with another
now in progress under official auspices, it may be stated that the credit and responsibility
for the present paper rests with Master Michelson.

Experimental Determination of the Velocity of Light.

By Albert A. Michelson, Master, U.S.N.

Introduction.

In Cornu's elaborate memoir upon the determination of the velocity of light, several objections
are made to the plan followed by Foucault, which will be considered in the latter part of this
work. It may, however, be stated that the most important among these was that the deflection
was too small to be measured with the required degree of accuracy. In order to employ this
method, therefore, it was absolutely necessary that the deflection should be increased.

In November, 1877, a modification of Foucault's arrangement suggested itself, by which this
result could be accomplished. Between this time and March of the following year a number of
preliminary experiments were performed in order to familiarize myself with the optical arrangements.
The first experiment tried with the revolving mirror produced a deflection considerably greater
than that obtained by Foucault. Thus far the only apparatus used was such as could be adapted
from the apparatus in the laboratory of the Naval Academy.

At the expense of $10 a revolving mirror was made, which could execute 128 turns per second.
The apparatus was installed in May, 1878, at the laboratory. The distance used was 500 feet,
and the deflection was about twenty times that obtained by Foucault.[1]

   [Footnote 1: See Proc. Am. Assoc. Adv. Science, Saint Louis meeting.]

These experiments, made with very crude apparatus and under great difficulties, gave the following
table of results for the velocity of light in miles per second:

         186730
         188820
         186330
         185330
         187900
         184500
         186770
         185000
         185800
         187940
         ------
    Mean 186500 ± 300 miles per second,
      or 300140 kilometers per second.

In the following July the sum of $2,000 was placed at my disposal by a private gentleman for
carrying out these experiments on a large scale. Before ordering any of the instruments, however,
it was necessary to find whether or not it was practicable to use a large distance. With a
distance (between the revolving and the fixed mirror) of 500 feet, in the preliminary experiments,
the field of light in the eye-piece was somewhat limited, and there was considerable indistinctness
in the image, due to atmospheric disturbances.

Accordingly, the same lens (39 feet focus) was employed, being placed, together with the other
pieces of apparatus, along the north sea-wall of the Academy grounds, the distance being about
2,000 feet. The image of the slit, at noon, was so confused as not to be recognizable, but
toward sunset it became clear and steady, and measurements were made of its position, which
agreed within one one-hundredth of a millimeter. It was thus demonstrated that with this distance
and a deflection of 100 millimeters this measurement could be made within the ten-thousandth part.

In order to obtain this deflection, it was sufficient to make the mirror revolve 250 times
per second and to use a "radius" of about 30 feet. In order to use this large radius (distance
from slit to revolving mirror), it was necessary that the mirror should be large and optically
true; also, that the lens should be large and of great focal length. Accordingly the mirror
was made 1¼ inches in diameter, and a new lens, 8 inches in diameter, with a focal length of
150 feet was procured.

In January, 1879, an observation was taken, using the old lens, the mirror making 128 turns
per second. The deflection was about 43 millimeters. The micrometer eye-piece used was substantially
the same as Foucault's, except that part of the inclined plate of glass was silvered, thus
securing a much greater quantity of light. The deflection having reached 43 millimeters, the
inclined plate of glass could be dispensed with, the light going past the observer's head through
the slit, and returning 43 millimeters to the left of the slit, where it could be easily observed.

Thus the micrometer eye-piece is much simplified, and many possible sources of error are removed.

The field was quite limited, the diameter being, in fact, but little greater than the width
of the slit. This would have proved a most serious objection to the new arrangement. With the
new lens, however, this difficulty disappeared, the field being about twenty times the width
of the slit. It was expected that, with the new lens, the image would be less distinct; but
the difference, if any, was small, and was fully compensated by the greater size of the field.

The first observation with the new lens was made January 30, 1879. The deflection was 70 millimeters.
The image was sufficiently bright to be observed without the slightest effort. The first observation
with the new micrometer eye-piece was made April 2, the deflection being 115 millimeters.

The first of the final series of observations was made on June 5. All the observations previous
to this, thirty sets in all, were rejected. After this time, no set of observations nor any
single observation was omitted.

Theory of New Method.

Let S, Fig. 1, be a slit, through which light passes, falling on R, a mirror free to rotate
about an axis at right angles to the plane of the paper; L, a lens of great focal length, upon
which the light falls which is reflected from R. Let M be a plane mirror whose surface is perpendicular
to the line R, M, passing through the centers of R, L, and M, respectively. If L be so placed
that an image of S is formed on the surface of M, then, this image acting as the object, its
image will be formed at S, and will coincide, point for point, with S.

If, now, R be turned about the axis, so long as the light falls upon the lens, an image of
the slit will still be formed on the surface of the mirror, though on a different part, and
as long as the returning light falls on the lens an image of this image will be formed at S,
notwithstanding the change of position of the first image at M. This result, namely, the production
of a stationary image of an image in motion, is absolutely necessary in this method of experiment.
It was first accomplished by Foucault, and in a manner differing apparently but little from
the foregoing.

In his experiments L, Fig. 2, served simply to form the image of S at M, and M, the returning
mirror, was spherical, the center coinciding with the axis of R. The lens L was placed as near
as possible to R. The light forming the return image lasts, in this case, while the first image
is sweeping over the face of the mirror, M. Hence, the greater the distance RM, the larger
must be the mirror in order that the same amount of light may be preserved, and its dimensions
would soon become inordinate. The difficulty was partly met by Foucault, by using five concave
reflectors instead of one, but even then the greatest distance he found it practicable to use
was only 20 meters.

Returning to Fig. 1, suppose that R is in the principal focus of the lens L; then, if the plane
mirror M have the same diameter as the lens, the first, or moving image, will remain upon M
as long as the axis of the pencil of light remains on the lens, and this will be the case no
matter what the distance may be.

When the rotation of the mirror R becomes sufficiently rapid, then the flashes of light which
produce the second or stationary image become blended, so that the image appears to be continuous.
But now it no longer coincides with the slit, but is deflected in the direction of rotation,
and through twice the angular distance described by the mirror, during the time required for
light to travel twice the distance between the mirrors. This displacement is measured by the
tangent of the arc it subtends. To make this as large as possible, the distance between the
mirrors, the radius, and the speed of rotation should be made as great as possible.

The second condition conflicts with the first, for the radius is the difference between the
focal length for parallel rays, and that for rays at the distance of the fixed mirror. The
greater the distance, therefore, the smaller will be the radius.

There are two ways of solving the difficulty: first, by using a lens of great focal length;
and secondly, by placing the revolving mirror within the principal focus of the lens. Both
means were employed. The focal length of the lens was 150 feet, and the mirror was placed about
15 feet within the principal focus. A limit is soon reached, however, for the quantity of light
received diminishes very rapidly as the revolving mirror approaches the lens.

Arrangement and Description of Apparatus.

Site and Plan.

The site selected for the experiments was a clear, almost level, stretch along the north sea-wall
of the Naval Academy. A frame building was erected at the western end of the line, a plan of
which is represented in Fig. 3.

The building was 45 feet long and 14 feet wide, and raised so that the line along which the
light traveled was about 11 feet above the ground. A heliostat at H reflected the sun's rays
through the slit at S to the revolving mirror R, thence through a hole in the shutter, through
the lens, and to the distant mirror.

The Heliostat.

The heliostat was one kindly furnished by Dr. Woodward, of the Army Medical Museum, and was
a modification of Foucault's form, designed by Keith. It was found to be accurate and easy
to adjust. The light was reflected from the heliostat to a plane mirror, M, Fig. 3, so that
the former need not be disturbed after being once adjusted.

The Revolving Mirror.

The revolving mirror was made by Fauth & Co., of Washington. It consists of a cast-iron frame
resting on three leveling screws, one of which was connected by cords to the table at S, Fig.
3, so that the mirror could be inclined forward or backward while making the observations.

Two binding screws, S, S, Fig. 4, terminating in hardened steel conical sockets, hold the revolving
part. This consists of a steel axle, X, Y, Figs. 4 and 5, the pivots being conical and hardened.
The axle expands into a ring at R, which holds the mirror M. The latter was a disc of plane
glass, made by Alvan Clark & Sons, about 1¼ inch in diameter and 0.2 inch thick. It was silvered
on one side only, the reflection taking place from the outer or front surface. A species of
turbine wheel, T, is held on the axle by friction. This wheel has six openings for the escape
of air; a section of one of them is represented in Fig 6.

Adjustment of the Revolving Mirror.

The air entering on one side at O, Fig. 5, acquires a rotary motion in the box B, B, carrying
the wheel with it, and this motion is assisted by the reaction of the air in escaping. The
disc C serves the purpose of bringing the center of gravity in the axis of rotation. This was
done, following Foucault's plan, by allowing the pivots to rest on two inclined planes of glass,
allowing the arrangement to come to rest, and filing away the lowest part of the disc; trying
again, and so on, till it would rest in indifferent equilibrium. The part corresponding to
C, in Foucault's apparatus, was furnished with three vertical screws, by moving which the axis
of figure was brought into coincidence with the axis of rotation. This adjustment was very
troublesome. Fortunately, in this apparatus it was found to be unnecessary.

When the adjustment is perfect the apparatus revolves without giving any sound, and when this
is accomplished, the motion is regular and the speed great. A slight deviation causes a sound
due to the rattling of the pivots in the sockets, the speed is very much diminished, and the
pivots begin to wear. In Foucault's apparatus oil was furnished to the pivots, through small
holes running through the screws, by pressure of a column of mercury. In this apparatus it
was found sufficient to touch the pivots occasionally with a drop of oil.

Fig. 7 is a view of the turbine, box, and supply-tube, from above. The quantity of air entering
could be regulated by a valve to which was attached a cord leading to the observer's table.

The instrument was mounted on a brick pier.

The Micrometer.

The apparatus for measuring the deflection was made by Grunow, of New York.

This instrument is shown in perspective in Fig. 8, and in plan by Fig. 9. The adjustable slit
S is clamped to the frame F. A long millimeter-screw, not shown in Fig. 8, terminating in the
divided head D, moves the carriage C, which supports the eye-piece E. The frame is furnished
with a brass scale at F for counting revolutions, the head counting hundredths. The eye-piece
consists of a single achromatic lens, whose focal length is about two inches. At its focus,
in H, and in nearly the same plane as the face of the slit, is a single vertical silk fiber.
The apparatus is furnished with a standard with rack and pinion, and the base furnished with
leveling screws.

Manner of Using the Micrometer.

In measuring the deflection, the eye-piece is moved till the cross-hair bisects the slit, and
the reading of the scale and divided head gives the position. This measurement need not be
repeated unless the position or width of the slit is changed. Then the eye-piece is moved till
the cross-hair bisects the deflected image of the slit; the reading of scale and head are again
taken, and the difference in readings gives the deflection. The screw was found to have no
lost motion, so that readings could be taken with the screw turned in either direction.

Measurement of Speed of Rotation.

To measure the speed of rotation, a tuning-fork, bearing on one prong a steel mirror, was used.
This was kept in vibration by a current of electricity from five "gravity" cells. The fork
was so placed that the light from the revolving mirror was reflected to a piece of plane glass,
in front of the lens of the eye-piece of the micrometer, inclined at an angle of 45°, and thence
to the eye. When fork and revolving mirror are both at rest, an image of the revolving mirror
is seen. When the fork vibrates, this image is drawn out into a band of light.

When the mirror commences to revolve, this band breaks up into a number of moving images of
the mirror; and when, finally, the mirror makes as many turns as the fork makes vibrations,
these images are reduced to one, which is stationary. This is also the case when the number
of turns is a submultiple. When it is a multiple or simple ratio, the only difference is that
there are more images. Hence, to make the mirror execute a certain number of turns, it is simply
necessary to pull the cord attached to the valve to the right or left till the images of the
revolving mirror come to rest.

The electric fork made about 128 vibrations per second. No dependence was placed upon this
rate, however, but at each set of observations it is compared with a standard Ut₃ fork, the
temperature being noted at the same time. In making the comparison the sound-beats produced
by the forks were counted for 60 seconds. It is interesting to note that the electric fork,
as long as it remained untouched and at the same temperature, did not change its rate more
than one or two hundredths vibrations per second.

The Lens.

The lens was made by Alvan Clark & Sons. It was 8 inches in diameter; focal length, 150 feet;
not achromatic. It was mounted in a wooden frame, which was placed on a support moving on a
slide, about 16 feet long, placed about 80 feet from the building. As the diameter of the lens
was so small in comparison with its focal length, its want of achromatism was inappreciable.
For the same reason, the effect of "parallax" (due to want of coincidence in the plane of the
image with that of the silk fiber in the eye-piece) was too small to be noticed.

The Fixed Mirror.

The fixed mirror was one of those used in taking photographs of the transit of Venus. It was
about 7 inches in diameter, mounted in a brass frame capable of adjustment in a vertical and
a horizontal plane by screw motion. Being wedge-shaped, it had to be silvered on the front
surface. To facilitate adjustment, a small telescope furnished with cross-hairs was attached
to the mirror by a universal joint. The heavy frame was mounted on a brick pier, and the whole
surrounded by a wooden case to protect it from the sun.

Adjustment of the Fixed Mirror.

The adjustment was effected as follows: A theodolite was placed at about 100 feet in front
of the mirror, and the latter was moved about by the screws till the observer at the theodolite
saw the image of his telescope reflected in the center of the mirror. Then the telescope attached
to the mirror was pointed (without moving the mirror itself) at a mark on a piece of card-board
attached to the theodolite. Thus the line of collimation of the telescope was placed at right
angles to the surface of the mirror. The theodolite was then moved to 1,000 feet, and, if found
necessary, the adjustment was repeated. Then the mirror was moved by the screws till its telescope
pointed at the hole in the shutter of the building. The adjustment was completed by moving
the mirror, by signals, till the observer, looking through the hole in the shutter, through
a good spy-glass, saw the image of the spy-glass reflected centrally in the mirror.

The whole operation was completed in a little over an hour.

Notwithstanding the wooden case about the pier, the mirror would change its position between
morning and evening; so that the last adjustment had to be repeated before every series of
experiments.

Apparatus for Supplying and Regulating the Blast of Air.

Fig. 10 represents a plan of the lower floor of the building. E is a three-horse power Lovegrove
engine and boiler, resting on a stone foundation; B, a small Roots' blower; G, an automatic
regulator. From this the air goes to a delivery-pipe, up through the floor, and to the turbine.
The engine made about 4 turns per second and the blower about 15. At this speed the pressure
of the air was about half a pound per square inch.

The regulator, Fig. 11, consists of a strong bellows supporting a weight of 370 pounds, partly
counterpoised by 80 pounds in order to prevent the bellows from sagging. When the pressure
of air from the blower exceeds the weight, the bellows commences to rise, and, in so doing,
closes the valve V.

This arrangement was found in practice to be insufficient, and the following addition was made:
A valve was placed at P, and the pipe was tapped a little farther on, and a rubber tube led
to a water-gauge, Fig 12. The column of water in the smaller tube is depressed, and, when it
reaches the horizontal part of the tube, the slightest variation of pressure sends the column
from one end to the other. This is checked by an assistant at the valve; so that the column
of water is kept at about the same place, and the pressure thus rendered very nearly constant.
The result was satisfactory, though not in the degree anticipated. It was possible to keep
the mirror at a constant speed for three or four seconds at a time, and this was sufficient
for an observation. Still it would have been more convenient to keep it so for a longer time.

I am inclined to think that the variations were due to changes in the friction of the pivots
rather than to changes of pressure of the blast of air.

It may be mentioned that the test of uniformity was very delicate, as a change of speed of
one or two hundredths of a turn per second could easily be detected.

Method Followed in Experiment.

It was found that the only time during the day when the atmosphere was sufficiently quiet to
get a distinct image was during the hour after sunrise, or during the hour before sunset. At
other times the image was "boiling" so as not to be recognizable. In one experiment the electric
light was used at night, but the image was no more distinct than at sunset, and the light was
not steady.

The method followed in experiment was as follows: The fire was started half an hour before,
and by the time everything was ready the gauge would show 40 or 50 pounds of steam. The mirror
was adjusted by signals, as before described. The heliostat was placed and adjusted. The revolving
mirror was inclined to the right or left, so that the direct reflection of light from the slit,
which otherwise would flash into the eye-piece at every revolution, fell either above or below
the eye-piece.[2]

   [Footnote 2: Otherwise this light would overpower that which forms the
   image to be observed. As far as I am aware, Foucault does not speak of
   this difficulty. If he allowed this light to interfere with the
   brightness of the image, he neglected a most obvious advantage. If he
   did incline the axis of the mirror to the right or left, he makes no
   allowance for the error thus introduced.]

The revolving mirror was then adjusted by being moved about, and inclined forward and backward,
till the light was seen reflected back from the distant mirror. This light was easily seen
through the coat of silver on the mirror.

The distance between the front face of the revolving mirror and the cross-hair of the eye-piece
was then measured by stretching from the one to the other a steel tape, making the drop of
the catenary about an inch, as then the error caused by the stretch of the tape and that due
to the curve just counterbalance each other.

The position of the slit, if not determined before, was then found as before described. The
electric fork was started, the temperature noted, and the sound-beats between it and the standard
fork counted for 60 seconds. This was repeated two or three times before every set of observations.

The eye-piece of the micrometer was then set approximately[3] and the revolving mirror started.
If the image did not appear, the mirror was inclined forward or backward till it came in sight.

   [Footnote 3: The deflection being measured by its tangent, it was
   necessary that the scale should be at right angles to the radius (the
   radius drawn from the mirror to one or the other end of that part of
   the scale which represents this tangent). This was done by setting the
   eye-piece approximately to the expected deflection, and turning the
   whole micrometer about a vertical axis till the cross-hair bisected the
   circular field of light reflected from the revolving mirror. The axis
   of the eye-piece being at right angles to the scale, the latter would
   be at right angles to radius drawn to the cross-hair.]

The cord connected with the valve was pulled right or left till the images of the revolving
mirror, represented by the two bright round spots to the left of the cross-hair, came to rest.
Then the screw was turned till the cross-hair bisected the deflected image of the slit. This
was repeated till ten observations were taken, when the mirror was stopped, temperature noted,
and beats counted. This was called a set of observations. Usually five such sets were taken
morning and evening.

Fig. 13 represents the appearance of the image of the slit as seen in the eye-piece magnified
about five times.

Determination of The Constants.

Comparison of the Steel Tape with the Standard Yard.

The steel tape used was one of Chesterman's, 100 feet long. It was compared with Wurdeman's
copy of the standard yard, as follows:

Temperature was 55° Fahr.

The standard yard was brought under the microscopes of the comparator; the cross-hair of the
unmarked microscope was made to bisect the division marked o, and the cross-hair of the microscope,
marked I, was made to bisect the division marked 36. The reading of microscope I was taken,
and the other microscope was not touched during the experiment. The standard was then removed
and the steel tape brought under the microscopes and moved along till the division marked 0.1
(feet) was bisected by the cross-hair of the unmarked microscope. The screw of microscope I
was then turned till its cross-hair bisected the division marked 3.1 (feet), and the reading
of the screw taken. The difference between the original reading and that of each measurement
was noted, care being taken to regard the direction in which the screw was turned, and this
gave the difference in length between the standard and each succesive portion of the steel
tape in terms of turns of the micrometer-screw.

To find the value of one turn, the cross-hair was moved over a millimeter scale, and the following
were the values obtained:

Turns of screw of microscope I in 1mm--

     7.68  7.73  7.60  7.67
     7.68  7.62  7.65  7.57

     7.55  7.65  7.61  7.63

     Mean =7.65

     Hence one turn = 0.1307mm.

     or = 0.0051 inch.

     The length of the steel tape from 0.1 to 99.1 was found to be
     greater than 33 yards, by 7.4 turns =.96mm        +.003 feet.

     Corrected length                                100.006 feet.

Determination of the Value of Micrometer.

Two pairs of lines were scratched on one slide of the slit, about 38mm apart, i.e., from the
center of first pair to center of second pair. This distance was measured at intervals of 1mm
through the whole length of the screw, by bisecting the interval between each two pairs by
the vertical silk fiber at the end of the eye-piece. With these values a curve was constructed
which gave the following values for this distance, which we shall call D′:

                      Turns of screw.
     At   0 of scale D′  =38.155
         10 of scale D′   38.155
         20 of scale D′   38.150
         30 of scale D′   38 150
         40 of scale D′   38.145
         50 of scale D′   38.140
         60 of scale D′   38.140
         70 of scale D′   38.130
         80 of scale D′   38.130
         90 of scale D′   38.125
        100 of scale D′   38.120
        110 of scale D′   38.110
        120 of scale D′   38.105
        130 of scale D′   38.100
        140 of scale D′   38.100

Changing the form of this table, we find that,--

     For the first
       10 turns the average value of D′ is 38.155
       20 turns                                   38.153

      130 turns                                   38.132
      140 turns                                   38.130

On comparing the scale with the standard meter, the temperature being 16°.5 C., 140 divisions
were found to = 139.462mm. This multiplied by (1 + .0000188 × 16.5) = 139.505mm.

One hundred and forty divisions were found to be equal to 140.022 turns of the screw, whence
140 turns of the screw = 139.483mm, or 1 turn of the screw = 0.996305mm.

This is the average value of one turn in 140.

But the average value of D, for 140 turns is, from the preceding table, 38.130.

Therefore, the true value of D, is 38.130 × .996305mm, and the average value of one turn for
10, 20, 30, etc., turns, is found by dividing 38.130 × .996305 by the values of D;, given in
the table.

This gives the value of a turn--

                                 mm.
    For the first 10 turns    0.99570
                  20 turns    0.99570
                  30 turns    0.99573

NOTE.--The micrometer has been sent to Professor Mayer, of Hoboken, to test the screw again,
and to find its value. The steel tape has been sent to Professor Rogers, of Cambridge, to find
its length again. (See page 145.)

Measurement of the Distance between the Mirrors.

Square lead weights were placed along the line, and measurements taken from the forward side
of one to forward side of the next. The tape rested on the ground (which was very nearly level),
and was stretched by a constant force of 10 pounds.

The correction for length of the tape (100.006) was +0.12 of a foot.

To correct for the stretch of the tape, the latter was stretched with a force of 15 pounds,
and the stretch at intervals of 20 feet measured by a millimeter scale.

                                mm.
    At 100 feet the stretch was 8.0
        80 feet the stretch was 5.0
        60 feet the stretch was 5.0
        40 feet the stretch was 3.5
        20 feet the stretch was 1.5

Weighted mean = 7.7 mm.
           For 10 pounds, stretch = 5.1 mm.
                                  = 0.0167 feet. He
    dropped the woman's hand.

He turned and walked heavily out of the room without a backward glance. He could do no more.

"And
will you stoop to me?" pleaded Marteau.

           For answer the
           woman knelt by
           his bed and slipped
           her arm tenderly
           under his head.
           She bent
    and kissed him.

             
             "When you are stronger," she replied,
             "you shall raise me up to your own high
          level of
          courage and devotion and self-sacrifice, but meanwhile it is upon
my bosom that your head must lie."

"Alas," said Marteau, after a little, "the Emperor is taken, the Empire is lost, my poor France!"

"I
will go back with you and we will help to build it up again," said
the woman.

That was the best medicine that could be given to the young man. His recovery was slow but
it was sure and it was the more rapid because of the gracious care of the woman he loved, who lavished
upon him all the pent-up passion of her fond adoring heart.

Sir Gervaise Yeovil, whose interest at court was great, exerted himself to secure a reconfirmation
of Marteau's patent of nobility and to see that no difficulties were placed in the way of the young
couple in obtaining repossession of their estates. So that once more
there should be a d'Aumenier and perhaps a renewal of the ancient
house in the old château in Champagne. This was easier since Marteau
had never taken oath to King Louis and therefore had broken no faith.

At
the quiet wedding that took place as soon as Marteau recovered his
strength a little, Sir Gervaise continued to act the father's part
to the poor woman. After the ceremony he delighted the heart of the
soldier by giving to him what he loved after the woman, the Eagle
which had been Frank Yeovil's prize.

"You will think of the lad,
sometimes," said the old Baronet to the girl. The rate of the chronometer, the record of which was
kept at the Observatory, was very regular, and was found by observations of transits of stars
during the week to be +1.3 seconds per day, which is the same as the recorded rate.

The correction for temperature was found by Professor Mayer by counting the sound-beats between
the standard and another Ut₃ fork, at different temperatures. His result is +.012 vibrations
per second for a diminution of 1° Fahr. Using the same method, I arrived at the result +.0125.
Adopted +.012.

In one of the preceding experiments, I compared the two Vt₃ forks while the standard was tracing
its record on the cylinder, and also when it was in position as for use in the observations.
The difference, if any, was less than .01 vibration per second.

Second determination.

(Joint work with Professor A.M. Mayer, Stevens Institute, Hoboken.)

The fork was wedged into a wooden support, and the platinum tip allowed to rest on lampblacked
paper, wound about a metal cylinder, which was rotated by hand Time was given by a break-circuit
clock, the rate of which was ascertained, by comparisons with Western Union time-ball, to be
9.87 seconds. The spark from secondary coil of the inductorium passed from the platinum tip,
piercing the paper. The size of the spark was regulated by resistances in primary circuit.

The following is a specimen determination:

Effect of Support and of Scraping.

The standard Vt₃ fork held in its wooden support was compared with another fork on a resonator
loaded with wax and making with standard about five beats per second. The standard was free
from the cylinder. The beats were counted by coincidences with the ⅕ second beats of a watch.

Specimen.

Coincidences were marked--

    At 32   seconds.
       37   seconds.
       43.5 seconds.
       49   seconds.
       54.5 seconds.
       61.5 seconds.
       61.5 - 32 = 29.5.
       29.5 ÷ 5 = 5.9 = time of one interval.

In this time the watch makes 6.13×5 = 30.65 beats, and the forks make 30.65 + 1 = 31.65 beats.

Hence the number of beats per second is 31.65 ÷ 6.13 = 5.163.

Circumstances the same as in last case, except that standard Vt₃ fork was allowed to trace
its record on the lampblacked paper, as in finding its rate of vibration.

In the following table, the numbers in the column headed "Distinctness of Image" are thus translated:
3, good; 2, fair; 1, poor. These numbers do not, however, show the relative weights of the
observations.

The numbers contained in the columns headed "Position of Deflected Image," "Position of Slit,"
and displacement of image in divisions were obtained as described in the paragraph headed "Micrometer,"
page 120.

The column headed "B" contains the number of "beats" per second between the electric Vt₂ fork
and the standard Vt₃ as explained in the paragraph headed "Measurement of the Speed of Rotation."
The column headed "Cor." contains the correction of the rate of the standard fork for the difference
in temperature of experiment and 65° Fahr., for which temperature the rate was found. The numbers
in the column headed "Number of revolutions per second" were found by applying the corrections
in the two preceding columns to the rate of the standard, as explained in the same paragraph.

The "radius of measurement" is the distance between the front face of the revolving mirror
and the cross-hair of the micrometer.

The numbers in the column headed "Value of one turn of the screw" were taken from the table,

In the last two sets of June 13, the micrometer was fixed at 113.41 and 112.14 respectively.
The image was bisected by the cross-hair, and kept as nearly as possible in this place, meantime
counting the number of seconds required for the image of the revolving mirror to complete 60
oscillations. In other words, instead of measuring the deflection, the speed of rotation was
measured. In column 7 for these two sets, the numbers 11 and 6 are the differences between
the greatest and the smallest number of seconds observed.

In finding the mean value of V from the table, the sets are all given the same weight. The
difference between the result thus obtained and that from any system of weights is small, and
may be neglected.

The following table gives the result of different groupings of sets of observations. Necessarily

Discussion of Errors.

The value of V depends on three quantities D, n, and φ. These will now be considered in detail.

The Distance.

The distance between the two mirrors may be in error, either by an erroneous determination
of the length of the steel tape used, or by a mistake in the measurement of the distance by
the tape.

The first may be caused by an error in the copy of the standard yard, or in the comparison
between the standard and the tape. An error in this copy, of .00036 inch, which, for such a
copy, would be considered large, would produce an error of only .00001 in the final result.
Supposing that the bisections of the divisions are correct to .0005 inch, which is a liberal
estimate, the error caused by supposing the error in each yard to be in the same direction
would be only .000014; or the total error of the tape, if both errors were in the same direction,
would be 000024 of the whole length.

The calculated probable error of the five measurements of the distance was ±.000015; hence
the total error due to D would be at most .00004. The tape has been sent to Professor Rogers,
of Cambridge, for comparison, to confirm the result.

The Speed of Rotation.

This quantity depends on three conditions. It is affected, first, by an error in the rate of
the standard; second, by an error in the count of the sound beats between the forks; and third,
by a false estimate of the moment when the image of the revolving mirror is at rest, at which
moment the deflection is measured.

The calculated probable error of the rate is .000016. If this rate should be questioned, the
fork can be again rated and a simple correction applied. There were certain papers of which
I alone knew the hiding place. There was no way for me to reach them save by the courtesy
of the Czar Alexander.

He sent me to Field-Marshal Blücher with instructions to provide me with an escort to this château.
The Field-Marshal did so, and the rest you know."

"And you propose to sell estates that have been in the hands of the
family for so long a period? It seems to me that I visited them once
when I was a military student at Brienne.

The error due to an incorrect estimate of the exact time when the images of the revolving mirror
came to rest was eliminated by making the measurement sometimes when the speed was slowly increasing,
and sometimes when slowly decreasing. Further, this error would form part of the probable error
deduced from the results of observations.

We may then conclude that the error, in the measurement of n, was less than .00002.

The Deflection.

The angle of deflection φ was measured by its tangent, tan φ = d/r; d was measured by the steel
screw and brass scale, and r by the steel tape.

The value of one turn of the screw was found by comparison with the standard meter for all
parts of the screw. This measurement, including the possible error of the copy of the standard
meter, I estimate to be correct to .00005 part. The instrument is at the Stevens Institute,
where it is to be compared with a millimeter scale made by Professor Rogers, of Cambridge.

The deflection was read to within three or four hundredths of a turn at each observation, and
this error appears in the probable error of the result.

The deflection is also affected by the inclination of the plane of rotation to the horizon.
This inclination was small, and its secant varies slowly, so that any slight error in this
angle would not appreciably affect the result.

The measurement of r is affected in the same way as D, so that we may call the greatest error
of this measurement .00004. It would probably be less than this, as the mistakes in the individual
measurements would also appear in the probable error of the result.

The measurement of φ was not corrected for temperature. As the corrections would be small they
may be applied to the final result. For an increase of 1° F. the correction to be applied to
the screw for unit length would be -.0000066. The correction for the brass scale would be +.0000105,
or the whole correction for the micrometer would be +.000004. The correction for the steel
tape used to measure r would be +.0000066. Hence the correction for tan. φ would be -.000003
t. The average temperature of the experiments is 75°.6 F. 75.6-62.5 = 13.1. -.000003×13.1 = -.00004

Hence φ should be divided by 1.00004, or the final result should be multiplied by 1.00004.
This would correspond to a correction of +12 kilometers.

The greatest error, excluding the one just mentioned, would probably be less than .00009 in
the measurement of φ.

Summing up the various errors, we find, then, that the total constant error, in the most unfavorable
case, where the errors are all in the same direction, would be .00015. Adding to this the probable
error of the result, .00002, we have for the limiting value of the error of the final result
±.00017. This corresponds to an error of ±51 kilometers.

The correction for the velocity of light in vacuo is found by multiplying the speed in air
by the index of refraction of air, at the temperature of the experiments. The error due to
neglecting the barometric height is exceedingly small. This correction, in kilometers, is +80.

Final Result.

  The mean value of V from the tables is 299852
  Correction for temperature                +12
                                      ------------
  Velocity of light in air               299864
  Correction for vacuo                       80
                                      ------------
  Velocity of light in vacuo             299944±51

The final value of the velocity of light from these experiments is then--299940 kilometers
per second, or 186380 miles per second.

Objections Considered.

Measurement of the Deflection.

The chief objection, namely, that in the method of the revolving mirror the deflection is small,
has already been sufficiently answered. The same objection, in another form, is that the image
is more or less indistinct. This is answered by a glance at the tables. These show that in
each individual observation the average error was only three ten-thousandths of the whole deflection.

Uncertainty of Laws of Reflection and Refraction in Media in Rapid Rotation.

What is probably hinted at under the above heading is that there may be a possibility that
the rapid rotation of the mirror throws the reflected pencil in the direction of rotation.
Granting that this is the case, an inspection of Fig. 14 shows that the deflection will not
be affected.

In this figure let m m be the position of the mirror when the light first falls on it from
the slit at a, and m′ m′ the position when the light returns.

From the axis o draw op op, perpendicular to m m and to m′ m′, respectively. Then, supposing
there is no such effect, the course of the axis of the pencil of light would be a o c mirror
c o a′. That is, the angle of deflection would be a o a′, double the angle p o p′. If now the
mirror be supposed to carry the pencil with it, let o c′ be the direction of the pencil on
leaving the mirror m m; i.e., the motion of the mirror has changed the direction of the reflected
ray through the angle c o c′. The course would then be a o c, mirror c′ o. From o the reflection
would take place in the direction a″, making the angles c′ o p, and p′ o a″ equal. But the
angle c o c′ must be added to p o a″, in consequence of the motion of the mirror, or the angle
of deviation will be a o a″ + c o c′; or a o a″ + c o c′ = d. (1)

By construction--

    c o p′ = p′ o a′ (2)
    c′ o p′ = p′ o a″ (3)

Subtracting (3) from (2) we have--

    c o p′ - c′ o p′ = p′ o a′ - p′ o a″, or
    c o c′ = a′ o a″

Substituting a′ o a″ for c o c′ in (1) we have-- a o a″ + a′ o a″ = a o a′ = d.

Or the deflection has remained unaltered.

Retardation Caused by Reflection.

Cornu, in answering the objection that there may be an unknown retardation by reflection from
the distant mirror, says that if such existed the error it would introduce in his own work
would be only 1/7000 that of Foucault, on account of the great distance used, and on account
of there being in his own experiments but one reflection instead of twelve.

In my own experiments the same reasoning shows that if this possible error made a difference
of 1 per cent. in Foucault's work (and his result is correct within that amount), then the
error would be but .00003 part.

Distortion of the Revolving Mirror.

It, has been suggested that the distortion of the revolving mirror, either by twisting or by
the effect of centrifugal force, might cause an error in the deflection.

The only plane in which the deflection might be affected is the plane of rotation. Distortions
in a vertical plane would have simply the effect of raising, lowering, or extending the slit.

Again, if the mean surface is plane there will be no effect on the deflection, but simply a
blurring of the image.

Even if there be a distortion of any kind, there would be no effect on the deflection if the
rays returned to the same portion whence they were reflected.

The only case which remains to be considered, then, is that given in Fig. 15, where the light
from the slit a, falls upon a distorted mirror, and the return light upon a different portion
of the same.

The one pencil takes the course a b c d e f a′, while the other follows the path a f g h i b a′.

In other words, besides the image coinciding with a, there would be two images, one on either
side of a, and in case there were more than two portions having different inclinations there
would be formed as many images to correspond. If the surfaces are not plane, the only effect
is to produce a distortion of the image.

As no multiplication of images was observed, and no distortion of the one image, it follows
that the distortion of the mirror was too small to be noticed, and that even if it were larger
it could not affect the deflection.

The figure represents the distorted mirror at rest, but the reasoning is the same when it is
in motion, save that all the images will be deflected in the direction of rotation.

Imperfection of the Lens.

It has also been suggested that, as the pencil goes through one-half of the lens and returns
through the opposite half, if these two halves were not exactly similar, the return image would
not coincide with the slit when the mirror was at rest. This would undoubtedly be true if we
consider but one-half of the original pencil. It is evident, however, that the other half would
pursue the contrary course, forming another image which falls on the other side of the slit,
and that both these images would come into view, and the line midway between them would coincide
with the true position. No such effect was observed, and would be very unlikely to occur. If
the lens was imperfect, the faults would be all over the surface, and this would produce simply
an indistinctness of the image.

Moreover, in the latter part of the observations the mirror was inverted, thus producing a
positive rotation, whereas the rotation in the preceding sets was negative. This would correct
the error mentioned if it existed, and shows also that no constant errors were introduced by
having the rotation constantly in the same direction, the results in both cases being almost
exactly the same.

Periodic Variations in Friction.

If the speed of rotation varied in the same manner in each revolution of the mirror, the chances
would be that, at the particular time when the reflection took place, the speed would not be
the same as the average speed found by the calculation. Such a periodic variation could only
be caused by the influence of the frame or the pivots. For instance, the frame would be closer
to the ring which holds the mirror twice in every revolution than at other times, and it would
be more difficult for the mirror to turn here than at a position 90° from this. Or else there
might be a certain position, due to want of trueness of shape of the sockets, which would cause
a variation of friction at certain parts of the revolution.

To ascertain if there were any such variations, the position of the frame was changed in azimuth
in several experiments. The results were unchanged showing that any such variation was too
small to affect the result.

Change of Speed of Rotation.

In the last four sets of observations the speed was lowered from 256 turns to 192, 128, 96,
and 64 turns per second. The results with these speeds were the same as with the greater speed
within the limits of errors of experiment.

Bias.

Finally, to test the question if there were any bias in taking these observations, eight sets
of observations were taken, in which the readings were made by another, the results being written
down without divulging them. Five of these sets are given in the "specimen," pages 133-134.

It remains to notice the remarkable coincidence of the result of these experiments with that
obtained by Cornu by the method of the "toothed wheel."

Cornu's result was 300400 kilometers, or as interpreted by Helmert 299990 kilometers. That
of these experiments is 299940 kilometers.

Postscript.

The comparison of the micrometer with two scales made by Mr. Rogers, of the Harvard Observatory,
has been completed. The scales were both on the same piece of silver, marked "Scales No. 25,
on silver. Half inch at 58° F., too short .000009 inch. Centimeter at 67° F., too short .00008 cm."

It was found that the ratio .3937079 could be obtained almost exactly, if, instead of the centimeter
being too short, it were too long by .00008 cm. at 67°.

On this supposition the following tables were obtained. They represent the value of one turn
of the micrometer in millimeters.

Table 1 is the result from centimeter scale.

Table 2 is the result from half-inch scale.

Table 3 is the result from page 31.

It is seen from the correspondence in these results, that the previous work is correct. 

                       Emperor!" who could be indifferent to that appeal?

    Disregarding the old Marquis absolutely, as
               if he were not on the earth, the
               Emperor came nearer smiling. He
               was irresistible to these soldiers
               when he smiled.
               
               "Well," he said, his hands outstretched
              and open, "soldiers of the Fifth,
              who were with me in Italy, how are
              you all? I am come back to see you
              again, mes enfants," he went on genially. "Is there any one of you
who wishes to kill me?"

"No, no, Sire. Certainly not," came the cry.
