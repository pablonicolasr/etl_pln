CHAPTER I

HOW THE BOSS WON HIS TITLE

=Late last Thursday evening one Jonas Rodney Potts, better known to this community as "Upright"
Potts, stumbled into the mill-race, where it had providentially been left open just north of
Cady's mill. Everything was going along finely until two hopeless busybodies were attracted
to the spot by his screams, and fished him out. It is feared that he will recover. We withhold
the names of his rescuers, although under strong temptation to publish them broadcast.--Little
Arcady Argus of May 21st.=

Looking back to that time from a happier present, I am filled by a genuine awe of J. Rodney
Potts. Reflecting upon those benign ends which the gods chose to make him serve, I can but
marvel how lightly each of us may meet and scorn a casual Potts, unrecking his gracious and
predestined office in the play of Fate.

Of the present--to me--supreme drama of the Little Country, I can only say that the gods had
selected their agent with a cunning so flawless that suspicion of his portents could not well
have been aroused in one lacking discernment like unto the gods' very own. So trivially, so
utterly, so pitiably casual, to eyes of the flesh, was this Potts of Little Arcady, from his
immortal soul to the least item of his inferior raiment!

Thus craftily are we fooled by the Lords of Destiny, whose caprice it is to affect remoteness
from us and a lofty unconcern for our poor little doings.

There is bitterness in the lines of that Argus paragraph, and a flippant incivility might be
read between them by the least discerning.

Arcady of the Little Country, however, knows there is neither bitterness nor real cynicism
in Solon Denney, founder, editor, and proprietor of the Little Arcady Argus; motto, "Hew to
the Line, Let the Chips Fall Where they May!" Indeed, we do know Solon. Often enough has the
Argus hewn inexorably to the line, when that line led straight through the heart of its guiding
genius and through the hearts of us all. One who had seen him, as I did, stand uncovered in
the presence of his new Washington hand-press, the day that dynamo of Light was erected in
the Argus office, could never suppose him to lack humanity or the just reverence demanded by
his craft.
