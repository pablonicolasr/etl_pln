          Juveniles=

          =With all the original
          Illustrations by Reginald B. Birch.
          5 vols. Each 12mo $1.25.=

A writer in the Boston Post has said of Mrs. Burnett: "She has a beauty of imagination and
a spiritual insight into the meditations of childhood which are within the grasp of no other
writer for children,"--and these five volumes would indeed be difficult to match in child literature.
The new edition is from new plates, with all the original illustrations by Reginald B. Birch,
is bound in a handsome new cover. "Little Lord Fauntleroy," "Two Little Pilgrims' Progress,"
"Piccino and Other Child Stories," "Giovanni and the Other," "Sara Crewe," and "Little Saint
Elizabeth and other Stories" (in one volume).

          =Three New
          Volumes by
          G. A. Henty=

          =Illustrated by Walter
          Paget and W. A. Margetson.
          Each 12mo $1.50=.

It would be a bitter year for the boys if Mr. Henty were to fail them with a fresh assortment
of his enthralling tales of adventure, for, as the London Academy has said, in this kind of
story telling, "he stands in the very first rank." "With Frederick the Great" is a tale of
the Seven Years' War, and has twelve full-page illustrations by Wal. Paget; "A March on London"
details some stirring scenes of the times when Wat Tyler's motley crew took possession of that
city, and the illustrations are drawn by W. A. Margetson, while Wal. Paget has supplied the
pictures for "With Moore at Corunna," in which the boy hero serves through the Peninsular War.
(Each 12mo, $1.50.)

with a loving, tender grace," says the Boston Herald.

          =An Old-Field School Girl by Marion Harland=

(Illustrated, 12mo, $1.25.) "As pretty a story for girls as has been published in a long time,"
says the Buffalo Express, and the Chicago Tribune is even more appreciative: "Compared with
the average books of its class 'An Old-Field School Girl,' becomes a classic."

"A collection of those dearly loved 'Songs of Childhood' by Eugene Field, which have touched
many hearts, both old and young, and will continue to do so as long as little children remain
the joy of our homes. It was a happy thought of the publisher to choose another such child
lover and sympathizer as Kenneth Grahame to write the Preface to the new edition, and Charles
Robinson to make the many quaint and most amusing illustrations."--The Evangelist.

          and Bowie by

gives them the added fascination of being creatures of fiction, and yet there is no straining
for effect."
