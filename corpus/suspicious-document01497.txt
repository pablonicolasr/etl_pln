HUCKLEBERRY FINN

By Mark Twain

Part 3.

CHAPTER XI.

"COME in," says the woman, and I did.  She says:  "Take a cheer."

I done it.  She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says:

"What might your name be?"

"Sarah Williams."

"Where 'bouts do you live?  In this neighborhood?'

"No'm.  In Hookerville, seven mile below.  I've walked all the way and I'm all tired out."

"Hungry, too, I reckon.  I'll find you something."

"No'm, I ain't hungry.  I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below here at a farm; so I
ain't hungry no more.  It's what makes me so late. My mother's down sick, and out of money
and everything, and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore.  He lives at the upper end of the
town, she says.  I hain't ever been here before.  Do you know him?"

"No; but I don't know everybody yet.  I haven't lived here quite two weeks. It's a considerable
ways to the upper end of the town.  You better stay here all night.  Take off your bonnet."

"No," I says; "I'll rest a while, I reckon, and go on.  I ain't afeared of the dark."

She said she wouldn't let me go by myself, but her husband would be in by and by, maybe in
a hour and a half, and she'd send him along with me. Then she got to talking about her husband,
and about her relations up the river, and her relations down the river, and about how much
better off they used to was, and how they didn't know but they'd made a mistake coming to our
town, instead of letting well alone--and so on and so on, till I was afeard I had made a mistake
coming to her to find out what was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap
and the murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along.  She told about
me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap
and what a hard lot he was, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I
was murdered.  I says:

"Who done it?  We've heard considerable about these goings on down in Hookerville, but we don't
know who 'twas that killed Huck Finn."

"Well, I reckon there's a right smart chance of people HERE that'd like to know who killed
him.  Some think old Finn done it himself."

"No--is that so?"

"Most everybody thought it at first.  He'll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched.
But before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim."

"Why HE--"

I stopped.  I reckoned I better keep still.  She run on, and never noticed I had put in at all:

"The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed.  So there's a reward out for him--three
hundred dollars.  And there's a reward out for old Finn, too--two hundred dollars. Those who can
not - now falls below the level, and disappears into the mass of the other riff-raff that comes here
to America, and believes it need only enter the nose plug, to be already received with open arms. We
here in America watch the view but with fairly calm, and know what
we can expect from such hopes.

"We here in America? - Well, "said Hopfgarten, really surprised at the change that produced a
few months in the usually quiet and often shy surgeon -" not so bad talk, as if you were as
many years as months in America.

"The experience of mature the man, not the years," the Doctor said
quietly. - "Very nice thought, especially from the African medicinal
standpoint," said Hopfgarten, "but apropos - err I am, or have I heard
somewhere that you are married already? - "Certainly," said HÃ¼ckl,
the smoke of his cigar, blowing on his own - "I came about three months
to Wisconsin, and found the mischief of the doctors here progressed
to a climax that is not to describe.

It quack fooled a number of people around here, of which even now, even a great part of his
poison administered to all those unfortunates who fall into their
hands, and several very respectable American families in particular,
were of such scams really ill-treated, and slowly but have been systematically
murdered one by one.

Since I came here and was in several cases, by American doctors have called the discontinued patients.
A major New Orleans practice had made me familiar with this local climatic conditions, a quick glance,
which an able doctor has his own, or he is just not a capable doctor put me in the state, the evils, such as those
committed Misgriffe to identify correctly a word I came - without being immodest, saw and conquered.
The daughter of a very wealthy farmer nearby, I pulled this kind from the clutches of death, and
the father who had abandoned his child already gave it to me for further food. "Hopfgarten had, without,
however, by the owner be the "# doctor shops #" prompted particularly to the single chair established
in the small room, probably stood for the convenience audition patients, heard, and, fingers crossed
it to other hunting and stapling the eyes fixed on the tellers to this battle and victory patient
report. He was a peculiar feeling, and not without interest for him to observe the transformation
that the whole nature of the former HÃ¼ckl, sudden current # M. D.
# done this and he could not help getting into comparisons between
him and the young thunder, which, however, turned out not to the advantage
of its current counterpart.

HÃ¼ckl but its quite unconscious, and had become so firmly convinced
of his talents that he was not even surprised himself, suddenly discovered
such an excellent doctor to have even chatted away for a while in
the above manner, and looked particularly his teach former companions
an idea of ââthe spread, both as excellent "customers" that he
is here already in the short time of his earned vacation, and asked
him at last to visit him but once in the evening at his "villa" near
the city, his home institution to take a look.

Maybe he wanted by his visit, but he probably had suspected earlier to have had a not so good opinion
of him, impose upon, perhaps, but also - and more probable - parry something he carried with Mr.
von Hopfgarten appearance the travel bag, of course, unfounded fear, to have believed that this fact
had no intention to strangers in the city with him when einzuquartiren an old companions.
Hopfgarten did not even think of something derartges of course, but just the thought here in any
case quite HÃ¼ckl known for a matching personality, that which was most dear to him to learn.
  I couldn't look up yet.

Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor they had to live, and
how the rats was as free as if they owned the place, and so forth and so on, and then I got
easy again.  She was right about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the
corner every little while.  She said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she
was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace.  She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into
a knot, and said she was a good shot with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two
ago, and didn't know whether she could throw true now.  But she watched for a chance, and directly
banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said "Ouch!" it hurt her arm so.  Then she
told me to try for the next one.  I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back,
but of course I didn't let on.  I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his nose I let
drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a tolerable sick rat.  She said that was
first-rate, and she reckoned I would hive the next one.  She went and got the lump of lead
and fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with.
I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and went on talking about her and her
husband's matters.  But she broke off to say:

"Keep your eye on the rats.  You better have the lead in your lap, handy."

So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped my legs together on
it and she went on talking.  But only about a minute. Then she took off the hank and looked
me straight in the face, and very pleasant, and says:

"Come, now, what's your real name?"

"Wh--what, mum?"

"What's your real name?  Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?--or what is it?"

I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn't know hardly what to do.  But I says:

"Please to don't poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum.  If I'm in the way here, I'll--"

"No, you won't.  Set down and stay where you are.  I ain't going to hurt you, and I ain't going
to tell on you, nuther.  You just tell me your secret, and trust me.  I'll keep it; and, what's
more, I'll help you. So'll my old man if you want him to.  You see, you're a runaway 'prentice,
that's all.  It ain't anything.  There ain't no harm in it. You've been treated bad, and you
made up your mind to cut.  Bless you, child, I wouldn't tell on you.  Tell me all about it
now, that's a good boy."

So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer, and I would just make a clean
breast and tell her everything, but she musn't go back on her promise.  Then I told her my
father and mother was dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country
thirty mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it no longer; he
went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my chance and stole some of his daughter's
old clothes and cleared out, and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles.  I traveled
nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted
me all the way, and I had a-plenty.  I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care
of me, and so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen.

"Goshen, child?  This ain't Goshen.  This is St. Petersburg.  Goshen's ten mile further up
the river.  Who told you this was Goshen?"

"Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn into the woods for
my regular sleep.  He told me when the roads forked I must take the right hand, and five mile
would fetch me to Goshen."

"He was drunk, I reckon.  He told you just exactly wrong."

"Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain't no matter now.  I got to be moving along.
I'll fetch Goshen before daylight."

"Hold on a minute.  I'll put you up a snack to eat.  You might want it."

So she put me up a snack, and says:

"Say, when a cow's laying down, which end of her gets up first?  Answer up prompt now--don't
stop to study over it.  Which end gets up first?"

"The hind end, mum."

"Well, then, a horse?"

"The for'rard end, mum."

"Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?"

"North side."

"If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with their heads pointed
the same direction?"

"The whole fifteen, mum."

"Well, I reckon you HAVE lived in the country.  I thought maybe you was trying to hocus me
again.  What's your real name, now?"

"George Peters, mum."

"Well, try to remember it, George.  Don't forget and tell me it's Elexander before you go,
and then get out by saying it's George Elexander when I catch you.  And don't go about women
in that old calico.  You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe.  Bless you,
child, when you set out to thread a needle don't hold the thread still and fetch the needle
up to it; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it; that's the way a woman most always
does, but a man always does t'other way.  And when you throw at a rat or anything, hitch yourself
up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can, and miss your rat
about six or seven foot. Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there
for it to turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one side,
like a boy.  And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees
apart; she don't clap them together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead.  Why,
I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived the other things
just to make certain.  Now trot along to your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters,
and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what
I can to get you out of it.  Keep the river road all the way, and next time you tramp take
shoes and socks with you. The river road's a rocky one, and your feet'll be in a condition
when you get to Goshen, I reckon."

I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where
my canoe was, a good piece below the house.  I jumped in, and was off in a hurry.  I went up-stream
far enough to make the head of the island, and then started across.  I took off the sun-bonnet,
for I didn't want no blinders on then.  When I was about the middle I heard the clock begin
to strike, so I stops and listens; the sound come faint over the water but clear--eleven. 
When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but
I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started a good fire there
on a high and dry spot.

Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half below, as hard as I
could go.  I landed, and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern. 
There Jim laid, sound asleep on the ground.  I roused him out and says:

"Git up and hump yourself, Jim!  There ain't a minute to lose.  They're after us!"

Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he worked for the next half
an hour showed about how he was scared.  By that time everything we had in the world was on
our raft, and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid.  We put
out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn't show a candle outside after that.

I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look; but if there was a boat
around I couldn't see it, for stars and shadows ain't good to see by.  Then we got out the
raft and slipped along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still--never saying
a word.

CHAPTER XII.

IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at last, and the raft did
seem to go mighty slow. The
stranger offered them a saying: "no money, no cakey," laughing cheerfully and continuing to
sing. The children ran along, their mouths watering at the delicious food that they could not
reach. However, the dry, hard bread felt that much drier, and so much harder. Oh, how the children
ran and rattled the dishes in the boarding houses of New Orleans,
where they had set up businesses for the "poor keepers" that worked
and sacrificed to protect their fellow men.

Guests came and went in swarms. Flights followed food, and not much time was spent on minor matters.


When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the Illinois
side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them
so she looked like there had been a cave-in in the bank there.  A tow-head is a sandbar that
has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.

We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side, and the channel
was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we warn't afraid of anybody running across us.
We laid there all day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and
up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.  I told Jim all about the time I had
jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was a smart one, and if she was to start after
us herself she wouldn't set down and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she'd fetch a dog.  Well,
then, I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?  Jim said he bet she did think
of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he believed they must a gone up-town to get
a dog and so they lost all that time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen
mile below the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.  So I said I
didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long as they didn't.

When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket, and
looked up and down and across; nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the
raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things
dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft,
so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves.  Right in the middle
of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it
for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam
would keep it from being seen.  We made an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others
might get broke on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern
on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream,
to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have to light it for up-stream boats unless
we see we was in what they call a "crossing"; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks
being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the channel, but hunted
easy water.

This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current that was making over
four mile an hour.  We catched fish and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off
sleepiness.  It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs
looking up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't often that
we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle.  We had mighty good weather as a general thing,
and nothing ever happened to us at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.

Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, nothing but just a shiny
bed of lights; not a house could you see.  The fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was
like the whole world lit up. In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty
thousand people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights
at two o'clock that still night.  There warn't a sound there; everybody was asleep.

Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little village, and buy ten
or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken
that warn't roosting comfortable, and took him along.  Pap always said, take a chicken when
you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does,
and a good deed ain't ever forgot.  I never see pap when he didn't want the chicken himself,
but that is what he used to say, anyway.

Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon, or a mushmelon,
or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of that kind.  Pap always said it warn't no harm to
borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't anything
but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.  Jim said he reckoned the widow
was partly right and pap was partly right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two
or three things from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more--then he reckoned it
wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others.  So we talked it over all one night, drifting along
down the river, trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes,
or the mushmelons, or what.  But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and concluded
to drop crabapples and p'simmons.  We warn't feeling just right before that, but it was all
comfortable now.  I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good,
and the p'simmons wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.

We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or didn't go to bed
early enough in the evening.  Take it all round, we lived pretty high.

The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with a power of thunder
and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the
raft take care of itself. When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,
and high, rocky bluffs on both sides.  By and by says I, "Hel-LO, Jim, looky yonder!" It was
a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.  We was drifting straight down for her.  The
lightning showed her very distinct.  She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above
water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a chair by the big bell,
with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it, when the flashes come.

Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like, I felt just the way
any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the
middle of the river.  I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what
there was there.  So I says:

"Le's land on her, Jim."

But Jim was dead against it at first.  He says:

"I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack.  We's doin' blame' well, en we better let blame'
well alone, as de good book says.  Like as not dey's a watchman on dat wrack."

"Watchman your grandmother," I says; "there ain't nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot-house;
and do you reckon anybody's going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night
as this, when it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?"  Jim couldn't
say nothing to that, so he didn't try.  "And besides," I says, "we might borrow something worth
having out of the captain's stateroom.  Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid
cash.  Steamboat captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and THEY don't care
a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.  Stick a candle in your pocket;
I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.  Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by
this thing?  Not for pie, he wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure--that's what he'd call it;
and he'd land on that wreck if it was his last act.  And wouldn't he throw style into it? --wouldn't
he spread himself, nor nothing?  Why, you'd think it was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come.
I wish Tom Sawyer WAS here."

Jim he grumbled a little, but give in.  He said we mustn't talk any more than we could help,
and then talk mighty low.  The lightning showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched
the stabboard derrick, and made fast there.

The deck was high out here. 

It was spring now in the vast country, the forest had fresh juicy green covered, and germinated
thousands of flowers on the swelling and branches filled the wilderness with their sweet fragrance.
The deer moved to the Salt Lick at night, the turkey Balzter in the pines Hills and in the yellow
leaf shows that deposited on the ground like a thick carpet urged emerged grasses, herbs and flowers,
and opened their petals to the warm drowsy Sunbeam.

As the birds were singing so merrily in the young leaves, and the croaking frogs, and the Locusts
with their strange regular chirping forest busy, how all this so new fresh and looked beautiful
in the young world, and the dew again as clear and sparkling, the Beaded stems. - So new and
fresh - even the small grave that there, the slender oak was raised, and the brown earth sharply
against the yellow leaves of the ground, against the contrasted green bushes, which clung tightly
about it.

Under the hill slept Olnitzki's youngest child and the mother had for weeks of the nurse cared
for, must guard the camp, until the body re-heated by a Fever that seized him, and the effects of
sleepless nights of sorrow through which she woke up, could recover
only slightly.

Was it because even the last few days have been allowed to leave the camp, they had but not yet
hinausgedurft into the open, to the tomb of the favorite, the Amalie now used, and to which
they sowed German flowers, including the sleeping child to bed nice and gentle. Sad duty of
the flowers which she had hoped to friendly place to home and the sister plant, when in happiness
and domestic peace, the home may had forgotten, by the fragrant cups from the parents garden
memories of the youth recall, good God - especially the memory was all that the poor heart
in pain and sorrow, nor maintained, nor had taken - what could she
have been if they the lost.

Amalie was sitting next to the grave in a small bank on it by the neighbor Jack Owen (of them
then helped bury the child, and had sent his own wife over several weeks, beizustehn them in
all that they needed) of twigs and young trees next to the small Hill built. They acted in a
simple woolen garment, as the women of the backwoods carried, dressed, and her hair smooth and
simply combed back and tied in a ponytail.

Even her earrings and rings had been than they were connected only to the lashes her flashing Thränenperlen
- a nice, but alas a serious jewelry. -

Amalie of Seebald had become an Other, the long months they spent in the woods here; - Not older
by about grief and compassion, to see his sister suffer so much the more natural, the simpler nature of
their forced upon the real life struggles with it, had made them more younger and stronger,
her eye has its own luster, their whole attitude far more resilient, far more powerful given,
but her other hand that spanned enthusiastic, that morbidly romantic
taken, the better their forces pushed back until then.

You was a beautiful, perhaps, but useless dream awake, and felt now that they have a Purpose
was to live, that they could use and act in the world.

Take advantage of work and - yes, with all their might to the sister of salvation - but how? -
What they could do here, how they could help here, where the fate of his iron hand mercilessly placed
on the rolled dice and, as she recognized her sister lives now, almost
could only pray that God will soon remove from the chain which she
held, and next to the children should let in the quiet forest.

She had taken a deep, sad look in both their lives, and she saw no help - no rescue, but death.

In serious senses, leaning his head on his hand, she sat by the little grave - it was now the
only place where they weep undisturbed, but the sister and hide the tears was that her own
heart's only made more difficult without their load to be able facilitate
- as she steps in the foliage behind him could hear, and then quickly
turning around, their old leaders recognized the Jack Owen, with his
dog at his side, the box on the Shoulder, sauntered slowly through
the forest. But what I say is this:  it ain't good sense to
go court'n around after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's jist
as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks.  Ain't that so?"

"You bet it is.  But how you goin' to manage it this time?"

"Well, my idea is this:  we'll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we've overlooked
in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide the truck. Then we'll wait.  Now I say it ain't
a-goin' to be more'n two hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river.  See?
He'll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own self.  I reckon that's
a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him.  I'm unfavorable to killin' a man as long as
you can git aroun' it; it ain't good sense, it ain't good morals.  Ain't I right?"

"Yes, I reck'n you are.  But s'pose she DON'T break up and wash off?"

"Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can't we?"

"All right, then; come along."

So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled forward. It was dark as
pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse whisper, "Jim !" and he answered up, right at
my elbow, with a sort of a moan, and I says:

"Quick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning; there's a gang of murderers in
yonder, and if we don't hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows
can't get away from the wreck there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix.  But if we find
their boat we can put ALL of 'em in a bad fix--for the sheriff 'll get 'em. Quick--hurry! 
I'll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You start at the raft, and--"

"Oh, my lordy, lordy!  RAF'?  Dey ain' no raf' no mo'; she done broke loose en gone I--en here
we is!"

CHAPTER XIII.

WELL, I catched my breath and most fainted.  Shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that! 
But it warn't no time to be sentimentering.  We'd GOT to find that boat now--had to have it
for ourselves.  So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it
was, too--seemed a week before we got to the stern.  No sign of a boat.  Jim said he didn't
believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn't hardly any strength left, he said.  But
I said, come on, if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix, sure.  So on we prowled again.
We struck for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along forwards on the
skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge of the skylight was in the water.
When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough!  I could
just barely see her.  I felt ever so thankful.  In another second I would a been aboard of
her, but just then the door opened.  One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple
of foot from me, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says:

"Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!"

He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and set down.  It was Packard.
Then Bill HE come out and got in.  Packard says, in a low voice:

"All ready--shove off!"

I couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak.  But Bill says:

"Hold on--'d you go through him?"

"No.  Didn't you?"

"No.  So he's got his share o' the cash yet."

"Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money."

"Say, won't he suspicion what we're up to?"

"Maybe he won't.  But we got to have it anyway. Come along."

So they got out and went in.

The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half second I was in the
boat, and Jim come tumbling after me.  I out with my knife and cut the rope, and away we went!

We didn't touch an oar, and we didn't speak nor whisper, nor hardly even breathe.  We went
gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the paddle-box, and past the stern; then
in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her
up, every last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.

When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern show like a little spark
at the texas door for a second, and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat,
and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.

Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft.  Now was the first time that I begun
to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn't had time to before.  I begun to think how dreadful
it was, even for murderers, to be in such a fix.  I says to myself, there ain't no telling
but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would I like it?  So says I to Jim:

"The first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or above it, in a place where it's
a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and then I'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn,
and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung
when their time comes."

But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again, and this time worse than
ever.  The rain poured down, and never a light showed; everybody in bed, I reckon.  We boomed
along down the river, watching for lights and watching for our raft.  After a long time the
rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering, and by and by a flash
showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we made for it.

It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again.  We seen a light now away
down to the right, on shore.  So I said I would go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder
which that gang had stole there on the wreck.  We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and
I told Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile,
and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars and shoved for the light.  As I got
down towards it three or four more showed--up on a hillside.  It was a village.  I closed in
above the shore light, and laid on my oars and floated. She was forced here by and by to go to the whole table, and Jimmy followed her around
there, taking up his conversation again.

"Someone could earn some money shameful, Miss Hedwig," he continued, letting the left hand in place,
and with the right of the young girl one of the glasses to wipe reaching.

"What Mr. Jimmy?"

Well, with a boarding and Lodginghaus.

"" Yes, but why it starts because somebody does not?

"Smiled Hedwig, who could not escape but that the young man himself understood by someone,
if they still no idea about the other consequences had. Jimmy, however, who flattered himself with the most
unfounded hope, the girl he'll meet half way, glasses rich forgot
to even that, began again to crack with his fingers and said, half serious
half bashfully: "Well, if know of someone who Someone that wanted
to - wanted to "? - What, "asked Hedwig. be 'someone's wife, "said
Jimmy, as he, his half advertising it illustrate, the right arm around
the waist of just passing it back to Hedwig.

The girl
recoiled from the touch and saw the cheeky not if, but would in any
case very confident guy with such a serious back-looking views on
that everyone else has to give up to Jimmy's place and any further
attempt in despair.

Jimmy, however, was far from a real rejection of his personality
over to keep even possible, and even went so far as he believed the
matter the same, may bring a kiss to one of mutually satisfactory end.

The opportunity was certainly favorable, no one around, and before Hedwig had any idea of ââthe
proposed project, the outrageous society his right arm around her
and pressed quickly with his left hand while her chin up, and was
just his fat pompous mouth on the tender lips of the girl squeeze,
as their small but strong and as fast fist him so struck in the face,
that he let go of pain and fright, and drew back, and down drops in
the same time also the warm blood on his nose felt.

In almost the same moment the door opened, and a German who had lived in the house for a few
weeks and is now a house bought by Mr Hamann place in a city located somewhere in Ohio, joined
in quickly. He seemed ready and wanted, in fact, before he went on board the steamer, only pay a small
bill that was written in the "bar # #" for him.


"My George!  It's the beatenest thing I ever struck.  And THEN what did you all do?"

"Well, we hollered and took on, but it's so wide there we couldn't make nobody hear.  So pap
said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow. I was the only one that could swim, so
I made a dash for it, and Miss Hooker she said if I didn't strike help sooner, come here and
hunt up her uncle, and he'd fix the thing.  I made the land about a mile below, and been fooling
along ever since, trying to get people to do something, but they said, 'What, in such a night
and such a current? There ain't no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.'  Now if you'll go and--"

"By Jackson, I'd LIKE to, and, blame it, I don't know but I will; but who in the dingnation's
a-going' to PAY for it?  Do you reckon your pap--"

"Why THAT'S all right.  Miss Hooker she tole me, PARTICULAR, that her uncle Hornback--"

"Great guns! is HE her uncle?  Looky here, you break for that light over yonder-way, and turn
out west when you git there, and about a quarter of a mile out you'll come to the tavern; tell
'em to dart you out to Jim Hornback's, and he'll foot the bill.  And don't you fool around
any, because he'll want to know the news.  Tell him I'll have his niece all safe before he
can get to town.  Hump yourself, now; I'm a-going up around the corner here to roust out my
engineer."

I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back and got into my skiff
and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards, and
tucked myself in among some woodboats; for I couldn't rest easy till I could see the ferryboat
start. But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this
trouble for that gang, for not many would a done it.  I wished the widow knowed about it. 
I judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and
dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in.
