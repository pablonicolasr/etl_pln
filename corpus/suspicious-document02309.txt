CHAPTER I

THE VOYAGE OF THE GOLDEN HIND

All through the sixteenth century the South Seas were regarded as a mysterious wonderworld,
whence Spain drew unlimited wealth of gold and silver bullion, of pearls and precious stones.
Spain had declared the Pacific 'a closed sea' to the rest of the world.  But in 1567 it happened
that Sir John Hawkins, an English mariner, was cruising in the Gulf of Mexico, when a terrific
squall, as he said, drove his ships landward to Vera Cruz, and he sent a messenger to the Spanish
viceroy there asking permission to dock and repair his battered vessels.  Now on one of the
English ships was a young officer, not yet twenty-five years of age, named Francis Drake. 
Twelve Spanish merchantmen rigged as frigates lay in the harbour, and Drake observed that cargo
of small bulk but ponderous weight, and evidently precious, was being stowed in their capacious
holds.  Was this the gold and silver {2} bullion that was enriching Spain beyond men's dreams?
Whence did it come?  Could English privateers intercept it on the high seas?

Perhaps the English adventurers evinced too great interest in that precious cargo; for though
the Spanish governor had granted them permission to repair their ships, the English had barely
dismantled when Spanish fire-ships came drifting down on their moorings.  A cannon-shot knocked
a mug of beer from Hawkins's hand, and head over heels he fell into the sea, while a thousand
Spaniards began sabring the English crew ashore.  Some friendly hand threw out a rope to Hawkins,
who was clad in complete armour.  In the dark, unseen by the enemy, he pulled himself up the
side of a smaller ship, and, cutting hawsers, scudded for the open sea.  There escaped, also,
of Hawkins's fleet another small ship, which was commanded by Francis Drake; and after much
suffering both vessels reached England.

One can imagine the effect on young Drake of the treacherous act and of the glimpse of that
cargo of gold and silver treasure.  The English captains had but asked a night's lodging from
a power supposed to be friendly.  {3} They had been met by a pirate raid.  Good!  Young Francis
Drake eagerly took up Spain's challenge; he would meet the raid with counter-raid.  Three years
later he was cruising the Spanish Main, capturing and plundering ships and forts and towns.
In 1572 he led his men across the Isthmus of Panama, and intercepted and captured a Spanish
convoy of treasure coming overland.  Near the south side of the isthmus he climbed a tree and
had his first glimpse of the Pacific.  It set his blood on the leap.  On bended knee he prayed
aloud to the Almighty to be permitted to sail the first English ship on that 'faire sea.' 
And, having recrossed the isthmus and loaded his ships with plunder, he bore away for England
and reached Plymouth in August 1573.

The raid on Panama had brought Drake enormous wealth.  At his own cost he built three frigates
and two sloops to explore the South Seas, his purpose being to enter the Pacific through the
Strait of Magellan, which no Englishman had yet ventured to pass.  These ships he equipped
as if for royal tournament.  Players of the violin and the harp discoursed music at each meal.
Rarest wines filled the lockers. Drake, clad in rich velvet, {4} dined on plates of pure gold
served by ten young noblemen, who never sat or donned hat in his presence; and on his own ship,
the Pelican--afterwards called the Golden Hind--he had a hundred picked marines, men eager
for battle and skilful in wielding the cutlass.  His men loved him as a dauntless leader; they
feared him, too, with a fear that commanded obedience on the instant.

Queen Elizabeth was in a quandary how to treat her gallant buccaneer and rover of the high
seas.  England and Spain were at peace, and she could not give Drake an open royal commission
to raid the commerce of a friendly power; but she did present him with a magnificent sword,
to signify that she would have no objection if he should cut his way through the portals leading
to the 'closed sea.'  The fleet set sail in December 1577, and steered by the west coast of
Morocco and the Cape Verde Islands.  The coast of Brazil was reached in April.  Two of the
ships were abandoned near the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, after having been stripped of provisions.
In August the remaining three ships entered the tempestuous seas around Cape Horn.  Drake drove
before the gales with sails close-reefed and hatches battened, and came {5} out with only one
of his three ships left, the first English keel to cleave the waters of the Pacific.  In honour
of the feat Drake renamed his ship the Golden Hind.  Perhaps there was jocose irony in the
suggestion of gold and speed.  Certain it is, the crew of the Golden Hind were well content
with the possession of both gold and speed before advancing far up the west coast of South America.

Quite by chance, which seems always to favour the daring, somewhere off the coast of Chile
Drake picked up an Indian fisherman.  The natives of South America, for the best of reasons,
hated their Spanish masters, who enslaved them, treated them brutally, and forced them to work
in the pearl fisheries and the mines.  Drake persuaded the Indian to pilot his ship into the
harbour of Valparaiso.  Never dreaming that any foreign vessel had entered the Pacific, Spanish
treasure-ships lay rocking to the tide in fancied security, and actually dipped colours to
Drake.  Drake laughed, waved his plumed hat back in salute, dealt out wine to give courage
to 'his merrie boys,' and sailed straight amid the anchored treasure-ships.  Barely had the
Golden Hind taken a position in the midst of the enemy's fleet, when, selecting one of the
staunchest {6} vessels of the enemy, Drake had grappling-irons thrown out, clamping his ship
to her victim.  In a trice the English sailors were on the Spanish deck with swords out and
the rallying-cry of 'God and St George!  Down with Spanish dogs!'  Dumbfounded and unarmed,
down the hatches, over the bulwarks into the sea, reeled the surprised Spaniards.  Drake clapped
hatches down upon those trapped inside, and turned his cannon on the rest of the unguarded
Spanish fleet. Literally, not a drop of blood was shed.  The treasure-ships were looted of
their cargoes and sent drifting out to sea.

All the other harbours of the Pacific were raided and looted in similar summary fashion; and,
somewhere seaward from Lima, Drake learned of a treasure-ship bearing untold riches--the Glory
of the South Seas--the huge caravel in which the Spaniards sent home to Spain the yearly tribute
of bullion.  The Golden Hind, with her sails spread to the wind, sought for the Glory like
a harrier for its quarry.  One crew of Spaniards on a small ship that was scuttled saved their
throats by telling Drake that the great ship was only two days ahead, and loaded to the water-line
with wealth untold.  Drake crowded sail, had muskets {7} and swords furbished and thirty cannon
loaded, and called on his crew to quit themselves like men.  And when the wind went down he
ordered small boats out to tow the Golden Hind.  For five days the hunt lasted, never slackening
by day or by night; and when, at three in the afternoon of a day in March, Drake's brother
shouted from the cross-trees, 'Sail ho!' every man aboard went mad with impatience to crowd
on the last inch of canvas and overtake the rich prize.  The Englishmen saw that the Spanish
ship was so heavily laden that she was making but slow progress; and so unconscious was the
Spanish captain of danger, that when he discerned a ship approaching he actually lowered canvas
and awaited what he thought might be fresh orders from the viceroy.  The Golden Hind sped on
till she was almost alongside the Spaniard; then Drake let go full blast all thirty cannon,
as fast as he could shift and veer for the cannoneers to take aim.  Yards, sails, masts fell
shattered and torn from the splendid Spanish ship.  The English clapped their grappling-hooks
to her sides, and naked swords did the rest.  To save their lives, the Spanish crew, after
a feeble resistance, surrendered, and bullion to the value in {8} modern money of almost a
million dollars fell into the hands of the men of the Golden Hind.

Drake's vessel was now loaded deep with treasure, and preparations were made to sail homeward,
but her commander realized that it would be dangerous to attempt to return to England by way
of the Spanish Main with a ship so heavily laden that she must sail slowly.  It was then that
legends of a North-East Passage came into his mind.  He would sail northward in search of the
strait that was supposed to lead through the continent to the Atlantic--the mythical strait
of Anian.  As the world knows, there was no such passage; but how far north did Drake sail
seeking it?  Some accounts say as far as Oregon; others, as far as the northern coast of California;
but, at all events, as he advanced farther north he found that the coast sheered farther and
farther west. So he gave over his attempt to find the strait of the legends, and turned back
and anchored in 'a faire and good bay,' which is now known as Drake's Bay, a short distance
north of San Francisco; and, naming the region New Albion, he claimed it for Queen Elizabeth.
In July 1579 he weighed anchor and steered south-west.  {9} He reached the Molucca Islands
in November, and arrived at Java in March.  In June he rounded the Cape of Good Hope and then
beat his way up the Atlantic to England. In September 1580 the Golden Hind entered the harbour
of Plymouth. How Drake became the lion of the hour when he reached England, after having circumnavigated
the globe, need not be told.  Ballads were recited in his honour.  Queen Elizabeth dined in
state on the Golden Hind, and, after the dinner, with the sword which she had given him when
he set out, she conferred on Drake the honour of knighthood, as the seal of his country's acclaim.

Drake's conclusions regarding the supposed passage from the Pacific to the Atlantic were correct,
though for two hundred years they were rejected by geographers.  His words are worth setting
down: 'The Asian and American continents, if they be not fully joined, yet seem they to come
very neere, from whose high and snow-covered mountains, the north and north-west winds send
abroad their frozen nimphes to the infecting of the whole air--hence comes it that in the middest
of their summer, the snow hardly departeth from these hills at all; hence come those thicke
mists and {10} most stinking fogges, ... for these reasons we coniecture that either there
is no passage at all through these Northerne coasts, which is most likely, or if there be,
that it is unnavigable.'

{11}

CHAPTER II

VITUS BERING ON THE PACIFIC

Since Drake's day more than a century had rolled on.  Russia was awakening from ages of sleep,
as Japan has awakened in our time, and Peter the Great was endeavouring to pilot the ship of
state out to the wide seas of a world destiny.  Peter, like the German Kaiser of to-day, was
ambitious to make his country a world-power.  He had seen enough of Europe to learn that neighbouring
nations were increasing their strength in three ways--by conquest, by discovery, and by foreign
commerce--and that foreign commerce meant, not only buying and selling, but carrying the traffic
of other nations.  The East India Company, in whose dockyards he had worked as a carpenter,
was a striking instance of the strength that could be built up by foreign commerce.  Its ships
cruised from Nova Zembia to Persia and East India, carrying forth the products of English workshops
and {12} farms, and bringing back the treasures of all lands.

By conquest, Peter had extended the bounds of his empire from the Ural Mountains to the seas
of China.  By discovery, what remained to be done?  France and England had acquired most of
the North American continent.  Spain and Portugal claimed South America; and Spain had actually
warned the rest of the world that the Pacific was 'a closed sea.'  But there were legends of
a vast domain yet undiscovered.  Juan de Fuca, a Greek pilot, employed, as alleged, by Spanish
explorers between 1587 and 1592, was reported to have told of a passage from the Pacific to
the Arctic through a mountainous forested land up in the region of what is now British Columbia.
Whether Juan lied, or mistook his own fancies for facts, or whether the whole story was invented
by his chronicler Michael Lok, does not much matter.  The fact was that Spanish charts showed
extensive unexplored land north of Drake's New Albion or California.  At this time geographers
had placed on their maps a vast continent called Gamaland between America and Asia; and, as
if in corroboration of this fiction, when Peter's Cossacks struggled doggedly across {13} Asia,
through Siberia, to the Pacific, people on these far shores told tales of drift-wood coming
from America, of islands leading like steps through the sea to America, of a nation like themselves,
whose walrus-hide boats sometimes drifted to Siberia and Kamchatka.  If any new and wealthy
region of the world remained to be discovered, Peter felt that it must be in the North Pacific.
When it is recalled that Spain was supposed to have found in Peru temples lined with gold,
floors paved with silver, and pearls readily exchanged in bucketfuls for glass beads, it can
be realized that the motive for discovery was not merely scientific.  It was one that actuated
princes and merchants alike.  And Peter the Great had an additional motive--the development
of his country's merchant shipping.  It was this that had induced him to establish the capital
of his kingdom on the Baltic.  So, in 1725, five weeks before his death--one of the most terrible
deaths in history, when remorse and ghosts of terrible memories came to plague his dying hours
till his screams could be heard through the palace halls--he issued a commission for one of
the greatest expeditions of discovery that ever set out for America--a commission to Vitus
{14} Bering, the Dane, to explore the Pacific for Russia.

Like Peter the Great, Vitus Bering had served an apprenticeship with the East India Company.
It is more than probable that he first met his royal patron while he was in this service. 
While other expeditions to explore America had but to cross the sea before beginning their
quest, Bering's expedition had to cross the width of Europe, and then the width of Asia, before
it could reach even the sea.  Between St Petersburg and the Pacific lay six thousand miles
of mountain and tundra.  Caravans, flat-boats, and dog-trains must be provided to transport
supplies; and the vessels to be used at the end of the land journey must be built on the Pacific.
The explorers were commissioned to levy tribute for food and fur on Tartar tribes as their
caravans worked slowly eastward.  Bering's first voyage does not concern America.  He set out
from Kamchatka on July 9, 1728, with forty-four men, and sailed far enough north to prove that
Asia and America were not united by any Gamaland, and that the strait now bearing his name
separated the two continents; but, like the tribes of Siberia, he saw signs of a great land
area on {15} the other side of the rain-hidden sea.  Out of the blanketing fog drifted trees,
seaweed, bits of broken boats.  And though Bering, like the English navigator Drake, was convinced
that no Gamaland existed, he was confronted by the learned geographers, who had a Gamaland
on their maps and demanded truculently, whence came the signs of land?

In March 1730, within one month of the time he returned to St Petersburg, Bering was again
ordered to prepare to carry out the dead emperor's command--'to find and set down reliably
what was in the Pacific.'  The explorer had now to take his orders from the authorities of
the Academy of Sciences, whose bookish inexperience and visionary theories were to hamper him
at every turn.  Botanists, artists, seven monks, twelve physicians, Cossack soldiers--in all,
nearly six hundred men--were to accompany him; and to transport this small army of explorers,
four thousand pack-horses were sent winding across the desert wastes of Siberia, with one thousand
exiles as guides and boatmen to work the boats and rafts on the rivers and streams.  Great
blaring of trumpets marked the arrival and departure of the caravans at the Russian forts on
the way; and if the savants, whose {16} presence pestered the soul of poor Bering, had been
half as keen in overcoming the difficulties of the daily trail as they were in drinking pottle-deep
to future successes, there would have been less bickering and delay in reaching the Pacific.
Dead horses marked the trail across two continents.  The Cossack soldiers deserted and joined
the banditti that scoured the Tartar plains; and for three winters the travellers were storm-bound
in the mountains of Siberia.  But at length they reached Avacha Bay on the eastern shore of
Kamchatka, and the waters of the Pacific gladdened the eyes of the weary travellers.  At Petropavlovsk
on the bay they built a fort, houses, barracks, a chapel, and two vessels, named the St Peter
and the St Paul.

Early on the morning of June 4, 1741, the chapel bells were set ringing.  At dawn prayers were
chanted to invoke the blessing of Heaven on the success of the voyage.  Monks in solemn procession
paraded to the water's edge, singing.  The big, bearded men, who had doggedly, drunkenly, profanely,
religiously, marched across deserts and mountains to reach the sea, gave comrades a last fond
embrace, ran down the sand, jumped into the jolly-boats, rowed out, and clambered up {17} the
ships' ladders.  And when the reverberating roll of the fort cannon signalled the hour of departure,
anchors were weighed, and sails, loosened from the creaking yard-arms, fluttered and filled
to the wind. While the landsmen were still cheering and waving a farewell, Bering and his followers
watched the shores slip away, the waters widen, the mountains swim past and back.  Then the
St Peter and the St Paul headed out proudly to the lazy roll of the ocean.

Now the savants, of whom Bering carried too many with him for his own peace of mind, had averred
that he had found no Gamaland on his first voyage because he had sailed too far north.  This
time he was to voyage southward for that passage named after Juan de Fuca.  This would lead
him north of Drake's New Albion in California, and north of the Spanish cruisings about modern
Vancouver Island.  This was to bring him to the mythical Gamaland.  Bering knew there was no
Gamaland; but in the captain's cabin, where the savants bent all day over charts, was the map
of Delisle, the geographer of French Canada, showing vast unnamed lands north of the Spanish
possessions; and in the expedition was a member of the Delisle family.  So {18} Bering must
have known or guessed that an empire half the size of Russia lay undiscovered north of Juan
de Fuca's passage.

So confident were the members of the expedition of reaching land to the east at an early date
that provisions and water for only a few weeks were carried along.  Bering had a crew of seventy-seven
on the St Peter, and among the other men of science with him was the famous naturalist, George
W. Steller.  Lieutenant Chirikoff sailed the St Paul with seventy-six men, and Delisle de la
Croyère was his most distinguished passenger.  As is usual during early June in that latitude,
driving rains and dense fogs came rolling down from the north over a choppy sea.  The fog turned
to snow, and the St Paul, far in the lead, came about to signal if they should not keep together
to avoid losing each other in the thick weather; but the St Peter was careening dangerously,
and shipping thunderous seas astern.  Bering's laconic signal in answer was to keep on south
'to Gamaland'; but when the fog lifted the St Peter was in latitude 46°, far below the supposed
location of the strait of Juan de Fuca, and there was in sight neither Gamaland nor the sister
ship.  The scientists with Bering were in such a peevish mood {19} over the utter disproof
of their mythical continent that they insisted on the commander wasting a whole month pottering
back and forth looking for Chirikoff's ship.  By this time the weather had become very warm,
the drinking water very rank, and the provisions stale.  Finally, the learned men gave decision
that as the other ship could not be found the St Peter might as well turn north.

Bering had become very depressed, and so irritable that he could not tolerate approach.  If
the men of learning had been but wise in the dangers of ocean travel, they would have recognized
in their commander the symptoms of the common sea-scourge of the age--scurvy.  Presently, he
was too ill to leave his bed, and Waxel, who hated all interference and threatened to put the
scientists in irons or throw them overboard, took command.  By the middle of July passengers
and crew were reduced to half allowance of bad water.  Still, there were signs that afforded
hope.  As the ship worked through the fog-blanket northward, drift-wood and land birds, evidently
from a land other than Asia, were seen.

At last came a land wind from the south-east, lifting the fog and driving it back to the north.
And early one morning there were {20} confused cries from the deck hands--then silence--then
shouts of exultant joy!  Everybody rushed above-decks, even the sick in their night-robes,
among them Bering, wan and weak, answering scarce a word to the happy clamour about him.  Before
the sailors' astonished gaze, in the very early light of that northern latitude, lay a turquoise
sea--a shining sheet of water, milky and metallic like a mountain tarn, with the bright greens
and blues of glacial silt; and looming through the primrose clouds of the horizon hung a huge
opal dome in mid-heaven. At first they hardly realized what it meant.  Then shouts went up--'Land!'
'Mountains!' 'Snow-peaks!'  The St Peter glided forward noiseless as a bird on the wing.  Inlets
and harbours, turquoise-green and silent, opened along a jagged, green and alabaster shore.
As the vessel approached the land the explorers saw that the white wall of the inner harbour
was a rampart of solid ice; but where the shore line extended out between ice and sea was a
meadow of ferns and flowers abloom knee-deep, and grasses waist-high.  The spectators shouted
and laughed and cried and embraced one another.  Russia, too, had found a new empire.  St Elias
they named the {21} great peak that hung like a temple dome of marble above the lesser ridges;
but Bering only sighed. 'We think we have done great things, eh?  Well, who knows where this
is?  We're almost out of provisions, and not a man of us knows which way to sail home.'

Steller was down the ship's ladder with the glee of a schoolboy, and off for the shore with
fifteen men in one of the row-boats to explore. They found the dead ashes of a camp-fire on
the sands, and some remnants of smoked fish; but any hope that the lost ship's crew had camped
here was at once dispelled by the print of moccasined feet in the fine sand.  Steller found
some rude huts covered with sea-moss, but no human presence.  Water-casks were filled; and
that relieved a pressing need.  On July 21, when the wind began to blow freshly seaward, Bering
appeared unexpectedly on deck, ashen of hue and staggering from weakness, and peremptorily
ordered anchors up.  Bells were rung and gongs beaten to call those ashore back to the ship.
Steller stormed and swore.  Was it for this hurried race ashore that he had spent years toiling
across two continents?  He wanted to botanize, to explore, to gather data for science; but
the commander had had {22} enough of science.  He was sick unto death, in body and in soul,
sick with the knowledge that they were two thousand miles from any known port, in a tempestuous
sea, on a rickety ship manned for the most part by land-lubbers.

As they scudded before the wind, Bering found that the shore was trending south towards the
home harbour.  They were following that long line of reefed islands, the Aleutians, which project
out from Alaska towards Asia.  A roar of reefs through the fog warned them off the land; but
one midnight of August the lead recorded less than three feet of water under the keel.  Before
there was time for panic, a current that rushed between rocks threw the vessel into a deep
pool of backwash; and there she lay till morning.  By this time many of the sailors were down
with scurvy.  It became necessary to land for fresh water.  One man died as he was lifted from
the decks to the shore. Bering could not stand unaided.  Twenty emaciated sailors were taken
out of their berths and propped up on the sand.  And the water they took from this rocky island
was brackish, and only increased the ravages of the malady.

From the date of this ill-fated landing, a {23} pall--a state of paralysis, of inaction and
fear--seemed to hang over the ship.  The tide-rip was mistaken for earthquake; and when the
lurid glare of volcanic smoke came through the fog, the sailors huddled panic-stricken below-decks
and refused to obey orders.  Every man became his own master; and if that ever works well on
land, it means disaster at sea. Thus it has almost always been with the inefficient and the
misfits who have gone out in ships--land-lubbers trying to be navigators.  Just when Bering's
crew should have braced themselves to resist the greatest stress, they collapsed and huddled
together with bowed heads, inviting the worst that fate could do to them.  When the tide-rip
came through the reefs from the north along the line of the Aleutian Islands with the swiftness
of a mill-race, the men had literally to be held to the rudder at pistol point and beaten up
the masts with the flat of the officers' swords.  But while they skulked, a hurricane rolled
up the fog; and the ship could but scud under bare poles before the wind. Rations were now
down to mouldy sea-biscuits, and only fifteen casks of water remained for three-score men.

Out of the turmoil of waters and wind along {24} the wave-lashed rocks came the hoarse, shrill,
strident cry of the sea-lion, the boom and snort of the great walrus, the roar of the seal
rookeries, where millions of cubs wallowed, and where bulls lashed themselves in their rage
and fought for mastery of the herd.  By November, Waxel alone was holding the vessel up to
the wind.  No more solemn conferences of self-important, self-willed scientists filled the
commander's cabin! No more solemn conclaves and arguments and counter-arguments to induce the
commander to sail this way and that!  Bedlam reigned above and below decks.  No man had any
thought but how to reach home alive. Prayers and vows and offerings went up from the decks
of the St Peter like smoke.  The Russians vowed themselves to holy lives and stopped swearing.

To the inexpressible delight of all hands the prayers seemed to be heard.  On November 4 the
storm abated, and land loomed up on the horizon, dim at first, but taking shape as the vessel
approached it and showing a well-defined, rock-bound harbour.  Was this the home harbour? The
sick crawled on hands and knees above the hatchway to mumble out their thanks to God for escape
from doom.  A cask of brandy was opened, {25} and tears gave place to gruff, hilarious laughter.
Every man was ready to swear that he recognized this headland, that he had known they were
following the right course after all, and that he had never felt any fear at all.

Barely had the grief become joy, when a chill silence fell over the ship.  The only sounds
were the rattling of the rigging against the masts, the groaning of the timbers of the vessel,
and the swish of the waves cut by the prow.  These were not Kamchatka shores.  This was only
another of the endless island reefs they had been chasing since July. The tattered sails flapped
and beat dismally against the cordage. Night fell.  There was a retributive glee in the whistle
of the mocking wind through the rotten rigging, and the ship's timbers groaned to the boom
of the heavy tide.

Bering was past caring whether he lived or died.  Morning revealed a shore of black basalt,
reef upon reef, like sentinels of death saying, 'Come in! come in!  We are here to see that
you never go out'; and there was a nasty clutch to the backwash of the billows smashing down
from those rocks.

Waxel called a last council of all hands in {26} the captain's cabin. 'We should go on home,'
said Bering, rising on his elbow in his berth. 'It matters not to me.  I am past mending; but
even if we have only the foremast left and one keg of water, let us try for the home harbour.
A few days must make it.  Having risked so much, let us risk all to win!' As they afterwards
found, they were only one week from Kamchatka; but they were terrified at the prospect of any
more deep-sea wanderings, and when one of the officers dared to support Bering's view, they
fell on him like wild beasts and threw him from the cabin.  To a man they voted to land.  That
vote was fate's seal to the penalty men must pay for their mistakes.

Above the white fret of reefs precipices towered in pinnacles two thousand feet high.  Through
the reefs the doomed ship stole like a hunted thing.  Only one man kept his head clear and
his hand to the helm--the lieutenant whom all the rest had thrown out of the cabin. The island
seemed absolutely treeless, covered only with sedge and shingle and grass.  The tide began
to toss the ship about so that the sick were rolled from their berths.  Night came with a ghostly
moonlight silvering the fret of a seething sea that seemed to be {27} reaching up white arms
for its puny victims.  The lieutenant threw out an anchor.  It raked bottom and the cable snapped.
The crazed crew began throwing the dead overboard as an offering to appease the anger of the
sea.  The St Peter swept stern foremost full on a reef. Quickly the lieutenant and Steller
threw out the last anchor.  It gripped between rocks and--held.  The tide at midnight had thrown
the vessel into a sheltered cove.  Steller and the lieutenant at once rowed ashore to examine
their surroundings and to take steps to make provision for the morrow.  They were on what is
now known as Bering Island.  Fortunately, it was literally swarming with animal life--the great
manatee or sea-cow in herds on the kelp-beds, blue foxes in thousands, the seal rookeries that
were to make the islands famous; but there was no timber to build houses for wintering in.
It was a barren island.  They could make floors of sand, walls of peat, roofs of sea-moss;
but what shelter was this against northern gales?

By November 8 a rude pit-shelter had been constructed to house the invalided crew; but the
sudden transition from the putrid hold to the open, frosty air caused the death of many as
they were lowered on stretchers.  Amid a {28} heavy snow Bering was wrapped in furs and carried
ashore.  The dauntless Steller faced the situation with judgment and courage.  He acted as
doctor, nurse, and hunter, and daily brought in meat for the hungry and furs to cover the dying.
Five pits sheltered the castaways.  When examined in 1885 the walls of the pits were still
intact--three feet of solid peat.  Clothing of sea-otter skins of priceless value, which afterwards
proved a fortune to those who survived, and food of the flesh of the great sea-cow, saved a
remnant of the wretched crew.  During most of the month of November the St Peter rode safely
at anchor while storms thundered around her retreat; but on the 28th her cable snapped beneath
a hurricane, and she was driven high and dry on the shore, a broken wreck.  In all thirty-one
men had perished of scurvy by January 1742.  Among these was the poor old commander.  On the
morning of December 8, as the wind went moaning round their shelter, Steller heard the Dane
praying in a low voice.  And just at daybreak he passed into that great, quiet Unknown World
whence no traveller has returned.

How the consort ship, the St Paul, found {29} her way back to Kamchatka, and how Bering's castaways
in the spring built themselves a raft and mustered their courage to essay the voyage home which
they ought to have attempted in the autumn, are matters for more detailed history.  But just
as Cartier's discovery of the St Lawrence led to the pursuit of the little beaver across a
continent, so the Russians' discovery of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands led to the pursuit
of the sea-otter up and down the North Pacific; led the way, indeed, to that contest for world
supremacy on the Pacific in which the great powers of three continents are to-day engaged.

CHAPTER III

THE OUTLAW HUNTERS

Chirikoff's crew on the St Paul had long since returned in safety to Kamchatka, and the garrison
of the fort on Avacha Bay had given up Bering's men as lost for ever, when one August morning
the sentinel on guard along the shore front of Petropavlovsk descried a strange apparition
approaching across the silver surface of an unruffled sea. It was like a huge whale, racing,
galloping, coming in leaps and bounds of flying fins over the water towards the fort.  The
soldier telescoped his eyes with his hands and looked again.  This was no whale.  There was
a mast pole with a limp skin-thing for sail.  It was a big, clumsy, raft-shaped flat-boat.
The oarsmen were rowing like pursued maniacs, rising and falling bodily as they pulled.  It
was this that gave the craft the appearance of galloping over the water.  The soldier called
down others to look.  Some one ran for the commander of the {31} fort. What puzzled the onlookers
was the appearance of the rowers.  They did not look like human beings; their hair was long;
their beards were unkempt.  They were literally naked except for breech-clouts and shoulder-pieces
of fur.  Then somebody shouted the unexpected tidings that they were the castaways of Bering's
crew.

Bugles rang; the fort drum rumbled a muster; the chapel bells pealed forth; and the whole population
of the fort rushed to the water-side--shouting, gesticulating, laughing, crying--and welcomed
with wild embraces the returning castaways.  And while men looked for this one and that among
the two-score coming ashore from the raft, and women wept for those they did not find, on the
outskirts of the crowd stood silent observers--Chinese traders and pedlars from Manchuria,
who yearly visited Kamchatka to gather pelts for the annual great fur fairs held in China.
The Chinese merchants looked hard; then nodded knowingly to each other, and came furtively
down amid the groups along the shore front and timidly fingered the matted pelts worn by the
half-naked men.  It was incredible.  Each penniless castaway was wearing the fur of the sea-otter,
or what the Russians called {32} the sea-beaver, more valuable than seal, and, even at that
day, rarer than silver fox.  Never suspecting their value, the castaways had brought back a
great number of the pelts of these animals; and when the Chinese merchants paid over the value
of these furs in gold, the Russians awakened to a realization that while Bering had not found
a Gamaland, he might have stumbled on as great a source of wealth as the furs of French Canada
or the gold-lined temples of Peru. 

"No, monsieur," Jefferson replied, "I succeed him. No one could replace him."

And that answer had more truth than wit.

Honors came to Franklin such as no other American has ever received, but he remained from first
to last the same quiet, deep-hearted, and unselfish man, whose chief motive was the promotion
of human welfare. He had his faults and made his mistakes; but time has sloughed them all away,
and there are few sources of inspiration which can compare with the study of his life.

* * * * *

No family has loomed larger in American affairs than the Adams family
of Massachusetts.

John Adams, President himself and living to see his own son President--an experience which, probably
no other man will ever enjoy--had a second cousin who played a much more important part than
he did in securing the independence of the United States. His name was Samuel Adams, and when
he graduated from Harvard in 1740, at the age of eighteen, his thesis discussed the question,
"Whether it be lawful to resist the supreme magistrate if the commonwealth cannot otherwise be preserved,"
and answered it in the affirmative.

Samuel Adams was a silent, stern and deeply religious man, something of a dreamer, a bad manager and
constantly in debt; but he was perhaps the first in America to conceive
the idea of absolute independence from Great Britain, and he worked
for this end unceasingly and to good purpose.

The wealthy John Hancock was one of his converts, and it was partly to warn these two of the
troops sent out to capture them that Paul Revere took that famous ride to Lexington on the night
of April 18, 1775. A month later, when General Gage offered amnesty
to all the rebels, Hancock and Adams were especially excepted.

It
was Samuel Adams who, perceiving that Virginia was apt to be lukewarm
in aiding a war which was to be fought mostly in the North, suggested
the appointment of Virginia's favorite son, George Washington, as
commander-in-chief of the American army, and who seconded the motion
to that effect made by John Adams. He lived to see his dream of independence
realized, and his grave in the old Granary burying ground at Boston
is one of the pilgrimage places of America. Iron
for bolts of boats must be brought all the way from Europe; so the outlaw hunters did without
iron, and fastened planks together as best they could with deer thongs in place of nails, and
moss and tallow in place of tar.  In the crazy vessels so constructed they ventured out from
Kamchatka two thousand miles across unknown boisterous seas.  Once they had reached the Aleutians,
natives were engaged to do the actual hunting under their direction.  Exiles and criminals
could not be expected to use gentle methods to attain their ends.  'God is high in the heavens
and the Czar is far away,' they said.  The object was quick profit, and plundering was the
easiest way to attain it.  How were the Aleutian Indians paid?  At first they were not paid
at all. They were drugged into service with vodka, a liquor that put them in a frenzy; and
bayoneted and bludgeoned into obedience.  These methods failing, wives and children were seized
by the Russians and held in camp as hostages to guarantee a big hunt.  The {35} Aleuts' one
object in meeting the Russian hunter at all was to get possession of firearms. From the time
Bering's crew and Chirikoff's men had first fired rifles in the presence of these poor savages
of the North, the Indians had realized that 'the stick that thundered' was a weapon they must
possess, or see their tribe exterminated.

The brigades of sea-otter hunters far exceeded in size and wild daring the platoons of beaver
hunters, who ranged by pack-horse and canoe from Hudson Bay to the Rocky Mountains.  The Russian
ship, provisioned for two or three years, would moor and draw up ashore for the winter on one
of the eleven hundred Aleutian Islands.  Huts would be constructed of drift-wood, roofed with
sea-moss; and as time went on even rude forts were erected on two or three of the islands--like
Oonalaska or Kadiak--where the kelp-beds were extensive and the hunting was good enough to
last for several years.  The Indians would then be attracted to the camp by presents of brandy
and glass beads and gay trinkets and firearms.  Perhaps one thousand Aleut hunters would be
assembled.  Two types of hunting boats were used--the big 'bidarkie,' carrying twenty or thirty
men, and the little kayak, a {36} mere cockle-shell.  Oiled walrus-skin, stretched taut as
a drum-head, served as a covering for the kayak against the seas, a manhole being left in the
centre for the paddler to ensconce himself waist-deep, with oilskin round his waist to keep
the water out.  Clothing was worn fur side in, oiled side out; and the soles of all moccasins
were padded with moss to protect the feet from the sharp rocks.  Armed with clubs, spears,
steel gaffs and rifles, the hunters would paddle out into the storm.

There were three types of hunting--long distance rifle-shooting, which the Russians taught
the Aleuts; still hunting in a calm sea; storm hunting on the kelp-beds and rocks as the wild
tide rode in with its myriad swimmers.  Rifles could be used only when the wind was away from
the sea-otter beds and the rocks offered good hiding above the sea-swamps.  This method was
sea-otter hunting de luxe.  Still hunting could only be followed when the sea was smooth as
glass.  The Russian schooner would launch out a brigade of cockle-shell kayaks on an unruffled
stretch of sea, which the sea-otter traversed going to and from the kelp-beds.  While the sea-otter
is a marine denizen, it must come up to breathe; and if it does not come up frequently of its
{37} own volition, the gases forming in its body bring it to the surface. The little kayaks
would circle out silent as shadows over the silver surface of the sea.  A round head would
bob up, or a bubble show where a swimmer was moving below the surface.  The kayaks would narrow
their surrounding circle.  Presently a head would appear.  The hunter nearest would deal the
death-stroke with his steel gaff, and the quarry would be drawn in.  But it was in the storm
hunt over the kelp-beds that the wildest work went on.  Through the fiercest storm scudded
bidarkies and kayaks, meeting the herds of sea-otter as they drove before the gale. To be sure,
the bidarkies filled and foundered; the kayaks were ripped on the teeth of the rock reefs.
But the sea took no account of its dead; neither did the Russians.  Only the Aleut women and
children wept for the loss of the hunters who never returned; and sea-otter hunting decreased
the population of the Aleutian Islands by thousands.  It was as fatal to the Indian as to the
sea-otter.  Two hundred thousand sea-otters were taken by the Russians in half a century. 
Kadiak yielded as many as 6000 pelts in a single year; Oonalaska, 3000; the Pribylovs, 5000;
Sitka used to yield 15,000 a {38} year.  To-day there are barely 200 a year found from the
Commander Islands to Sitka.

It may be imagined that Russian criminals were not easy masters to the simple Aleut women and
children who were held as hostages in camp to guarantee a good hunt.  Brandy flowed like water,
the Czar was far away, and it was a land with no law but force.  The Russian hunters cast conscience
and fear to the winds.  Who could know?  God did not seem to see; and it was two thousand miles
to the home fort in Kamchatka.  When the hunt was poor, children were brained with clubbed
rifles, women knouted to death before the eyes of husbands and fathers. In 1745 a whole village
of Aleuts had poison put in their food by the Russians.  The men were to eat first, and when
they perished the women and children would be left as slaves to the Russians.  A Cossack, Pushkareff,
brought a ship out for the merchant Betshevin in 1762, and, in punishment for the murder of
several brutal members of the crew by the Aleuts, he kidnapped twenty-five of their women.
Then, as storm drove him towards Kamchatka, he feared to enter the home port with such a damning
human cargo.  So he promptly marooned fourteen victims on a rocky coast, {39} and binding the
others hand and foot, threw them into the sea.  The merchant and the Cossack were both finally
punished by the Russian government for the crimes of this voyage; but this did not silence
the blood of the murdered women crying to Heaven for vengeance. In September 1762 the criminal
ship came back to Avacha Bay.  In complete ignorance of the Cossack's diabolical conduct, four
Russian ships sailed that very month for the Aleutian Islands.  Since 1741, when Bering's sailors
had found the kelp-beds, Aleuts had hunted the sea-otter and Russians had hunted the Aleuts.
For three years fate reversed the wheel.  It was to be a man-hunt of fugitive Russians.

Just before the snow fell in the autumn of 1763 Alexis Drusenin anchored his ship on the north-east
corner of Oonalaska, where the rocks sprawl out in the sea in five great spurs like the fingers
of a hand.  The spurs are separated by tempestuous reef-ribbed seas.  The Indians were so very
friendly that they voluntarily placed hostages of good conduct in the Russians' hands.  Two
or three thousand Aleut hunters came flocking over the sea in their kayaks to join the sea-otter
brigades.  On the spur opposite to Drusenin's {40} anchorage stood an Aleut village of forty
houses; on the next spur, ten miles away across the sea, was another village of seventy people.
The Russian captain divided his crew, and placed from nine to twelve men in each of the villages.
With ample firearms and enough brandy half a dozen Russians could control a thousand Aleuts.
Swaggering and bullying and loud-voiced and pot-valiant, Drusenin and two Cossacks stooped
to enter a low-thatched Aleut hut.  The entrance step pitched down into a sort of pit; and
as Drusenin stumbled in face foremost a cudgel clubbed down on his skull.  The Cossack behind
stumbled headlong over the prostrate form of his officer; and in the dark there was a flash
of long knives--such knives as the hunters used in skinning their prey.  Both bodies were cut
to fragments.  The third man seized an axe as the murderers crowded round him and beat them
back; he then sought safety in flight.  There was a hiss of hurtling spears thrown after him
with terrible deftness.  With his back pierced in a dozen places, drenched in his own blood,
the Cossack almost tumbled over the prostrate body of a sentinel who had been on guard at a
house down by the ship, and had been wounded by the flying {41} spears.  A sailor dashed out,
a yard-long bear-knife in his grasp, and dragged the two men inside.  Of the dozen Russians
stationed here only four survived; and their hut was beset by a rabble of Aleuts drunk with
vodka, drunk with blood, drunk with a frenzy of revenge.

Cooped up in the hut, the Russians kept guard by twos till nightfall, when, dragging a bidarkie
down to the water, they loaded it with provisions and firearms, and pushed out in the dark
to the moan and heave of an unquiet sea.  Though weakened from loss of blood, the fugitives
rowed with fury for the next spur of rock, ten miles away, where they hoped to find help. 
The tide-rip came out of the north with angry threat and broke against the rocks, but no blink
of light shone through the dark from the Russian huts ashore.  The men were afraid to land,
and afraid not to land.  Wind and sea would presently crush their frail craft to kindling-wood
against the rocky shore.

The Russians sprang out, waded ashore, uttered a shout!  Instantly lances and spears fell about
them like rain.  They joined hands and ran for the cove where the big schooner had been moored.
Breathlessly they waited for the dawn to discover where their ship lay; {42} but daylight revealed
only the broken wreckage of the vessel along the shore, while all about were blood-stains and
pieces of clothing and mutilated bodies, which told but too plainly that the crew had been
hacked to pieces.  There was not a moment to be lost.  Before the mist could lift, the fugitives
gathered up some provisions scattered on the shore and ran for their lives to the high mountains
farther inland.  And when daylight came they scooped a hole in the sand, drew a piece of sail-cloth
over this, and lay in hiding till night.

From early December to early February the Russians hid in the caves of the Oonalaska mountains.
Clams, shell-fish, sea-birds stayed their hunger.  It is supposed that they must have found
shelter in one of the caves where there are medicinal hot springs; otherwise, they would have
perished of cold.  In February they succeeded in making a rude boat, and in this they set out
by night to seek the ships of other Russian hunters.  For a week they rowed out only at night.
Then they began to row by day.  They were seen by Indians, and once more sought safety in the
caves of the mountains, where they remained in hiding for five weeks, venturing {43} out only
at night in search of food.  Here, snow-water and shell-fish were all they had to sustain them;
and again they must build a rude raft to escape.  Towards the end of March they descried a
Russian vessel in the offing, and at last succeeded in reaching friends.

Almost the same story could be told of the crews of each of the ships that had sailed from
Avacha Bay in September 1762.  One ship foundered. The castaways were stabbed where they lay
in exhausted sleep.  Every member of the crew on a third ship had been slain round a bath-house,
such as Russian hunters built in that climate to enable them to ward off rheumatism by vapour
plunges.  One ship only escaped the general butchery and carried the refugees home.

Of course, Cossack and hunter exacted terrible vengeance for this massacre.  Whole villages
were burned to the ground and every inhabitant sabred.  On one occasion, as many as three hundred
victims were tied in line and shot.  The result was that the Cossacks' outrages and the Aleuts'
vengeance drew the attention of the Russian government to this lucrative fur trade in the far
new land.  The disorders put an end to free, unrestricted trade.  {44} Henceforth a hunter
must have a licence; and a licence implied the favour of the court.  The court saw to it that
a governor took up his residence in the region to enforce justice and to compel the hunters
to make honest returns.  Like the Hudson's Bay men, the Russian fur traders had to report direct
to the crown.  Thus was inaugurated on the west coast of America the Russian régime, which
ended only in 1867, when Alaska was ceded to the United States.

{45}

CHAPTER IV

COOK AND VANCOUVER

It was the quest for a passage to the Atlantic that brought Captain James Cook to the Pacific.
Before joining the Royal Navy, Cook had been engaged as a captain in the Baltic trade; and
from Russian merchantmen he had learned all about Bering's voyage in the North Pacific, which
was being quoted by the geographers in proof of an open passage north of Alaska.  In the Baltic,
too, Cook had heard about the strait of Juan de Fuca, which was supposed to lead through the
continent to the Atlantic.  At this time all England was agog with demands that the Hudson's
Bay Company should find a North-West Passage or surrender its charter.  Parliament had offered
a reward of £20,000 to any one discovering a passage-way to the Pacific, and Samuel Hearne
had been sent tramping inland to explore the north by land.  Curiously enough, Cook had been
born in 1728, the very {46} year that Bering had set out on his first expedition; and he was
in the Baltic when news came back to St Petersburg of Bering's death.  The year 1759 found
him at Quebec with Wolfe.  During the next ten years he explored and charted northern and southern
seas; and when the British parliament determined to set at rest for ever the myth of a passage,
Cook was chosen to conduct the expedition.  He was granted two ships--the Resolution and the
Discovery; and among the crews was a young midshipman named Vancouver.  The vessels left England
in the summer of 1776, and sailed from the Sandwich Islands in 1778 for Drake's New Albion.
The orders were to proceed from New Albion up to 65° north latitude and search for a passage
to Hudson Bay.

On March 7, 1778--two hundred years after Drake's famous voyage--Cook's ships descried thin,
sharp lines of land in the offing.  As the vessels drew nearer the coast towering mountains
met the gaze of the explorers. Cook had orders to keep a sharp look-out in this region for
the strait of Juan de Fuca; but storm drove him off-shore, and, although he discovered and
named Cape Flattery at the entrance to the strait that now bears the name {47} of the old Greek
pilot, he did not catch as much as a glimpse of the great bay opening inland.  In fact, he
set down that in this latitude there was no possibility of Juan de Fuca's strait existing.
Landing was made on Vancouver Island at the famous harbour now known as Nootka; and Indians
swarmed the sea in gaily painted dug-outs with prows carved like totem-poles.  Women and children
were in the canoes.  That signified peace; and though cannon were manned in readiness, an active
and friendly trade at once opened between the crews and the natives.  Fifteen hundred beaver
and sea-otter pelts were exchanged for a handful of old nails.  At least two thousand natives
gathered round the two ships.  Some of the men wore masks and had evidently just returned from
a raid, for they offered Cook human skulls from which the flesh had not been removed, and pointed
to slave captives.

Any one who knows Vancouver Island in spring needs no description of the inspiring scene surveyed
by the sea-weary crews.  Snow rested on the coastal mountains.  The huge opal dome now known
as Mount Baker loomed up through the clouds of dawn and dusk on the southern sky-line. In fair
{48} weather the long pink ridge of the Olympics could be seen towards Puget Sound.  Inland
from Nootka were vast mountain ridges heavily forested to the very clouds with fir trees and
spruce of incredible size.  Lower down grew cypress, with gnarled red roots entangling the
rocks to the very water's edge, Spanish moss swinging from branch to branch, and partridge
drumming in the underbrush.  For a month the deep-sea travellers enjoyed a welcome furlough
on shore.  One night the underbrush surrounding the encampment was found to be literally alive
with painted warriors.  Cook demanded an explanation of the grand 'tyee' or chief.  The Indian
explained that these were guards to protect the encampment.  However that might be, Cook deemed
it well to be off.

On May 1 the ships were skirting the Sitka coast, which Chirikoff and Bering had explored a
quarter of a century previously.  St Elias, Bering's landfall, was sighted.  So was the spider-shaped
bay now known as Prince William Sound.  The Indians here resembled the Eskimos of Greenland
so strongly that the hopes of the explorers began to rise. So keen were they to prove the existence
of a passage to the Atlantic that when swords, {49} beads, powder, evidently obtained from
white traders, were observed among the Indians, the Englishmen tried to persuade themselves
that these Indians must be in communication with the Indians of the domain of the Hudson's
Bay Company, forgetting that Russians had been on the ground for forty years.  Cook sailed
round the coast, past Cape Prince of Wales and through Bering Strait, keeping his prows northward
until an impassable wall of ice barred his way.  Having now thoroughly explored the coast,
Cook was satisfied that Drake and Bering had been right.  There was no passage east.   He then
crossed to Siberia, sailed down the Asiatic coast, and visited the Aleutian Islands.  The Russians
of Oonalaska and Kamchatka resented the English intrusion on their hunting-ground, while the
English refused to acknowledge that they were invading Russian territory.

It was planned to winter and repair the ships at the Sandwich Islands. This part of Cook's
voyage does not concern Canada.  It was something like a repetition of the transgressions of
the Russian outlaw hunters, and was followed by the penalty that transgressors pay.  The islanders
had welcomed the white men as demi-gods, but the gods {50} proved to have feet of clay.  To
the islanders a sacred 'taboo' always existed round the burial-graves.  Cook permitted his
sailors to violate this 'taboo' in order to take timber for the repair of his ships.  Perhaps
it was a reaction from almost three years of navy discipline; perhaps it was the influence
of those seductive southern seas; however that may be, the sailors apparently gave themselves
up to riotous debauch.  The best of the islanders withdrew disillusioned, sad, sullen, resentful
over the violation of their sacred burial-places.  Only the riff-raff of the natives forgathered
with the riotous crew.  When the ships at length set sail with a crew sore-headed from dissipation,
by way of a climax to the debauch, a number of women and children were carried along.

Retribution came swift as sword-stroke.  The women set up such a wailing that Cook stopped
the ships to set them ashore.  In the delay of rowing the boats to land a fierce gale sprang
up.  The wind snapped off the foremast of the Resolution clean to the decks.  The two ships
had to put back to the harbour for repairs.  Not a canoe, not a man, not a voice, welcomed
them.  The sailors were sullen; Cook was angry; and when the white {51} men wanted to trade
for fresh food, the islanders would take only daggers and knives in barter.  The white men
had stolen from their burial-graves.  The savages now tried to steal from the ships, and on
Sunday, February 14, they succeeded in carrying off the large row-boat of the Discovery.

Cook landed with a strong bodyguard to demand hostages for the return of the lost boat.  The
islanders remembered the kidnapping of the women, and refused.  Cook was foolhardy enough to
order his men to fire on any canoe trying to escape from the harbour.  The rest of the episode
is so familiar that it scarcely needs telling.  A chief crossing the harbour in a skiff was
shot.  The women were at once hurried off to the hills.  The men donned their spears and war-mats.
A stone hurled from the rabble running down to the shore struck Cook. Enraged out of all self-control,
he shot the culprit dead.  In defence of their commander some marines rowing ashore at once
fired a musketry volley into the horde of islanders.  Cook turned his back to the thronging
savages, now frenzied to a delirium, and signalled the marines to cease firing.  As he did
so, a dagger was plunged beneath his shoulder-blade.  He was {52} hacked to pieces under the
eyes of his powerless men; and four soldiers also fell beneath the furious onslaught.

What need to tell of the wild scramble for the sea; of the war-horns blowing all night in the
dark; of the camp-fires glimmering from the women's retreat in the hills?  By dint of threat
and show of arms and promises, Captain Charles Clerke, who was now in command, induced the
islanders to deliver the remnants of Cook's body.  In an impressive silence, on Sunday the
21st of February 1779, the coffin containing the great commander's bones was committed to the deep.

The sensational nature of Cook's death, within half a century of Bering's equally tragic fate,
while exploring the same unknown seas, spread round the world the fame of the exploits of both.
It was recalled that Drake had claimed New Albion for England two centuries before.  Then rumours
came that the Spanish viceroy in Mexico had been following up the discoveries of both Drake
and Bering.  One Bruno Heceta from Monterey made report that there were signs of a great turbid
river cutting the coast-line north of Drake's New Albion.  In spite of Cook's {53} adverse
report, the questions were again mooted: Where was Juan de Fuca's strait?  Did it lead to Hudson
Bay?  Where was this Great River of which both the inland savages and the Spanish explorers
spoke?  Quebec had fallen.  Scottish fur merchants of Montreal had formed the North-West Company
in opposition to the Hudson's Bay Company, and were pushing their traders far west towards
the Rockies, far north towards the Arctic Circle.  Who would be first to find the great unknown
river, to fathom the mysteries of Juan de Fuca's strait?  Dreaming of these things up in the
Athabaska country, Alexander Mackenzie, a trader for the Nor'westers, was preparing to push
his canoes down to the Arctic as a preliminary to his greater journey to the Pacific.  If Bering's
crew, if Cook's crew, both sold half-rotted cargoes of furs for thousands of pounds, how much
more easily could trading vessels properly equipped reap fortune from the new El Dorado!

Inland by canoe from Montreal, overland by flat-boat and pack-horse from the Missouri, across
the continent from Hudson Bay, round the world by the Cape and the Horn, across the ocean from
China--it now became a race to the Pacific.  Greater wealth seemed there {54} in furs than
had been found in gold in the temples of Peru, or in silver in the mines of Mexico.  The struggle
for control of the Pacific, which has culminated in our own day, now began.  Spain, Russia,
England, Canada, and the new-born United States were the contestants in the arena.  What has
reached its climax in the sluicing of two oceans together at Panama began in the pursuit of
sea-otter and seal after the voyages of Bering and of Cook.

The United States had an added motive.  On the principle of protecting native shipping, American
ports discriminated against British ships, and British ports discriminated against American
ships.  It was absolutely necessary to their existence as a nation that the United States should
build up a merchant fleet.  Under fostering laws, with the advantages of cheap labour and abundant
timber, a wonderful clipper fleet had been constructed in Massachusetts and Maryland and Virginia
ship-yards, consisting of swift sailing-vessels suitable for belting the seas in promoting
commerce and in war.  The ship-yards built on shares with the merchants, who outfitted the
cargo.  Builders and merchants would then divide the profits.  Under these conditions American
traders were penetrating {55} almost every sea in the world; and the cargoes brought back built
up the substantial fortunes of many old Boston families.  'Bostonnais' these swift new traders
were called from the Baltic to China.  It can be readily believed that what they heard of Cook
and Bering interested the Boston men mightily.  At all events, they fitted out two ships for
the Pacific trade--ships that were to range the seas for the United States as Drake's and Cook's
had drawn a circle round the world for England.  Captain John Kendrick commanded the Columbia,
Captain Robert Gray the Lady Washington, and on one of the vessels was a sailor who had been
to the North-West coast with Cook.  In order to secure Spain's goodwill, letters were obtained
to the viceroy of Mexico; and when, in the course of the voyage, these letters were presented
to the viceroy of Mexico at San Blas, he honoured them by at once issuing orders to the presidios
of Monterey and Santa Barbara and San Francisco to arrest both officers and crew if the Americans
touched at any Spanish port.  Spain was still dreaming of the Pacific being 'a closed sea.'
She took cognizance of Bering's exploits to the north, but she at once strove to checkmate
an advance south from {56} the north, by herself advancing north from the south.  It was in
1775 that Heceta had observed the turbid entrance to a great river and the opening to a strait
that might be that of Juan de Fuca.  However, on Monday, October 1, 1787, the two American
vessels sailed away from Boston.  It was August of 1788 before they were off Drake's New Albion;
and in the stormy weather encountered all the way up the Pacific, the little sloop Lady Washington
had proved a faster, better sailer than the heavier cargo vessel, the Columbia.  Signs of a
river were observed; and a pause was made at one of the harbours on the coast--either Tillamook
or Gray's Harbour.  Here the Indians, indignant at a recent outrage committed against them
by whites, attacked the Americans and drove them off before they could search for an entrance
to the Great River.  It now became apparent that the small sloop had the advantage, not only
in speed, but because it could go in closer to the coast.  Towards the end of August Gray's
crew distinctly observed the Olympic mountains and set down record of Cape Flattery. 'I am
of opinion,' notes the mate, 'that the Straits of Juan de Fuca do exist; for the coast takes
a great bend here.'

{57}

At Nootka surprise awaited the Americans.  John Meares and William Douglas, English captains,
were there in a palisaded fort and with two vessels; a little trading schooner of thirty tons
named the North-West America had just been built--the first ship built on the North-West coast--and
was being launched amid thunder of cannon and clinking of glasses, and September 19 was observed
as a holiday--the first public holiday in what is now British Columbia.  Meares and Douglas
entertained Gray at dinner, and over brimming wine-glasses gave him the news of recent happenings
on the coast.  Captain Barkley, another English trader, had looked into the Strait of Juan
de Fuca and placed it on his chart.  Meares had sought in vain for the River of the West, and
did not believe that it existed.  In fact, he had named the headland that hid it Cape Disappointment.
And, of course, no furs existed on the Pacific coast.  When did a fur trader ever acknowledge
to a rival that there were furs?  Meares reported that he, too, had been down at Tillamook
Bay; and Gray guessed that it had been Meares's injustice to the Indians that provoked the
raid on himself.  Meares was short of provisions, and the Lady Washington needed {58} repairs.
The American gave the Englishman provisions to reach China, and the Englishman repaired the
American's ship.  Meares declared that he had bought all Nootka from the Indians.  He did not
relate that he had paid only two pocket-pistols and some copper for it.  Towards the end of
September came Kendrick on the belated Columbia.  Both Americans were surprised to learn that
half a dozen navigators had already gone as far north as Nootka Sound.  Perez, Heceta, Quadra--all
had coasted Vancouver Island for Spain from 1774 to 1779, and so had La Pérouse, the French
explorer, in 1787.  Hanna had come out from China for furs in 1785.  In 1787 Portlock and Dixon
had secured almost two thousand sea-otter skins as far north as the Queen Charlotte Islands.
These were things Meares did not tell the Americans.  It would have been to acknowledge that
an abundance of furs was there to draw so many trading-ships.  But during the winter at Nootka
the men from Boston learned these facts from the Indians.

The winter was passed in trading with the Indians, and spring saw Gray far up the Strait of
Juan de Fuca.  By May 1 the ships were loaded with furs and were about to sail.  {59} Meanwhile,
what had the Spanish viceroy been doing?  Strange that the Spaniards should look on complaisantly
while English traders from China--Meares and Hanna and Barkley and Douglas--were taking possession
of Nootka.  The answer came unexpectedly.  Just as the 'Bostonnais' were sailing out for a
last run up the coast, there glided into Nootka Sound a proud ship--all sails set, twenty cannon
pointed, Spanish colours spread to the breeze.  The captain of this vessel, Don Joseph Martinez,
took a look at the English fortifications and another at the Americans.  The Americans were
enemies of England.  Therefore the pompous don treated them royally, presented them with spices
and wines, and allowed them to depart unmolested.  When the Americans returned from the run
up coast, they found the English fort dismantled, a Spanish fort erected on Hog Island at the
entrance of the sound, and Douglas's ship--the companion of Meares's vessel--held captive by
the Spaniard.  Gray and Kendrick now exchanged ships, and sailed for China to dispose of their
cargoes of furs and receive in exchange cargoes of tea for Boston.  The whole city of Boston
welcomed the Columbia home in the autumn of 1790.  Fifty thousand {60} miles she had ploughed
through the seas in three years.

In June 1791 Gray was out again on the Columbia.  This time he went as far north as the Portland
Canal, past the Queen Charlotte Islands, where he met Kendrick on the Lady Washington.  The
quarrel at Nootka between the English and the Spaniards was still going on; so this autumn
the two 'Bostonnais' anchored for the winter in Clayoquot Sound--a place later to be made famous
by tragedy--south of Nootka. Here they built a stockaded fur-post for themselves, which they
named Fort Defence.  During the winter they built and launched a little coasting schooner,
the Adventure.

Up at Nootka the Spaniard Gonzales de Haro had replaced Martinez; and his countrymen Quimper
and Elisa were daily exploring on the east side of Vancouver Island, where to this day Spanish
names tell of their charting.  Some of the names, however, were afterwards changed.  What is
to-day known as Esquimalt, Quimper called Valdes, and Victoria he named Cordoba.  Amid much
firing of muskets and drinking of wine Quimper took solemn possession of all this territory
for Spain.  Then, early in August {61} of 1791, he sailed away for Monterey, while Elisa remained
at Nootka.

Gray knew that three English vessels which had come from China for furs--Colnett's Argonaut,
Douglas's Iphigenia, and the Princess Royal--had been seized by the Spanish at Nootka.  Though
the fact had not been trumpeted to the world, the Spanish said that their pilots had explored
these coasts as early as 1775--at least three years before Cook's landing at Nootka; so that
if first exploration counted for possession, Spain had first claim.  Whether the Spaniards
instigated the raid that now threatened the rival American fort at Clayoquot, the two 'Bostonnais'
never knew.  The Columbia had been beached and dismantled.  Loop-holes punctured the palisades
of the fort, and cannon were above the gates.  Sentinels kept constant guard; but what was
Gray's horror to learn in February 1792 that Indians to the number of two thousand were in
ambush round the fort and had bribed a Hawaiian boy to wet the priming of the 'Bostonnais'
guns.  The fort could not be defended against such a number of enemies, for there were not
twenty men within the walls.  Gray hastily got the Columbia ready for sea. Having stowed in
the hold {62} enough provisions to carry them home if flight should become necessary, the sailors
worked in the dark to their necks in water scraping the hull free of barnacles, and when the
high tide came in, she was floated out with all on board.  On the morning of the 20th the woods
were seen to be alive with Indians.  The Indians had not counted on their prey escaping by
sea, and an old chief came suavely aboard offering Gray sea-otter skins if the 'Bostonnais'
would go ashore to trade.  Gray slapped the old rascal across the face; the Indian was over
the side at a plunge, and the marauders were seen no more.

In spite of the difficulties and dangers it presented, Gray determined to make another effort
to find the river which old Bruno Heceta had sighted in 1775.  And early in April, after sending
his mate north on the little vessel Adventure to trade, Gray sailed away south on the Columbia.
Let us leave him for the present stealing furtively along the coast from Cape Flattery to Cape
Disappointment.

It was the spring of 1792.  The Spaniard Elisa of Nootka had for a year kept his pilot Narvaez,
in a crazy little schooner crowded {63} with thirty sailors, charting north-east past the harbour
of Victoria, through Haro Strait, following very much the same channel that steamers follow
to-day as they ply between Victoria and Vancouver.  East of a high island, where holiday folk
now have their summer camps, Pilot Narvaez came on the estuary of a great river, which he called
Boca de Florida Blanca.  This could not be Bruno Heceta's river, for this was farther north
and inland.  It was a new river, with wonderful purple water--the purple of river silt blending
with ocean blue.  The banks were wooded to the very water's edge with huge-girthed and mossed
trees, such as we to-day see in Stanley Park, Vancouver.  The river swept down behind a deep
harbour, with forested heights between river-mouth and roadstead, as if nature had purposely
interposed to guard this harbour against the deposit of silt borne down by the mighty stream.
To-day a boulevard rises from the land-locked harbour and goes over the heights to the river-mouth
like the arc of a bow; the finest residences of the Canadian Pacific coast stand there; and
the river is lined with mile upon mile of lumber-yards and saw-mills.  Where the rock projects
like a hand into the turbid waters stands {64} a crowded city, built like New York on what
is almost an island.  Where the opposite shores slope down in a natural park are rising the
buildings of a great university.  The ragged starveling crew of Pilot Narvaez had found what
are now known as Burrard Inlet, Vancouver City, Point Grey, Shaughnessy Heights, and the Fraser
River.  The crew were presently all ill of scurvy, possibly because of the unsanitary crowding,
and the schooner, almost falling to pieces, came crawling back to Nootka.  The poor Mexicans
were utterly unaware that they had discovered a gateway for northern empire.  Narvaez himself
lay almost unconscious in his berth.  Elisa sent them all home to Mexico on furlough; and,
on hearing their report, the viceroy of Mexico ordered out two ships, the Sutil and the Mexicana,
Don Galiano and Don Valdes in command, to follow up the charting of the coast northward from
Vancouver Island to the Russian settlements.

Small ringing of bells, no blaring of trumpets at all, prayers a-plenty, but little ammunition
and less food, accompanied the deep-sea voyagings of these poor Spanish pilots.  When Bering
set out, he had the power of the whole Russian empire behind him.  When Cook set {65} out,
he had the power of the whole British Navy behind him.  But when the poor Mexican peons set
out, they had nothing behind them but the branding iron, or slavery in the mines, if they failed.
Yet they sang as they sailed their rickety death-traps, and they laughed as they rowed; and
when the tide-rip caught them, they sank without a cry to any but the Virgin.  Look at a map
of the west coast of the Pacific from the Horn to Sitka.  First were the Spaniards at every
harbour gate; and yet to-day, of all their deep-sea findings on that coast, not a rod, not
a foot, does Spain own.  It was, of course, Spain's insane policy of keeping the Pacific 'a
closed sea' that concealed the achievements of the Mexican pilots and buried them in oblivion.
But if actual accomplishments count, these pilots with their ragged peon crews, half-bloods
of Aztec woman and Spanish adventurer, deserve higher rank in the roll of Pacific coast exploration
than history has yet accorded them.

England, it may be believed, did not calmly submit to seeing the ships and forts of her traders
seized at Nootka.  It was not that England cared for the value of three vessels engaged in
foreign trade.  Still less did she {66} care for the log-huts dignified by the name of a fort.
But she was mistress of the seas, and had been since the destruction of the Armada.  And as
mistress of the seas, she could not tolerate as much as the seizure of a fishing-smack.  For
some time there were mutterings of war, but at length diplomacy prevailed. England demanded,
among other things, the restoration of the buildings and the land, and full reparation for
all losses.  Spain decided to submit, and accordingly the Nootka Convention was signed by the
two powers in October 1790.  Two ships, the Discovery and the Chatham, were then fitted out
by the British Admiralty for an expedition to the Pacific to receive formal surrender of the
property from Spain, and also to chart the whole coast of the Pacific from Drake's New Albion
to the Russian possessions at Sitka.  This expedition was commanded by Captain George Vancouver,
who had been on the Pacific with Cook.  It was April 1792 when Vancouver came up abreast of
Cape Disappointment. Was it chance, or fate, that a gale drove him off-shore just two weeks
before a rival explorer entered the mouth of the great unknown river that lay on his vessel's
starboard bow?  But for this mishap Vancouver might have discovered {67} the Columbia, and
England might have made good her claim to the territory which is now Oregon and Washington
and Idaho.  Vancouver's ships were gliding into the Strait of Juan de Fuca when they met a
square-hulled, trim little trader under the flag of the United States.  It was the Columbia,
commanded by Robert Gray.  The American told an astounding story.  He had found Bruno Heceta's
River of the West.  Vancouver refused to credit the news; yet there was the ship's log; there
were the details--landmarks, soundings, anchorages for twenty miles up the Columbia from its
mouth.  Gray had, indeed, been up the river, and had crossed the bar and come out on the Pacific
again.

Vancouver now headed his ships inland and proceeded to explore Puget Sound.  Never before had
white men's boats cruised the waters of that spider-shaped sea.  Every inlet of the tortuous
coasts was penetrated and surveyed, to make certain that no passage to the north-east lay through
these waters.  In June the explorers passed up the Strait of Georgia.  A thick fog hid from
them what would have proved an important discovery--the mouth of the Fraser river.  Some distance
north of Burrard Inlet the explorers met the two {68} Spanish ships which the viceroy of Mexico
had sent out, the Sutil and the Mexicana, commanded respectively by Don Galiano and Don Valdes.
From them Vancouver learned that Don Quadra, the Spanish representative, was awaiting him at
Nootka, prepared to restore the forts and property as agreed in the Nootka Convention.  The
vessels continued their journey northward and entered Queen Charlotte Sound in August.  Then,
steering into the open sea, Vancouver sailed for Nootka to meet Spain's official messenger.
He had circumnavigated Vancouver Island.

The Nootka controversy had almost caused a European war.  Now it ended in what has a resemblance
to a comic opera.  Vancouver found the Spaniards occupying a fort on an island at the mouth
of the harbour. On the main shore stood the Indian village of Chief Maquinna.  A Spanish pilot
guided the English ship to mooring.  The Spanish frigates fairly bristled with cannon.  An
English officer dressed in regimentals marched to the Spanish fort and presented Captain Vancouver's
compliments to Don Quadra.  Spanish cannon thundered a welcome that shook the hills, and English
guns made answer.  A curious fashion, to waste good powder {69} without taking aim at each
other, thought Chief Maquinna.  Don Quadra breakfasted Captain Vancouver.  Captain Vancouver
wined and dined Don Quadra; and Maquinna, lord of the wilds, attended the feast dressed Indian
fashion.  But when the Spanish don and the English officer took breath from flow of compliments
and wine, they did not seem to arrive anywhere in their negotiations.  Vancouver held that
Spain must relinquish the site of Meares's fort and the territory surrounding it and Port Cox.
Don Quadra held that he had been instructed to relinquish only the land on which the fort stood--according
to Vancouver, 'but little more than one hundred yards in extent any way.'  No understanding
could be arrived at, and Quadra at the end of September took his departure for Monterey, leaving
Vancouver to follow a few days later.

Vancouver was anxious to be off on further exploration.  He was eager to verify the existence
of the river which Gray had reported.  He spent most of October exploring this river.  Explorers
in that day, as in this, were not fair judges of each other's feats.  Vancouver took possession
of the Columbia river region for England, setting down in his narrative that {70} 'no other
civilized nation or state had ever entered this river before ... it does not appear that Mr
Gray either saw or was ever within five leagues of the entrance.'

Vancouver then visited the presidio at San Francisco, and thence proceeded to Monterey, where
Quadra awaited him.  His lieutenant, Broughton, who had been in charge of the boats that explored
the Columbia, here left him and accompanied Quadra to San Blas, whence he went overland to
the Atlantic and sailed for England, bearing dispatches to the government.  Vancouver spent
yet another year on the North Pacific, corroborating his first year's charting and proving
that no north-east passage through the continent existed.  Portland Canal, Jervis Inlet, Cook
Inlet, Prince William Sound, Lynn Canal--all were traced to head-waters by Vancouver.

The curtain then drops on the exploration of the North Pacific, with Spain jealously holding
all south of the Columbia, Russia jealously holding all north of Sitka, and England and the
United States advancing counter-claims for all the territory between.

CHAPTER V

'ALEXANDER MACKENZIE, FROM CANADA, BY LAND'

The movement of the fur traders towards the Pacific now became a fevered race for the wealth
of a new El Dorado. "The schizomycetae furnish, without doubt, by far the most numerous group
of infective diseases. We distinguish within this group two widely different series of forms,
which we will speak of as bacilli and cocco-bacteria respectively. The former, which was first
exhaustively described by Ferdinand Cohn, and the pathological importance of which, especially
in relation to the splenic disease of cattle, was first shown by Koch, consist of threads, in
the interior of which permanent or resting-spores are developed. These spores becoming free,
are able, under suitable conditions of life, again to develop into
threads.

The whole development of these organisms, and especially the formation of spores, is completed
on the surface of the fluids, and under the influence of an abundant supply of oxygen.

"The number of affections in which these organisms have been found, and which may be to a certain
extent produced artificially by the introduction of these organisms into healthy animal bodies,
has been largely increased since the discovery of Koch, that the bacteria of splenic fever (anthrax)
belong to this group. Under this head must be placed the bacillus malarise (Klebs and Tommassi-Crudeli),
the bacillus typhi abdominalis (Klebs, Ebert), the bacillus typhi exanthematici (Klebs, observations
not yet published), the bacillus of hog-cholera (Klein), and, finally the bacillus leprosus (Neisser).
It would exceed the time appointed were I to attempt to describe these forms more minutely. This
may, perhaps, be better reserved for discussion and demonstration.

"Alongside of these general infective diseases produced by bacilli, local affections also occur,
which indicate the presence of these organisms at the point where disease begins. As an example
of these processes, which probably occur in various organs, I would mention gastritis bacillaris, of
which I shall show you preparations. In this, we can trace the entrance of the bacilli into
the peptic glands, as well as their further distribution in the walls of the stomach, and in
the vascular system.

"The second group of the pathogenetic schizomycetae I propose to call,
with Billroth, cocco-bacteria, because they consist of collections
of micrococci, which are capable of transforming themselves into short
rods.

The former usually form groups united by zooegloea; by prolongation of the cocci rods are formed,
which sprout out, break up by division into chains, and further lead again to the formation of resting
masses of cocci. I distinguish, further, in this group, two genera--the microsporina and the
monadina; in the former of which the micrococci are collected into spherical lumps, in the
latter into layers. The one class is developed in artificial cultivation fluid, the other on
the surface. The former requires a medium poor in oxygen, the latter a medium rich in oxygen,
for their development.

"Among the affections produced by microsporina, I reckon especially the septic processes, and
also true diphtheria.

On the other hand, to the processes produced by monadina belong especially a large series of diseases,
which according to their clinical and anatomical features, may be characterized as inflammatory processes,
acute exanthemata, and infective tumors, or leucocytoses. Of inflammatory processes, those belong
here which do not generally lead to suppuration, such as rheumatic affections, including the heart,
kidney, and liver affections, which accompany this process, sequelae
which, as is well known, lead more especially to formation of connective
tissue, and not to suppuration.

Here, also, belong croupous pneumonia, the allied disease erysipelas, certain puerperal processes,
and finally, parotitis epidemica, or mumps.

"Among the acute exanthemata, the following may, up to the present time, be placed in this group;
variola-vaccina, scarlatina, and measles.

"The group of infective
tumors is represented by tuberculosis, syphilis, and glanders. Throughout
the whole group of cocco-bacteria the demonstration of organisms in
the diseased parts encounters difficulties which vary considerably
in the different kinds."

The speaker concluded by describing the
methods (now well known) by which the powers of the different organisms
are tested.  In the big brigades the men paddled in relays.  In this canoe
each man was expected to pole and paddle continuously and fiercely against a current that was
like a mill-race.  Mackenzie listened to the grumblers over the night camp-fire, and explained
how much safer it was to ascend an unknown stream with bad rapids than to run down it.  The
danger could always be seen before running into it.  He cheered the drooping spirits of his
band, and inspired them with some of his own indomitable courage.

By May 16 the river had narrowed to a foaming cataract; and the banks were such sheer rock-wall
that it was almost impossible to land.  They had arrived at the Rocky Mountain Portage, as
it was afterwards called. It was clear that the current could not be stemmed by pole or paddle;
the canoe must be towed or carried.  When Mackenzie tried to get foothold or handhold on the
shore, huge boulders and land-slides of loose earth slithered down, threatening to smash canoe
and canoemen. Mackenzie got out a tow-line eighty feet long.  This he tied to the port thwart
of the canoe.  With the tow-line round his shoulders, while the torrent roared {76} past and
filled the canyon with the 'voice of many waters,' Mackenzie leaped to the dangerous slope,
cut foothold and handhold on the face of the cliff with an axe, and scrambled up to a table
of level rock.  Then he shouted and signalled for his men to come up.  If the voyageurs had
not been hemmed in by a boiling maelstrom on both sides, they would have deserted on the spot.
Mackenzie saw them begin to strip as if to swim; then, clothes on back and barefoot, they scrambled
up the treacherous shore.  He reached over, and assisted them to the level ground above.  The
tow-line was drawn taut round trees and the canoe tracked up the raging current.  But the rapids
became wilder. A great wave struck the bow of the canoe and the tow-line snapped in mid-air.
The terrified men looking over the edge of the precipice saw their craft sidle as if to swamp;
but, on the instant, another mighty wave flung her ashore, and they were able to haul her out
of danger.

Mackay went ahead to see how far the rapids extended.  He found that they were at least nine
miles in length.  On his return the men were declaring that they would not ascend such waters
another rod. Mackenzie, to humour them, left them to a regale of rum {77} and pemmican, and
axe in hand went up the precipitous slope, and began to make a rough path through the forest.
Up the rude incline the men hauled the empty canoe, cutting their way as they advanced.  Then
they carried up the provisions in ninety-pound bundles.  By nightfall of the first day they
had advanced but one mile.  Next morning the journey was continued; the progress was exactly
three miles the second day, and the men fell in their tracks with exhaustion, and slept that
night where they lay.  But at length they had passed the rapids; the toilsome portage was over,
and the canoe was again launched on the stream.  The air was icy from the snows of the mountain-peaks,
and in spite of their severe exercise the men had to wear heavy clothing.

On May 31 they arrived at the confluence where the rivers now known as the Finlay and the Parsnip,
flowing together, form the Peace.  The Indians of this region told Mackenzie of a great river
beyond the big mountains, a river that flowed towards the noonday sun; and of 'Carrier Indians'[2]
inland, who acted as {78} middlemen and traders between the coast and the mountain tribes.
They said that the Carriers told legends of 'white men on the coast, who wore armour from head
to heel'--undoubtedly the Spanish dons--and of 'huge canoes with sails like clouds' that plied
up and down 'the stinking waters'--meaning the sea.

Mackenzie was uncertain which of the two confluents to follow--whether to ascend the Finlay,
flowing from the north-west, or the Parsnip, flowing from the south-east.  He consulted his
Indian guides, one of whom advised him to take the southern branch.  This would lead, the guide
said, to a lake from which they could portage to another stream, and so reach the great river
leading to the sea.  Mackenzie decided to follow this advice, and ordered his men to proceed
up the Parsnip. Their hearts sank.  They had toiled up one terrible river; directly before
them was another, equally precipitous and dangerous. Nevertheless, they began the ascent. 
For a week the rush of avalanches from the mountain-peaks could be heard like artillery fire.
Far up above the cloud-line they could see the snow tumbling over an upper precipice in powdery
wind-blown cataracts; a minute later would come the thunderous {79} rumble of the falling masses.
With heroic fortitude the voyageurs held their way against the fierce current, sometimes paddling,
sometimes towing the canoe along the river-bank. Once, however, when Mackenzie and Mackay had
gone ahead on foot to reconnoitre, ordering the canoemen to paddle along behind, the canoe
failed to follow.  Mackay went back and found the voyageurs disputing ashore.  They pretended
that a leak had delayed them.  From Indians met by the way, Mackenzie learned that he was indeed
approaching a portage over the height-of-land to the waters that flowed towards the Pacific.
One of these Indians was induced to go with Mackenzie as guide.  They tramped ahead through
a thicket of brush, and came suddenly out on a blue tarn.  This was the source of the Parsnip,
the southern branch of the Peace.  The whole party arrived on June 12.  A portage of 817 paces
over a rocky ridge brought them to a second mountain lake drained by a river that flowed towards
the west.  Mackenzie had crossed the watershed, the Great Divide, and had reached the waters
which empty into the Pacific.

The river which the explorers now entered was a small tributary of the Fraser.  Some {80} years
later it was named by Simon Fraser the Bad River, and it deserved the name.  Mackenzie launched
his canoe down-stream.  The men's spirits rose.  This was working with the current, not against
it; but the danger of going with an unknown current became at once apparent.  The banks began
to skim past, the waters to rise in oily corrugations; and before the voyageurs realized it,
they were caught by a current they could not stem and were hurried sidling down-stream.  The
men sprang out to swim, but the current prevented them from reaching land, and they clung in
terror to the sides of the canoe till an eddy sent them on a sand-bar in the midst of the rapids.
With great difficulty the craft was rescued and brought ashore.  The stern had been torn out
of the canoe, half the powder and bullets lost, and the entire cargo drenched.

The men were panic-stricken and on the verge of mutiny; but Mackenzie was undaunted and determined
to go forward.  He spread the provisions out to dry and set his crew to work patching up the
stern of the broken canoe with resin and oilcloth and new cedar lining.  That night the mountain
Indian who had acted as guide across the portage gave Mackenzie the slip and escaped in the
{81} woods.  For several days after this most of the party trudged on foot carrying the cargo,
while four of the most experienced canoemen brought the empty canoe down the rapids.  But on
June 17 they found further progress by water impossible owing to masses of driftwood in the
stream.  They were now, however, less than a mile from the south fork of the Fraser; the men
carried the canoe on their shoulders across the intervening neck of swamp, and at last the
explorers 'enjoyed the inexpressible satisfaction' of finding themselves on the banks of a
broad, navigable river, on the west side of the Great Divide.

The point where they embarked, on the morning of June 18, was about thirty-five miles above
the Nechaco, or north fork of the Fraser, just at the upper end of the great bend where the
south fork, flowing to the north-west, sweeps round in a semicircle, joins its confluent, and
pours southward to the sea.  This trend of the river to the south was not what Mackenzie expected.
He wanted to follow a stream leading west.  Without noticing it, he had passed the north fork,
the Nechaco, and was sweeping down the main stream of the Fraser, where towering mountains
cut off the view ahead, and the powerful {82} rush of the waters foreboded hard going, if not
more rapids and cataracts. Mackenzie must have a new guide.  The Carrier Indians dwelt along
this river, but they appeared to be truculently hostile.  On June 21 a party of these Indians
stood on one of the banks and shot arrows at the explorers and rolled stones from the precipices.
Mackenzie landed on the opposite bank, after sending a hunter by a wide detour through the
woods behind the Indians on the other shore, with orders to shoot instantly if the savages
threatened either the canoe or himself.  In full sight of the Indians Mackenzie threw trinkets
in profusion on the ground, laid down his musket and pistol, and held up his arms in token
of friendship.  The savages understood the meaning of his actions.  Two of them jumped into
a dug-out and came poling across to him. Suspiciously and very timidly they landed.  Mackenzie
threw himself on the ground, and on the sands traced his path through the 'shining mountains.'
By Indian sign-language he told them he wanted to go to the sea; and, disarmed of all suspicion,
the Indians were presently on the ground beside him, drawing the trail to the sea.  Terrible
rapids (they imitated the noise of the cataracts) barred his way by this river.  {83} He must
turn back to where another river (the Blackwater) came in on the west, and ascend that stream
to a portage which would lead over to the sea.

The post of Alexandria on the Cariboo Road marks Mackenzie's farthest south on the Fraser.
At this point, after learning all he could of the route from the Indians, he turned the prow
of his canoe up the river. The Carrier Indians provided him with a guide.  On July 4, nearly
two months from the time of leaving the fort on the Peace river, the portage on the Blackwater
was reached; the canoe was abandoned, some provisions were cached, and each man set off afoot
with a ninety-pound pack on his back.  Heavy mist lay on the thick forest.  The Indian trail
was but a dimly defined track over forest mould.  The dripping underbrush that skirted the
path soaked the men to the skin.  The guide had shown an inclination to desert, and Mackenzie
slept beside him, ready to seize and hold him on the slightest movement.  Totem cedar-poles
in front of the Indian villages told the explorers that they were approaching the home of the
coastal tribes.  The men's clothing was by this time torn to shreds.  They were barefooted,
bareheaded, {84} almost naked.  For nearly two weeks they journeyed on foot; then, having forded
the Dean river, they embarked for the sea on the Bella Coola in cedar dug-outs which they procured
from Indians of one of the coastal tribes.  Daily now Mackenzie saw signs of white traders.
The Indians possessed beads and trinkets.  One Indian had a Spanish or Russian lance.  Fishing
weirs were passed.  There was a whiff of salt water in the air; then far out between the hills
lay a gap of illimitable blue.  At eight o'clock in the morning of Saturday, July 20, 1793,
Mackenzie reached the mouth of the river and found himself on the sea.  The next day he went
down North Bentinck Arm, and, passing the entrance to the south arm, landed at the cape on
the opposite shore.  He then proceeded down Burke Channel. Lat. 52° 20' 48" N.'

Barely two months previously Vancouver had explored and named these very waters and headlands.
A hostile old Indian explained bellicosely that the white sailors had fired {85} upon him.
For this outrage he demanded satisfaction in gifts from Mackenzie.  Few gifts had Mackenzie
for the aggressive old chief.  There were exactly twenty pounds of pemmican--two pounds a man
for a three months' trip back.  There remained also fifteen pounds of rice--the mainstay of
the voyageurs--and six pounds of mouldy flour.  The Indians proved so vociferously hostile
that two voyageurs had to stand guard while the others slept on the bare rocks.  On one occasion
savages in dug-outs began hurling spears.  But no harm resulted from these unfriendly demonstrations,
and the party of explorers presently set out on their homeward journey.

Mackenzie had accomplished his object.  In the race to the Pacific overland he was the first
of the explorers of North America to cross the continent and reach the ocean.  Late in August
the voyageurs were back at the little fort on the Peace river.  Mackenzie shortly afterwards
quitted the fur country and retired to Scotland, where he wrote the story of his explorations.
His book appeared in 1801, and in the following year he was knighted by the king for his great
achievements.

CHAPTER VI

THE DESCENT OF THE FRASER RIVER

American traders were not slow to follow up the discovery of Robert Gray on the Pacific.  Spain,
the pioneer pathfinder, had ceded Louisiana to France; and France, by way of checkmating British
advance in North America, had sold Louisiana to the United States for fifteen million dollars.
What did Louisiana include?  Certainly, from New Orleans to the Missouri.  Did it also include
from the Missouri to Gray's river, the Columbia?  The United States had sent Meriwether Lewis
and William Clark overland from the Missouri to the Columbia, ostensibly on a scientific expedition,
but in reality to lay claim to the new territory for the United States.  This brings the exploration
of the Pacific down to 1806.

Take a look at the map!  Mackenzie had crossed overland from the Peace river to Bella Coola.
Who was to own the great belt of {87} empire--a third larger than Germany--between Mackenzie's
trail westward and Lewis and Clark's trail to the mouth of the Columbia?  In 1805 Simon Fraser,
who as a child had come from the United States to Canada with his widowed mother in the Loyalist
migration, and now in his thirtieth year was a partner in the North-West Company of Montreal,
had crossed the Rockies by way of the Peace river.  He had followed Mackenzie's trail over
the terrible nine-mile carrying-place and had built there a fur-post--Rocky Mountain Portage.
He had ascended that same Parsnip river, which Mackenzie had found so appalling, to a little
emerald lake set like a jewel in the mountains.  There he had built another fur-trading post,
and named it after his friend, Archibald Norman M'Leod.  This was the first fur-post known
to have been erected in the interior of New Caledonia, now British Columbia.  The new fort
had been left in charge of James M'Dougall; and during the winter of 1806 M'Dougall had crossed
the heavily drifted carrying-place and descended the Bad River as far as the south fork of
the Fraser, which all traders at that time mistook for the upper reaches of Gray's Columbia.
Instead of going down the main stream of the {88} Fraser, M'Dougall ascended both the Nechaco
and the Stuart; and if he did not actually behold the beautiful alpine tarns since known as
Fraser Lake and Stuart Lake, he was at least the first white man to hear of them.

In May of 1806, after sending the year's furs from Rocky Mountain Portage east to Fort Chipewyan,
Simon Fraser set out to explore this inland empire concerning which M'Dougall had reported.
John Stuart accompanied Fraser as lieutenant.  They crossed from the head-waters of the Parsnip
to the south fork of the Fraser, and on June 10 camped at the mouth of the Nechaco.  Towards
the end of July the Carriers camped on Stuart Lake were amazed to see advancing across the
waters, with rhythmic gallop of paddles, two enormous birch canoes.  When the canoes reached
the land Fraser and Stuart stepped ashore, and a volley was fired to celebrate the formal taking
possession of a new inland empire. What to do with the white men's offerings of tobacco the
Carriers did not know.  They thought the white men in smoking were emitting spirits with each
breath.  When the traders offered soap to the squaws, the women at once began to devour it.
The result was a frothing at the {89} mouth as amazing to them as the smoke from the men. 
History does not record whether the women became as addicted to soap as the men to the fragrant
weed.

Active trading with the Indians began at once.  The lake was named Stuart in honour of Fraser's
companion, and the ground was cleared for a palisaded fort, which, when erected, they named
Fort St James.  The scene was enchanting.  The lake wound for a distance of fifty miles amid
the foot-hills of the mighty forested mountains.  It was four or five miles wide, and was gemmed
with green islets; and all round, appearing through the clouds in jagged outline, were the
opal summits of the snowy peaks.  No wonder the two Scotsmen named the new inland empire New
Caledonia--after their native land.

It will be remembered that M'Dougall had heard of another mountain tarn.  This was forty miles
south of Stuart Lake, at the headwaters of the Nechaco, the north fork of the Fraser.  Stuart
went overland south to spy out the southern lake; and his report was of such an entrancing
region--heavily forested, with an abundance of game and fish--that Fraser glided down the Stuart
river and poled up the Nechaco to the lake which Stuart had {90} already named after his chief.
Again a fort was erected and named Fort Fraser, making three forts in the interior of New Caledonia.

Fraser had sent a request to the directors of the North-West Company to be permitted to fit
out an expedition down the great river, which he thought was the Columbia; and in the spring
of 1807 two canoes under Jules Quesnel were sent out with goods.  Quesnel arrived at Fort St
James in the autumn, bringing from the east the alarming word that Lewis and Clark had gone
overland and taken possession of all the territory between the Missouri and the mouth of the
Columbia.  No time was to be lost by Fraser in establishing a claim to the region to the west
of the Rockies between the Peace and the Columbia.  Fraser went down the river and strengthened
British possession by building a fourth fort--Fort George at the mouth of the Nechaco.  This
was to be the starting-point of the expedition to the Pacific.  Then, towards the end of May
1808, he set out down the great river with four canoes, nineteen voyageurs, and Stuart and
Quesnel as first assistants.

Fifteen miles below the fort the river walls narrowed and the canoes swept into the roaring
cataract of Fort George canyon.  {91} The next day they shot through the Cottonwood canyon,
and paused at the point thenceforth to be known as Quesnel.  On the third day they passed Mackenzie's
farthest south--the site of the present Alexandria.  Below this the river was unexplored and
unknown.  Suddenly the enormous flood-waters swollen by melting mountain snows contracted to
a width of only forty yards, and with a fearful roar swept into a rock-walled gorge.  In sublime
unconsciousness of heroism Fraser records:

As it was impossible to carry the canoes across the land owing to the height of the steep hills,
we resolved to venture down.  I ordered the five best men of the crews into a canoe lightly
loaded; and in a moment it was under way.  After passing the first cascade she lost her head
and was drawn into an eddy, where she was whirled about, in suspense whether to sink or swim.
However, she took a turn from this vortex, flying from one danger to another; but, in spite
of every effort, the whirlpool forced her against a low rock.  Upon this the men scrambled
out, saving their lives; but the greatest difficulty was {92} still ahead.  To continue by
water would be certain destruction.  During this distressing scene we were on shore looking
on; but the situation rendered our approach perilous.  The bank was high and steep.  We had
to plunge our daggers into the ground to avoid sliding into the river. We cut steps, fastened
a line to the front of the canoe, and hauled it up.  Our lives hung upon a thread, as one false
step might have hurled us into eternity.  However, we cleared the bank before dark.  The men
had to ascend the immense hills with heavy loads on their backs.

Indians warned the white men to desist from their undertaking.  Better, they advised, go overland
eastward to a great peaceful river and descend that to the sea.  Fraser, of course, did not
know that the peaceful river they spoke of was really the Columbia.  He thought the river he
was following was the Columbia.  With the help of Indians the canoes were pulled up-hill, and
horses were hired from them to carry the provisions overland.  Below this portage, as they
continued the descent, an enormous crag spread {93} across the river, appearing at first to
bar the passage ahead.  This was Bar Rock.  Beyond it several minor rapids were passed without
difficulty; and then they came upon a series of great whirlpools which seemed impassable. 
But the men unloaded the canoes and--'a desperate undertaking'--ran them down the rapids with
light ballast.  They then came back overland for the packs.

This task [says Fraser] was as dangerous as going by water.  The men passed and repassed a
declivity, on loose stones and gravel, which constantly gave way under foot.  One man, who
lost the path, got in a most intricate and perilous position.  With a large package on his
back, he got so wedged amid the rocks that he could move neither forward nor backward, nor
yet unload himself.  I crawled, not without great risk, to his assistance, and saved his life
by cutting his pack so [that] it dropped back in the river.  On this carrying-place, which
was two miles long, our shoes became shattered.

For several days after this the advance was by a succession of rapids and portages.  On June
9 the stream again narrowed to forty {94} yards and swept violently between two overhanging
precipices.

The water, which rolls down this passage in tumultuous waves and with great velocity, had a
frightful appearance.  However, it being absolutely impossible to carry canoes by land, all
hands without hesitation embarked on the mercy of the awful tide.  After breathing a little,
we continued our course to the point where the Indians camped.

The natives here warned Fraser that it would be madness to go forward. At the same time they
furnished him with a guide.  The same evening the party reached the place described by Fraser
as 'a continual series of cascades cut by rocks and bounded by precipices that {95} seemed
to have no end.'  Never had he seen 'anything so dreary and dangerous.' Towering above were
'mountains upon mountains whose summits are covered with eternal snow.'  An examination of
the river for some distance below convinced Fraser that it was impossible of navigation, and
he decided to make the remainder of the journey on foot.  After building a scaffold, on which
the canoes and some provisions were placed and covered with underbrush and moss, the party,
on June 11, began their tramp down the river-bank.  Each man carried on his back a ninety-pound
pack, supported by a strap across the forehead.  Again and again on the journey Indians confronted
Fraser with hostile show of weapons, but the intrepid trader disarmed hostility by gifts. 
The Indians declared that the sea lay only ten 'sleeps' distant.  One of the chiefs said that
he had himself seen white men, who were great 'tyees,' because 'they were well dressed and
very proud and went about this way'--clapping his hands to his hips and strutting about with
an air of vast importance. The Indians told Fraser of another great river that came in from
the east and joined this one some distance below.  He had passed the site of the present Lillooet
and was {96} approaching the confluence of the Thompson with the Fraser.  Farther down European
articles were seen among the Indians.  It was the fishing season, and the tribes had assembled
in great hordes.  Here the river was navigable, and three wooden dug-outs were obtained from
the natives for the descent to the sea.  The voyageurs again embarked, and swept down the narrow
bends of the turbulent floods at what are now Lytton, Yale, and Hope.  There were passes where
the river was such a raging torrent that the dug-outs had to be carried overland.  There were
places where Fraser's voyageurs had to climb precipices by means of frail ladders, made of
poles and withes, that swayed to their tread and threatened to precipitate them into the torrent
beneath.

When the river turned sharply west, Fraser could not help noticing that the Indians became
more violently hostile.  Far south could be seen the opal dome of Mount Baker, named by Vancouver
after one of his lieutenants.  As they advanced, the banks lowered to reedy swamps and mosquitoes
appeared in clouds.  What troubled Fraser most was the fact that the river lay many miles north
of the known latitude of the Columbia.  It daily grew on {97} him that this could not possibly
be the Columbia.  The tide rose and fell in the river.  The Indian guide begged the white men
not to go on; he was afraid, he said, of the Indians of the sea-coast.  The river channel divided.
Natives along the shore began singing war-songs and beating the war-drum; then they circled
out threateningly round the white men's boats.  Signs were seen of the sea ahead; but the Indians
were 'howling like wolves and brandishing war-clubs,' and Fraser concluded that it would be
unwise to delay longer amid such dangers.  To his intense disappointment he had established
the latitude as 49°, whereas the Columbia was in latitude 46° 20'.  'This river is therefore
not the Columbia,' he declared. 'If I had been convinced of this when I left my canoes, I would
certainly have returned.'

The return journey was fraught with danger.  Always one man stood guard while the others slept;
and again and again the little party was surrounded by ferociously hostile bands.  Between
apprehension of the dangers of the wild trail of the Fraser canyons and fear of hostile natives,
the men became so panic-stricken that they threw down their paddles and declared their intention
of trying to escape {98} overland through the mountains.   Fraser reasoned and remonstrated,
and finally threatened.  After so much heroism he would not permit cowardly desertion.  Then
he forced each voyageur to swear on the Cross: 'I do solemnly swear that I will sooner perish
than forsake in distress any of our crew during the present voyage.'  With renewed self-respect
they then paddled off, singing voyageurs' songs to keep up their courage. Imagine, for a moment,
the scene!  The turbid, mad waters of the Fraser hemmed in between rock walls, carving a living
way through the adamant; banks from which red savages threw down rocks wherever the wild current
drove the dug-out inshore; and, tossed by the waves--a chip-like craft containing nineteen
ragged men singing like schoolboys!  Once away from the coastal tribes, however, the white
men were aided by the inland Carriers.  They found the canoes and supplies in perfect condition
and unmolested, though hundreds of Carrier Indians must have passed where lay the belongings
of the white strangers.  On August 5, to the inexpressible relief of Fort George, the little
band once more were at their headquarters in New Caledonia.

{99}

CHAPTER VII

THOMPSON AND THE ASTORIANS

While Fraser was working down the wild canyons of the great river which now bears his name,
other fur traders were looking towards the Pacific ocean.  In 1810 John Jacob Astor, a New
York merchant, who bought furs from the Nor'westers in Montreal for shipment to Germany, formed
the Pacific Fur Company, and took into its service a number of the partners and servants of
the North-West Company.  Some of these men were dispatched round the Horn in the Tonquin to
the mouth of the Columbia; while another party went overland from Mackinaw and St Louis, following
the trail of Lewis and Clark.  One of the Nor'westers who entered Astor's service was Alexander
Mackay, Mackenzie's companion on the journey to the coast; another was a brother of the Stuart
who had accompanied Fraser through New Caledonia; and a third was a {100} brother of the M'Dougall
who commanded Fort M'Leod, the first fort built by the Nor'westers in New Caledonia.

In the light of subsequent developments, it is a matter for speculation whether these Nor'westers
joined Astor purposely to overthrow his scheme in the interests of their old company; or were
later bribed to desert him; or, as is most likely, simply grew dissatisfied with the inexperienced,
blundering mismanagement of Astor's company, and reverted gladly to their old service.  However
that may have been, it is certain that the North-West Company did not fail to take notice of
the plans that Astor had set afoot for the Pacific fur trade; for in a secret session of the
partners, at Fort William on Lake Superior, 'it was decided in council that the Company should
send to Columbia River, where the Americans had established Astoria, and that a party should
proceed overland to the coast.'

It puzzled the Nor'westers to learn that the river Fraser had explored in 1808 was not the
Columbia.  Where, then, were the upper reaches of the great River of the West which Gray and
Vancouver had reported?  The company issued urgent instructions to its traders in the Far West
to keep pushing up {101} the North and South Saskatchewan, up the Red Deer, up the Bow, up
the Athabaska, up the Smoky, up the Pembina, and to press over the mountains wherever any river
led oceanwards through the passes.  This duty of finding new passable ways to the sea was especially
incumbent on the company's surveyor and astronomer, David Thompson.  He was formerly of the
Hudson's Bay Company, but had come over to the Nor'westers, and in their service had surveyed
from the Assiniboine to the Missouri and from Lake Superior to the Saskatchewan.

Towards the spring of 1799 Thompson had been on the North Saskatchewan and had moved round
the region of Lesser Slave Lake.  That year, at Grand Portage, at the annual meeting of the
traders of the North-West Company, he was ordered to begin a thorough exploration of the mountains;
and the spring of 1800 saw him at Rocky Mountain House[1] on the upper reaches of the North
Saskatchewan above the junction of the Clearwater.  Hitherto the Nor'westers had crossed the
{102} mountains by way of the Peace river.  But Thompson was to explore a dozen new trails
across the Great Divide.  While four of his men crossed over to the Red Deer river and rafted
or canoed down the South Saskatchewan, Thompson himself, with five French Canadians and two
Indian guides, crossed the mountains to the Kootenay country.  The Kootenay Indians were encamped
on the Kootenay plains preparatory to their winter's hunt, and Thompson persuaded some of them
to accompany him back over the mountains to Rocky Mountain House on the North Saskatchewan.
This was the beginning of the trade between the Kootenays and white men. Probably from these
Indians Thompson learned of the entrance to the Rockies by the beautiful clear mountain-stream
now named the Bow; and Duncan M'Gillivray, a leading partner, accompanied him south from Rocky
Mountain House to the spot on the Bow where to-day the city of Calgary stands.  It was on this
trip that Nor'westers first met the Piegan Indians.  From these horsemen of the plains the
explorers learned that it was only a ten-day journey overland to the Missouri.  Snow was falling
when the traders entered the Rockies at what is now the Gap, on the {103} Canadian Pacific
Railway.  Inside the gateway to the rugged defile of forest and mountain the traders revelled
in the sublime scenery of the Banff valley.  At Banff, eastward of Cascade mountain, on the
sheltered plain where Kootenays and Stonies used to camp, one can still find the circular mounds
that mark a trading-station of this era.  Whether the white men discovered the beautiful blue
tarn now known as Devil's Lake, or saw the Bow river falls, where tourists to-day fish away
long summer afternoons, or dipped in the famous hot springs on the slope of Sulphur mountain,
we do not know.  They could hardly have met and conversed with the Kootenays and Stonies without
hearing about these attractions, which yearly drew Indian families to camp in the encircling
mountains, while the men ranged afield to hunt.

Thompson and M'Gillivray were back at Rocky Mountain House on the Saskatchewan for Christmas.
Some time during 1800 their French-Canadian voyageurs are known to have crossed Howse Pass,
the source of the North Saskatchewan, which was discovered by Duncan M'Gillivray and named
after Joseph Howse of the North-West Company.

For several years after this Thompson was {104} engaged in making surveys for the North-West
Company in the valley of the Peace river and between the Saskatchewan and the Churchill.  In
1806 we find him in the country south of the Peace, which was then in charge of that Jules
Quesnel who was to accompany Fraser in 1808.  Fraser, as we have seen, was already busy exploring
the region between M'Leod Lake and Stuart Lake, and had laid his plans to descend the great
river which he thought was Gray's Columbia.  Now, while Thompson spent the winter of 1806-7
between the Peace and the North Saskatchewan, trading and exploring, he doubtless learned of
Fraser's explorations west of the Rockies and of the vast extent of New Caledonia; and June
1807 saw him over the mountains on the Kootenay plains, where to his infinite delight he came
upon a turbulent river, whose swollen current flowed towards the Pacific.  'May God give me
to see where its waters flow into the ocean,' he ejaculated.  This was, however, but a tributary
of the long-sought Columbia.  It was the river now called the Blaeberry. Thompson followed
down the banks of this stream by a well-known Indian trail, and on June 30 he came to the Columbia
itself.  Although the river here flowed to the north, {105} he must have known, from the deposits
of blue silt and the turgidity of the current, that he had found at least an upper reach of
the River of the West; but he could hardly guess that its winding course would lead him a dance
of eleven hundred miles before he should reach the sea.

The party camped and built the boats they needed, and a fortnight later they were poling up-stream
to the lake we to-day know as Windermere, where Thompson built a fort which he called 'Kootenai.'
Here he spent the winter trading, and when the warm Chinook winds cleared away the snows, in
April 1808, about the time Fraser was preparing to descend the Fraser river, he paddled up-stream
to where the Columbia river has its source in Upper Columbia Lake.  A portage of about a mile
and a half brought him to another large river, which flowed southward.  This stream--the Kootenay--led
him south into the country of the Flatheads, then made a great bend and swept to the north.
This was disappointing. Thompson returned to his fort on Windermere Lake, packed the furs his
men had gathered, and retraced his trail of the previous year to Rocky Mountain House.  He
had undoubtedly found the River {106} of the West, but he had learned nothing of its course
to the sea.

During nearly all of 1809 Thompson was exploring the Kootenay river and its branches through
Idaho and Montana.  Still no path had he found to the sea.  In 1810 he seems to have gone east
for instructions from his company.  What the instructions were we may conjecture from subsequent
developments.  Astor of New York, as we have seen, was busy launching his fur traders for operations
on the Pacific.  Piegan warriors blocked the passage into the Rockies by the North Saskatchewan;
so Thompson in the autumn of this year ascended the Athabaska.  Winter came early. The passes
were filled with snow and beset by warriors.  He failed to get provisions down from Rocky Mountain
House; and his men, cut off by hostile savages from all help from outside posts, had literally
to cut and shovel their way through Athabaska Pass while subsisting on short rations.  The
men built huts in the pass; some hunted, while others made snow-shoes and sleighs.  They were
down to rations of dog-meat and moccasins, and hardly knew whether to expect death at the hands
of raiding Piegans or from starvation.  On New Year's Day of 1811, {107} when the thermometer
dropped to 24° below zero, with a biting wind, Thompson was packing four broken-down horses
and two dogs over the pass to the west side of the Great Divide.  The mountains rose precipitously
on each side; but when the trail began dropping down westward, the weather moderated, though
the snow grew deeper; and in the third week of January Thompson came on the baffling current
of the Columbia.  He camped there for the remainder of the winter, near the entrance of the
Canoe River.  Why he went up the Columbia in the spring, tracing it back to its source, and
thence south again into Idaho, instead of rounding the bend and going down the river, we do
not know.  He was evidently puzzled by the contrary directions in which the great river seemed
to flow.  At all events, by a route which is not clearly known, Thompson struck the Spokane
river in June 1811, near the site of the present city of Spokane; and following down the Spokane,
he again found the elusive Columbia and embarked on its waters.  At the mouth of the Snake
River, on July 9, he erected a pole, on which he hoisted a flag and attached a sheet of paper
claiming possession of the country for Great Britain and the North-West {108} Company.  A month
later, when Astor's traders came up-stream from the mouth of the Columbia, they were amazed
to find a British flag 'waving triumphantly' at this spot. Unfortunately, Thompson's claim
ignored the fact that both Lewis and Clark and the Astorians had already passed this way on
their overland route to the Pacific.

From this point Thompson evidently raced for the Pacific.  Within a week he had passed the
Dalles, passed the mouth of the Willamette, passed what was to become the site of the Hudson's
Bay Company's post of Fort Vancouver; and at midday of Monday, July 15, he swept round a bend
of the mighty stream and came within sight of the sea.  Crouched between the dank, heavy forests
and the heaving river floods, stood a little palisaded and fresh-hewn log fur-post--Astoria.
Thompson was two months too late to claim the region of the lower Columbia for the Nor'westers.
One can imagine the wild halloo with which the tired voyageurs greeted Astoria when their comrades
of old from Athabaska came tumbling hilariously from the fort gates--M'Dougall of Rocky Mountain
House, Stuart of Chipewyan, and John Clarke, whom Thompson had known at Isle à la {109} Crosse.
But where was Alexander Mackay, who had gone overland with Mackenzie in 1793?  The men fell
into one another's arms with gruff, profane embraces.  Thompson was haled in to a sumptuous
midday dinner of river salmon, duck and partridge, and wines brought round the world.  The
absence of Mackay was the only thing that took from the pleasure of the occasion.

A party of the Astorians, as we have seen, had sailed round the Horn on the Tonquin; another
party had gone overland from Mackinaw and St Louis.  On the Tonquin were twenty sailors, four
partners, twelve clerks, and thirteen voyageurs.  She sailed from New York in September 1810.
Jonathan Thorn, the captain, was a retired naval officer, who resented the easy familiarity
of the fur traders with their servants, and ridiculed the seasickness of the fresh-water voyageurs.
The Tonquin had barely rounded the Horn before the partners and the commander were at sixes
and sevens.  A landing was made at the mouth of the Columbia in March 1811, and eight lives
were lost in an attempt to head small boats up against the tide-rip of river and sea.  After
endless jangling about where to {110} land, where to build, how to build, the rude fort which
Thompson saw had been knocked together.  The Tonquin sailed up the coast of Vancouver Island
to trade.  On the vessel went Alexander Mackay to help in the trade with the coastal Indians,
whom he was supposed to know.  In spite of Mackay's warning that the Nootka tribes were notoriously
treacherous and resentful towards white traders, Captain Thorn with lordly indifference permitted
them to swarm aboard his vessel.  Once when Mackay had gone ashore at Clayoquot, where Gray
had wintered twenty years before, Thorn, forgetting that his ship was not a training-school,
struck an old chief across the face and threw him over the rail.  When Mackay heard what had
happened, instead of applauding the captain's valour, he showed the utmost alarm, and begged
Thorn to put out for the open sea.  The captain smiled in scorn.  Twenty Indians were welcomed
on the deck the very next day.  More came.  At the same time the vessel was completely surrounded
by a fleet of canoes.  As if to throw the white men off all suspicion, the squaws came paddling
out, laughing and chatting.  Mackay in horror noticed that in the barter all the Indians were
taking knives {111} for their furs, and that groups were casually stationing themselves at
points of vantage on the deck--at the hatches, at the cabin door, along the taffrail.  Mackay
hurried to the captain.  Thorn affected to ignore any danger, but he nevertheless ordered the
anchors up.  Seeing so many Indians still on board, the sailors hesitated. Thorn lost his head
and uttered a shout.  This served as a signal for the savages, who shrieked with derisive glee
and fell upon the crew with knives, hatchets, and clubs.  Down the companionway tumbled the
ship's clerk, Lewis, stabbed in the back.  Over the taffrail headlong fell Mackay, clubbed
by the Indians aboard, caught on the knives of the squaws below.  The captain was so unprepared
for the attack that he had no weapon but his pocket-knife.  He was stunned by a club, pitched
overboard, and literally cut to pieces by the squaws.  In a moment the Tonquin was a shambles.
All on deck were slaughtered but four, who gained the main cabin, and with muskets aimed through
windows scattered the yelling horde.  The Indians sprang from the ship and drew off, while
the four white survivors escaped in a boat, and the Tonquin's sails flapped idly in the wind.
Next morning the Indians paddled {112} out to plunder what seemed to be a deserted ship.  A
wounded white man appeared above the hatches and waved them to come on board and trade. They
came in hosts, in hordes, in flocks, like carrion-birds or ants overrunning a half-dead thing.
Suddenly earth and air at Clayoquot harbour were rent with a terrific explosion, and the sea
was drenched with the blood of the slaughtered savages.  The only remaining white man, the
wounded Lewis, had blown up the powder magazine.  He perished himself in order to punish the
marauders.

Had this story been known at Astoria when Thompson arrived, he would have found the Astorians
in a thoroughly dejected condition.  As it was, murmurs of discontent were heard.  Here they
had been marooned on the Columbia for three months without a ship, waiting for the contingent
of the Astorians who were toiling across the continent.[2] Not thus did Nor'westers conduct
expeditions.  What Thompson thought of the situation we do not know.  All we do know is that
he remained only a week.  On July 22, fully provisioned by M'Dougall, he went back up the Columbia
post-haste.

{113}

One year later we find Thompson at Fort William reporting the results of his expedition to
the assembled directors of the North-West Company. He had surveyed every part of the Columbia
from its source to its mouth.  And he was the first white man on its upper waters.

The War of 1812 had begun, and a British warship was on its way to capture Astoria.  At the
same time the Nor'westers dispatched an overland expedition to the Columbia.  Among their emissaries
went the men of New Caledonia, Alexander Henry (the younger) of Rocky Mountain House, Donald
M'Tavish, and a dozen others who were former comrades of the leading Astorians.  They succeeded
in their mission, and in the month of October 1813 Astor's fort was sold to the North-West
Company and renamed Fort George.

The methods of fur traders have been the same the world over: to frighten a rival off the ground
if possible; if not, then to buy him off.  It is not all surmise to suppose that when Thompson
was sent to the Pacific there was in view some other purpose than merely to survey an unknown
river.  But exploration and the fur trade went hand in hand; and whatever the motives may have
been, the {114} result was that, after more than four years of arduous toil, Thompson had given
to commerce a great waterway.  His exploration of the Columbia closes the period of discovery
on the Pacific coast.

[1] To explain what may appear like a confusion of names, it may be stated that in the history
of the fur trade from 1800 to 1850 there were at various stages as many as sixteen differently
situated fur-posts under the name of Rocky Mountain House.

[2] The overland party suffered the greatest hardship and some loss of life, and did not arrive
at Astoria till January 1812.

CHAPTER VIII

THE PASSING OF THE FUR LORDS

When Astoria passed to the Nor'westers, with it came, as we shall see, an opportunity of acquiring
for Great Britain the whole of the vast region west of the Rockies, including California and
Alaska.  Gray's feat in finding the mouth of the Columbia, and the explorations of Lewis and
Clark overland to the same river, gave the United States possession of a part of this territory
by right of discovery; but this possession was practically superseded by the transfer of Astor's
fort to the British-Canadian Company.  Yet, to-day, we find Britain not in possession of California,
not in possession of the region round the mouth of the Columbia, not in possession of Alaska.
The reason for this will appear presently.

The Treaty of Ghent which closed the War of 1812 made no mention of the boundaries of Oregon,
but it provided that any territory captured by either nation in the course of the {116} war
should be restored to the original owner.  The question then arose: did this clause in the
treaty apply to Astoria?  Was the taking over of the fur-post by the British company in reality
an act of war?  The United States said Yes; Great Britain said No; and both nations claimed
sovereignty over Oregon.  In 1818 a provisional agreement was reached, under which either nation
might trade and establish settlements in the disputed territory.  But it was now utterly impossible
for Astor to prosecute the fur trade on the Pacific.  The 'Bostonnais' had lost prestige with
the Indians when the Tonquin sank off Clayoquot, and the more experienced British and Canadian
traders were in control of the field.  At this time the Hudson's Bay Company and the Nor'westers
were waging the trade war that terminated in their union in 1820-1821; and when the united
companies came to assign officers to the different districts, John M'Loughlin, who had been
a partner in the North-West Company, was sent overland to rule Oregon.

What did Oregon comprise?   At that time no man knew; but within ten years after his arrival
in 1824 M'Loughlin had sent out hunting brigades, consisting of two or {117} three hundred
horsemen, in all directions: east, under Alexander Ross, as far as Montana and Idaho; south,
under Peter Skene Ogden, as far as Utah and Nevada and California; along the coast south as
far as Monterey, under Tom Mackay, whose father had been murdered on the Tonquin and whose
widowed mother had married M'Loughlin; north, through New Caledonia, under James Douglas--'Black
Douglas' they called the dignified, swarthy young Scotsman who later held supreme rule on the
North Pacific as Sir James Douglas, the first governor of British Columbia.  If one were to
take a map of M'Loughlin's transmontane empire and lay it across the face of a map of Europe,
it would cover the continent from St Petersburg to Madrid.

The ruler of this vast domain was one of the noblest men in the annals of the fur trade.  John
M'Loughlin was a Canadian, born at Rivière du Loup, and he had studied medicine in Edinburgh.
The Indians called him 'White Eagle,' from his long, snow-white hair and aquiline features.
When M'Loughlin reached Oregon--by canoe two thousand miles to the Rockies, by pack-horse and
canoe another seven hundred miles {118} south to the Columbia--two of the first things he saw
were that Astoria, or Fort George, was too near the rum of trading schooners for the well-being
of the Indians, and that it would be quite possible to raise food for his men on the spot,
instead of transporting it over two watersheds and across the width of a continent.  He at
once moved the headquarters of the company from Astoria to a point on the north bank of the
Columbia near the Willamette, where he erected Fort Vancouver. Then he sent his men overland
to the Spaniards of Lower California to purchase seed-wheat and stock to begin farming in Oregon
in order to provision the company's posts and brigades.  It was about the time that his wheat-fields
and orchards began to yield that some passing ocean traveller asked him: 'Do you think this
country will ever be settled?' 'Sir,' answered M'Loughlin, emphasizing his words by thumping
his gold-headed cane on the floor, 'wherever wheat grows, men will go, and colonies will grow.'
Afterwards, when he had to choose between loyalty to his company and saving the lives of thousands
of American settlers who had come over the mountains destitute, these words of his were quoted
against him.  He {119} had, according to the directors of the company, favoured settlement
rather than the fur trade.

Meanwhile, M'Loughlin ruled in a sort of rude baronial splendour on the banks of the Columbia.
The 'Big House,' as the Indians always called the governor's mansion, stood in the centre of
a spacious courtyard surrounded by palisades twenty feet high, with huge brass padlocks on
the entrance-gates.  Directly in front of the house two cannon were stationed, and piled up
behind them ready for instant use were two pyramids of balls.  Only officers of some rank dined
in the Hall; and if visitors were present from coastal ships that ascended the river, Highland
kilties stood behind the governor's chair playing the bagpipes.  Towards autumn the southern
and eastern brigades set out on their annual hunt in California, Nevada, Montana, and Idaho.
Towards spring, when the upper rivers had cleared of ice, the northern brigades set out for
the interior of New Caledonia.  Nothing more picturesque was ever seen in the fur trade than
these Oregon brigades. French-Canadian hunters with their Indian wives would be gathered to
the number of two hundred.  Indian ponies fattened during the {120} summer on the deep pasturage
of the Willamette or the plains of Walla Walla would be brought in to the fort and furbished
forth in gayest of trappings.  Provisions would then be packed on their backs.  An eager crowd
of wives and sweethearts and children would dash out for a last good-bye.  The governor would
personally shake hands with every departing hunter.  Then to bugle-call the riders mounted
their restive ponies, and the captain--Tom Mackay or Ogden or Ross--would lead the winding
cavalcade into the defiles of mountain and forest, whence perhaps they would not emerge for
a year and a half.  Though the brigades numbered as many as two hundred men, they had to depend
for food on the rifles of the hunters, except for flour and tobacco and bacon supplied at the
fort.  Once the brigade passed out of sight of the fort, the hunters usually dashed ahead to
anticipate the stampeding of game by the long, noisy, slow-moving line.  Next to the hunters
would come the old bell-mare, her bell tinkling through the lonely silences.  Far in the rear
came the squaws and trappers.  Going south, the aim was to reach the traverse of the deserts
during winter, so that snow would be available for water.  Going east, the {121} aim was to
cross the mountain passes before snow-fall.  Going north, the canoes must ascend the upper
rivers before ice formed.  But times without number trappers and hunters were caught in the
desert without snow for water; or were blocked in the mountain passes by blizzards; or were
wrecked by the ice cutting their canoes on the upper rivers. Innumerable place-names commemorate
the presence of humble trapper and hunter coursing the wilderness in the Oregon brigades. 
For example: Sublette's River, Payette's River, John Day's River, the Des Chutes, and many
others.  Indeed, many of the place-names commemorate the deaths of lonely hunters in the desert.
Crow and Blackfoot and Sioux Indians often raided the brigades when on the home trip loaded
with peltry.  One can readily believe that rival traders from the Missouri instigated some
of these raids.  There were years when, of two hundred hunters setting out, only forty or fifty
returned; there were years when the Hudson's Bay brigades found snow-bound, storm-bound, starving
American hunters, and as a price for food exacted every peltry in the packs; and there were
years when rival American traders bribed every man in Ogden's brigade to desert.

{122}

The New Caledonia brigades set out by canoe--huge, long, cedar-lined craft manned by fifty
or even ninety men.  These brigades were decked out gayest of all.  Flags flew at the prow
of each craft.  Voyageurs adorned themselves with coloured sashes and headbands, with tinkling
bells attached to the buckskin fringe of trouser-leg.  Where the rivers narrowed to dark and
shadowy canyons, the bagpipes would skirl out some Highland air, or the French voyageurs would
strike up some song of the habitant, paddling and chanting in perfect rhythm, and sometimes
beating time with their paddles on the gunwales.  Leaders of the canoe brigades understood
well the art of never permitting fear to enter the souls of their voyageurs.  Where the route
might be exposed to Indian raid, a regale of rum would be dealt out; and the captain would
keep the men paddling so hard there was no time for thought of danger.

In course of time the northern brigades no longer attempted to ascend the entire way to the
interior of New Caledonia by boat.  Boats and canoes would be left on the Columbia at Fort
Colville or at Fort Okanagan (both south of the present international boundary), and the rest
of the trail would be pursued by {123} pack-horse.  Kamloops became the great half-way house
of these north-bound brigades; and horses were left there to pasture on the high, dry plains,
while fresh horses were taken to ascend the mountain trails.  Fort St James on Stuart Lake
became the chief post of New Caledonia.  Here ruled young James Douglas, who had married the
daughter of the chief factor William Connolly.  Ordinarily, the fort on the blue alpine lake
lay asleep like an August day; but on the occasion of a visit by the governor or the approach
of a brigade, the drowsy post became a thing of life.  Boom of cannon, firing of rifles, and
skirling of bagpipes welcomed the long cavalcade.  The captain of the brigade as he entered
the fort usually wore a high and pompous beaver hat, a velvet cloak lined with red silk, and
knee-breeches with elaborate Spanish embossed-leather leggings. All this show was, of course,
for the purpose of impressing the Indians.  Whether impressed or not, the Indians always counted
the days to the wild riot of feasting and boat-races and dog-races and horse-races that marked
the arrival or departure of a brigade.

New Caledonia, as we know, is now a part of Canada; but why does not the Union Jack float over
the great region beyond the Rockies {124} to the south--south of the Strait of Juan de Fuca
and the 49th parallel? Over all this territory British fur lords once held sway.  California
was in the limp fingers of Mexico, but the British traders were operating there, and had ample
opportunity to secure it by purchase long before it passed to the United States in 1848.  Simpson
would have gone further, and reached out the company's long arm to the islands of the Pacific
and negotiated with the natives for permission to build a fort in Hawaii.  James Douglas was
for buying all Alaska from the Russians; but to the directors of the Hudson's Bay Company Alaska
seemed as remote and as worthless as Siberia, so they contented themselves with leasing a narrow
strip along the shore.  Thus California, Alaska, and Hawaii might easily have become British
territory; but the opportunity was lost, and they went to the United States.  So, too, did
the fine territory of Oregon, out of which three states were afterwards added to the American
Union.  But the history of Oregon is confused in a maze of {125} politics, into which we cannot
enter here.  As we have seen, Bruno Heceta, acting for Spain, was the first mariner to sight
the Columbia, and the American, Robert Gray, was the first to enter its mouth, thus proving
Heceta's conjecture of a great river.  Then for Great Britain came Vancouver and Broughton;
then the Americans, Lewis and Clark and the Astorians; and finally Thompson, the British Nor'wester
and the first man to explore the great river from its source to the sea.  Then during the War
of 1812 the American post on the Columbia passed to the North-West Company of Montreal; and
if it had not been for the 'joint occupancy' agreement between Great Britain and the United
States in 1818, Oregon would undoubtedly have remained British.  But with the 'joint occupancy'
arrangement leaving sovereignty in dispute, M'Loughlin of Oregon knew well that in the end
sovereignty would be established, as always, by settlement.

First came Jedediah Smith, the American fur trader, overland.  He was robbed to the shirt on
his back by Indians at the Umpqua river.  There and then came the great choice to M'Loughlin--should
he save the life of rivals, or leave them to be murdered by {126} Indians? When Davis was chosen
President of the Confederacy, Alexander H. Stephens was chosen Vice-President. Stephens had
also had a picturesque career. Left an orphan, without means, at the age of fifteen he had nevertheless
secured an education, and, in 1834, after two months' study, was admitted to the Georgia bar.
He at once began to win a more than local reputation, for he was a man of unusual ability, and in
1836, he was elected to the Legislature, though an avowed opponent of nullification.

Seven years later, he was sent to Congress, and continued to oppose the secession movement; but
he saw whither things were trending, and in 1859 he resigned from
Congress, remarking that he knew there was going to be a smash-up
and thought he would better get off while there was time.  In 1838, at a council of the directors in
London, he personally urged the sending of a garrison of British soldiers, and that the government
should take control of Oregon in order to establish British rights.  His suggestions received
little consideration.  Had not the company single-handed held all Rupert's Land for almost
two hundred years?  Had they not triumphed over all rivals?  They would do so here.

But by 1843 immigrants were pouring over {127} the mountains by the thousands.  Washington
Irving's Astoria and Captain Bonneville, and the political cry of 'Fifty-four forty or fight'--which
meant American possession of all south of Alaska--had roused the attention of the people of
the United States to the merits of Oregon, and caused them to make extravagant claims.  Long
before the Oregon Treaty of 1846, which established the 49th parallel as the boundary, M'Loughlin
had foreseen what was coming.  The movement from the east had become a tide.  The immigrants
who came over the Oregon Trail in 1843 were starving, almost naked, and without a roof.  Again
the Indians crowded about M'Loughlin. 'Shall we kill?  Shall we kill?' they asked.  M'Loughlin
took the rough American overlanders into his fort, fed them, advanced them provisions on credit,
and sent them to settle on the Willamette.  Some of them showed their ingratitude later by
denouncing M'Loughlin as 'an aristocrat and a tyrant.'  The settlers established a provisional
government in 1844, and joined in the rallying-cry of 'Fifty-four forty or fight.'  This, as
M'Loughlin well knew, was the beginning of the end.  His friends among the colonists begged
him to subscribe to the provisional {128} government in order that they might protect his fort
from some of their number who threatened to 'burn it about his ears.' He had appealed to the
British government for protection, but no answer had come; and at length, after a hard struggle
and many misgivings, he cast in his lot with the Americans.  Two years later, in 1846, he retired
from the service of the company and went to live among the settlers.  He died at Oregon City
on the Willamette in 1857.

As early as June 1842 M'Loughlin had sent Douglas prospecting in Vancouver Island, which was
north of the immediate zone of dispute, for a site on which to erect a new post.  The Indian
village of Camosun, the Cordoba of the old Spanish charts, stood on the site of the present
city of Victoria.  Here was fresh water; here was a good harbour; here was shelter from outside
gales.  Across the sea lay islands ever green in a climate always mild and salubrious.  Fifteen
men left old Fort Vancouver with Douglas in March 1843 in the company's ship the Beaver, and
anchored at Vancouver Island, just outside Camosun Bay. With Douglas went the Jesuit missionary,
Father Bolduc, who on March 19 {129} celebrated the first Mass ever said on Vancouver Island,
and afterwards baptized Indians till he was fairly exhausted.  In three days Douglas had a
well dug and timbers squared.  For every forty pickets erected by the Indians he gave them
a blanket.  By September stockades and houses had been completed, and as many as fifty men
had come to live at the new fort, to which the name Victoria was finally given.  Victoria became
the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company on the Pacific.  It was unique as a fortified
post, in that it was built without the driving of a single nail, wooden pegs being used instead.

By 1849 the discovery of gold in California was bringing a rush of overlanders.  There had
been rumours of the discovery of precious metals on the Fraser and in East Kootenay.  The company
became alarmed; and Sir John Pelly, the governor in England, and Sir George Simpson, the governor
in America, went to the British government with the disquieting question: What is to hinder
American colonists rolling north of the boundary and establishing right of possession there
as they did on the Columbia?  By no stretch of its charter could the Hudson's Bay Company {130}
claim feudal rights west of the Rockies. What, my Lord Grey asks, would the company advise
the British government to do to avert this danger from a tide of democracy rolling north? 
Why, of course, answers Sir John Pelly, proclaim Vancouver Island a British colony and give
the company a grant of the territory and the company will colonize it with British subjects.
The proposal was laid before parliament.  It would be of no profit to follow the debate that
ensued in the House of Commons, which was chiefly 'words without knowledge darkening counsel.'
The request was officially granted in January 1849; and Richard Blanshard, a barrister of London,
was dispatched as governor of the new colony.  But as he had neither salary nor subjects, he
went back to England in disgust in 1851, and James Douglas of the Hudson's Bay Company reigned
in his stead.

But fate again played the unexpected part, and rang down the curtain on the fur lords of the
Pacific coast.  A few years previously Douglas had seen M'Loughlin compelled to choose between
loyalty to his company and loyalty to humanity.  A choice between his country and his company
was now unexpectedly thrust on the reticent, careful, {131} masterful Douglas.  In 1856 gold
was discovered in the form of large nuggets on the Fraser and the Thompson, and adventurers
poured into the country--20,000 in a single year.  Douglas foresaw that this meant British
empire on the Pacific and that the supremacy of the fur traders was about to pass away.  The
British government bought back Vancouver Island, and proclaimed the new colony of British Columbia
on the mainland.  Douglas retired from the company's service and was appointed governor of
both colonies.  In 1866 they were united under one government.

The stampede of treasure-seekers up the Fraser is another story.  When the new colony on the
mainland came into being, and the Hudson's Bay Company fell from the rank of a feudal overlord
to that of a private trader, the pioneer days of the Pacific became a thing of the past.
