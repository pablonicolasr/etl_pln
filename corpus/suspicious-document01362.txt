THE PREFACE.

The following discourse was written some Years since, not without the thought that, possibly,
it might be of farther use than for the entertainment of the Writer: Yet so little express
Intention was there of Publishing the Product of those leisure Hours it employ'd, that these
Papers lay by for above two Years unread, and almost forgotten. After which time, being perus'd
and Corrected, they were communicated to some Friends of the Authors, who judging them capable
to be useful, they are now sent into the World in that Hope.

There is nothing pretended or suppos'd to be in them which is not obvious: but Truths the most
evident, are sometimes overlook'd, or not sufficiently and universally attended to: And where
these are Truths of moment, it is no ill Service, by frequent representations of them, to procure
them attention.

I think there can be few heartily concerned for the Vice and Immorality that abounds amongst
us, who have not sometimes reflected upon loose or careless Education, as one cause thereof:
But yet the great weight that right Instruction and Discipline of Youth, is of, in respect
both of Peoples present and future Felicity, is (as I take it) far from being generally so
settl'd in the Minds of Parents, as to be steadily look'd upon by them as the one thing to
that degree necessary, that without due care taken thereof, all other indeavours, to render
their Children happy, either in this Life, or in that which is to come, are likely to be very
inefficacious. 

This army being too weak to accomplish its object, major general Winslow, who commanded it, declared
himself unable to proceed on the expedition without reinforcements. The arrival of a body of British
troops, with general Abercrombie, removed this difficulty; but another occurred which still
farther suspended the enterprise.

The regulations respecting rank had given great disgust in America; and had rendered it disagreeable
and difficult to carry on any military operations which required a junction of British and
provincial troops. When consulted on this delicate subject, Winslow assured general Abercrombie
of his apprehensions that, if the result of the junction should be to place the provincial troops under
British officers, it would produce general discontent, and perhaps desertion. His officers concurred
in this opinion; and it was finally agreed that British troops should succeed the provincials
in the posts then occupied by them, so as to enable the whole colonial force to proceed under
Winslow, against Crown Point.

On the arrival of the earl of Loudoun, this subject was revived. The question was seriously
propounded, "whether the troops in the several colonies of New England, armed with his majesty's
arms, would, in obedience to his commands signified to them, act in conjunction with his European
troops; and under the command of his commander in chief?" The colonial officers answered this
question in the affirmative; but entreated it as a favour of his
lordship, as the New England troops had been raised on particular
terms, that he would permit them, so far as might consist with his
majesty's service, to act separately. This request was acceded to;
but before the army could be put in motion, the attention both of
the Europeans and provincials, was directed to their own defence.

                  OCCASIONAL THOUGHTS

                   In reference to a

                 Vertuous or Christian

                        LIFE.

There is no so constant and satisfactory a Pleasure, to those who are capable of it, as Rational
Conversation gives: And to me, depriv'd of that Enjoyment, the remembrance thereof, is, in
my present Solitude, the most delightful Entertainment: Wherein some of my leisure hours will
not, I hope, be mispent, should this engage me to prosecute such Thoughts as were lately suggested
to me by others. The which taking their rise from a particular Enquiry, and thence proceeding
to a general Consideration of the Folly and Madness of Rational Creature's acting, as if they
had no other Principle to direct or determin them, than the Incitements of their Passions and
Appetites, comprehended at once the unhappiness of Mankind, both Here and Hereafter. Since
those Breaches of the Eternal Law of Reason, which disorder Common-wealths and Kingdoms; disturb
the Peace of Families; and make by far the greatest part of the Private Infelicities of Particular
Persons in this World, are what the Sovereign Disposer of all things has ordain'd, shall render
Men miserable in a future Life also.

A survey of which Moral Irregularities, as bringing into view a large Scene of Human Depravity,
does indeed furnish matter for melancholy, rather than pleasing Contemplations: But the Mind
is sometimes no less affected with Delight, wherein there is a mixture of sadness on Subjects,
which in themselves consider'd are ungrateful, than on occasions the most welcome to us: And
such a just zeal in any for the interests of Vertue, as makes them, with a Charitable concern,
reflect on the miscarriages of others, and thence take occasion to examine their own Actions
by the true Rules and Measures of their Duty, expresses a disposition of Mind too becoming
Rational Creatures, and too seldom met withal, not to please, tho' excited by Representations
which are disagreeable; provided they are of such a matter as is not then new to our Thoughts.

That the Gross of Mankind do every where live in opposition to that Rule of Nature which they
ought to obey, is a sad Truth; but that we who have this Rule enforc'd by a clearer Light,
are included herein, and do in this find the source of many Evils, not only fear'd, but which
we actually feel, are Considerations yet more affecting, and not a little aggravated in that,
within Memory, this heretofore sober Nation has been debauch'd from Principles of Vertue and
Religion, to such an excess of Vice and Prophaneness, that it has been Fashionable to have
no shame of the grossest Immoralities; and Men have thought even to recommend themseves by
avow'd Impiety. A Change which could not be consider'd without extream regret by all who either
were in earnest Christians, or who truly lov'd the Prosperity of their Country: And as upon
this occasion there was reason to be sensible that nothing operates so powerfully as the example
of Princes; some have been of later Years induc'd to hope for a revolution in our Manners,
no less advantageous than what has hitherto secur'd those Civil and Religious Liberties, without
which it is impossible for Vertue to subsist among any People whatsoever. But Experience shows
that Humane Nature is much easier led into Evil, than reduc'd from it; and that inveterate
Maladies are difficultly cur'd.

When Men's Practices have infected their Principles and Opinions; and these have had time again
reciprocally to confirm them in their Vicious Habits and Customs, the whole Constitution is
corrupted; and the Personal Vertue then of the Prince (however conspicuous) will not, without
a concurrence of other means, influence farther than to make (it may be) some change in the
Garb, or Fashion of Men's Vices.

A due and vigorous Execution of proper Laws against Immorality and Prophaneness, is that alone
which will effectually restrain them: And a right care had of Education, is the only humane
means of making People truly Vertuous. Whenever our inferiour Magistrates shall be such as
will be a terror to Evil doers, and encouragers of those who do well, and when Parents shall
be perswaded that it is in their power to procure to their Children more valuable Treasures
than Riches and Honours; the ancient Vertue of our Ancestors will then quickly be equall'd,
if not surpass'd, by that of their Posterity: But till then, it is in vain to expect that any
great Advances should be made towards an Amendment, as necessary to our present and National,
as to our Personal and Future Happiness.

What the force of Education is upon our Minds, and how by a due regard had to it, Common-wealths
and Kingdoms have flourished, and become famous; and how much this has been recommended by
Wise Men in all Ages, requires but a small consideration of Humane Nature, and Acquaintance
with History to inform us; nor is any thing more obvious to observe than the power of Education.
This matter yet has no where been ordinarily look'd after, proportionably to the moment it
is visibly of: And even the most sollicitous about it, have usually employ'd their care herein
but by halves with respect to the Principal Part in so great a concernment; for the information
and improvement of the Understanding by useful Knowledge, (a thing highly necessary to the
right regulation of the Manners) is commonly very little thought of in reference to one whole
Sex; even by those who in regard of the other, take due care hereof. But to this omission in
respect of one Sex, it is manifestly very much to be attributed, that that pains which is often
bestow'd upon the other, does so frequently, as it does, prove ineffectual: Since the actual
assistance of Mothers, will (generally speaking) be found necessary to the right forming of
the Minds of their Children of both Sexes; and the Impressions receiv'd in that tender Age,
which is unavoidably much of it passed among Women, are of exceeding consequence to Men throughout
the whole remainder of their Lives, as having a strong and oftentimes unalterable influence
upon their future Inclinations and Passions.

As those Persons who afforded that agreeable Conversation I have mention'd, were the greater
part of them Ladies, it was not strange if they express'd much displeasure at the too general
neglect of the Instruction of their Sex; a Reflection not easily to be avoided by them, when
their thoughts upon the miscarriages and unhappiness of Mankind in general, terminated in a
more peculiar Consideration of that part which those of their own Condition had in the one,
and the other. Wherein the Conversation concluded where it had begun; the occasion which introduced
it having been the Enquiry of a Lady, What was the Opinion of one in the Company concerning
a Book Intitled Conseils d'Ariste sur les Moyens de conserver sa Reputation? Of which (she
said) she had heard divers Persons of Merit and Quality, speak very differently: Some as if
it contained the most useful Instructions that could be given for the rendring any young Lady
such as her best Friends could wish she should be; and others, as relishing too much of an
Antiquated severity, not indulgent enough either to the natural and agreeable Gaiety of Youth,
or to that innocent Liberty now in use, deriv'd like most of our other Fashions, from that
Nation where these Counsels were thought needful.

I remember not the Book you speak of enough to answer to your desire, (reply'd the Person to
whom this Enquiry was address'd) but what you say is objected to these Conseils is without
doubt impertinent, unless the Precepts therein meant to be condemn'd, are shown to be in themselves
faulty; it being certainly otherwise no matter of exception to them that they are not Indulgent
to what an Age, the Manners whereof they were intended to correct, had establish'd or found
agreeable. This Objection yet can hardly (I think) be less just, than such a Character of any
Book of this Nature, as some it seems give of this: the Author whereof pretended not (as I
suppose) to so much in his Design, as these People find in his Performance. And the nature
and extent of a Christian's Duty is but little in their thoughts, who think that any Rules
dictated by Prudence, or Experience of the World, and directed to the Glory of a good Name,
are such Instructions as can render any one what they ought to be. A solid Vertue can alone
do this; the Possession whereof is infinitely preferable to that of Reputation; with which
yet it is so rarely unattended, that one may affirm there is no so secure and easie a way (especially
for a Lady) to acquire and conserve the Reputation of being Vertuous, as really to be so.

But Vertue is not (tho often so misrepresented) included in Innocency; or does consist in a
partial Practice of Actions praiseworthy; for its extent is equal to our liberty of Action;
and its Principle the most Active one of the Mind; Vertue being the natural result of a sincere
desire to conform in all things to the Law set us by our Maker; which who so truly endeavours,
will not find much occasion for such kind of Advices as the above-mentioned ones, either to
correct their Faults, or teach them to put a mask over them; an ill use sometimes made of this
sort of Instructions: However a better might be, since it is true, that young People from the
Experience of others may learn many things in reference to their Conduct, the knowledge whereof
they would buy too dear at their own. The difficulty yet that there is in applying general
Rules to particular Cases, makes (I presume) Books of this sort, how good soever in the kind,
of less advantage to those who most need them, than some imagine them to be.

This which was then said on the Subject of these Conseils (lying by accident in the way) suggests
to me now two things, wherein the Documents ordinarily given to such young Ladies, as are intended
to have the best care taken of their Instruction, are, I think, very defective; and the fitter
to be redress'd, as being of peculiar ill consequence in a Sceptical, loose and unthinking
Age; wherein Wit is apt to pass upon many for Reason.

The first of these is, That those Notions, or Ideas of Vertue, and consequent Rules of Action,
which are usually given to such young Persons, do rarely carry along with them an entire conviction
of their Truth and Reasonableness: Whence if these Instructions at any time happen strongly
to cross the Inclinations of those to whom they are given, it will appear rational to question
their Solidity: And when Principles that thwart People's passions or interests, come once to
be doubted of by them, it is great odds, that they will sooner be slighted, than better examin'd.

Now, this want of apparent Truth and Reasonableness, is not only where the Notions and Precepts
giv'n, are in themselves such as either in Whole, or in Part, are not True or Rational; but
also (oftentimes) where they are altogether conformable to right Reason: In which cases, the
want of apparent Reasonableness, proceeds from a defect of such Antecedent Knowledge in those
who are design'd to be instructed, as is necessary to the seeing their Reasonableness of the
Instructions giv'n them; that is to say, To their discerning the conformity with, or evident
deduction of such Instructions from some Truths which are unquestion'd by them: the which should
be the Principles of True Religion, so clearly made out to them, as to be by them acknowledg'd
for Verities. Religion being (as I shall take it at present for granted) the only sufficient
ground or solid support of Vertue; For the belief of a Superior, Omnipotent Being, inspecting
our Actions, and who will Reward or Punish us accordingly, is in all Men's Apprehensions the
strangest, and in truth the only stable and irresistible Argument for submitting our Desires
to a constant Regulation, wherein it is that Vertue does consist.

How far Natural Religion alone is sufficient for this, is very fit to be consider'd: But I
conclude that among us, there are few who pretend to recommend Vertue, but who do so either
with no respect at all to Religion, and upon Principles purely Humane, or else with reference
to the Christian Religion. [Sidenote: They abandon the country.]

The determination to abandon the country was immediately taken, and the wretched remnant of the colony
embarked on board the vessels, and sailed for England. "None dropped a tear," says Mr. Chalmer,
"because none had enjoyed one day of happiness."

[Sidenote: Stopped by Lord Delawar.]

Fortunately, they met Lord Delawar, who prevailed on them to return; and, on the 10th of June, resettled
them at Jamestown.

{1611}

By mildness of temper, attention to business, and judicious exercise of authority, this nobleman
restored order and contentment to the colony, and again impressed the Indians with respect for the
English name. Unfortunately, ill health obliged him to resign the government which he placed
in the hands of Mr. Percy, and sailed for the West Indies, leaving in the colony about two
hundred persons in possession of the blessings of health, plenty, and peace.

[Sidenote: Sir Thomas Dale.]

On the 10th of May, Sir Thomas Dale, who had been appointed to the government, arrived with a fresh
supply of men and provisions, and found the colony relapsing into a state of anarchy, idleness,
and want. It required all the authority of the new governor to maintain public order, and to compel
the idle and the dissolute to labour. Some conspiracies having been detected, he proclaimed martial
law, which was immediately put in execution. This severity was then deemed necessary, and
is supposed to have saved the settlement.[25]

[Footnote 25: Robertson. Chalmer. Stith. Beverly.]

In the beginning of August, Sir Thomas Gates, who had been appointed to succeed Sir Thomas Dale,
arrived with six ships, and a considerable supply of men and provisions. After receiving this
addition to its numbers, the colony again extended itself up James
river; and several new settlements were made.

{1612}

[Sidenote:
New Charter.]

Extravagant accounts of the fertility of Bermuda having
reached England, the company became desirous of obtaining it as a
place from which Virginia might be supplied with provisions. Application
was therefore made to the crown for a new patent, to comprehend this
island; and, in March, a charter was issued, granting to the treasurer
and company all the islands situate in the ocean within three hundred
leagues of the coast of Virginia. By this charter, the corporation
was essentially new modelled. It was ordained that four general courts
of the adventurers should be holden annually, for the determination
of affairs of importance, and weekly meetings were directed, for the
transaction of common business. To promote the effectual settlement
of the plantation, license was given to open lotteries in any part
of England.[26]

[Footnote 26: Robertson. Chalmer. Stith. Beverly.]

These
lotteries, which were the first ever drawn in England, brought twenty-nine
thousand pounds into the treasury of the company. When they were discontinued,
in 1620, on the complaint of the House of Commons, they were declared
to have "supplied the real food by which Virginia had been nourished." It is yet true that many
who have Learn'd, and who well remember long Catechisms, with all their pretended Proofs, are
so far from having that Knowledge which Rational Creatures ought to have of a Religion they
profess to Believe they can only be Sav'd by, as that they are not able to say, either what
this Religion does Consist in, or why it is they Believe it; and are so little instructed by
their Catechisms, as that, oftentimes, they understand not so much as the very Terms they have
Learn'd in them: And more often find the Proportions therein contain'd, so short in the Information
of their Ignorance; or so unintelligible, to their Apprehensions; or so plainly contradictory
of the most obvious Dictates of common Sense; that Religion (for the which they never think
of looking beyond these Systems) appears to them indeed a thing not Built upon, or defensible
by Reason: In consequence of which Opinion, the weakest attaques made against it, must needs
render such Persons (at the least) wavering in their Belief of it; Whence those Precepts of
Vertue, which they have receiv'd as bottom'd thereon, are, in a Time wherein Scepticism and
Vice, pass for Wit and Gallantry, necessarily brought under the suspicion of having no solid
Foundation; and the recommenders thereof, either of Ignorance, or Artifice.

But the not making Young People understand their Religion, is a fault not peculiar in regard
to the instruction of one Sex alone, any otherwise than as consider'd in its Consequences;
whereby (ordinarily speaking) Women do the most inevitably suffer; as not having the like Advantage
(at least early enough) of Correcting the Ignorance, or Errors of their Child-hood that Men have.

The other thing which I imagine faulty, does more peculiarly concern the Sex, but is yet chiefly
practic'd in regard of Those of it who are of Quality, and that is, the insinuating into them
such a Notion of Honour as if the praise of Men ought to be the Supreme Object of their Desires,
and the great Motive with them to Vertue: A Term which when apply'd to Women, is rarely design'd,
by some People, to signifie any thing but the single Vertue of Chastity; the having whereof
does with no more Reason intitle a Lady to the being thought such as she should be in respect
of Vertue, than a handsome Face, unaccompany'd by other Graces, can render her Person truly
Amiable. Or rather, Chastity is so essential to, singly, so small a part of the Merit of a
Beautiful Mind, that it is better compar'd to Health, or Youth, in the Body, which alone have
small Attractions, but without which all other Beauties are of no Value.

To perswade Ladies then that what they cannot want without being contemptible, is the chief
Merit they are capable of having, must naturally either give them such low thoughts of themselves
as will hinder them from aspiring after any thing Excellent, or else make them believe that
this mean Opinion of them is owing to the injustice of such Men in their regard as pretend
to be their Masters. A belief too often endeavour'd to be improv'd in them by others.

But whether any Natural, or Design'd ill consequence follow from hence or no, this is certain,
that a true Vertue is the best Security against all the Misfortunes that can be fear'd, and
the surest Pledge of all the Comforts that can be hop'd for in a Wife, viz. such a Vertue whose
Foundation is a desire above all things, of approving our selves to God; the most opposite
Principle whereunto is the making the Esteem of Men the chief End, and Aim of our Actions;
as it is propos'd to be of Their's who have the empty Idea of Glory set before them as the
great Motive to, and high Reward of that particular Duty, which (as if it included all others)
does ordinarily ingross the Name of Vertue, with regard to Women. A very wrong Motive this,
to Those who aim at what is truely Honourable, and such as may (and often does) as well produce
an ill, as a good effect.

But these wrong or partial Notions of Vertue, and Honour, are the Product only of such Men's
Inventions as are unwilling to regulate their own Actions by the Universal, and Eternal Law
of Right; and therefore are ever desirous to find out such Rules for other People, as will
not reach themselves, and as they can extend and contract as they please. In saying of which,
it is not deny'd, that the love of Praise may be sometimes usefully instill'd into very Young
Persons, to give them the desire of Eminence in things wherein they should endeavour to excel:
But as this ought never to be made the incitement to any Vertue but in the earliest Childhood
of our Reason, so also at no time should Glory (which is the Reward only of Actions transcendently
Good, either in kind, or degree) be represented as the purchase of barely not meriting Infamy:
The apprehension of which, is a much stronger perswasive to most People not to do amiss, than
that of Glory, which cannot consist with it: For no Body can rationally think that Glory can
be due to them for doing that, which it would be shameful in them not to do. But there is yet
a farther Folly and ill Consequence in Men's intitling Ladies to Glory on account of Chastity
which is, that the conceit hereof (especially in those who are Beautiful) does ordinarily produce
in them a Pride and Imperiousness, that is very troublesome to such as are the most concern'd
in them.

One whose business it was to remark the Humours of the Age, and of Mankind in general, has,
I remember, made a Husband on this occasion to say,

     Such Vertue is the Plague of Human Life,
     A Vertuous Woman, but a Cursed Wife.

And he adds,

     In Unchaste Wives,
     There's yet a kind of recompencing Ease,
     Vice keeps 'em Humble, gives 'em care to please.
     But against clamorous Vertue, what Defence?

If Mr. Dryden did distinguish herein, between real Vertue and that Idol one of Men's Invention,
he was, perhaps, not much in the wrong in what he suggests: But if he design'd in this a Satyr
against Marriage, as a state in the which a Man can no way be happy, it appears then how much
Vertue is prejudiced by this foreign Support, whilst it becomes thereby expos'd to such a Censure;
which if it may be Just in reference to a vain Glorious Chastity, yet can never be so of a
truly Vertuous one: Obedience to the Law of God, being an Universal Principle, and admitting
of no Irregularity in one thing any more than in another, which falls under it's Direction.

It is indeed only a Rational Fear of God, and desire to approve our selves to him, that will
teach us in All things, uniformly to live as becomes our Reasonable Nature; to inable us to
do which, must needs be the great Business and End of a Religion which comes from God.

But how differently from this has the Christian Religion been represented by those who place
it in useless Speculations, Empty Forms, or Superstitious Performances? The Natural Tendency
of which things being to perswade Men that they may please God at a cheaper Rate than by the
Denial of their Appetites, and the Mortifying of their Irregular Affections, these Misrepresentations
of a pretended Divine Revelation have been highly prejudicial to Morality: And, thereby, been
also a great occasion of Scepticism; for the Obligation to Vertue being loosen'd, Men easily
become Vicious; which when once they are, the Remorse of their Consciences bringing them to
desire that there should be no future Reckoning for their Actions; and even that there should
be no God to take any cognizance of them; they often come (in some degree at least) to be perswaded
both of the one, and the other of these. And thus, many times, there are but a few steps between
a Zealous Bigot, and an Infidel to all Religion.

Scepticism, or rather Infidelity, is the proper Disease our Age, and has proceeded from divers
Causes: But be the remoter or original ones what they will, it could never have prevail'd as
it has done, had not Parents very generally contributed thereto, either her by negligence of
their Children's Instruction; or Instructing them very ill in respect of Religion.

It might indeed seem strange to one who had no experience of Mankind, that People (however
neglected in their Education) could, when they came to years of Judgment, be to such a degree
wanting to themselves, as not to seek right Information concerning Truths of so great Moment
to them not to be Ignorant of, or mistaken in, as are those of Religion. Yet such is the wretched
Inconsideration Natural to most Men, that (in fact) it is no uncommon thing at all to see Men
live day after day, in the pursuit of their Inclinations, without ever exerting their Reason
to any other purpose than the gratification of their Passions; and no wonder can it then be
if they give in to the belief, or take up with a blind Perswasion of such Opinions as they
see to be most in Credit; and which will also the best suit their turn?

Absolute Atheism does no doubt the best serve Their's, who live as if there was no God in the
World; but how far so great Non-sense as this, has been able to obtain, is not easie to say:
downright Atheism being what but few Men will own. To me it appears (in that Those who will
expose themselves to argue against the Existence of a God, do rarely venture to produce any
Hypothesis of their own to be fairly examin'd and compar'd with that which they reject: But
that their opposition to a Deity, consists only in Objections which may as well be retorted
upon themselves, and which at best prove nothing but the shortness of Humane Understanding)
to me, I say, it appears from hence probable that the greatest part of Atheistick Reasoners,
do rather desire, and seek to be Atheists, than that in reality they are so. Men, who are accustom'd
to Believe without any Evidence of Reason for what they Believe, are, it is likely, more in
earnest in this wild Opinion: And in all appearance very many there are among us of such as
a Learned Man calls Enthusiastick Atheists, viz. who deny the Existence of an Invisible, Omniscient,
Omnipotent, first Cause of all things, only through a certain Sottish disbelief of whatsoever
they cannot either see or feel; never consulting their Reason in the Case. That there are some
who do thus, their Discourses assure us: The Actions of many others, are unaccountable without
supposing them to be of this Number; and it is very suspicious that to this Atheism as to a
secret Cause thereof, may be attributed the avow'd Averseness of many Men to reveal'd Religion,
since in a Country where People are permitted to read the Scriptures, and to use their Reason
freely in matters of Religion; and where, in effect, there are so many Rational Christians,
'tis hard to conceive that Men can be long Scepticks in regard of Christianity, if they are
indeed hearty Deists; and fully perswaded of the Truths of Natural Religion.

But it being sufficiently obvious that want of Instruction concerning Religion does in a Sceptical
Age dispose Men to Scepticism and Infidelity, which often terminates in downright Atheism;
let us see whether, or no, Ill, by which I mean, all irrational Instruction in regard of Religion,
has not the same Tendency.

It is as undeniable as the difference between Men's being in, and out of their Wits, that Reason
ought to be to Rational Creatures the Guide of their Belief: That is to say, That their Assent
to any thing, ought to be govern'd by that proof of its Truth, whereof Reason is the Judge;
be it either Argument, or Authority, for in both Cases Reason must determine our Assent according
to the validity of the Ground it finds it Built on: By Reason being here understood that Faculty
in us which discovers, by the intervention of intermediate Ideas, what Connection Those in
the Proposition have one with another: Whether certain; probable; or none at all; according
whereunto, we ought to regulate our Assent. If we do not so, we degrade our selves from being
Rational Creatures; and deprive our selves of the only Guide God has given us for our Conduct
in our Actions and Opinions.

Authority yet is not hereby so subjected to Reason, as that a Proposition which we see not
the Truth of, may not nevertheless be Rationally assented to by us.

For tho' Reason cannot from the Evidence of the thing it self induce our assent to any Proposition,
where we cannot perceive the Connexion of the Ideas therein contain'd; yet if it appears that
such a Proposition was truly reveal'd by God, nothing can be more Rational than to believe
it: since we know that God can neither Deceive, nor be Deceived: That there are Truths above
our Conception, and that God may (if he so pleases) communicate these to us by Supernatural
Revelation.

The part of Reason then, in regard of such a Proposition as this, is, only to examine whether
it be indeed a Divine Revelation: which should Reason not attest to the Truth of; it is then
evidently Irrational to give, or require assent to it as being so.

And as plainly Irrational must it be to give, or require assent to any thing as a Divine Revelation,
which is evidently contrary to Reason; no less being herein imply'd than that God has made
us so as to see clearly that to be a Truth, which is yet a Falshood; the which, were it so,
would make the Testimony of our Reason useless to us; and thereby destroy also the Credit of
all Revelation; for no stronger proof can be had of the Truth of any Revelation than the Evidence
of our Reason that it is a Revelation.

Now if the Christian Religion be very often represented as teaching Doctrines clearly contrary
to Reason; or as exacting belief of what we can neither perceive the Truth of, nor do find
to be reveal'd by Christ, or his Apostles: And, (what is still more) that this pretended Divine
Religion does even consist in such a Belief as This; so that a Man cannot be a Christian without
believing what he neither from Arguments or Authority has any Ground for believing; what must
the Natural Consequence of this be upon all whoever so little consult their Reason, when in
riper Years they come to reflect hereupon, but to make them recal, and suspend, at least, their
assent to the Truth of a Religion that appears to them thus Irrational? since an Irrational
Religion can never Rationally be conceived to come from God.

And if Men once come to call in question such Doctrines as (tho' but upon slender Grounds for
it) they had received for unquestionable Truths of Religion, they are ordinarily more likely
to continue Scepticks, or to proceed to an intire disbelief of this Religion, than to take
occasion from hence to make a just search after its Verity: The want either of Capacity, Leisure
or Inclination for such an inquiry, disposing Men, very generally, to neglect it; and easily
to satisfy themselves in so doing, from a perswasion that the Christian Religion is indeed
self condemn'd: Those whom they imagine to have understood it as well as any Men, having never
taught them that this Religion does so much as pretend to any Foundation in, or appeal to Reason,
that Faculty in us which distinguishes us from Beasts, and the Actual use thereof from Mad-Men;
but indeed Taught them the contrary: And thus prejudg'd, it truly is that the Christian Religion,
by those who disbelieve it, has usually come to be rejected; without ever having been allow'd
a fair Examination.

From what has been said, I think it does appear, that Ill, that is to say, Irrational Instruction
concerning Religion, as well as want of Instruction, disposes to Scepticism: And this being
so, what wonder can it be that Scepticism having once become fashionable, should continue so?
the un-instructed, and the ill-instructed, making by so great odds, the Majority. For Those
who have no Religion themselves, do not often take care that others should have any: And They
who adhere to a misgrounded Perswasion concerning Religion, retaining a Reverence for their
Teachers, do, in consequence thereof, commonly presume that their Children cannot be better
taught than they have been before them; which is generally (as has been said) only by the learning
of some approved Catechism; wherein, commonly enough, the first principles of Religion are
not, as they should be, laid down, but suppos'd: and from whence Those who learn them, learn
nothing except that certain Propositions are requir'd to be Believed, which perhaps, they find
inconceivable by them; or (at best) whereof they see neither use, nor certainty: These Catechisms
yet being represented to Children by those whom they the most Esteem, and Credit, as containing
Sacred verities on the Belief of which Salvation does depend, they quickly become afraid to
own that they are not convinc'd of the Truth of what is deliver'd in them: For the greater
part among our selves are instructed in Religion much after the same manner that that good
Lady of the Church of Rome instructed her Child; who when the Girl told her, she could not
believe Transubstantiation; Reply'd, What? You do you not believe Transubstantiation? You are
a naughty Girl, and must be whip'd.

Instead of having their reasonable Inquiries satisfy'd, and incourag'd, Children are ordinarily
rebuk'd for making any: from whence not daring in a short time to question any thing that is
taught them in reference to Religion; they, (as the Girl above-mention'd was) are brought to
say, that they do Believe whatever their Teachers tell them they must Believe; whilst in Truth
they remain in an ignorant unbelief, which exposes them to be seduc'd by the most pitiful Arguments
of the Atheistical, or of such as are disbelievers of reveal'd Religion.

The Foundation of All Religion is the belief of a God; or of a Maker and Governour of the World;
the evidence of which, being visible in every thing; and the general Profession having usually
stamp'd it with awe upon Children's Minds, they ought perhaps most commonly to be suppos'd
to Believe This, rather than have doubts rais'd in them by going about to prove it to them:
because those who are uncapable of long deductions of Reason, or attending to a train of Arguments,
not finding the force thereof when offer'd to prove what they had always taken for a clear,
and obvious verity, would be rather taught thereby to suspect that a Truth which they had hitherto
look'd on as unquestionable, might rationally be doubted of, than be any ways confirm'd in
the belief of it. But if any doubts concerning the Existence of God, do arise in their Minds,
when they own this, or that this, can be discover'd by discoursing with them: such doubts should
always be endeavour'd to be remov'd by the most solid Arguments of which Children are capable.
Nor should They ever be rebuk'd for having those doubts; since not giving leave to look into
the grounds of asserting any Truth, whatever it be, can never be the way to establish that
Truth in any rational Mind; but, on the contrary, must be very likely to raise a suspicion
that it is not well grounded.

The belief of a Deity being entertain'd; what should be first taught us should be what we are
in the first place concern'd to know.

Now it is certain that what we are in the first place concern'd to know, is that which is necessary
to our Salvation; and it is as certain that whatever God has made necessary to our Salvation,
we are at the same time capable of knowing. All Instruction therefore which obtrudes upon any
one as necessary to their Salvation, what they cannot understand or see the evidence of, is
to that Person, wrong Instruction; and when any such unintelligible, or unevident Propositions
are delivered to Children as if they were so visible Truths that a reason, or proof of them
was not to be demanded by them, what effect can this produce in their Minds but to teach them
betimes to silence and suppress their Reason; from whence they have afterwards no Principle
of Vertue left; and their practices, as well as opinions, must needs (as is the usual consequence
hereof) become expos'd to the Conduct of their own, or other Men's Fancies?

The existence of God being acknowledg'd a Truth so early receiv'd by us, and so evident to
our Reason, that it looks like Natural Inscription; the Authority of that Revelation by which
God has made known his Will to Men, is to be firmly establish'd in People's Minds upon its
clearest, and most rational evidence; and consequentially They are then to be refer'd to the
Scriptures themselves, to see therein what it is that God requires of them to believe and to
do; the great Obligation they are under diligently to study these Divine Oracles being duly
represented to them. But to exhort any one to search the Scriptures to the end of seeing therein
what God requires of him, before he is satisfy'd that the Scriptures are a Revelation from
God, cannot be rational: since any ones saying that the Scriptures are God's Word, cannot satisfy
a rational and inquisitive Mind that they are so: and that the Books of the Old and New Testament
were dictated by the Spirit of God, is not a self evident Proposition, but a Truth that demands
to be made out, before it can be rationally assented to.

It should also be effectually Taught, and not in Words alone, That it is our Duty to study
and examine the Scriptures, to the end of seeing therein what God requires of us to believe,
and to do. But none are effectually, or sincerely taught this, if notwithstanding that this
is sometimes told them, they are yet not left at liberty to believe, or not believe, according
to what, upon examination, appears to them to be the sense of the Scriptures: for if we must
not receive them in that sense, which, after our best inquiry, appears to us to be their meaning,
it is visible that it signifies nothing to bid us search, and examine them.

These two things, viz. a rational assurance of the Divine Authority of the Scriptures, and
a liberty of fairly examining them, are absolutely necessary to the satisfaction of any rational
Person, concerning the certainty of the Christian Religion, and what it is that this Religion
does consist in: and He who when he comes to be a Man, shall remember that being a Boy he has
been check'd for doubting, instead of being better inform'd when he demanded farther proof
than had been given him of the Divine Authority of the Scriptures: or that he has been reprehended
for thinking that the Word of God contradicted some Article of his Catechism; has just ground,
when he reflects thereupon, to question, whether or no, the Interaction of his Childhood has
not been an Imposition upon his Reason; which he will no doubt be apt to believe the more,
when others shall confidently affirm to him that it has been so: And in that Age of Men's Lives
when they are in the eagerest pursuit of Pleasure, it is great odds (as has been already observ'd)
that if, in regard of Religion, they come to lose the belief of what they have once thought
unquestionable, they will more often be perswaded that there is no Truth at all therein, than
set themselves seriously to find out what is so.

How dangerous a thing then is such Instruction in Religion, as teaches nothing unless it be
to stifle the Suggestions of our Natural Light? But that such Instruction as this, is all that
the far greatest Number of People have, there is too much ground to conclude, from the visible
Ignorance even of the most of Those who are Zealous in some Profession of Christian Faith,
and Worship: Few of These not being at a loss to answer, if ask'd, either, What the Faith of
a Christian does consist in? Or, Why they believe such Articles concerning it, as they profess
to believe?

That their God-fathers, and God-mothers ingag'd for them that they should believe so; is a
reason for their doing it that I suppose, there are but Few who would not be asham'd to give;
as seeing that a Mahumetan could not be thought to assert his Faith more absurdly in the Opinion
of any indifferent By-stander, and yet it is evident that no better a reason than this have
very many for their Belief.

What is the chief and highest end of Man? is a Question which, methinks, supposes the resolution
of more antecedent Questions, than Children, untaught, can be presum'd to be resolv'd in. But
be this Question ever so proper to begin a Catechism withal, the answer hereto, viz. That Man's
chief and highest end is to glorifie God, and enjoy him for ever; is not surely very instructive
of an ignorant Child. It is a good Question in the same Catechism; How doth it appear the Scriptures
are the Word of God? But who would imagine that for the information of any one who wanted to
be inform'd herein, it should be answer'd, That the Scriptures manifest themselves to be the
Word of God by their Majesty and Purity: by the consent of all the Parts, and by the scope
of the whole; which is to give all Glory to God: by their Light and Power to convince, and
convert Sinners; to comfort and build up Believers to Salvation: But the Spirit of God bearing
Witness by and with the Scriptures, in the Heart of Man is alone able fully to perswade that
they are the very Word of God. One would almost be tempted to suspect that Men who talk'd thus,
were not themselves thorowly perswaded that the Scriptures were indeed the Word of God; for
how is it possible not only for a Young Boy, or Girl, but even for an Indian Man, or Woman,
to be by this answer more convinc'd than they were before, of the Scriptures being what they
are pretended to be? To assure any rational inquirer of Which, it is necessary they should
be satisfied, That the Scriptures were indeed written by those whose Names they bear; That
these Persons were unquestionable Witnesses, and Faithful Historians of the matters they relate;
and that they had such a Guidance, and Direction from the Spirit of God as led them to deliver
all necessary Truth, and to preserve them from all error prejudicial thereunto: which Things
have so good evidence, that none who are not manifestly prejudic'd, can refuse assent thereto,
when they are duly represented to them: but without having weigh'd this evidence, the Divine
Authority of the Scriptures may, possibly, be by some firmly believ'd, but cannot be so upon
the conviction of their Reason.

The Instruction then of most Peoples Younger Years being such as we have seen in regard of
Religion: and Vertue, viz. The right regulation of our Passions, and Appetites, having (as
has been abovesaid) no other sufficient inforcement than the Truths of Religion; can it reasonably
be thought strange, that there is so little Vertue in the World as we find there is? or that
correspondently to their Principles, Peoples Actions generally are (at best) unaccountable
to their Reason? For Time, and more Years, if they give strength to our Judgments whereby we
may be thought able to inform our selves, and correct the errors and defects of our Education,
give also strength to our Passions; which grown strong, do furnish and suggest Principles suited
to the purposes and ends that they propose; besides, that Ill Habits once settl'd, are hardly
chang'd by the force of any principles of which Reason may come to convince Men at their riper
Age: A Truth very little weigh'd; tho' nothing ought more to be so with respect to a vertuous
Education; since rational Religion, so soon as they are capable thereof, is not more necessary
to the ingaging People to Vertue, than is the fixing, and establishing in them good Habits
betimes, even before they are capable of knowing any other reason for what they are taught
to do, than that it is the Will of Those who have a just power over them that they should do
so. For as without a Knowledge of the Truths of Religion, we should want very often sufficient
Motives, and Encouragements to submit our Passions and Appetites to the Government of Reason;
so without early Habits establish'd of denying our Appetites, and restraining our Inclinations,
the Truths of Religion will operate but upon a very few, so far as they ought to do.

By Religion I understand still Reveal'd Religion. For tho' without the help of Revelation,
the Commands of Jesus Christ (two positive Institutions only excepted) are, as dictates likewise
of Nature, discoverable by the Light of Reason; and are no less the Law of God to rational
Creatures than the injunctions of Revelation are; yet few would actually discern this Law of
Nature in its full extent, meerly by the Light of Nature; or if they did, would find the inforcement
thereof a sufficient Ballance to that Natural love of present pleasure which often opposes
our compliance therewith; since before we come to such a ripeness of understanding as to be
capable by unassisted Reason to discover from the Nature of Things the just measures of our
Actions, together with the obligations we are under to comply therewithal; an evil indulgence
of our Inclinations has commonly establish'd Habits in us too strong to be over-rul'd by the
Force of Arguments; especially where they are not of very obvious deduction. Whence it may
justly be infer'd that the Christian Religion is the alone Universally adapted means of making
Men truly Vertuous; the Law of Reason, or the Eternal Rule of Rectitude being in the Word of
God only, to those of all capacities, plainly, and Authoritatively deliver'd as the Law of
God, duly inforc'd by Rewards and Punishments.

Yet in that Conformity with, and necessary support which our Religion brings to the Law of
Reason, or Nature, that is to say, to Those dictates which are the result of the determinate
and unchangeable Constitution of things (and which as being discoverable to us by our rational
Faculties, are therefore sometimes call'd the Law of Reason, as well as the Law of Nature)
Christianity does most conspicuously and evidently appear to be a Divine Religion; viz. to
be from the Author of Nature; however incongruous some Men may phancy it to be for God supernaturally
to reveal to Men what is naturally discoverable to them, by those Faculties he has given them:
The which conceit together with not considering, or rightly weighing the inforcements which
Natural Religion needs, and receives from Revelation, has very much dispos'd many to reject
reveal'd Religion. Whereunto such Notions of Christianity as agree not to the Attributes of
an Infinitely Wise and Good Being, which Reason teaches the first cause of all things to be,
have also not a little contributed; for from hence many Men, zealous for the Honour of God
and lovers of Mankind, have been prejudic'd against the Truth of the Christian Religion: In
consequence whereof they have reasonably concluded that there was no such thing as reveal'd
Religion; and from thence have again infer'd that Men had no need thereof to the Ends of Natural
Religion.

Those yet who think Revelation to be needless in this regard, how well soever they may, possibly,
intend to Natural Religion, do herein entertain an Opinion that would undermine it: Experience
shewing us that Natural Light, unassisted by Revelation, is insufficent to the Ends of Natural
Religion: A Truth necessary to be acknowledg'd to the having a due value for the benefit that
we receive by the Revelation of Jesus Christ; and many, who profess belief in him, have not
a right estimation of that benefit on this very account, viz. as thinking too highly, or rather
wrongly of Natural Light: notwithstanding that nothing is more undeniably true than that from
the meer Light of Nature Men actually were so far from discovering the Law of Nature in its
full extent or force, as that they did not generally own, and but very imperfectly discern,
its prescriptions or obligation. 'Tis also alike evident that as Christianity has prevail'd,
it has together with Polytheism, and (in great measure) Idolatry, beaten out likewise the allow'd
Practice of gross Immorality; which in the Heathen World was countenanc'd, and incourag'd by
the examples of their very Gods themselves; and by being frequently made even a part in Religious
Worship. For the Truth of this effect of Christianity we must appeal to History; from whence
if any one should imagine they could oppose any contrary example, it could (I think) be taken
but from one only Country; wherein (if the Historian says right) Morality was more exemplary
than in any other that we know of for near 400 Years that its Pagan Natives possess'd it; whose
exterminators (calling themselves Christians) made it a most deplorable Scene of Injustice,
Cruelty and Oppression, bringing thither Vices unknown to those former Inhabitants. But what
only can follow from this example is, That a People, having a continu'd Succession of Princes,
who study to advance the good of the Community, making that the sole Aim of their Government;
and directing all their Laws, and Institutions to that End (which was the peculiar felicity
of those happy Americans) will without other than Natural Light much better practice all social
Vertues, than Men set loose from Law and Shame; who tho' Baptiz'd into the Name of Christ have
not yet so much as a true Notion of Christianity, to the which, may certainly be added, or
than any other People, who tho' they have the Light of the Gospel among them, yet are not govern'd
by the Laws thereof; and a truly Christian Common-wealth in this sense, remains yet to be seen
in the World; which when it is, the Vertue, and Felicity of such a People will be found much
to surpass the (perhaps partial) account which we have of that of the Peruvians; whose so long
uninterrupted Succession of Excellent Princes, is what only is admirable in the account we
have of them; and not the Force of the Light of Nature in those People, who being apparently
of tractable, gentle dispositions, and tir'd with the Miseries of a Life to the last degree
Brutish, did from the visible wretchedness and inconveniences thereof, gladly obey such whom
they believed were (as they told them they were) Divinely sent to teach then a happier way
of living. And in the Vertues which these their first Lawgivers taught them, their Successors
easily retain'd them; continuing still to maintain in them a perswasion of their Divine Extraction,
and Authority. From the which it will be found that this instance of the Peruvian Morality
makes for the need of Revelation to inforce Natural Religion, and not against it. But how far
Revelation is needful to assist Natural Light, will be the best seen in reflecting a little
upon what we receive from each of these Guides that God has given us. And if it shall appear
from thence that Natural Religion has need of Revelation to support it; and that the Revelation
which we have by Jesus Christ is exquisitely adapted to the end of inforcing Natural Religion;
this will both be the highest confirmation possible, that to inforce Natural Religion or Morality,
was the design of Christianity; and will also shew that to the want of their being in earnest
Christians, is to be attributed the immorality of such who, professing Christianity, live immoral
Lives. The consequence from whence must be, That to reclaim a Vicious People, it should be
consider'd, as the most effectual means of doing so, how to make Men really, and in earnest
Christians.

To see what light we receive from Nature to direct our Actions, and how far we are Naturally
able to obey that Light; Men must be consider'd purely as in the state of Nature, viz. as having
no extrinsick Law to direct them, but indu'd only with a faculty of comparing their distant
Ideas by intermediate Ones, and Thence of deducing, or infering one thing from another; whereby
our Knowledge immediately received from Sense, or Reflection, is inlarg'd to a view of Truths
remote, or future, in an Application of which Faculty of the mind to a consideration of our
own Existence and Nature, together with the beauty and order of the Universe, so far as it
falls under our view, we may come to the knowledge of a First Cause; and that this must be
an Intelligent Being, Wise and Powerful, beyond what we are able to conceive. And as we delight
in our selves, and receive pleasure from the objects which surround us, sufficient to indear
to us the possession and injoyment of Life, we cannot from thence but infer, that this Wise
and Powerful Being is also most Good, since he has made us out of nothing to give us a Being
wherein we find such Happiness, as makes us very unwilling to part therewith.

And thus, by a consideration of the Attributes of God, visible in the Works of the Creation,
we come to a knowledge of his Existence, who is an Invisible Being: For since Power, Wisdom
and Goodness, which we manifestly discern in the production and conservation of our selves,
and the Universe, could not subsist independently on some substance for them to inhere in,
we are assur'd that there is a substance where unto they do belong, or of which they are the
Attributes.

Which Attributes of God would not be discoverable by us, did we not discern a difference in
Things; as between Power and Weakness, Benevolence and no Benevolence, or its contrary; and
betwixt directing means to an End, and acting at hap-hazard without any design, or choice:
A knowledge, which, by whatever steps convey'd into the mind, is no other than a seeing things
to be what they are, and that they cannot but be what they are.

From which diversity and immutability in the Nature of things, there necessarily arises a diversity
of respects and relations between them, as unchangeable as the things themselves: wherein the
Will of the Creator in reference hereunto is reveal'd to every intelligent Agent, so far as
he is made capable of discerning these relations, dependencies and consequences; and whatsoever
with respect to his own Actions, such a Being finds resulting from any of these as most conformable
to the design of his Creator in making him such a part as he is of the whole, he cannot but
consider as the Will of God, thereby dictated to him; since otherwise, God would act contradictiously
to his Wisdom in making him what he is.

We being then indu'd, as we are, with a capacity of perceiving and distinguishing these differences
of Things; and also with a liberty of acting, or not, suitably and agreeably hereunto; whence
we can according to the preference of our own minds, act either in conformity to, or disconformity
with, the Will of the Creator (manifested in his Works no less than the Will of any Humane
Architect is in his) it follows, That to act answerably to the nature of such Beings as we
are, requires that we attentively examine, and consider the several natures of Things, so far
as they have any relation to our own actions.

Which attentive consideration of the Works of God objected to our view, implies an exercise
thereupon of that Faculty in us by which we deduce, or infer, one thing from another: Whence
(as has been said) our knowledge immediately deriv'd to us from sensation, or reflection, is
inlarg'd by the perception of remote, or distant Truths. The more obviously eminent advantages
accruing to us from which faculty of reason, plainly make known the Superiority of its Nature;
and that its suggestions, ought to be hearken'd to by us preferably to those of Sense; where
these (as it too often happens) do not concur. For did we know nothing by Inference and Deduction,
both our knowledge and injoyment would be very short of what they now are; many considerable
pleasures depending almost intirely upon Reason; and there being none of the greatest Enjoyments
of Sense which would not lose their best Relish, separated from those concomitant satisfactions
which accompany them only as we are rational Creatures. Neither is it our greatest happiness
alone which is manifestly provided for in our being indu'd with this Faculty; but our much
greater safety, and preservation likewise; since these require a capacity in us of foreseeing
distant Events, and directing means to an End, oftentimes through a long train of Actions;
which is what we can only do by that in us, whereby the Relations, Dependencies and Consequences
of things are discoverable to us.

But as Reason is that which either in kind or degree, differences Men from Brutes; and that
there are few, if any, who would lose this distinction, it is by common consent acknowledg'd
that Reason is in respect of all others, a preferable indowment. And if Beasts, only inferiour
to Men in the advantages of this Faculty, appear hereby intended to be subjected to Men, it
cannot be less evident That that part in Men which they have in common with Beasts, was likewise
design'd by their Maker to be subjected to their Reason also. From All which, it undeniably
follows that we do not act answerably to the Will, or pleasure of God, in making us such Creatures
as we are, if we either neglect the Search of those Measures of our Actions prescrib'd to us
by the discernable Natures of Things; or, if seeing these, we yet conform not our selves thereunto.

Now for any Creature knowingly to oppose the Will of its Creator, is not only disingenuity
in regard of what is owing from it to its Sovereign Benefactor, and Folly in respect of that
dependence which it has on him for its Being, as it is commonly represented to us to be; but
is also in the Nature of Things (simply consider'd) so repugnant to right Reason, that were
such a Creature consistent with it self herein, and could act pursuantly to That Will, it would
operate to its own destruction; since its Existence evidently depends upon That of its Maker;
whose Will, as reveal'd to us, being but a different consideration of his Attributes, the knowledge
whereof is all the Knowledge we have of God, cannot be so much as conceiv'd by us separable
from the Being of God; unless the God, which we conceive, be a Fiction of our own Imagination,
and not the Creator of All Things; who is an invisible Being only knowable to us in, and by,
the exemplifications of his Attributes: The infinite Perfection, and the inseparable Correspondence,
and Harmony of which (discernable in the Frame and Government of the Universe) plainly tells
us, That the Divine Will cannot be (like ours) successive Determinations without dependance,
or connection one upon another; much less inconsistent, contradictory, and mutable; but one
steady, uniform, unchangeable result of infinite Wisdom and Benevolence, extending to, and
including All his Works. So that Sin, or disobedience to our Maker is manifestly the greatest
Nonsense, Folly and contradiction conceivable, with regard purely to the immutable perfection
of the Divine Nature; and to the Natural constitution of things, independently upon any positive
command of God to us, or his irresistible power over us.

But as without a capacity in The Creature to act contrary to the will of the Creator there
could be no defect, or self-excellency in any Created Being; contrariety to the Will of God
is therefore permitted in the Universe as a necessary result of Creaturely imperfection, under
the greatest endowment that a Created Being is capable of having, viz. That of Freedom or Liberty
of Action: And as the constitution of such Creature, as this, implies that what is best in
reference to the design of the Creator, and of its own Happiness, should not be always necessarily
present to the Mind as Best; such a Creature may oppose the Will of his Maker with various
degrees of Guilt in so doing; or (possibly) with none at all; for no Agent can offend farther
than he wilfully abuses the Freedom he has to act.

But God having made Men so as that they find in themselves, very often, a liberty of acting
according to the preference of their own Minds, it is incumbent upon them to study the Will
of their Maker; in an application of the Faculty of Reason which he has given them, to the
consideration of the different respects, consequences, and dependencies of Things, so as to
discern from thence, the just measures of their actions in every circumstance and relation
they stand plac'd in; which measures are nothing else but the dictates resulting from those
views which such a consideration of things as this gives us, of what is consonant, or not so,
to the design of the Creator in every particular, wherein we are concern'd to act. And these
manifestations of his Will, thus discoverable to us, ought to be regarded by us, as his Commands.

Yet however certain it is, that the dictates of Reason, or Nature, discernable by our natural
Faculties, are the commands of God to us, as rational Creatures; it is equally true that the
love of happiness (which consists in pleasure) is the earliest, and strongest principle of
Humane Nature; and therefore whatever measures Reason does, or might, prescribe, when particular
occasions occur, the sentiment of what Men find pleasing or displeasing to them, however contrary
to those dictates of right Reason, is very apt to determine their choice. God yet who is the
Author of Order, and not of Confusion, has fram'd all things with Consistency, and Harmony;
and however, in Fact, it too often happens that we are misled by that strong desire of happiness
implanted in us, yet does this no way necessarily interfere with our acting in an intire conformity
to the prescriptions of the Law of Reason; but the contrary: For from hence it is that this
Law has its Sanction, viz. That, duly considering it, we shall evidently find our happiness,
and misery, are annex'd to the observance, or neglect, of that unalterable Rule of Rectitude,
discoverable to us by the Nature of Things; so that this Rule of Rectitude, or Eternal Will
of God, has also the force of a Law given to it by that inseparable accord that there is betwixt
our happiness or misery, with our obedience, or disobedience, hereunto. Thus our duty and happiness,
can never be divided, but when we prefer a less happiness to a greater; and therein act not
conformably to the dictates of our natural desire of happiness, or pleasure; which two Terms
differ only in this, that we apply the Term Pleasure to any agreeable Sentiment, or Sensation,
how small, or short soever in its duration; but that of Happiness, only to such degrees of
pleasure, as do, in some considerable degree, out-ballance our Evils.

That we are many ways capable of receiving pleasure, we experimentally find; every sense furnishes
something to delight, and please us, in its Application to Objects suited to a grateful exercise
thereof. And the operations of our own Minds upon the Ideas presented to them by our Senses,
afford us also other pleasures, oftentimes preferable by us to those that we receive immediately
from Sense. But be our pleasures excited how they will; or whatsoever they consist in, Those
that Men receive from the Gratification of antecedent desire, are the pleasures that they have
the strongest relish of. A Good not desir'd, making (comparatively) but a small Impression upon us.

Now the Gratification of their desires is not always in Men's Power, but oftentimes it is so.
It is then often in their choice to procure to themselves pleasure, or not. Whence it is reasonable
for them to inquire, since happiness consists in pleasure; and the Gratification of their Desires,
and Appetites, always gives them pleasure; whether, or no, to Gratifie These should not therefore
always be that which should determine their actions in pursuance of this their chief End?

That happiness consisting in pleasure, we are so much the happier as we enjoy more pleasure,
must unquestionably, be found true; but that the Gratification of Men's Desires and Appetites
cannot therefore be that which should always, as they are rational Agents, determine, or regulate
their actions in pursuit of happiness, is no less evident; in that we perceive our selves,
and the Things to which we have relation, to be so fram'd, and constituted, in respect one
of another, that the Gratification of our present Desires and Appetites, does sometimes for
a short, or small pleasure, procure to us a greater, and more durable Pain: and that on the
contrary, the denial, or restraint of our present Desires, and Appetites, does sometimes for
a short, or small Pain, procure to us a greater, or more durable Pleasure. Since then that
we should act contrary to our own end therein, and prefer less pleasure to greater, it is apparent
that the Gratification of our present Appetites cannot be that which always, as we are rational
Agents, proposing to our selves happiness for our chief end, should determine, or regulate
our voluntary actions; present Appetite telling us only what will give us present pleasure;
not what will, in the whole, procure to us the most pleasure. What else then appears to be
the Rule, or Measure of Men's actions acting purely with respect to the pursuit of happiness
as their chief End, but the determinations of that Faculty in them which, in reference to the
different properties and relations discernable in Things, can alone be the Judge what will,
in the whole, procure to them the most pleasure? And thus the very desire of happiness, or
love of pleasure, rightly pursu'd, does oblige us to make the determinations or dictates of
Reason, and not the suggestions of present Appetite, the Measure, and Rule of our actions in
our pursuit after happiness. Which that we might possess was no doubt the end of our Creator
in giving us Being; since he could not stand in need of, or be better'd by our Existence. And
if that we might be happy was the end for which God made us, it is most certain that he has
neither set any such measures to our Actions, or put any such unhappy Biass upon our Minds,
as shall necessarily contradict this his end. Whence it again appears that the love of Pleasure
implanted in us (if we faithfully pursue it in prefering always that which will, on the whole,
procure to us the most pleasure) can never mislead us from the observance of the Law of Reason:
And that this Law enjoyns only a right regulation of our natural desire of pleasure, to the
end of our obtaining the greatest happiness that we are capable of: so that there is an inseparable
connection, or relation of Moral Good and Evil, with our Natural Good, and Evil. To assert
therefore that our chief Good does consist in pleasure, is far from drawing after it any such
consequence as many have pretended it does, in prejudice to the Law of Reason, that Natural
Revelation of Gods Will to us; since no Man can upon due consideration thereof Judge, That
the Gratification of his present Appetites ought to be to him the Measure or Rule of his Actions
in consequence of Pleasures being his chief Good: experience it self, we see, contradicting
such a consequence: and that so evidently that I think we do not in fact find that even Those,
who the most indulge to their Passions and Appetites, do so as believing upon a cool examination
thereof, that to do thus is the truest Wisdom, in consequence of our greatest Good consisting
in pleasure; but such Men indulge to their present Appetites meerly as being strongly induc'd
(contrary oftentimes to the suggestions of their own minds therein) thro' the love of pleasure,
and abhorrence of pain, to do, or forbear whatever they find will procure to them the one,
or free them from the other at the present Time; the Gratification whereof They prefer to that
which is Future. It is however true that such declamations as are sometimes made against pleasure
absolutely (not the irregular pursuit of it) as if pleasure was in its own Nature, a false,
and deceitful, not a real and solid Good, have produc'd this ill effect, that many from the
absurdity hereof are confirm'd in an evil indulgence of their Appetites, as if to Gratifie
These was indeed the truest Wisdom of a rational Creature, in consequence of pleasure, being
his chief Good. But they judge not thus from a due examination, or any examination at all of
the nature of Things, but from a Reason (if it may be call'd so) of opposition. For so ridiculously
weak are a great part of Men in their Reasoning, that seeing they are in the wrong who oppose
them, they become from thence as much perswaded, and as well satisfy'd that the contrary to
such Mens Assertions is true; or that themselves are in the right, as if they saw that these
things really were so. This arguing yet is no more irrational than that whereby a palpable
Truth is deny'd, only because some have indeavour'd to draw, or have been thought to have drawn
ill consequences from it: Which is yet all the ground of not allowing that Pleasure, and Pain,
are truly Good, and Evil; the denying of which, can be of no Service to Morality, but the contrary,
since Moral Good, and Evil, consider'd antecedently to any positive Law of our Maker, are apt
to be thought but a Notion where that inseparable Relation is overlook'd which there is between
actions denominated by us vertuous, or vicious, and the Natural Good, and Evil of Mankind.

Christians, perhaps, need not the confederation of this to inforce their obedience to the Will
of their Maker; but as it is a great recommendation of the Precepts of the Gospel to find that
they have an exact correspondence with, and conformity to the Nature of Things: So also those
who are not influenc'd by, as not being yet thorowly perswaded of this Divine Revelation, will
sooner be induced to imbrace Vertue, and contemn the allurements of Vice, when they see These
to have the very same reality, in Nature as their Happiness and Misery have; than when (tho'
ever so pompously set out) Vertue appears founded only upon nice, or subtle Speculations. But
some Men there are so far from approving of any Notion or Theorem being advanc'd with respect
to Deists whereby, as such, they may be induc'd to the love of Vertue (which is the best predisposition
to the entertainment of Christianity) that they are ready to treat as not being themselves
Christians if not as Atheists, any one who in the view of gaining thus much upon these Men
assert Vertue by any other Arguments than such as they will not admit of, viz. those drawn
from Revelation.

However true yet it is that happiness, or our chief Good, does consist in pleasure; it is no
less true that the irregular Love of pleasure is a perpetual source to us of Folly, and Misery.
That we are liable to the which irregularity, is but a necessary result of our Creaturely imperfection:
for we cannot love pleasure, and not love present pleasure: and the love of present pleasure
it is which misleads our narrow, and unattentive Minds from a just comparison of the present,
with what is future. Nor is it a wonder if we are oftentimes thus mislead; since we frequently
wander from the right way with less excuse for doing so: Men, not seldom, going astray from
Reason, when the love of present pleasure is so far from misguiding their variously frail Natures,
that its allurements will not retain them in the paths of Vertue; and tho' Reason only has
Authority to set Bounds to their desires, they subject both Them, and Her to an Unjust and
Arbitrary Dominion, equally Foreign to both: A thing manifest, not only in instances here and
there, but in the examples of whole Nations; who either by positive institution, or allow'd
of Custom, have transgressed against the plainest prescriptions of Reason, in things so far
from gratifying their Appetites, as that they are contrary, and even sometimes grievous to
Mens natural desires. To account for which, will not here be impertinent; nor (in order to
the doing so) to consider first what the Terms Vertue and Religion have, in their vulgar acceptation,
every where generally stood for.

Religion has, I think, been rightly defin'd to be the knowledge how to please God, and thus
taken, does necessarily include vertue, that is to say, Moral Rectitude; but as Men have usually
apply'd these Terms Vertue and Religion, they stand for things very different and distinct,
one from another. For by a Vertuous Man, in all Countries of the World, or less Societies of
Men, is commonly meant, by those who so call any one, such a Man as steadily adheres to that
Rule of his Actions which is establish'd for a Rule in his Country Tribe, or Society, be that
what it will. Hence it has been that Vertue has in different Times and Places chang'd Face;
and sometimes so far, as that what has been esteem'd Vertuous in one Age, and in one Country,
has been look'd upon as quite the contrary in others: tho' in all Times and Places, wherein
Men have not degenerated into a downright Brutish, or altogether Animal Life (as some whole
Nations have done) but have set any Rules, or Measures to their Actions, the dictates of right
Reason have more, or less, taken Place with them, so far as the manifest advantages, or rather
necessity thereof to the subsistence or convenience of Society, has directed Men. And so much
as Custom, or the Injunctions of some Lawgiver inforc'd these dictates of Reason, or Nature,
so far and no further, did obedience thereunto denominate Men Vertuous; without any distinction
made in reference to these prescriptions, as being Precepts of the Eternal Law of Right, or
as obligatory any other ways than as being part of the Law, or Fashion of that Country, or
Society, wherein these Rules had prevail'd or were establish'd. A firm and steady adherence
to which, whether conformable, or not, to the Law of Reason, being alike that which ever intitled
Men to be esteem'd Vertuous among those who profess'd to live by the same Rule.

Now since Man is a Creature that has variable, and disagreeing Inclinations, as having passions
very changeable, and oftentimes contradictory one to another, there is not any fix'd Rule,
or Measure, whatsoever that can possibly be set to his Actions, which can constantly be adher'd
to by him, without some difficulty, or uneasiness; because any steady, and unalterable Rule
must necessarily oftentimes, thwart and cross his changeable Appetites, and differing Inclinations;
even altho' that Rule was contriv'd, and intended ever so much, to be indulgent to the Passions,
and Desires of Humane Nature in general.

Conformity therefore of Mens actions to any fix'd, and unvariable Rule, is a thing of some
difficulty, be the Rule what it will: And therefore Transgression against that Rule which Men
profess'd themselves oblig'd to act by, has always, every where been; and but few Men comparatively,
were strictly Vertuous: That is, did in all things conform, or sincerely endeavour to conform
their Actions to that, which they acknowledged for the Rule of them.

Those yet who believ'd a Superior Invisible Power that made them, could not be satisfy'd with
themselves in Transgressing against that which they thought ought to be their Rule: For however
they understood this Rule to be deriv'd, they yet believ'd it carry'd with it, some way or
other, an obligation upon them to Obedience; since otherwise they would not have look'd upon
it as a Rule. Now, as they could not know that God would not punish their Disobedience to That
which they look'd upon as obliging them to Obedience; but, on the contrary, had more, or less,
Reason to apprehend that he would do so, They therefore (thinking him to be an exorable as
well as an Omniscient, and Omnipotent Being) were hereby on These occasions taught to deprecate
his Vengeance, and implore his Mercy: And hence the more Guilty and Fearful came to invent
Attonements, Expiations, Penances and Purgations, with all that various Train of Ceremonies
which attended those Things; Naturally imagining that the Divine Nature resembled their own;
and thence believing that they should the more easily appease his Anger, and avert the effects
of his Wrath, if by such means, as these, they did, as it were, in Gods behalf Revenge upon
themselves their Disobedience to him. And as the Solemnity of these Matters requir'd peculiar
Hands to Execute them; and Devotion exacted that such should be liberally rewarded, and highly
respected for their Pious performances; from hence the profit which some reap'd by these things,
as well as the satisfaction that others found therein, who were unwilling to be rigorously
restrain'd by the Rule of their Actions, yet were uneasie under the reproaches of their Consciences
when they transgressed against it, made these Inventions, and the value set upon them, to be
daily improv'd; till Men at last have sought to be, and have effectually been perswaded that
they might render themselves acceptable to God without indeavouring sincerely to obey the Rule
by which they profess'd to believe they were oblig'd to live; and that even when they did think
that this was a Law giv'n them by God himself.

Now the great practicers, and promoters of the abovesaid things, are every where Those who
are generally esteem'd, and call'd Religious. Whence the Term Religion appears ordinarily to
have stood for nothing else, but some Expedient, or other, found out to satisfy Men that God
was satisfied with them, notwithstanding that their Consciences reproach'd them with want of
Conformity to the acknowledg'd Rule, or Law of their Actions.

Having premis'd thus much concerning the Notions Men vulgarly have had of Vertue and Religion,
let us now proceed to see how it has come to pass, That they have with Allowance, Approbation,
and oftentimes, with injunction of their Lawmakers and Governours, transgress'd against the
most visible Dictates of the Law of Nature, or Reason, in Things not favourable to their Natural
Passions and Appetites; but even, sometimes, contrary thereunto; as are denying themselves
the lawfullest Enjoyments of Life; Macerating their Bodies; Prostituting their Wives; and exposing
their Off-spring and Themselves to cruel Torments, and even Death it self. The cause of which
I think appears plainly to be; that Mankind having been generally convinc'd that there was
a Maker of themselves and of the World, who they concluded was as well able to take cognisance
of what they did, as to produce them into Being; and to whom they could not believe that all
the Actions of his Creatures were alike pleasing, or displeasing; they became fearful (as has
been said) of incurring his displeasure, whenever they did any thing which their Consciences
reproach'd them for: From the which Fear of a Superior invisible Power, inspecting their Actions,
they were early induc'd to hearken to, and follow such who profess'd themselves to have some
Knowledge Supernaturally reveal'd to them of God's Will. And we find, in the Histories of all
Nations, that the generality of Mankind were perswaded (contrary to the Sentiments of some
Modern Deists) That it was a thing very congruous to the Divine Being, that he should in this
way reveal to Men his pleasure concerning them; since the greatest part, every where, did with
little difficulty give Credit to such who had the confidence to affirm to them, that they were
sent by God to teach them what he required of them: the which being so, a submission of Mens
Reason to the dictates of suppos'd inspir'd Teachers must necessarily follow: and they from
thence become liable to be impos'd upon, all the ways that could serve the ends of such who
made use of this pretence to promote thereby any Interest of their own, or others.

And as there is scarce any Country can be nam'd where there has not been these pretences to
Revelation; so no Instance, I believe, can be found of any Institution or generally approv'd
of Practice, opposite to the obvious Dictates of Nature, or Reason, and not in Favour of Mens
Appetites, which does not appear, or on good ground may not be presumed to have been receiv'd
on this pretence of Supernatural Revelation; which has ever procur'd the firmest adherence
to any New Institution whatsoever; and was very sufficient to make the absurdest things be
swallow'd equally with the most reasonable; it being undeniably true, that whatever God does
Command, his Creatures are under an equal Obligation of Obedience thereunto.

Some Men, it is likely, there have, in all Ages and Places, been, who were too Sagacious to
admit of that as Revelation from God, which manifestly oppos'd Natural Light; and who needed
a proof of the Divine Mission of such pretenders as these. But the unthinking Multitude were
ever Credulous; and thence have been always practic'd upon in various kinds, and measures,
as has best suited the occasion: Those who have had vicious Inclinations, or little Aims, and
short views, having impos'd upon them suitably to their Ends: And such as have had larger comprehensions,
generous designs, and Minds above Vulgar, Base and Sordid Passions, having answerably to their
Aims, serv'd themselves of the same credulity. Of the last kind were such who have propos'd
the reclaiming of Men from vices more obviously prejudicial to Society, and civil Government;
thereby to erect or restore some flourishing Kingdom, or common-wealth; And these, tho' they
have deceived Men, in making them believe that their Laws were Divinely inspir'd, have yet
deservedly been Honour'd by them as Benefactors, because of that happiness which they procur'd
to them thereby, in this World; beyond which, their views extended not, as having no knowledge
of a future Life. The which sort of Men, however rational, and Vertuous they were, yet (like
other pretenders to Revelation) that they might the better procure Authority to their Dictates,
did with their civil Institutions, mix Holy Mysteries; and that usually as peculiar Secrets
taught them by some Divinity. They also, how much soever they, perhaps, secretly contemn'd
such things, did yet generally pay a great outward regard to matters of Religion; which have
ever abounded in the best Govern'd, and most Flourishing Kingdoms, and Common-wealths.

Now (as has been already said) the exact observers of the civil Institutions of their Country,
or Customs of their Ancestors, were look'd upon as Men of Vertue; and whoso apply'd himself
eminently to the observation of such superstitions as consisted of Sacrifices, Processions,
Lustrations, &c. with a various Train of Pompous Ceremonies, diversify'd according to the Phancies
of their Authors, was look'd upon as a Religious Man; whilst there was a third sort of Men
(inconsiderable always in their Number) who judged, by the true rule of Reason, what was right,
and what was wrong, in the first of these; and who contemning the Fopperies of the last, were
oftentimes (thro' their means who most found their Account in those Matters) in danger of passing
with the silly People for Atheists: such as search for their opinions, and the Measures of
their Actions in the Reason and Truth of Things, having always been very unacceptable to Those
whose Interest it has been to keep up the Credit and Authority of vain Traditions and Superstitious
Practices; because if These should be hearken'd to, Those Apprehended that they should become
useless.

Men of this third sort are They who are vertuous in a Rational and Christian estimation; for
if adherence to the Rule of Mens Actions (be that what it will) denominates Men vertuous among
those of their own perswasion therein; then That which denominates a Man vertuous amongst Those
who take the prescriptions of right Reason, or of the Gospel (for these are but one, and the
same, differently promulg'd) for the Rule of their Actions, must be an adherence to the Law
of right Reason, or of this Revelation: Which Rule, is not (as all others are) a changeable,
because (as we have seen) no Arbitrary thing; it being founded in Relations, and Connexions,
which are as immutable as that determinate constitution in Things, which makes every thing
what it is. From whence it has been that such Men in all Ages, and Places, as were above the
prejudices of their Country Religion, and Manners, viz. such as we have now spoken of, have
ever had much the same Sentiments in respect of Vertue. But these have always been but a small
Number: Custom, and blind Opinion, have ever govern'd the World; and the light of Reason has
neither appear'd to Men to be, nor in Fact been any where sufficient to direct the generality
of Mankind to Truth; as some imagine it capable of doing; who because of that clear Evidence
which Reason gives to those verities that Revelation has already taught them, think that they
owe, or might have ow'd to this light of Reason what they are not indebted to it for; and what
it is a Thousand to One odds they would not have receiv'd from it, had they been Born where
there was no other than Natural Light.

For we find not any Country in any Age of the World, wherein Men did generally acknowledge,
by the meer force of Reason, Natural Religion in its full extent; or where the Law of Nature
was by the Light of Nature universally own'd. Some Dictates of it as suggested by necessity,
or convenience, having only been receiv'd, (as has been already said) but not distinguish'd
from the most Arbitrary Institutions of Men; altho' it is probable that the greater Conformity
any Law had to the dictates of right Reason, it did the more universally and easily obtain
Belief of its being divinely reveal'd to him who pretended so to have receiv'd it; and this
apparently it was which gave so great Success to the Peruvian Lawgivers; whose Idolatry was
the most specious that was possible; and whose Rules of Living (pretended to have been receiv'd
by them from the Sun, their Father, and Vicegerent of Pachacama, the Supream Invisible and
Unapproachable God) were highly suitable to the dictates of right Reason.

This Law nevertheless not being receiv'd by that People but as a Supernatural Revelation, the
great Morality of the Peruvians affords no Argument against, but (on the contrary) proves strongly
the need of Revelation; since whatever Force of Reason these Natural Truths did appear to this
People to carry with them, when represented as divine Commands, this light had never yet attracted
their sight purely by its own Brightness; nor ever has any where done so, but here and there
in a few Instances of Persons of more than ordinarily inquisitive Minds; and (probably) for
the most part, exempted by a happy priviledge of Nature from the servitude of sensual, and
sordid Passions.

And tho' nothing can be more evident to those who reflect thereupon, than that Mens Actions
should be regulated, and directed by that Faculty in them which shows them the different properties,
relations, and dependencies of things, and not by their Appetite, which only can tell what
will at the present please, or offend them; not what will, upon the whole, procure to them
the most pleasure, or uneasiness; yet such appears to be the unreflecting Nature of the generality
of Mankind, and such their fondness of present pleasure, as either not to consider this Truth,
or when they do so, to be induc'd (in consequence thereof) to obey the most manifest dictates
of Reason, or Natural Light, which will lay any restraint upon their pleasing, and, oftentimes,
violent Inclinations: Much less will they be at pains to search for any such Measures of their
Actions in the Constitution and dependances of things; which is indeed what the far greater
part of Men have not the Capacity, or Leisure to do: Neither are Any able to do this so early
as to prevent their irregular Inclinations from being first strengthen'd and confirm'd by ill
habits: which when once they are, Reason does in vain oppose them, how clear soever her dictates
appear. On the contrary, our Passions grown strong, do usually so far corrupt our Reason as
to make her joyn parties with them against her self; we not only doing amiss, but likewise
finding Arguments to justify our so doing, even to our selves as well as others.

But there is still, beyond this, a farther impediment to Mens obeying the Law of Nature, by
vertue of the meer Light of Nature; which is, that they cannot, in all circumstances, without
Revelation, make always a just estimate in reference to their happiness. For, tho' it is demonstrable
that the Law of Reason is the Law of God, yet the want of an explicite knowledge of the penalty
incur'd by the breach of that Law, makes it not to be evident to all Men that the incuring
of this penalty shall (in all cases) make the preference of breaking this Law, an ill Bargain:
which it may, sometimes not be to many, in regard of the discernable natural consequences of
such a Transgression. For tho' observance of the Law of Reason is, in the constitution of Natural
Causes, visibly to those who consider it (generally speaking) the means of our greatest happiness,
even in this present World, yet if there be no future Life (which that there is, is made certain
to us, only by the Revelation thereof in the Gospel) to answer in for Transgression of this
Law; the breach of it may, tho' not naturally, yet accidentally, in some cases, conduce to
Mens greater happiness; and, very often, notwithstanding that to have obey'd the Law of Reason
they may discern would have been better for them than to have follow'd their Appetites, had
they been early so accustom'd, yet now that they have contracted different Habits, which are
like a Right Hand, or Eye to them, the difficulty of a new course of Life may appear too great
for the attempt of it to be adviseable; since the consideration of the shortness and uncertainty
of Life may make Men apt to say to themselves on such occasions,

     Who would lose the present Hour,
     For one that is not in his Power?
     Or not be happy now he may,
     But for a Future Blessing stay:
     Who know not he shall live a Day?

The Revelation of an Eternal Life after this, with an express Declaration of Everlasting Rewards
and Punishments annex'd to our Obedience, or Disobedience, to the Law of Nature (tho' such
a Future State may be reasonably infer'd from all things happening alike to the Good, and to
the Bad in this World, and from Men's Natural desire of Immortality) is yet but a necessary
inforcement of the Law of Nature to the far greatest part of Mankind, who stand in need of
this knowledge, and are uncapable of an Inference so repugnant to what their Senses daily tell
them in the case; and wherein the Truth asserted has scarcely ever procur'd an unwavering assent
from the most rational of the Heathen Philosophers themselves. Now the unquestionable certainty
of a Future State, wherein Men shall receive Everlasting Rewards, and Punishments, we alone
owe the knowledge of to Jesus Christ, who only has brought Life and Immortality to Light. The
willingest to believe the Souls Immortality were before our Saviours coming, at best, doubtful
concerning it; and the generality of Mankind, were yet far less perswaded of it.

Fables indeed concerning a life hereafter (wherein there were Rewards and Punishments) the
Greeks had; and from them, they were deriv'd to some other Nations; but that for Fables they
were taken is evident, and we are expressly told so by Diodorus Siculus, who applauding the
Honours done to Good Men at their Funerals, by the Egyptians, because of that warning and encouragement
which it gave to the Living to be mindful of their Duty, says, That the Greeks, as to what
concern'd the Rewards of the Just, and the Punishment of the Impious, had nothing among them
but invented Fables and Poetical Fictions which never wrought upon Men for the Amendment of
their Lives; but on the contrary, were despis'd and laugh'd at by them.

Whether, or no, Men should subsist after Death depending plainly upon the good Pleasure of
their Maker, the Pagan World (to whom God had not reveal'd his Will herein) could not possibly
have any certainty of a Life after this. Arguments there were (as has been said) that might
induce rational Men to hope for a future Existence as a thing probable; and they did so: But
the Gross of Mankind saw not the Force of these Reasonings to be perswaded thereby of a thing
so inconceivable by them as that the Life of the Person was not totally extinguish'd in the
Death of the Body; and a Resurrection to Life, was what they thought not of, the certainty
of which, together with future Reward and Punishment, by enabling us to make a right estimate
concerning what will most conduce to our happiness, plainly brings this great encouragement
to our Observance of the Law of God, that it lets us see our happiness, and our Duty, are inseparably
united therein; since whatever pleasure we voluntarily deprive our selves of in this World
from preference of Obedience to God's Commands, it shall be recompenced to us manifold in the
World that is to come: So that now we can find our selves in no Circumstance, wherein our Natural
Desires of Happiness, or love of Pleasure, can rationally induce us to depart from the Rule
of our Duty.

The little which has been said, do, methinks, sufficiently evince the need of Revelation both
to Teach and inforce Natural Religion: But the defectiveness of the Light of Nature to this
end, is a Verity of so great use to be establish'd, that the consideration thereof should not
be left upon such short Reflections as these; was not this Truth at large made out in a late
Treatise intitled, The reasonableness of Christianity as delivered in the Scriptures.

A work which the unhappy mistakes and disputes among us concerning the Christian Religion,
makes useful to all Men; and which has been peculiarly so to many, as the only Book wherein
they have found the insufficiency of Natural Light to Natural Religion, has been fully shewed,
although that to reconcile Men to, or establish them in the belief of Divine Revelation, nothing
was more requisite to make this appear, in an Age wherein the prevalency of Deism has been
so much and so justly complain'd of.

But against the insufficiency of Natural Light to the ends of Natural Religion, the World having
been so many Ages without it, is, by some, thought an Objection: For, if Supernatural Light
had been so needful as is pretended to be, how could it comport, say they, with the Wisdom
of God not to have given it to Men sooner and more universally?

To judge of all the Ends and Designs of the Divine Wisdom in the Creation or Government of
the World, is to suppose that we have a comprehension of God's Works, adequate or commensurate
thereunto; which is not only to conceive of his Wisdom as not being infinite, but even to circumscribe
it within very narrow bounds. If the Wisdom of God, (like his other Attributes) does infinitely
surpass our reach, his Views must, for that reason, be necessarily oftentimes, as much beyond
our short Sight. For us then, when we see not the reason why any thing is, to take upon us
to say that such a thing does, or does not comport with the Wisdom of God, must needs be the
highest Folly that can be, since it implies a presumption, that we see all in respect of such
a Subject that God sees: And the Objection here made turns only upon the unaccountableness
of the Divine Wisdom herein to our Understandings. For God's dealing thus with Men, can by
no means be said by us to imply any contradiction to his Wisdom. Whilst we having an assurance
highly Rational (from those numberless Worlds which surround us) that we are but a small part
of the Intellectual Creation of our Maker; and being certain that our abode here bears but
a very inconsiderable proportion of Time to millions of Ages, and is as nothing to Eternity,
cannot tell but that to know much more than we do, in this State, of the intire Scheme of Providence
with respect to the whole extent of intelligent Beings, may be necessary to our seeing the
Beauty of anyone part of the design of our Creator. And it is the most suitable to the All-comprehensive
Wisdom of God for us to conceive, that without having this knowledge, we may be far less able
to judge of the Divine oeconomy, in reference to his Dealings with us here, than he who should
see but one Scene of a Dramma, would thereby be capacitated to judge of the Plot or Design
of the whole. In Objecting therefore against the need of Revelation to support Natural Religion,
because that we understand not why, if Revelation was necessary to this end, the World had
it no sooner: Men are guilty of so great an Absurdity as to argue from a Matter only unknown
to them against the reality of that evidently is: Which is always irrational to do; but is
especially so, when, if we cannot answer what is Objected, we yet see plainly that That Objection
may be very answerable, and accountable for, even to our Conceptions; were but our views a
little more enlarged, and such as, perhaps, they shall be hereafter.

But in urging this consideration as sufficient to silence any Objection to the needfulness
of Revelation from its lateness and want of Universality; I suppose not that the Divine, oeconomy
is herein actually incomprehensible by Men; or at least, may not be accounted for, if not demonstratively
aright, yet suitably to the Divine Attributes: and a due reflection upon the intire design
of Christianity, so far as it is reveal'd to us, will, it is likely, conduct us best to a sight
hereof. But our present business is not this inquiry, but to see what those advantages are
which we receive by the Revelation of Jesus Christ, the design of whole coming into the World
appears to have been, to inforce the Rule of Rectitude, by setting it in a clearer Light, with
the manifest Attestation of Divine Authority, and promulging it as the Law of God, by Declaration
of eternal Rewards and Punishments, annexed to the observance or breach thereof.

Yet to deliver clearer and more excellent Precepts of Morality; to attest to the Divinity hereof
by Miracles; or to bring Immortalitie to light, were not (as the means of inforcing Natural
Religion) the whole business for which Christ took our Nature upon him. It was a Decree as
immutable as the Divine Nature, that no unrighteous thing should have everlasting Life: Wherefore
all, both Jews and Gentiles having broken the Law, and being thereby condemn'd (since the Law
necessarily requir'd perfect Righteousness, and could admit of no abatement thereof) Christ
came to establish betwixt God and Man, a Covenant of Grace in order to Mens obtaining eternal
Life, which they could not obtain by the Works of the Law. The which Covenant of Grace was,
that to as many as believe in his Son, taking him for their King, and submitting to his Law,
God would grant remission of their Sins; and that this their Faith should be imputed to them
for Righteousness; that is, accepted of by him, in lieu of perfect Obedience, in all such who
sincerely indeavour'd to live up to the Precepts of Christ, their Lord.

Men have ever been solicitous, to reconcile Pardon of Sin to the Purity of God's Nature, which
has expos'd them (as we have seen) to divers Delusions, and to wearisome and costly Superstitions;
even sometimes to the giving the Fruit of their Bodies to attone for the sins of their Souls.
All the Forms of Pagan Religion have abounded with Institutions of this Nature; and that of
the Jews consisted very much of tiresome and unpleasant performances; which being Types and
Shadows of him that was to come, were practis'd to the same purpose. All which things we are
freed from by the Gospel; Christ having offer'd up himself once for all, through whom forgiveness
of Sin is preached to as many as believe in him, truly repenting of their past Sins, and walking
in newness of Life, conformably to the Law of him their Master; but and if, thro' humane Weakness
or Imbecillity, we do Sin, he is our Advocate with the Father, who for the sake of him his
Beloved Son, will justify, or accept as Righteous, those who truly believe in him, whence we
are justify'd by God's free Grace or Favour, and not by the Works of the Law, against which
all have transgressed, and fail'd of a perfect Obedience.

The great end then of Christianity is (in short) to teach us effectually to renounce all Ungodliness
and every evil work, by declaring to us, that if we sincerely repent of our Sins past, and
indeavour, for the time to come, to obey the Law of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, which
is no other than the Law of Reason, or the eternal Rule of Right, we need not despair of God's
Mercy from the Imperfection of our Obedience; since he will for the sake of his Son, pardon
their Sins who believe in him: Sincere indeavours after perfect Righteousness being accepted
in those who believe in Christ as if they attained it, which is call'd, the Righteousness of
Faith. And thus our Blessed Lord, that he might purchase to himself a peculiar people zealous
of good Works, has propos'd to his Followers the strongest Motives and Encouragements that
are conceivable to induce free Agents to Obedience, putting them at once upon using their utmost
Diligence to fullfil the Law; yet, at the same time, delivering them from the fear that their
defective Righteousness should render their Labour vain in the Lord, by assuring them that
he will be merciful to their Sins.

The which Christian Doctrine concerning the forgiveness of Sins (contrary to that of other
Religions) effectually obliges Men to use their utmost care not to commit Sin, and leaves no
room for the Lusts of their Hearts, or devices of cunning Men to deceive them by any Superstitious
Inventions of expiating or attoning for Transgression; whereby Vertue (as we have seen) was
always undermin'd. For, tho' in the Christian Religion, there is an abatement of the rigour
and severity of the Law, which could not but require an unsinning Obedience; yet we are therein
taught, that Jesus Christ is the only Attonement for Sin: And such a Faith in him as makes
us to become his obedient Subjects, is the only means to us of Salvation: An inforcement of
the Law of Righteousness which was wanting to the Pagan World; whose persuasion of the placability
of the Divine Nature (as we have seen) generally taught them, only to find out such imaginary
ways of appeasing God's Anger, and expiating for their Sins, as did more or less supersede
their indeavours after Obedience to the Law.

Whence it appears that the assurance of future Existence, with the knowledge of eternal Rewards
and Punishments annex'd to Mens Observance, or not observance of the Law of Reason had Men
had it, without the Revelation of the Gospel, would not have been so universal or powerful
an inforcement of Obedience to them as it is to us; to whom together with this, is preach'd
also the Doctrine of forgiveness of Sins, through Faith in Jesus Christ. For the consciousness
of transgression against this Law, which, under such a Penalty exacted their Obedience, must
either have driven Men into despair of being accepted by God, whence they would have given
over the indeavours of obeying him as a fruitless Labour; or else if they believ'd that God
would accept of some Compensation for their defective Righteousness, they would have been induc'd
no less, but even more strongly from their knowledge of a future Life, than they were without
it, to seek to attone the Divine Wrath by such ways as would inevitably draw on a neglect of
conformity to his Law. Whereas Christianity doth provide against both these Mistakes, in that
it assures us that God will accept of our imperfect Obedience for the sake of his Son, if we
believe in him, and withal sincerely indeavour to obey him; whereby Faith does plainly not
make void, but establish the Law, it laying the highest Obligation as well as Encouragement
that is possible upon Men to do their utmost to live up to the Prescriptions of it.

And thus the Christian Religion, we find, is every way admirably adapted by the Divine Wisdom,
to the end of inforcing the eternal Law of Reason or Nature; which evidently needed this inforcement. Attached
to the Wyandot reserve (nine miles by sixteen) is that of the Delawares (three miles square). On reaching
Little Sandusky--Kahama's curse on the town baptizers of America!--there are often five or
six places named alike in one state: upper and lower, little and big, great and small--and
invariably the same names that are given to towns in one State, are to be found in every other.
Then their vile plagiarisms of European names causes a Babelonish confusion of ideas, enough to
disturb the equanimity of a "grisly saint;" and, with all humility, I disclaim having any pretensions
to that character. I have frequently heard a long-legged, sallow-looking backwoodsman talk of
having come lately from Paris, or Mecca, when instead of meaning the capital of La grande nation,
or the city of "the holy prophet," he spoke of some town containing a few hundred inhabitants,
situated in the backwoods of Kentucky, or amidst the gloomy forests
of Indiana.

The Americans too speak in prospective, when they talk of great places; no doubt "calculating"
that, one day, all the mighty productions of the old world will be surpassed by their ingenuity
and perseverance.

I reached Little Sandusky about one o'clock in the day, and there learned that there was a treaty
being holden with the Delawares--accordingly I repaired to the council ground. On a mat, under
the shade of seven large elm trees, which in more prosperous times
had waved over the war-like ancestors of this unfortunate people,
were seated three old sachems, the principal of the tribe.

The oldest appeared to be nearly eighty years of age, the next about seventy, and the last
about fifty.

On a chair to the right of the Indians was seated a young "half-breed" chief, the son of one
of the sachems by a white squaw; and on their left, seated on another chair, a Delaware dressed
in the costume of the whites. This young man was in the pay of the States, and acted as interpreter--he
interpreting into and from the Delaware language, and a gentleman of the mission (a Captain Walker)
into and from the Wyandot. At a table opposite the Indians were seated the commissioners.

The Lenni Lenapé, or Delawares, as they were called by the English, from the circumstance of
their holding their great "Council-fire" on the banks of the Delaware river, were once the most
powerful of the several tribes that spoke the Delaware tongue, and possessed an immense tract
of country east of the Alleghany mountains. This unfortunate people had been driven from place
to place, until at last they were obliged to accept of an asylum from the Wyandot, whom they
call their uncle; and now are forced to sell this, and go beyond the Mississippi. To a reflecting
mind, the scene was touching beyond description.

Here was the sad remnant of a great nation, who having been forced back from the original country of
their fathers, by successive acts of rapacity, are now compelled to enter into a compact which
obliges them, half civilized as they are, to return to the forest. The case is this,--the white
people, or rather Jackson and the southerns, say, that the Indians "retard improvement"--precisely
in the same sense that a brigand, when he robs a traveller, might say, that the traveller
retarded improvement--that is, retarded his improvement, inasmuch as he had in his pocket,
what would improve the condition of the brigand. The Indians have cultivated farms, and valuable
tracts of land, and no doubt it will improve the condition of the whites, to get possession of
those farms and rich lands, for one tenth of their saleable value. The profits that have accrued
to the United States from the systematic plunder of the Indians,
are immense, and a great portion of the national debt has been liquidated
by this dishonest means.[2]

The reserve of the Delawares contained
nine square miles, or 5760 acres.

For this it was agreed at the treaty, that they should be paid 6000 dollars, and the value of
the improvements, which I conceived to be a fair bargain. I was not then aware of the practice pursued
by the government, of making deductions, under various pretences, from the purchase-money, until
the unfortunate Indian is left scarcely anything in lieu of his lands, and says, that "the
justice of the white man is not like the justice of the red man,"
and that he cannot understand the honesty of his Christian brother.

The following extract, taken from the New York American, will give some insight into the mode
of dealing with the Indians.

"The last of the Ottowas.--Maumee Bay, Ohio, Sept. 3, 1831.--Mr. James B. Gardiner has concluded
a very important treaty at Maumee Bay, in Michigan, for a cession of all the lands owned by
the Ottowa Indians in Ohio, about 50,000 acres. It was attended with more labour and greater
difficulties than any other treaty made in this state: it was the last foothold which that savage,
warlike, and hostile tribe held in their ancient dominion. The conditions of this treaty are
very similar to those treaties of Lewistown and Wapaghkenetta, with
this exception, that the surplus avails of their lands, after deducting
seventy cents per acre to indemnify the government, are to be appropriated
for paying the debts of their nation, which amount to about 20,000
dollars."

[Query, what are those debts?--could they be the amount of presents made them on former occasions?]
"The balance, if any, accrues to the tribe. Seventy thousand acres of land are granted to them
west of the Mississippi.[3] The Ottowas are the most depredating, drunken, and ferocious in
Ohio. The reservations ceded by them are very valuable, and those on the Miami of the lake
embrace some of the best mill privileges in the State."

The Delawares were too few (being but fifty-one in number) to contend the matter, and therefore
accepted of the proposed terms. At the conclusion of the conference, the Commissioners told
them that they should have a barrel of flour, with the beef that had been killed for the occasion,
which was received with "Yo-ha!--Yo-ha!" They then said, laughing, "that they hoped their father
would allow them a little milk," meaning whisky, which was accordingly granted. They drank of
this modern Lethé and forgot for a time their misfortunes.

On the Osage fork of the Merrimack river, there are two settlements of the Delawares, to the neighbourhood
of which these Indians intend to remove.

Near the Delaware reserve, I fell in with a young Indian, apparently about twenty years of
age, and we journeyed together for several miles through the forest. He spoke English fluently,
and conformed as far as his taste would permit him, to the habits of the whites. His dress
consisted of a blue frock coat, blue cloth leggings, moccasins, a shawl tied about the head,
and a red sash round his waste. In conversation, I asked him if he were not a Cayuga--: "No,"
says he, "an Oneida," placing both his hands on his breast--"a clear Oneida." I could not help
smiling at his national pride;--yet this is man: in every country and condition he is proud
of his descent, and loves the race to which he belongs. This Oneida was a widow's son. He had sixteen
acres of cleared land, which, with occasional assistance, he cultivated himself. When the produce
was sold, he divided the proceeds with his mother, and then set out, and travelled until his
funds were exhausted. He had just then returned from a tour to New York and Philadelphia,
and had visited almost every city in the Union. As Guedeldk--that was the Oneida's name--and I
were rambling along, we met a negro who was journeying in great haste--he stopped to inquire if
we had seen that day, or the day previous, any nigger-woman going
towards the lake.

I had passed the day before two waggon loads of negros, which were being transported, by the state,
to Canada. A local law prohibits the settlement of people of colour within the state of Ohio, which was
now put in force, although it had remained dormant for many years.

There was much hardship in the case of this poor fellow. He had left his family at Cincinnati,
and had gone to work on the canal some eighteen or twenty miles distant. He had been absent about
a week; and on his return he found his house empty, and was informed that his wife and children
had been seized, and transported to Canada. The enforcement of this law has been since abandoned;
and I must say, although the law itself is at variance with the Constitution
of the United States, which is paramount to all other laws, that its
abandonment is due entirely to the good feeling of the people of Ohio,
who exclaimed loudly against the cruelty of the measure.

general interests, and national affairs, were conducted and superintended by a great council, assembled
annually in Onondaga, the central canton, composed of the chiefs of each republic; and eighty
sachems were frequently convened at this national assembly. It took cognizance of the great questions
of war and peace; of the affairs of the tributary nations, and their negotiations with the
French and English colonies. All their proceedings were conducted with great deliberation,
and were distinguished for order, decorum, and solemnity. In eloquence, in dignity, and in
all the characteristics of profound policy, they surpassed the assembly of feudal barons,

CHAPTER III.

From Little Sandusky, I passed through Marion, in Marion county. This town, like most others
in Ohio, is advancing rapidly, and has at present several good brick buildings. The clap-boarded
frame houses, which compose the great mass of habitations in the towns throughout the western
country, in general have a neat appearance. I here saw gazetted three divorces, all of which had
been granted on the applications of the wives. One, on the ground of the husband's absenting
himself for one year: another, on account of a blow having been given: and the third for general
neglect. There are few instances of a woman's being refused a divorce in the western country,
as dislike is very generally--and very rationally--supposed to constitute a sufficient reason
for granting the ladies their freedom.

I crossed Delaware county into Franklin county, where Columbus, the capital of the state, is situated.
The roads from the lake to this city, with few exceptions, passed
through woodlands, and the country is but thinly settled.

Beech, oak, elm, hickory, walnut, white-oak, ash, &c. compose the bulk of the forest trees;
and in the bottom lands, enormous sycamores are to be seen stretching their white arms almost
to the very clouds. The land is of various denominations, but in general may be termed fertile.

Columbus, the capital of Ohio, is seated on the Scioto river, which is navigable for keel and flat
boats, and small craft, almost to its source; and by means of a portage of about four miles,
to Sandusky river, which flows into lake Erie, a convenient communication is established between
the lakes, and the great western waters. The town is well laid out. The streets are wide; and the
court-house, town-hall, and public offices, are built of brick. There are some good taverns here,
and the tables d'hôtes are well and abundantly supplied.

There are land offices in every county seat, in which maps and plans of the county are kept.
On these, the disposable tracts of country are distinguished from those which have been disposed
of. The purchaser pays one fourth of the purchase money, for which he gets a receipt,--this
constitutes his title, until, on paying the residue, he receives a regular title deed. He may
however pay the full amount at once, and receive a discount of, I believe, eight per cent.
A township comprises thirty-six square miles (twenty three thousand and forty acres) in sections
of six hundred and forty acres each, which are subdivided, to accommodate purchasers, into quarter
sections, or lots of a hundred and sixty acres. The sixteenth section is not sold, but reserved
for the support of the poor, for education, and other public uses. There is no provision made
in this, or any other state, for the ministers of religion, which is found to be highly beneficial
to the interests of practical Christianity. The congress price of land has lately been reduced
from a dollar and a quarter per acre, to seventy-five cents.

Ohio averages 184 miles in extent, from north to south, and 220 miles from east to west. Area,
40,000 square miles, or 25,600,000 acres. The population in 1790, was 3000; in 1800, 45,365;
in 1810, 230,760; and in 1820, 581,434. White males, 300,609; white females, 275,955; free
people of colour, 4723; militia in 1821, 83,247. The last census, taken in 1830, makes the
population 937,679.

Having no more Indian reserves to visit, I took the stage, and rumbled over corduroys, republicans,
stumps, and ruts, until my ribs were literally sore, through London, Xenia, and Lebanon, to Cincinnati.

At
Lebanon there is a large community of the shaking Quakers. They have establishments also in
Mason county, and at Covington, in Kentucky: their tenets are strictly Scriptural. They contend,
that confessing their sins to one another, is necessary to a state of perfection; that the church
of Christ ought to have all things in common; that none of the members of this church ought
to cohabit, but be literally virgins; and that to dance and be merry is their duty, which part
of their doctrines they take from the thirty-first chapter of Jeremiah.

Their ceremonies are as follows:--The men sit on the left hand, squatting on the floor, with their
knees up, and their hands clasped round them. Opposite, in the same posture, sit the women, whose
appearance is most cadaverous and sepulchral, dressed in the Quaker costume. After sitting for
some time in this hatching position, they all rise and sing a canting sort of hymn, during which
the women keep time by elevating themselves on their toes.

After the singing has ceased, a discourse is delivered by one of the elders; which being ended, the men
pull off their coats and waistcoats. All being prepared, one of the brethren steps forward to
the centre of the room, and in a loud voice, gives out a tune, beating time with his foot, and singing
lal lal la, lal lal la, &c., being joined by the whole group, all jumping as high as possible,
clapping their hands, and at intervals twirling round,--but making rather ungraceful pirouettes:
this exercise they continue until they are completely exhausted. In their ceremonials they much
resemble the howling Dervishes of the Moslems, whom they far surpass in fanaticism.

Within about ten miles of Cincinnati we took up an old doctor, who was going to that city for the
purpose of procuring a warrant against one of his neighbours, who, he had reason to believe,
was concerned in the kidnapping of a free negro the night before. This is by no means an uncommon
occurrence in the free states bordering the great rivers. The unfortunate black man, when captured,
is hurried down to the river, thrust into a flat boat, and carried to the plantations. Such
negros are not exposed for sale in the public bazaars, as that would be attended with risk; but
a false bill of sale is made out, and the sale is effected to some planter before they reach Orleans.
There is, of course, always collusion between the buyer and seller, and the man is disposed
of, generally, for half his value.

These are certainly atrocious acts; yet when a British subject reads such passages as the following,
in the histories of East India government, he must feel that if they were ten times as infamous
and numerous as they are in reality, it becomes not him to censure them. Bolts, who was a judge
of the mayor's court of Calcutta, says, in his "Considerations on India Affairs," page 194,
"With every species of monopoly, therefore, every kind of oppression to manufacturers of all denominations
throughout the whole country has daily increased; insomuch that weavers, for daring to sell
their goods, and Dallals and Pykars, for having contributed to, or connived at, such sales, have
by the Company's agents, been frequently seized and imprisoned, confined in irons, fined considerable
sums of money, flogged, and deprived, in the most ignominious manner, of what they esteem most
valuable, their castes. Weavers also, upon their inability to perform such agreements as have
been forced from them by the Company's agents, universally known in Bengal by the name of Mutchulcahs,
have had their goods seized and sold on the spot, to make good the deficiency: and the winders
of raw silk, called Nagaards, have been treated also with such injustice, that instances have been
known of their cutting off their thumbs, to prevent their being forced to wind silk. This last
kind of workmen were pursued with such rigour, during Lord Clive's late government in Bengal, from
a zeal for increasing the Company's investment of raw silk, that the most sacred laws of society
were atrociously violated; for it was a common thing for the Company's scapoys to be sent by force of
arms to break open the houses of the Armenian merchants established at Sydabad (who have from time
immemorial been largely concerned in the silk trade), and forcibly take the Nagaards from their
work, and carry them away to the English factory."

As we approached Cincinnati the number of farms, and the extent of
cultivated country, indicated the comparative magnitude of that city.
Fields in this country have nothing like the rich appearance of those
in England and Ireland, being generally filled with half-rotten stumps,
scattered here and there among the growing corn, producing a most
disagreeable effect. Then, instead of the fragrant quickset hedge,
there is a "worm fence"--the rudest description of barrier known in
the country--which consists simply of bars, about eight or nine feet
in length, laid zig-zag on each other alternately: the improvement
on this, and the ne plus ultra in the idea of a west country farmer,
is what is termed a "post and rail fence." This denomination of fence
is to be seen sometimes in the vicinity of the larger towns, and is
constructed of posts six feet in length, sunk in the ground to the
depth of about a foot, and at eight or ten feet distance; the rails
are then laid into mortises cut into the posts, at intervals of about
thirteen or fourteen inches, which completes the work.

Cincinnati
is built on a bend of the Ohio river, which takes here a semicircular
form, and runs nearly west; it afterwards flows in a more southerly
direction. A complete chain of hills, sweeping from one point of the
bend round to the other, encloses the city in a sort of amphitheatre.
The houses are mostly brick, and the streets all paved. There are
several spacious and handsome market houses, which on market days
are stocked with all kinds of provisions--indeed I think the market
of Cincinnati is very nearly the best supplied in the United States.
There are many respectable public buildings here, such as a court-house,
theatre, bazaar, (built by Mrs. Trollope, but the speculation failed),
and divers churches, in which you may see well-dressed women, and
hear orthodox, heterodox, and every other species of doctrine, promulgated
and enforced by strength of lungs, and length of argument, with pulpit-drum
accompaniment, and all other requisites ad captandum vulgus. But there is also a farther ill influence which apparent
want of deference to Scripture Authority in those who pretend to believe (and, much more, to
teach the Gospel) has: And that is to the countenanceing too much that Multitude who preferring
the Christian Religion, do in their Practical that which these Men do in their Speculative
Opinions, viz. make the dictates of the Gospel their Rule so far only, as they are vouch'd
for and Authoriz'd by their Reason, infected, as it is, by Custom, Passion, or Worldly Interest;
which is done by very many who would be offended to have their belief of the Scriptures Question'd.
But however they profess to own them, none who act thus can be rationally thought to be sincerely
perswaded of their divine Authority, altho' it is possible that many such Men may have no intire
disbelief thereof neither; it being barely not assenting, which is the Natural Effect of Ignorance
in those who have good Sense enough to see that it is irrational, to be confidently assur'd
of what they have not sufficient Reason to be so assur'd of.

Now this want of a firm assent to the Divine Authority of the Scriptures in such as yet profess
to own them for the word of God, is unquestionably evident when such Men acquiesce not in the
Precepts of the Gospel, as the Rule of their Actions, any farther than they find those Precepts
to be Authoriz'd by the Testimony of their Reason: Of which manner of acting many very common
examples may be easily brought.

It is true that how much soever a Man is perswaded of the Authority of any Rule, a strong Passion,
or Apparent Interest may yet seduce him from the Obedience due to its prescriptions; but such
a Transgression being accompanied with Regret, or followed with Repentance, the Rule is still
as much acknowledg'd as if it were obey'd; and none, on the score of a contrary practice, are
chargeable with a disbelief thereof, but such who do, on a deliberate Choice and without Remorse,
transgress against it; which many professing to be Christians not only themselves do, but even
teach their Children the like: in which latter case it cannot be suppos'd that they are misled
by the strength of any prevailing Passion.

That we should forgive our Enemies and be patient under injuries (for instance) are, as plainly
as words can make them so, commanded in the Scriptures; yet how many are there professing to
believe that the Scriptures are the Word of God, who, as if no such Commands as these were
deliver'd by Christ, or his Disciples, do both Practice and Teach, the not putting up Affronts
unreveng'd; and this only because the Fashion of the Country has establish'd it, that a Gentleman
cannot do so with Honour? A Term which herein signifies nothing, but agreeably to certain measures
of acting that Men have Arbitrarily made for themselves, and which are not founded upon any
Principle of right Reason; however to be obey'd, it seems, by a Gentleman preferably to the
Commands of Christ. If there are Cases wherein from want of a due provision in Governments
against some sort of Injuries it may be thought that Men are excusable in asserting their own
Cause, yet thus much is at the least certain, That this Precept of Forgiveness could not be
transgress'd against, as it very frequently is, by Men professing to believe the Authority
of the Scriptures, if such were indeed fully perswaded that it was a divine Command which prohibited
the avenging of our selves.

But others there are (contrary to these Men) who would find it altogether condemnable for a
Man to hazard his own, and anothers Life in a Duel, or Rencounter (tho' caus'd by the Transport
of ever so just a provocation) who would see no Evil in his mispending of his Time, consuming
Day after Day, and Year after Year, uselesly to himself, or others, in a course of continual
Idleness and Sauntring; as if he was made only to Eat and to Drink, or to gratifie his Senses.
And how few Parents are there of Quality, even among such as are esteem'd the most vertuous,
who do not permit their Daughters to pass the best part of their Youth in that Ridiculous Circle
of Diversions, which is pretty generally thought the proper business of Young Ladies; and which
so ingrosses them that they can find no spare Hours, wherein to make any such improvements
of their understanding, as the leisure which they have for it exacts from them as rational
Creatures; or as is requisite or useful to the discharging well their present, or future Duties?

Some formal Devotions are (perhaps) necessary to some of These, to preserve them even in their
own good esteem; and they that can regularly find half an Hour, or an Hour in a Day to employ
in private upon this, and in reading some pious Book, together with, it may be, a certain Number
of Chapters in the Bible, need nothing more to make them be cry'd up for great examples to
the Age they live in; as if all this while there were no Precepts for these People in the Gospel,
concerning the improvement of their Time, and Talents, as things whereof they must one Day
be accountable. For others it may be they cannot but see that there are such Commands; but
the Sacred Law of Fashion has made endless Idle Visits, and less Innocent Entertainments, the
indispensibly constant Employment of those of their Condition: and when they are grown Old
in the perpetually repeated round of such Impertinence and Folly, they have but labour'd much
in their Calling.

Another Instance how little many, who profess to believe the Scriptures, do apparently look
upon them as the Rule of their Actions, we have in regard of the Precept not to Covet; which
is as much forbidden by the Law of God as not to Steal, or Cozen a Man of what is his property:
And yet the same Parents who have bred their Children in such a Sense of the Enormity of these
last Vices, as that they oftentimes seem to them like things that they are Naturally uncapable
of, are so far from teaching them to restrain their Exorbitant Desires, that very oft they
themselves with care inspire these into them: Whence it is sufficiently clear that the difference
made between Stealing and Cheating, or Coveting (alike forbidden by the Law of God) is from
hence, That Ambition is thought a Passion becoming some Ranks of Men, but Cheating or Stealing
not Vices proper for a Gentleman. A distinction that must needs refer to some other Rule than
that of the Gospel; which therefore is not That which, as a Divine Law, does prescribe to such
Men the Measures of their Actions.

To bring but one instance more of the Commands of Christ being comply'd with but so far only,
as they do comply with some other Rule prefer'd thereto by such as yet pretend to be Christians;
Chastity (for example) is, according to the Gospel, a Duty to both Sexes, yet a Transgression
herein, even with the aggravation of wronging another Man, and possibly a whole Family thereby,
is ordinarily talk'd as lightly of, as if it was but a Peccadillo in a Young Man, altho' a
far less Criminal Offence against this Duty in a Maid shall in the Opinion of the same Persons
brand her with perpetual Infamy: The nearest Relations oftentimes are hardly brought to look
upon her after such a dishonour done by her to their Family; whilst the Fault of her more guilty
Brother finds but a very moderate reproof from them; and in a little while, it may be, becomes
the Subject of their Mirth and Raillery. And why still is this wrong plac'd distinction made,
but because there are measures of living establish'd by Men themselves according to a conformity,
or disconformity with which, and not with the Precepts of Jesus Christ, their Actions are measur'd,
& judg'd of? A thing which would be unaccountable if Men were indeed heartily perswaded of
the Divine Revelation of our Saviours Doctrine; and did not profess to believe this but because
it is the Fashion of their Country so to do; and that their Parents have done so before them;
or, at most, that possibly they may have receiv'd from their Education some impressions which
will not permit them to reject the Christian Religion, any more than firmly induce their Assent
to the Truth of it. 

[Sidenote: Affairs of New York.]

In New York, the Leislerian and anti-Leislerian parties continued to persecute each other. To
this calamity was added, in the year 1702, the still heavier affliction of a malignant fever,
imported in a vessel from the West Indies, which, in almost every instance, proved mortal. A
similar disease raged, about the same time, in several other sea port towns; and was probably the
same which has since produced such fatal effects under the name of the yellow fever.

In the same year, lord Cornbury, a needy and profligate nobleman, was appointed governor of the province.
He embraced the anti-Leislerian party, that being then the strongest. On meeting the assembly, he
urged the necessity of providing money for the public exigencies; and, as he had arranged himself
with the ruling party, the vote of supply was liberal.

It was soon perceived that the confidence in the governor was misplaced. Considerable sums levied
for objects of great interest, were applied to his private use. The system adopted in New York,
for collecting and keeping public money, was calculated to favour this peculation. The colony
having no treasurer, its revenue came into the hands of the receiver general for the crown,
whence it was drawn by a warrant from the governor. Contests soon arose, between his lordship and
the legislature, on the subject of money; the house requiring a statement of disbursements, and
the appointment of a treasurer, to be controlled by them. At length, in 1706, an act was passed
raising three thousand pounds for fortifications, and directing the money to be placed in the hands
of a person named by the legislature. The assent of the governor to this act was not given
till the succeeding year, and was then accompanied with a message stating, that he had it in command
from the Queen "to permit the general assembly to name their own treasurer when they raised extraordinary
supplies for particular uses and which are no part of the standing and constant revenue."
The continual demands of the governor for money, his misapplication
of it, his extortion in the form of fees, and his haughty tyrannical
conduct increased the irritation subsisting between him and the legislature.
At length, the Queen yielded to the complaints of both New York and
New Jersey, and consented to recall him.

During these altercations,
some spirited resolutions were entered into by the assembly; one of
which claims particular notice.

By that want of Knowledge which I have ventur'd to say is fashionable, I understand not only
ignorance among Men, who have leisure for it, of Arts and Sciences in general; but also, and
especially the want of such particular Knowledge as is requisite to every one for the well
discharging either their Common or peculiar Business and Duty; wherein Religion is necessarily
included, as being the Duty of all Persons to understand, of whatever Sex, Condition, or Calling
they are of. Now to affirm that the greater part of People are ignorant concerning that which
is not only their Duty to know, but which also many are so sensible they ought to know, as
that they pretend to understand it enough to be either zealous about, or else to contemn it;
and to assert likewise that they want the knowledge of what is peculiarly belonging to them,
in their particular Station, to understand; are such Charges as ought not to be alledg'd, if
they are not so evidently true, as that we cannot open our Eyes without seeing them to be so.

In respect of Religion, it is, I think, universally allow'd to be true of the common People
of all sorts (tho' surely not without Matter of Reproach to some, or other, whose Care their
better Instruction ought to be) that they are very ignorant. But we will consider here only
such superior Ranks of Persons, in reference to whom what has already been said, has been spoken:
And to begin with the Female Sex, who certainly ought to be Christians; how many of these,
comparatively, may it be presum'd that there are, from the meanest Gentlewoman to the greatest
Ladies, that can give any such account of the Christian Religion, as would inform an inquisitive
Stranger what it consisted in; and what are the grounds of believing it? Such Women as understand
something of the distinguishing Opinions of that Denomination they have been bred up in, are
commonly thought highly intelligent in Religion; but I think there are but very few, even of
this little number, who could well inform a rational Heathen concerning Christianity itself:
Which is an Ignorance inexcusable in them, tho', perhaps, it is very often the effect only
of the want of other useful Knowledge, for the not having whereof, Women are much more to be
pitty'd than blam'd.

The improvements of Reason, however requisite to Ladies for their Accomplishment, as rational
Creatures; and however needful to them for the well Educating of their Children, and to their
being useful in their Families, yet are rarely any recommendation of them to Men; who foolishly
thinking, that Money will answer to all things, do, for the most part, regard nothing else
in the Woman they would Marry: And not often finding what they do not look for, it would be
no wonder if their Off-spring should inherit no more Sense than themselves. But be Nature ever
so kind to them in this respect, yet through want of cultivating the Tallents she bestows upon
those of the Female Sex, her Bounty is usually lost upon them; and Girls, betwixt silly Fathers
and ignorant Mothers, are generally so brought up, that traditionary Opinions are to them,
all their lives long, instead of Reason. They are, perhaps, sometimes told in regard of what
Religion exacts, That they must Believe and Do such and such things, because the Word of God
requires it; but they are not put upon searching the Scriptures for themselves, to see whether,
or no, these things are so; and they so little know why they should look upon the Scriptures
to be the Word of God, that but too often they are easily perswaded out of the Reverence due
to them as being so: And (if they happen to meet with such bad examples) are not seldom brought
from thence, even to scoff at the Documents of their Education; and, in consequence thereof,
to have no Religion at all. Whilst others (naturally more dispos'd to be Religious) are either
(as divers in the Apostles Days were) carry'd away with every wind of Doctrine, ever learning
and never coming to the knowledge of the Truth; Weak, Superstitious, Useless Creatures; or
else, if more tenacious in their Natures, blindly and conceitedly weded to the Principles and
Opinions of their Spiritual Guides; who having the direction of their Consciences, rarely fail
to have that also of their Affairs and Fortunes. A Wife of which sort proves, very often, no
small unhappiness to the Family where she comes; for this kind of ignorant Persons are, of
all others, the most Arrogant; and when they are once intitl'd to Saintship for their blind
Zeal, as nothing is more troublesome than they in finding fault with, and censuring every one
that differs from them, so to their Admirers (who lead them as they please) they think they
can never pay enough for that Incence which is offer'd them: The dearest Interests of Humane
Life being, oftentimes, thus sacrific'd to a vain Image of Piety; whilst makers of long Prayers
have devour'd Widows Houses.

But what is here said implying that Ladies should so well understand their Religion, as to
be able to answer both to such who oppose, and to such who misrepresent it; this may seem,
perhaps, to require that they should have the Science of Doctors, and be well skill'd in Theological
Disputes and Controversies; than the Study of which I suppose there could scarce be found for
them a more useless Employment. But whether such Patrons of Ignorance as know nothing themselves
which they ought to know, will call it Learning, or not, to understand the Christian Religion,
and the grounds of receiving it; it is evident that they who think so much knowledge, as that,
to be needless for a Woman, must either not be perswaded of the Truth of Christianity; or else
must believe that Women are not concern'd to be Christians. For if Christianity be a Religion
from God, and Women have Souls to be sav'd as well as Men; to know what this Religion consists
in, and to understand the grounds on which it is to be receiv'd, can be no more than necessary
Knowledge to a Woman, as well as to a Man: Which necessary Knowledge is sufficient to inable
any one so far to answer to the Opposers or Corrupters of Christianity, as to secure them from
the danger of being impos'd upon by such Mens Argumentations; which is all that I have thought
requisite for a Lady; and not that she should be prepar'd to challenge every Adversary to Truth.

Now that thus much knowledge requires neither Learned Education, or great Study, to the attaining
of it, appears in that the first Christians were mean and illiterate People; to which part
of Mankind the Gospel may rather be thought to have had a more especial regard than that they
are any way excluded from the Benefits thereof by incapacity in them to receive it. From whence,
we see that all Theorems too abstruse for Vulgar Apprehensions, which Christianity is believ'd
to Teach, however Divine Truths, are yet no part of the Doctrine of Salvation. There is not
therefore this pretence to impose upon any one the belief of any thing which they do not find
to be reveal'd in Scripture; the doing of which, has not only caus'd deplorable dissentions
among Christians, but also been an occasion to multitudes of well meaning People of having
so confus'd and unsatisfactory conceptions and apprehensions concerning the Christian Religion
as tho' perhaps not absolutely, or immediately prejudicial to their Salvation, yet are so to
their seeing clearly that Christianity is a rational Religion; without which few will be very
secure from the infection of Scepticism, or Infidelity, where those are become fashionable,
and prevailing. A danger to which many Women are no less expos'd than Men, and oftentimes,
more so. Whence it is but needful that they should so well understand their Religion as to
be Christians upon the Convictions of their Reason; which is indeed no more than one would
think it became every Christian, as a rational Creature, to be; were this not requisite in
regard of Scepticism, and Infidelity, as to some it is not; there being, no doubt, many a Country
Gentlewoman who has never in her Life heard Question'd, or once imagined that any one in their
Wits could Question the Articles of her Faith; which yet she her self knows not why she believes.

From the too Notorious Truth of what has been said in reference to the little that Women know
concerning Religion, it must be granted that the generality of them are shamefully Ignorant
herein. As for other Science, it is believ'd so improper for, and is indeed so little allow'd
them, that it is not to be expected from them: but the cause of this is only the Ignorance of Men.

The Age, we live in, has been, not undeservedly, esteem'd a knowing one: But to the Learned
Clergy much has been owing for its having obtain'd that Character; and tho' some few Gentlemen
have been the greatest advancers of Learning amongst us; yet they are very rare who apply themselves
to any Science that is curious: And as for such knowledge as is no less than requisite for
Men of Families, and Estates to have in regard of the proper business of their Station; it
may, I think, be said that never was this more neglected than at present; since there is not
a commoner complaint in every County than of the want of Gentlemen Qualified for the Service
of their Country, viz. to be Executors of the Law, and Law Makers; both of which it belonging
to this Rank of English Men to be, some insight into the Law which they are to see Executed,
and into that Constitution which they are to support, cannot but be necessary to their well
dischargeing these Trusts: Nor will this Knowledge be sufficiently Servicable to the Ends herein
propos'd, without some Acquaintance likewise with History, Politicks, and Morals. Every one
of these then are parts of Knowledge which an English Gentleman cannot, without blame, be Ignorant
of, as being essential to the duly Qualifying him for what is his proper business.

But whether we farther look upon such Men as having Immortal Souls that shall be for ever Happy
or Miserable, as they comply with the Terms which their Maker has propos'd to them; or whether
we regard them as Protestants, whose Birthright it is not blindly to Believe, but to Examine
their Religion; Or consider them only as Men whose ample Fortunes allow them leisure for so
important a Study, they are without doubt oblig'd to understand the Religion they profess.
Adding this then to what it is above concluded a Gentleman ought to know, let us examine how
common such Knowledge only is amongst our Gentlemen, as we see, without just matter of Reproach
to them, they cannot want: No one, I think, will deny that so much knowledge as this is so
little ordinary, as that those are apparently the far greater number who have never consider'd
any part hereof as an Acquisition, which they ought to make; and that they are but a few comparatively,
and pass among us for Men extraordinary, who have but a competent knowledge in any one of the
above-mention'd things. 

In 1621, the states general made a grant of the country to the West India company, who erected
a fort called Good Hope on Connecticut (which they denominated Fresh) river, and another called
Nassau on the east side of Delaware bay. The fort on Connecticut river, however, did not protect
that frontier against the people of New England, who continued to extend their settlements
towards the south. The Dutch remonstrated in vain against these encroachments, and were under
the necessity of receding as their more powerful neighbours advanced, until the eastern part
of Long Island, and the country within a few miles of the Hudson were relinquished. Farther south,
the Dutch had built fort Casimir (now New Castle) on the Delaware.

This fort was taken from them by the Swedes, who claimed the western shore of that river,
but was retaken by the Dutch, who, at the same time, conquered Christina, and received the submission
of the few Swedes who were scattered on the margin of the river. They also made a settlement
at cape Henlopen, which attracted the attention of lord Baltimore, who sent a commission to
New Castle ordering the Dutch governor to remove beyond the 40th
degree of north latitude, to which his lordship's claim extended.

This mandate however was not obeyed.

On the appearance of colonel Nichols before New Amsterdam, Stuyvesant, the governor, was disposed
to defend the place; but the inhabitants, feeling no inclination for the contest, took part with
their invaders; and Stuyvesant was compelled to sign a capitulation, by which he surrendered the
town to the English, stipulating for the inhabitants their property, and the rights of free
denizens. New Amsterdam took the name of New York, and the island of Manhattans that of York
Island.[95]

[Footnote 95: Chalmer. Smith.]

Hudson's, and the south, or Delaware river, were still to be reduced. Carteret commanded the expedition
against fort Orange, up Hudson's river, which surrendered on the twenty-fourth of September,
and received the name of Albany. While at that place, he formed a league with the five nations,
which proved eminently useful to the views of the English in America.

The command of the expedition against the settlement on the Delaware was given to sir Robert Carr,
who completed the conquest of that country.

Thus did England acquire
all that fine country lying between her southern and northern colonies;
an acquisition deriving not less importance from its situation, than
from its extent and fertility.

Nichols took possession of the conquered
territory, but was compelled to surrender a part of it to Carteret. Now it cannot, I think, be doubted,
but that a Mothers Concurrence and Care is thus necessary, if we consider that this is a work
which can never be too soon begun, it being rarely at all well performed, if not betimes undertaken;
nothing being so effectual to the making Men vertuous, as to have good Habits and Principles
of Vertue establish'd in them before the Mind is tainted with any thing opposite or prejudicial
hereunto. Those therefore must needs much over-look the chief Business of Education, or have
little consider'd the Constitution of Humane Nature, that reckon for nothing the first eight
or ten Years of a Boys Life; an Age wherein Fathers, who seldom are able to do it at any time,
can neither charge themselves with the care of their Children, nor be the watchful inspectors
of those that they must be trusted to; who usually and unavoidably by most Parents, are a sort
of People far fitter to be Learners than Teachers of the Principles of Vertue and Wisdom; the
great Foundation of both which consists in being able to govern our Passions, and subject our
Appetites to the direction of our Reason: A Lesson hardly ever well learnt, if it be not taught
us from our very Cradles. To do which requires no less than a Parents Care and Watchfulness;
and therefore ought undoubtedly to be the Mothers business to look after, under whose Eye they
are. An exemption from which, Quality (even of the highest degree) cannot give; since the Relation
between the Mother and Child is equal amongst all Ranks of People. And it is a very preposterous
Abuse of Quality to make it a pretence for being unnatural. This is a Truth which perhaps would
displease many Ladies were it told them, and therefore, probably, it is that they so seldom
hear it: But none of them could be so much offended with any one for desiring hereby to restrain
them from some of their expensive and ridiculous Diversions, by an employment so worthy of
Rational Creatures, and so becoming of maternal tenderness, as it is just to be with them for
neglecting their Children: A Fault that women of Quality are every way too often guilty of,
and are perhaps more without excuse for, than for any other that they are ordinarily taxable
with. For tho' it is to be fear'd that few Ladies (from the disadvantage of their own Education)
are so well fitted as they ought to be, to take the care of their Children, yet not to be willing
to do what they can herein, either as thinking this a matter of too much pains for them, or
below their Condition, expresses so senseless a Pride, and so much want of the affectionate
and compassionate Tenderness natural to that Sex and Relation, that one would almost be tempted
to question whether such Women were any more capable of, than worthy to be the Mothers of Rational
Creatures.

But natural Affection apart, it should be consider'd by these, that no one is Born into the
World to live idly; enjoying the Fruit and Benefit of other Peoples Labours, without contributing
reciprocally some way or other, to the good of the Community answerably to that Station wherein
God (the common Father of all) has plac'd them; who has evidently intended Humane kind for
Society and mutual Communion, as Members of the same Body, useful every one each to other in
their respective places. Some tribes which roam this region have a tradition, that the first Indian
ascended through this aperture, and settled on the earth's surface.

A few years since, on the Merrimac river in St. Louis county, a number of pigmy graves were
discovered. The coffins were of stone; and the length of the bodies which they contained, judging
from that of the coffins, could not have been more than from three feet and a half to four feet.
The graves were numerous, and the skeletons in some instances nearly entire.

In the month of June (1830), a party of gentlemen, whilst in pursuit of wild turkeys, in Hart
county, Kentucky, discovered, on the top of a small knoll, a hole
sufficiently large to admit a man's body. And could the bare Love of their Country induce,
among many more, the great Cornelia, Mother of the Gracchi, and Aurelia the Mother of Julius
Caesar, to do this for the Sons of Noble-men of Rome to whom they had no Relation but that
of their common Country, and shall not the like consideration, or what is infinitely beyond
this, that of their Children being hereafter for ever happy or miserable, accordingly as they
live in this World, prevail with the Ladies of our Days, who call themselves Christians, to
employ some of their Time and Pains upon their own Off-spring? The care of which (as has been
said) should begin with the first Years of Childrens Lives, in curbing at the earliest appearance
thereof, every their least evil inclination; and accustoming them to an absolute, constant,
and universal Submission and Obedience to the Will of those who have the disposal of them:
Since they will hardly ever after (especially in a great Fortune) be govern'd by their own
Reason, who are not made supple to that of others, before they are able to judge of fit and
unfit, by any other measure than as it is the Will, or not, of such whom they believe to have
a just Power over them. As they do become capable of examining and determining their Actions
by Reason, they should be taught never to do any thing of consequence heedlesly; and to look
upon the Dictates of their Reason as so inviolable a Rule of their Determinations, that no
Passion or Appetite must ever make them swerve therefrom. But instead of following this Method,
it is commonly thought too soon to correct Children for any thing, 'till the Season is past
for this sort of Discipline; which, if it come too late, is commonly so far from producing
the good it was design'd for, that losing the benefit of Correction (which, if duly apply'd,
is of infinite use) it turns to a Provocation; and renders stiff and incorrigible a Temper
it was meant to supple. Miss Wright sailed from New York for France, where she still remains,
in the month of July, 1830; and previous to her departure delivered an address, on which "the New
York Enquirer" makes the following observations:--

"The parting address of Miss Wright at the Bowery Theatre, on Wednesday evening, was a singular melange
of politics and impiety--eloquence and irreligion--bold invective, and electioneering slang. The
theatre was very much crowded, probably three thousand persons being present; and what was the
most surprising circumstance of the whole, is the fact, that about one half of the audience were
females--respectable females.

"When Fanny first made her appearance in this city as a lecturer on the 'new order of things,'
she was very little visited by respectable females. At her first lecture in the Park Theatre,
about half a dozen appeared; but these soon left the house. From that period till the present, we
had not heard her speak in public; but her doctrines, and opinions, and philosophy, appear
to have made much greater progress in the city than we ever dreamt
of. Her fervid eloquence--her fine action--her soprano-toned voice--her
bold and daring attacks upon all the present systems of society--and
particularly upon priests, politicians, bankers, and aristocrats as
she calls them, have raised a party around her of considerable magnitude,
and of much fervour and enthusiasm."

* * * * *

"The present state
of things in this city is, to say the least of it, very singular.

This I am sure, that who so has try'd how very little Sense is to be met with, or can be infus'd
into Nurses, and Nurse-Maids; and with what difficulty even the best of them by those who make
it their business to watch over them, are restrain'd from what they are perswaded has no hurt
in it, will soon be satisfy'd how little fit it is to trust Children any more than is necessary,
in such Hands. And no wiser than such, if not much worse, are the greatest part of those who
are usually their immediate Successors, viz. young Scholars and French Maids, erected into
Tutors and Governesses, only for the sake of a little Latin and French.

In Mr. L---- s excellent Treatise of Education, he shews how early and how great a Watchfulness
and Prudence are requisite to the forming the Mind of a Child to Vertue; and whoso shall read
what he has writ on that Subject, will, it is very likely, think that few Mothers are qualify'd
for such an undertaking as this: But that they are not so is the Fault which should be amended:
In the mean time nevertheless, their presum'd willingness to be in the right, where the Happiness
of their Children is concerned in it, must certainly inable them, if they were but once convinc'd
that this was their Duty, to perform it much better than such People will do, who have as little
Skill and Ability for it as themselves; and who besides, that they rarely desire to learn any
more than they have, are not induc'd by Affection to do for those under their care all the
Good that they can. Since then the Affairs either of Men's Callings, or of their private Estates,
or the Service of their Country (all which are indispensibly their Business) allows them not
the leisure to look daily after the Education of their Children; and that, otherwise, also
they are naturally less capable than Women of that Complaisance and Tenderness, which the right
Instruction and Direction of that Age requires; and since Servants are so far from being fit
to be rely'd upon in that great concern, that to watch against the Impediments they actually
bring thereto, is no small part of the care that a wise Parent has to take; I do presume that
(ordinarily speaking) this so necessary a Work of forming betimes the Minds of Children so
as to dispose them to be hereafter Wise and Vertuous Men and Women, cannot be perform'd but
by Mothers only. It being a thing practicable but by a very few to purchase the having always
Wise, Vertuous and well Bred People, to take the place of a Parent in governing their Children;
and together with them such Servants and Teachers, as must peculiarly be employ'd about them;
For the World does not necessarily abound with such Persons as these, and in such circumstances
as not to pretend to more profitable employments than Men of one or two thousand Pounds a Year
(and much less those great numbers who have smaller Estates) can often afford to make the care
of governing their Children from their Infancy to be. The procuring of such a Person as this
may (by accident) sometimes be in such a ones Power; but to propose the ingaging for reward
whenever there shall be need for them, vertuous, wife, and well-bred Men and Women, to spend
their time in taking care of the Education of young Children, is what can be done but by a
very few; since the doing this would not be found an easy charge to the greater part of almost
any rank amongst us; unless they would be content for the sake hereof to abridge themselves
of some of their extravagant Expences; which are usually the last that Men will deny themselves.

It is indeed wonderful (if we consider Men as rational Creatures) to see how much Mony they
will often bestow, not upon their Vices only, (for this is not so unaccountable) but upon meerly
fashionable Vanities, which give them more Trouble than Pleasure in the enjoyment: Yet at the
same time be as sparing, as is possible, of cost upon a Child's Education; and it is certain,
that for Rewards considerable enough to make it worth their while, those of a far different
Character from such as for the most part undertake it, would be induc'd to accept even the
early charge of Childrens Instruction. But every Gentleman of a good Family, or good Estate
also, is not in Circumstances to propound such sufficient Rewards; and for what the most can
afford to give, very few capable of performing this matter well, will trouble themselves about
it; at least with such Pupils as must be attended with Nurses or Maids. Wherefore no other
remedy, I believe, can be found but in returning still to our Conclusion, That this great concernment,
on which no less than Peoples Temporal and Eternal Happiness does mightily depend, ought to
be the Care and Business of Mothers. Nor do Women seem less peculiarly adapted by Nature hereunto,
than it can be imagin'd they should be, if the Author of Nature (as no doubt he did) design'd
this to be their Province in that division of Cares of Humane Life, which ought to be made
between a Man and his Wife. For that softness, gentleness and tenderness, natural to the Female
Sex, renders them much more capable than Men are of such an insinuating Condescention to the
Capacities of young Children, as is necessary in the Instruction and Government of them, insensibly
to form their early Inclinations. And surely these distinguishing Qualities of the Sex were
not given barely to delight, when they may, so manifestly, be profitable also, if joyn'd with
a well informed Understanding: From whence, viz. from Womans being naturally thus fitted to
take this care of their little Ones, it follows, that besides the injustice done to themselves
thereby, it is neglecting the Direction of Nature for the well breeding up of Children, when
Ladies are render'd uncapable hereof, through the want of such due improvements of their Reason
as are requisite hereunto.

That this has been no more reflected upon from a Principle of Pitty to that tender Age of Children
which so much requires help, seems very strange: For what can move a juster Commiseration than
to see such poor innocents, so far from having the Aid they stand in need of, that even those
who the most wish to do them good, and who resent, with the deepest Compassion, every little
Malady which afflicts their Bodies, do never attempt to rescue them from the greatest evils
which attend them in this Life, but even themselves assist to plunge them therein, by cherishing
in them those Passions which will inevitably render them miserable? A thing which can never
be otherwise whilst Women are bred up in no right Notions of Religion and Vertue; or to know
any use of Reason but in the service of their Passions and Inclinations; or at best of their
(comparatively trivial) Interests. 

Intoxicated with ardent spirits, and with their short lived success, they considered their work
as already achieved, and halted in an open field, where the time which might have been employed in
promoting their design, was devoted to dancing and exultation. Fortunately, the people of
the neighbourhood had assembled on the same day, to attend divine service; and, as was then directed
by law, all the men came armed. They marched immediately against the blacks, whom they completely
surprised. Many were killed, and the residue dispersed or taken. Thus the insurrection was
suppressed on the day of its commencement; and such of its leaders as survived the battle were immediately
executed.

During the long repose, which the pacific temper of the duke of Orleans,
Regent of France during the minority of Louis XV. and the equally
pacific temper of sir Robert Walpole, minister of England, gave to
their respective countries, the British colonies in America had increased
rapidly in population and in wealth.

Lands were cheap, and subsistence easily acquired. From New York to Virginia inclusive, no
enemy existed to restrain new settlements, and no fears of inability to maintain a family,
checked the natural propensity to early marriages. The people were employed in cultivating the
earth, and in spreading themselves over the vast regions which were open to them; and, during this
period, their history furnishes none of those remarkable events which interest posterity.

{1739}

[Sidenote: War with Spain.]

The increasing complaints of the merchants, and the loud clamours
of the nation, at length forced the minister to abandon his pacific
system; and war was declared against Spain.

A squadron commanded by admiral Vernon was detached to the West Indies, with instructions to
act offensively; and general Oglethorpe was ordered to annoy the settlements in Florida. He planned
an expedition against St. Augustine, and requested the assistance of South Carolina. That colony,
ardently desiring the expulsion of neighbours alike feared and hated, entered zealously into
the views of the general, and agreed to furnish the men and money he requested. A regiment, commanded
by colonel Vanderdussen, was immediately raised in Virginia and the two Carolinas. A body
of Indians was also engaged, and captain Price, who commanded the small fleet on that station,
promised his co-operation. These arrangements being made, and the mouth of St. John's river,
on the coast of Florida, being appointed as the place, of rendezvous general Oglethorpe hastened
to Georgia, to prepare his regiment for the expedition.

{1740}

Those unexpected impediments, which always embarrass military movements conducted by men without
experience, having delayed the arrival of his northern troops, Oglethorpe entered Florida at the
head of his own regiment, aided by a party of Indians; and invested Diego, a small fort about
twenty-five miles from St. Augustine, which capitulated after a short resistance. He then returned
to the place of rendezvous, where he was joined by colonel Vanderdussen, and by a company of
Highlanders under the command of captain M'Intosh; a few days after which, he marched with his
whole force, consisting of about two thousand men, to fort Moosa, in the neighbourhood of St.
Augustine, which was evacuated on his approach. The general now perceived that the enterprise
would be attended with more difficulty than had been anticipated. In the time which intervened
between his entering Florida and appearing before the town, supplies of provisions had been received
from the country, and six Spanish half gallies carrying long brass nine pounders, and two sloops
laden with provisions, had entered the harbour. Finding the place better fortified than had
been expected, he determined to invest it completely, and to advance by regular approaches.
In execution of this plan, colonel Palmer, with ninety-five Highlanders, and forty-two Indians,
remained at fort Moosa, while the army took different positions near the town, and began an
ineffectual bombardment from the island of Anastasia. The general was deliberating on a plan for
forcing the harbour and taking a nearer position, when colonel Palmer
was surprised, and his detachment cut to pieces. At the same time
some small vessels from the Havanna, with a reinforcement of men and
supply of provisions, entered the harbour through the narrow channel
of the Matanzas.

The army began to despair of success; and the provincials,
enfeebled by the heat, dispirited by sickness, and fatigued by fruitless
efforts, marched away in large bodies. The navy being ill supplied
with provisions, and the season for hurricanes approaching, captain
Price was unwilling to hazard his majesty's ships on that coast. For if it be consider'd, that she who did seriously desire
to make the best use of what she knew, would necessarily be oblig'd (for the gaining of Time
wherein she might do so) to order the Course, and manner of her Life something differently
from others of her Sex and Condition, it cannot be doubted but that a Conduct, which carry'd
with it so much Reproach to Woman's Idleness, and disappointment to Men's Vanity, would quickly
be judg'd fit to be ridicul'd out of the World before others were infected by the example.
So that the best Fate which a Lady thus knowing, and singular, could expect, would be that
hardly escaping Calumny, she should be in Town the Jest of the Would-be-Witts; tho wonder of
Fools, and a Scarecrow to keep from her House many honest People who are to be pitty'd for
having no more Wit than they have, because it is not their own Fault that they have no more.
But in the Country she would, probably, fare still worse; for there her understanding of the
Christian Religion would go near to render her suspected of Heresy even by those who thought
the best of her: Whilst her little Zeal for any Sect or Party would make the Clergy of all
sorts give her out for a Socinian or a Deist: And should but a very little Philosophy be added
to her other Knowledge, even for an Atheist. The Parson of the Parish, for fear of being ask'd
hard Questions, would be shy of coming near her, were his Reception ever so inviting; and this
could not but carry some ill intimation with it to such as Reverenc'd the Doctor, and who,
it is likely, might be already satisfy'd from the Reports of Nurses, and Maids, that their
Lady was indeed a Woman of very odd Whimsies. Her prudent Conduct and Management of her affairs
would probably secure her from being thought out of her Wits by her near Neighbours; but the
Country Gentlemen that wish'd her well, could not yet chuse but be afraid for her, lest too
much Learning might in Time make her Mad.

The saving of but one Soul from Destruction, is, it is true, a noble recompense for ten Thousand
such Censurers as these; but it is wondrous strange that only to be a Christian, with so much
other Knowledge as a Child of Nine or Ten Years Old may, and ought to have, should expose a
Lady to so great Reproaches; And what a shame is this for Men whose woful Ignorance is the
alone Cause thereof? For it is manifestly true that if the inimitable Author of Les Caracteres,
ou les Moeurs de ce Siecle, had demanded in England, who forbids Knowledge to Women? It must
have been answer'd him, the Ignorance of the Men does so; and the same Answer I think he might
have receiv'd in his own Country.

Monsieur Bruyere says indeed, and likely it is, That Men have made no Laws, or put out any
Edicts whereby Women are prohibited to open their Eyes; to Read; to Remember what they Read,
and to make use thereof in their Conversation, or in composing of Works. But surely he had
little Reason to suppose, as he herein does, that Women could not otherwise than by Laws and
Edicts be restrain'd from Learning. It is sufficient for this that no body assists them in
it; and that they are made to see betimes that it would be disadvantageous to them to have
it. For how few Men are there, that arrive to any Eminence therein? tho' Learning is not only
not prohibited to them by Laws and Edicts; but that ordinarily much Care, and Pains, is taken
to give it them; and that great Profits, oftentimes, and, always, Honour attends their having it.

The Law of Fashion, establish'd by Repute and Disrepute, is to most People the powerfullest
of all Laws, as Monsieur Bruyere very well knew; whose too Satyrical Genius makes him assign
as Causes of Womens not having Knowledge, the universally necessary consequences of being bred
in the want thereof. But what on different occasions he says of the Sex, will either on the
one part vindicate them, or else serve for an Instance that this Ingenious Writers Reflections,
however witty, are not always instructive, or just Corrections. For either Women have generally
some other more powerful Principle of their Actions than what terminates in rendering themselves
pleasing to Men (as he insinuates they have not) or else they neglect the improvement of their
Minds and Understandings, as not finding them of any use to that purpose; whence it is not
equal in him to charge it peculiarly (as he does) upon that Sex (if it be indeed so much chargeable
on them as on Men) that they are diverted from Science by une curiosité toute differente de
celle qui contente l'Espirt: ou un tout autre gout que celuy d'exercer leur Memoire.

Yet since I think it is but Natural, and alike so in both Sexes, to desire to please the other,
I may, I suppose, without any Injurious Reflexion upon Ladies, presume, that if Men did usually
find Women the more amiable for being knowing, they would much more commonly, than now they
are, be so.

But the Knowledge hitherto spoken of has a nobler Aim than the pleasing of Men, and begs only
Toleration from them; in granting whereof they would at least equally consult their own advantage:
as they could not but find, did They not by a common Folly, incident to Humane Nature, hope
that contradictions should subsist together in their Favour; from whence only it is that very
many who would not that Women should have Knowledge, do yet complain of, and very impatiently
bear the Natural, and unavoidable consequences of their Ignorance.

But what sure Remedy can be found for Effects whose Cause remains? and on what ground can it
be expected that Ignorance and uninstructed Persons should have the Venues which proceed from
a rightly inform'd Understanding, and well cultivated Mind? or not be liable to those Vices
which their Natures incline them to? And how should it otherwise be than that they, who have
never consider'd the Nature and Constitution of Things, or weigh'd the Authority of the Divine
Law, and what it exacts of them, should be perswaded that nothing can be so truly profitable
to them as the Indulgence of their present Passions, and Appetites? Which whoso places their
Happiness in the satisfaction of, cannot fail of being themselves miserable, or of making those
so who are concern'd in them.

Humane Nature is not capable of durable satisfaction when the Passions and Appetites are not
under the direction of right Reason: And whilst we eagerly pursue what disappoints our expectation,
or cloys with the Enjoyment, as all irregular pleasures, however Natural, do; and whilst we
daily create to our selves desires still more vain, as thinking thereby to be supply'd with
new Delights, we shall ever (instead of finding true Contentment) be subjected to uneasiness,
disgust and vexation: The unhappy state more, or less, of all who want that Knowledge which
is requisite to direct their Actions suitably to the Ends which as rational Creatures they
ought to propose: and as can inable them profitably to employ their Time.

But since Examples do the best perswade, let us see, with respect to Women, in the most considerable
Instances, what plainly are the Natural consequences of that Ignorance which they usually are
bred in; and which Men think so advantageous to themselves. We will suppose then a Lady bred,
as the generality of Men think she should be, in a blind belief concerning Religion; and taught
that it is even ridiculous for a Lady to trouble her Head about this matter; since it is so
far from being a Science fit for her, that it indeed properly belongs only to Gown-Men: and
that a Woman very well Merits to be laugh'd at who will act the Doctor: Her Duty in the case
being plain and easie; as requiring only of her to believe and practice what she is taught
at Church, or in such Books of Piety as shall be recommended to her by her Parents, or some
Spiritual Director.

This is generally, I think, the Sense of Men concerning the Knowledge which Ladies ought to
have of Religion: And thus much, I doubt not may suffice for their Salvation. But the saving
of their Souls (tho' it were herein as sure as it is possible) is not, I suppose, all that
Men are Solicitous for in regard of their Wives; their own Honour in that of those so near
to them, does I think, much more frequently and sensibly employ their Care: And that, too often,
appears to be but very weakly secur'd by such an implicit Faith as this. For these Believers
(especially if they are thought to have any Wit, as well as Beauty) will hardly escape meeting
some time or other, with those who will ask them why they Believe; and if they find then that
they have no more Reason for going to Church than they should have had to go to Mass, or even
to the Synagogue, had they been bred amongst Papists or Jews, they must needs, at the same
time, doubt whether, or no, the Faith they have been brought up in, is any righter than either
of these; from whence they will, (by easy steps) be induc'd to question the Truth of all Religion,
when they shall be told by those who have insinuated themselves into their Esteem and good
Graces, that indeed All Religions are, alike, the Inventions and Artifices of cunning Men to
govern the World by; unworthy of imposing upon such as have their good Sense: That Fools only,
and Ignorants are kept in Awe, and restrain'd by their Precepts; which, if they observe it,
they shall ever find, are the lest obey'd by those who pretend the most to obtrude them upon
others.

That this is Language which Women often hear is certain: And such a one as knows no reason
for what she has been taught to believe, but has been reprov'd, perhaps, for demanding one,
can very hardly avoid being perswaded that there is much appearance of Truth in this; whence
she will soon come to conclude, that she has hitherto been in the wrong, if upon any scruple
of Religion, she has not gratify'd her Inclination, in whatever she imagines might tend to
make her Life more pleasing to her. And should a young Lady, thus dispos'd, find a Lover whom
she thinks has a just value for all her good Qualities, which at best, perhaps, procure her
but the cold Civility of her Husband, it is odds that she may be in danger of giving him cause
to wish she had been better instructed, than may possibly suffice for her Salvation: Which,
whatever happens, none can pronounce, may not be secur'd from the allowances due to so great
Ignorance, or at least by any timely Repentance: Whilst Honour, if not intirely Ship-wrack'd,
it is scarce reasonable to hope, should suffer no Diminution on such an occasion; the which,
that Women the most vertuously dispos'd, may never be within distance of, will, in an Age like
this, be best provided for by their being betimes instructed in the true Reasons and Measures
of their Duty; since those, who are so, are not only better able to defend their Vertue, but
have also the seldomest occasion for such a defence. Men, how ill soever inclin'd, being aw'd
by, and made asham'd to attaque with so pittiful Arguments, as Vice admits of, such as they
see are rationally Vertuous; whilst easy ignorance is look'd upon as a Prey expos'd to every
bold Invader: And whatever Garb of Gravity or Modesty it is cloath'd withal, invites such very
often, even where the Charms of the Person would not otherwise attract them.

But as such Men who think that the understanding of Religion is a thing needless to Women,
do commonly much more believe all other rational Knowledge to be so; let us see how reasonably
these same Men who willingly allow not to Ladies any employment of their Thoughts worthy of
them as rational Creatures, do yet complain, that either Play is their daily and expensive
pastime; or that they love not to be at home taking care of their Children, as did heretofore
Ladies who were honour'd for their Vertue; but that an eternal round of idle Visits, the Park,
Court, Play-houses and Musick Meetings, with all the costly Preparations to being seen in publick,
do constantly take up their Time and their Thoughts. For how heavy an Accusation soever this,
in itself, is, may it not justly be demanded of such Men as we have spoken of, what good they
imagine Mothers who understand nothing that is fit for their Children to know, should procure
to them by being much in their Company: And next, whether they indeed think it equitable to
desire to confine Ladies to spend the best part of their Lives in the Society and company of
little Children; when to play with them as a more entertaining sort of Monkeys or Parroquets,
is all the pleasing Conversation that they are capable of having with them? For no other Delight
can ignorant Women take in the Company of young Children; and if to desire this, is not equitable
or just, must it not be concluded, that the greatest part of those, who make the above-mention'd
Complaints, do really mean nothing else thereby, but, by a colourable and handsome pretence,
to oblige their Wives, either to be less expensive, or to avoid, it may be, the occasions of
gaining Admirers which may make them uneasy? Neither can such, possibly, be presum'd upon any
Principle of Vertue, to disapprove those ways of anothers spending their Time, or Mony, which
themselves will either upon no consideration forbear; or else do so only, from a preference
of things as little, or yet less reasonable; as Drinking, Gaming, or Lew'd Company. Such Persons
of both Sexes as These, are indeed but fit Scourges to chastise each others Folly; and they
do so sufficiently, whilst either restraint on the one side begets unconquerable hatred and
aversion; or else an equal indulgence puts all their Affairs into an intire confusion and disorder:
Whence Want, mutual ill Will, Disobedience of Children, their Extravagance, and all the ill
effects of neglected Government, and bad Example follow; till they make such a Family a very
Purgatory to every one who lives in it. And as the Original cause of all these mischiefs is
Peoples not living like rational Creatures, but giving themselves up to the blind Conduct of
their Desires and Appetites; so all who in any measure do thus, will accordingly, more or less,
create vexation to each other, because it is impossible that they should ever be at ease, or
contented in their own Minds.

There being then so very few reasonable People in the World, as are, that is to say, such who
indeavour to live conformably to the Dictates of Reason, submitting their Passions and Appetites
to the Government and Direction of that Faculty which God has given them to that end; what
wonder can it be that so few are happy in a Marry'd Estate? And how little cause is there to
charge their Infelicity, as often is done, upon this Condition, as if it were a necessary Consequence
thereof?

The necessities of a Family very often, and the injustice of Parents sometimes, causes People
to sacrifice their Inclinations, in this matter, to interest; which must needs make this State
uneasy in the beginning to those who are otherways ever so much fitted to live well in such
a Relation; yet scarce any vertuous and reasonable Man and Woman who are Husband and Wife,
can know that it is both their Duty and Interest (as it is) reciprocally to make each other
Happy without effectually doing so in a little time. But if no contrary Inclination obstruct
this Felicity, a greater cannot certainly be propos'd, since Friendship has been allow'd by
the wisest, most vertuous, and most generous Men of all Ages to be the solidest and sweetest
pleasure in this World: And where can Friendship have so much advantage to arrive to, and be
maintain'd in its Perfection, as where two Persons have inseparably one and the same Interest;
and see themselves united, as it were, in their common Off-spring? All People, it is certain,
have not a like fitness for, or relish of this pleasure of Friendship, which therefore, however
preferable to others in the real advantages of it, cannot be equally valuable to all. But where
there is mutually that predominant Disposition to vertuous Love, which is the Characteristick
of the most excellent Minds, I think we cannot frame an Idea of so great Happiness to be found
in any thing in this Life, as in a Marry'd State.

It seems therefore one of the worst Marks that can be of the Vice and Folly of any Age when
Mariage is commonly contemn'd therein; since nothing can make it to be so but Mens Averseness
to, or incapacity for those things which most distinguish them from Brutes, Vertue and Friendship.

But it were well if Mariage was not become a State almost as much fear'd by the Wise, as despis'd
by Fools. Custom and silly Opinion, whose consequences yet are (for the most part) not imaginary,
but real Evils, do usually make it by their best Friends thought adviseable for those of the
Female Sex once to Marry; altho' the Risque which they therein run of being wretched, is yet
much greater than that of Men; who (not having the same inducements from the hazard of their
Reputation, or any uneasie dependance) are, from the examples of others Misfortunes, often
deter'd from seeking Felicity in a condition wherein they so rarely see, or hear of any who
find it; it being too true that one can frequent but little Company, or know the Story of but
few Families, without hearing of the publick Divisions, and Discords of Marry'd People, or
learning their private Discontents from their being in that state. But since the cause of such
unhappiness lies only in the corruption of Manners, were that redress'd, there would need nothing
more to bring Mariage into credit.

Vice and Ignorance, thus, we see, are the great Sources of those Miseries which Men suffer
in every state. These, oftentimes, mingle Gall even in their sweetest Pleasures; and imbitter
to them the wholesomest Delights. But what remedy hereto can be hop'd for, if rational Instruction
and a well order'd Education of Youth, in respect of Vertue and Religion, can only (as has
been said) rectify these Evils? For vicious and ignorant Parents are neither capable of this,
or generally willing that their Children should be instructed or govern'd any other ways, than
as themselves have been before them.

One might hence therefore, it may be, reasonably believe, that God reserves to himself, by
some extraordinary interposition of his providence, that Reformation which we are assur'd,
will some time be effected. But yet if all Persons, eminent by their Quality, who merit not
to be rank'd among the Vicious and Ignorant, would give the Example, much would thereby be
done towards the introducing of a general amendment: Since these could make a greater care
of Education in the above-mention'd Respects, become, in some degree, Fashionable: And even
a reasonable thing will not want Followers, if it be once thought the Fashion. We have seen
also that Mothers, in regard of their Childrens Instruction, ought to take upon themselves,
as their proper Business, a very great part in that concernment; and one would think that there
were no inconsiderable number of Ladies amongst us, who might, with hopes of success, be address'd
to, that they would indeavour to acquit themselves herein of their Duty. I mean all such as
are unhappily Marry'd; for what so good Reparation can they find for the misfortune of having
foolish and vicious Husbands, who neglect or treat them ill, as the having Children honour'd
for their Vertue, and who shall honour and love them, not only as their Parents, but as those
to whom they owe much more than their Being?

To perswade such whose Heads are full of Pleasure, and whose Hours pass gaily, to seek their
satisfaction in things of which they have never yet had any tast, could not reasonably be thought
other than a vain Attempt: But they who are wretched, one would think, should be easily prevail'd
with to hearken to any Proposition, which brings but the least glimpse of Happiness to them;
and were that tenderness of their Children, which ingages Mothers to do them all the good they
can, less natural than it is to Vertuous Women, one would imagine, that when from these alone
they must expect all their Felicity in this Life, they should readily contribute what is in
their Power to the securing to themselves this only Blessing which they can propose; and which
they cannot miss of, without the greatest increase imaginable to their present unhappiness:
Childrens Ill-doing being an Affliction equal to the Joy of their doing well. Which must be
an unspeakable one to such Parents as are conscious, that this is in great measure the Fruit
and Effect of their right direction. Nor is there any thing which a vertuous Man or Woman does
not think they owe, or is too much for them to return to those to whom they believe themselves
indebted for their being such. How great a Felicity then may a Mother, unhappy in the Relation
of a Wife, (by procuring to herself such Friends as these) lay up for her declining Age, which
must otherwise be more miserable than her unfortunate Youth? And how much better would she
employ her time in this care, than in the indulging to a weakness, very incident to tender
Minds, which is to bemoan themselves, instead of casting about for Relief against their Afflictions,
whereby they become but yet more soften'd to the Impressions of their Sorrow, and every day
less able to support them?

They are usually (it is true) the most Vertuous Women who are the aptest to bear with immoderate
Grief, the ill Humour, or unkindness of their Husbands: But it is pitty that such, who (in
an Age wherein the contrary is too often practis'd) have more Vertue than to think of returning
the Injuries they receive, should want so much Wit as not to repay unkindness, with a just
contempt of it: But instead thereof, foolishly sacrifice their Lives, or the Comforts of them
(which is our All in this World) to those who will not sacrifice the least inclination to their
reasonable Satisfaction: And how much wiser and more becoming Christians would it be for such
Ladies to reflect less upon what others owe to them, and more upon what they owe to themselves
and their Children, than to abandon themselves, as too many do, to a fruitless Grief; which
serves for nothing else, but to render them yet less agreeable to those whom they desire to
please; and useless in the World: Diseases, and, in time, constant ill Health being the almost
never failing Effects of a lasting Discontent upon such feeble Constitutions. But I take leave
to say, that the fault of those who make others thus miserable, and the weakness of such who
thus suffer their Minds to think under Adversity, are in a great measure both owing to one
and the same Cause, viz. Ignorance of the true Rules and Measures of their Duty; whereby they
would be taught to correct every excess; together with the want of such other Knowledge (suitable
to the Capacity and Condition of the Person) as would both usefully and agreably employ their
Time: This Knowledge, tho' not perhaps of a Nature immediately conducing to form, or rectify
the Manners, yet doing so, in a great measure, by restraining or preventing the irregularities
of them. For as ill natur'd and vicious Men, if they know but how pleasantly and profitably
to employ those tedious hours which lye upon their Hands, would be generally less Vicious,
and less ill Humour'd than they are; so Women of the most sensible Dispositions would not give
up themselves to sorrow that is always hurtful, and sometimes dangerous both in their Honour
and Salvation (excess of Tenderness, when abus'd, too often producing Hatred, and that Revenge)
if they were not only very little inform'd as to what God requires of them; but also very Ignorant
in regard of any kind of Ingenious Knowledge, whereby they might delightfully employ themselves,
and divert those displeasing Thoughts which (otherwise) will incessantly Torment, and Prey
upon their Minds. She who has no Inclinations unbecoming a Vertuous Woman, who prefers her
Husbands Affection to all things in the World; and who can no longer find that pleasure in
the ordinary Circle of Ladies Diversions, which perhaps, they gave her in her first Youth,
is but very ill provided to bear Discontent where she proposes her greatest satisfaction, if
she has nothing within her self which can afford her pleasure, independently upon others: Which
is what none can lastingly have, without some improvement of their rational Faculties; since
as Childhood, and Youth, wear off, the relish of those pleasures that are suited to them, do
so too; on which account the most happy would not ill consult their advantage, if by contracting
betimes a Love of Knowledge (which is ever fruitful in delight to those who have once a true
taste of it) they provide in their Youth such a Source of Pleasure for their Old Age as Time
will not dissipate, but improve; by rendring their Minds no less vigorous, and its Beauties
yet more attracting, when the short Liv'd ones of their Faces are impair'd, and gone. Whilst
those whose Youthful Time has been devoted to Vanities, or Trifles, Age does inevitably deliver
over either to melancholy Repentance, or (at best) to the wearisome Languishings which attend
a Life deprived of Desire and Enjoyment. 

Thus equipped, we commenced our journey to the Great Falls. The distance from Tonawanta to the
village of the Falls, now called Manchester, is about eleven miles. The way lies through a
forest, in which there are but a few scattered habitations. A great part of the road runs close
to the river Niagara; and the occasional glimpses of this broad sheet of water, which are obtained
through the rich foliage of the forest, added to the refreshing breeze that approached us through
the openings, rendered our pedestrian excursion extremely delightful.

Towards evening we arrived at the village, and proceeded to reconnoitre, in order to fix our position
for the night. After having done this satisfactorily, we then turned our attention to the all-important
operation of eating and drinking. While supping, an eccentric-looking person passed out through
the apartment in which we were. His odd appearance excited our curiosity, and we inquired who
this mysterious-looking gentleman was.

We were informed that he was an Englishman, and that he had been lodging there for the last six months,
but that he concealed his real name. He slept in one corner of a large barrack room, in which
there were of course several other beds. On a small table by his bed-side there were a few
French and Latin books, and some scraps of poetry touching on the tender passion. These, and
a German flute, which we observed standing against the window, gave us some clue to his character.
He was a tall, romantic-looking young man, apparently about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years
of age. His dress was particularly shabby. This the landlord told us was from choice, not from necessity,
as he had two trunks full of clothes nearly new. The reason he gave for dressing as he did,
was his knowing, he said, that if he dressed well, people would be talking to him, which he
wished to avoid; but, that by dressing as he did, he made sure that no one would ever think
of giving him any annoyance of that kind. I thought this idea unique: and whether he be still at
Niagara, or has taken up his abode at the foot of the Rocky mountains, I pronounce him to be a Diogenes
without a tub. He has read at least one page in the natural history
of civilized man.
For, not to say that it is a rational as well as Pious Fear that God by some signal Judgment
upon such as have abus'd many Mercies, should make an example of them for the deterring of
others, it is more certain (tho' usually less reflected upon) that it is no way necessary to
the punishment of any Wicked Ungrateful Nation, that God should interpose, by some extraordinary
act of his Providence, to inflict upon them the due Reward of their Disobedience, and Ingratitude:
Since so fitly are all things dispos'd in their Original Constitution, and the order of Nature
to the All-wise ends of their Maker, that (without his especial Interposition in the case)
the establish'd course of things does bring to pass the effects that he sees fit in respect
of the Moral, as well as of the Natural World; nor scarcely can any People from the avenging
Hand of the Almighty, in the most astonishing Judgments which can render them an eminent example
of his Displeasure, receive any severer Chastisement, than what they will find in the Natural
result and consequences of their Moral Corruption when grown to an Extremity.

It would be to enter into a large Field of Discourse to shew how experience has always attested
this. And we perceive, but too sensibly, that Vice proportionably to its measure, carries along
with it, its own Punishment, to need that we should search for Foreign, or Remote examples
in proof hereof.

A general Contempt of Religion towards God: Want of Truth and Fidelity amongst Men: Luxury
and Intemperance, follow'd with the neglect of industry, and application to useful Arts and
Sciences, are necessarily attended with misery, and have been usually also, the Fore-runners
of approaching Ruine to the best and most flourishing Governments which have been in the World.
And as in the same proportion that these things do any where prevail, so must naturally the
unhappiness of such a People; it is evident, that for any Prophane, Debauch'd, or Vicious Nation
to expect a durable Prosperity, is no other than to hope that God will in their Favour (who
have justly incur'd his Indignation) withhold the natural Effects of that Constitution and
Order of things, which he has with infinite Wisdom Establish'd: A Conceit too contradictious
to Reason, as well as too Presumptuous for any one, I suppose, to entertain.

FINIS.
