"Ah, mamma, (cried Alfred with tears in his eyes,) how I wish I had not set the trap to catch
that good Velvet; she might have had my cake, and welcome, if I had but known what she took
it for, how sorry I am! I wish Velvet was alive again, with all my heart."

"Did not I tell you, Alfred, you would be sorry for killing the nasty brown mouse, before the
day was over."

"Oh! yes, dear mamma, and so I am indeed; I wish you had told me the story before, and then
I should not have set the trap.--And so I suppose poor Downy will die, because she has no one
to feed her."

"Well, Alfred, shall I finish my story?

"Yes, if you please, mamma, but you don't know any more of it, do you?" "Only this, when Downy
found Velvet did not return, she died of grief. Thus ended the LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF THE FIELD-MOUSE."

"Ah, mamma," cried Alfred, bursting into tears, "what a cruel boy I have been! I have killed
both Downy and Velvet--I will never be so cruel again."

Mrs. Clifford, charmed with the sensibility of her little boy, kissed him most tenderly, saying,
"Dry your tears, my sweet Alfred, and resolve not to be so desirous of the death of a little
animal again. Though it is very necessary to kill them sometimes, or they would soon destroy
all our food and clothes; still when we are forced from necessity to kill any thing, we should
do it with as much humanity as we can, and never inflict on them unnecessary pain. I should
myself have been forced to set the trap for Velvet, only I did not like to see my little Alfred,
merely from revenge, wishing so eagerly for the death of a poor mouse, who did not know it
was doing any harm in eating the cake."

Alfred kissed his mother, and thanked her for her kindness in telling him the story; and wiping
his tears away, went into the garden to play till tea was ready.

    THE END.

Errors and Inconsistencies (noted by transcriber)

Spellings such as "recal" and "befel", and "eat" as a past-tense form, are unchanged. The author
almost always uses "lay" (present) for "lie", and "laid" for "lay" (past); no attempt was made
to correct these forms.
