    O hundred shores of happy climes!
      How swiftly streamed ye by the bark!
    At times the whole sea burned--at times
      With wakes of fire we tore the dark.

    New stars all night above the brim
      Of waters lightened into view;
    They climbed as quickly, for the rim
      Changed every moment as we flew.

    We came to warmer waves, and deep
      Across the boundless East we drove,
    Where those long swells of breaker sweep
      The nutmeg rocks, and isles of clove.

    For one fair Vision ever fled
      Down the waste waters day and night,
    And still we followed where she led,
      In hope to gain upon her flight.

PROLOGUE.

The traveller who reaches those enchanted gates of the Far East which swing open at the palm-girt
shores of Ceylon, enters upon a new range of thought and feeling. The first sight of tropical
scenery generally awakens a passionate desire for further experiences of the vast Archipelago
in the Southern Seas which girdles the Equator with an emerald zone. Lured onward by the scented
breeze in that eternal search for perfection destined to remain unsatisfied where every step
marks a higher ideal than the one already attained, the pilgrim pursues his endless quest,
for human aspiration has never yet touched the goal of desires and dreams. The cocoanut woods
of Ceylon and her equatorial vegetation lead fancy further afield, for the glassy straits of
Malacca beckon the wanderer down their watery highways to mysterious Java, where vast forests
of waving palms, blue chains of volcanic mountains, and mighty ruins of a vanished civilisation,
loom before the imagination and invest the tropical paradise with ideal attractions. The island,
seven hundred miles long, and described by Marianne North as "one magnificent garden of tropical
luxuriance," has not yet become a popular resort of the average tourist, but though lacking
some of those comforts and luxuries found under the British flag, it offers many compensations
in the wealth of beauty and interest afforded by scenery, architecture, and people. The two
days' passage from Singapore lies through a green chain of countless islets, once the refuge
of those pirates who thronged the Southern seas until suppressed by European power. The cliffs
of Banka, honeycombed with tin quarries, and the flat green shores of Eastern Sumatra, stretching
away to the purple mountains of the interior, flank the silvery straits, populous with native
proas, coasting steamers, sampans, and the hollowed log or "dug-out" which serves as the Malayan
canoe. Patched sails of scarlet and yellow, shaped like bats' wings, suggest gigantic butterflies
afloat upon the tranquil sea. The red roofs of whitewashed towns, and the tall shafts of white
lighthouses emphasise the rich verdure between the silvery azure of sky and water. The little
voyage ends at Tandjon Priok, nine miles from Batavia, for a volcanic eruption of Mount Salak
in 1699 filled up the ancient harbour, and necessitated the removal of shipping to a deep bay,
as the old city was landed high and dry through the mass of mud, lava, and volcanic sand, which
dammed up the lower reaches of the Tjiligong river, and destroyed connection with the sea.
The present model harbour, erected at tremendous cost, permits ships of heavy burden to discharge
passengers and cargo with comfort and safety at a long wharf, without that unpleasant interlude
of rocking sampans and reckless boatmen common to Eastern travel. A background of blue peaks
and clustering palms rises beyond the long line of quays and breakwaters flanked by the railway,
and a wealth of tropical scenery covers a marshy plain with riotous luxuriance. No Europeans
live either in Tandjon Priok or Old Batavia, and the locality was known for two centuries as
"the European graveyard." Flourishing Arab and Chinese campongs or settlements appear immune
from the terrible Java fever which haunts the morasses of the coast, and the industrial Celestial
who absorbs so much of Oriental commerce, possesses an almost superhuman imperviousness to
climatic dangers.

In the re-adjustment of power after the Fall of Napoleon, Java, invaded by England in 1811,
after a five years' interval of British rule under the enlightened policy of Sir Stamford Raffles,
was restored to the Throne of Holland. The supremacy of the Dutch East India Company, who,
after a prolonged struggle, acquired authority in Java as residuary legatee of the Mohammedan
Emperor, ended at the close of the eighteenth century. Perpetual warfare and rebellion, which
broke out in Central Java after the return of the island to the Dutch, taxed the resources
of Holland for five years. Immense difficulties arrested and delayed the development of the
fertile territory, until the "culture system" of forced labour within a certain area relieved
the financial pressure. One-fifth of village acreage was compulsorily planted with sugar-cane,
and one day's work every week was demanded by the Dutch Government from the native population.
The system was extended to tea and coffee; and indigo was grown on waste land not needed for
the rice, which constitutes Java's staff of life. Spices and cinchona were also diligently
cultivated under official supervision, and the lives of many explorers were lost in search
of the precious Kina-tree, until Java, after years of strenuous toil, now produces one-half
of that quinine supply which proves the indispensable safeguard of European existence on tropic
soil. The ruddy bark and scarlet branches of the cinchona groves glow with autumnal brightness
amid the evergreen verdure of the Javanese hills, and the "culture system," as a financial
experiment, proved, in spite of cavillers, a source of incalculable benefit to the natives
as well as to the colonists of Java. As we travel through the length and breadth of an island
cultivated even to the mountain tops with the perfection of detail common to the Dutch, as
the first horticulturists of the world, we realise the far-reaching wisdom, which in a few
decades transformed the face of the island, clearing vast tracks of jungle, and pruning that
riot of tropical nature which destroys as rapidly as it creates. A lengthened survey of Java's
political economy and past history would be out of place in a slight volume, written as a "compagnon
de voyage" to the wanderer who adds a cruise in the Archipelago to his Eastern itinerary, but
the colonial features of Dutch rule which have produced many beneficial results demand recognition,
for the varied characteristics of national genius and racial expansion suggest the myriad aspects
of that creative power bestowed on humanity made in the Divine Image, and fulfilling the great
destiny inspired by Heavenly Wisdom.

JAVA.

BATAVIA AND WELTEVREDEN.

From the railway station at Batavia the comfortless "dos-a-dos," colloquially known as the
sado, a vehicle resembling an elementary Irish car, and drawn by a rat-like Timor pony transports
us to the fashionable suburb of Weltevreden, away from the steamy port and fever-haunted commercial
capital. The march of modern improvement scarcely affects old-world Java, where jolting sado
and ponderous milord remain unchanged since the early days of colonisation, for time is a negligeable
quantity in this lotus-eating land, too apathetic even to adopt those alleviations of tropical
heat common to British India. The Java of the ancient world was considered "The Jewel of the
East," and possesses many claims to her immemorial title, but the stolid Dutchman of to-day
contents himself with the domestic arrangements which sufficed for his sturdy forefathers,
scorning the mitigations of swinging punkah or electric fan. The word Batavia signifies "fair
meadows," and these swampy fields of rank vegetation, exhaling a deadly miasma, were considered
such an adequate defence against hostile attack, that forts were deemed unnecessary in a locality
where 87,000 soldiers and sailors died in the Government Hospital during the space of twenty
years. Batavia proper is a commonplace city of featureless streets, brick-walled canals, and
ramshackle public buildings, but the residential town of Weltevreden, suggesting a glorified
Holland, combines the quaint charm of the mother country with the Oriental grace and splendour
of the tropics. The broad canals bordered by colossal cabbage-palms, the white bridges gay
with the many coloured garb of the Malay population, the red-tiled roofs embowered in a wealth
of verdure, and the pillared verandahs veiled with gorgeous creepers, tumbling in sheets of
purple and scarlet from cornice to floor, compose a characteristic picture, wherein Dutch individuality
triumphs over incongruous environment. Waving palms clash their fronds in the sea-breeze; avenues
of feathery tamarind and bending waringen trees surround Weltevreden with depths of green shadow;
the scarlet hybiscus flames amid tangled foliage, where the orange chalices of the flowering
Amherstia glisten from sombre branches, and hang like fairy goblets from the interwoven roofs
of tropical tunnels, pierced by broad red roads. On this Sunday afternoon of the waning year
which introduces us to Weltevreden, family groups are gathered round tea tables canopied with
flowers and palms, in the white porticos of the Dutch villas, and the startling déshabille
adopted by Holland in the Netherlands India almost defies description. The ladies, with stockingless
feet thrust into heelless slippers, and attired in the Malay sarong (two yards of painted cotton
cloth), supplemented by a white dressing-jacket, display themselves in verandah, carriage,
or street, in a garb only fit for the bath-room; while the men, lounging about in pyjamas,
go barefoot with the utmost sangfroid. The sarong, as worn by the slender and graceful Malay,
appears a modest and appropriate garb, but the grotesque effect of native attire on the broad-built
Dutchwoman affords conclusive proof that neither personal vanity nor a sense of humour pertain
to her stolid personality. Dutch Puritanism certainly undergoes startling transformations under
the tropical skies, and the Netherlands India produces a modification of European ideas concerning
what have been called "the minor moralities of life," unequalled in colonial experience. An
identical exhibition fills the open corridors of the Hotel Nederlanden, built round a central
court, and the general resort of the guests during the hot hours of the January days. Evening
dress is reserved for State occasions, and though sarong and kabaja be discarded at the nine
o'clock dinner, the blouse and skirt of morning wear in England suffices even at this late
hour for the fair Hollander, who also concedes so far to the amenities of civilisation as sometimes
to put on her stockings. So much of life in Java is spent in eating, sleeping, and bathing,
that but a small residuum can be spared for those outside interests which easily drop away
from the European when exiled to a colony beyond the beaten track of travel, and destitute
of that external friction which counteracts the enervating influence of the tropics. Comfort
is at a discount according to English ideas, but the arrangements of the Hotel Nederlanden,
under a kindly and capable proprietor, render it an exception to the prevailing rule. Each
guest is apportioned a little suite, consisting of bedroom, sitting-room, and a section of
the verandah, fitted up with cane lounge, table, and rocking-chair. The bathrooms, with porcelain
tank and tiles, leave nothing to be desired, and the "dipper-bath," infinitely cooler than
the familiar tub, becomes an unfailing delight. Ominous prophecies have emphasised the rashness
of coming to Java in the rainy season, but it has expended its force before January arrives,
and though daily showers cool the air, and the sky is often overcast, no inconvenience is experienced.
Lizards and mosquitoes are few, and in the marble-floored dining hall of cathedral proportions
the absence of a punkah is generally unfelt, though the fact of a tropical climate is realised
at the slightest exertion. The day begins at 6 a.m. with a cup of the Java coffee, which, at
first unpalatable, reveals by degrees the hidden excellence of the beverage, brought cold in
a stoppered cruet, the potent essence requiring a liberal admixture of boiling water. At 9
a.m. a solid but monotonous breakfast of sausage, bacon, eggs, and cheese is customary, with
the accompaniment of iced water, though tea and coffee are provided for the foreign traveller,
unused to the cold comfort which commends itself to Dutch taste. The mid-day riz-tavel from
beginning to end of a stay in Java, remains the terror of the English visitor. Each plate is
heaped with a mound of rice, on which scraps of innumerable ingredients are placed--meat, fish,
fowl, duck, prawns, curry, fried bananas, and nameless vegetables, together with chilis and
chutneys, sembals, spices, and grated cocoanut, in bewildering profusion. The Dutch digestion
triumphantly survives this severe test at the outset of the meal, and courageously proceeds
to the complementary courses of beefsteak, fritters and cheese. Fortunately for those of less
vigorous appetite, mine host of the Nederlanden, far in advance of his Javanese fraternity,
kindly provides a simple "tiffin" as an alternative to this Gargantuan repast. Afternoon tea
is served in the verandah, and at eight o'clock the Dutch contingent, having slept off the
effects of the rice table, prepares with renewed energies to attack a heavy dinner. New Year's
Eve is celebrated by a very bombardment of fireworks from the Chinese campong, and crowds hasten
to the fine Roman Catholic church for Benediction, Te Deum, and an eloquent, though to me incomprehensible,
Dutch sermon. Crisp muslins and uncovered heads for the women, and white linen garb for the
men, are the rule in church, for the slatternly undress of sarong and pyjamas is happily inadmissible
within the walls of the sanctuary, where the fair fresh faces and neat array compose a pleasing
picture which imagination would fail to evolve from the burlesque ugliness of the slovenly
déshabille wherewith the Dutch colonist disguises every claim to beauty or grace. On alluding
to the shock experienced by this grotesque travesty of native garb, a Dutch officer asserts
that there are in reality but few Dutch ladies in Java of pure racial stock, for one unhappy
result of remoteness from European influence is shown by the gradual merging of the Dutch colonists
into the Malay race by intermarriage. Exile to Java was made financially easy and attractive
by the Dutch Government, but it was for the most part a permanent separation from the mother
country, and a long term of years necessarily elapsed before the colonial planter could even
return for a short visit to his native land. The overwhelming force of public opinion against
mixed marriages, and the consequent degeneration of type, from a union which lowers one of
the contracting parties without raising the other, beats but faintly against these remote shores,
cut off from associations which mould and modify the crudities of individual thought in regions
swept by the full tide of contemporary life. The idea of welding European and Asiatic elements
into one race, as a defence against external aggression, possesses a superficial plausibility,
but ages of historical experiment only confirm the unalterable truth of the poetic dictum that

    East is East, and West is West,
      And never the two shall meet.
    Until they stand on either hand,
      At God's great Judgment Seat!

The sudden rise of an Oriental race to the position of a great world-power, and the apprehensions
of coming struggles for supremacy in Eastern waters, present many future complications concerning
Java, even if not weakened by the assimilation of her European colonists to an inferior race.

Neither landlord nor secretary of the Hotel Nederlanden spare time or trouble in arranging
the programme of sight-seeing, and but for their kindly help, only a partial success would
be possible, owing to the difficulties presented by the two unknown tongues of Dutch and Malay.
Ignorance of the former involves separation from the world as revealed by newspapers, and though
a smattering of "coolie Malay" is picked up with the aid of a handbook, and the "hundred words"
mastered, sanguinely asserted to suffice for colloquial needs, there are many occasions when
even the practice of this elementary language requires a more extensive vocabulary. At a New
Year's fête given by the proprietor of the hotel to his numerous Malay employés, we make our
first acquaintance with native music. Dancing girls, in mask and tinsel, gyrate to the weird
strains of the Gamelon, an orchestra of tiny gongs, bamboo tubes, and metal pipes. Actors perform
old-world dramas in dumb show, and conjurors in gaudy attire attract people of all ages to
those time-honoured feats of legerdemain which once represented the sorcery of the mystic East.
The simple Malay has not yet adopted the critical and unbelieving attitude which rubs the gilt
off the gingerbread or the bloom off the plum, and his fervid faith in mythical heroes and
necromantic exploits gives him the key to that kingdom of fancy often closed to a sadder if
wiser world. The electric tram provides an excellent method of gaining a general idea of Batavia
and Weltevreden; the winding route skirting canals and palm groves, campongs of basket-work
huts, and gay passers, the native markets, with their wealth of many-coloured fruit. Stacks
of golden bananas, olive-tinted dukus, rambutans like green chestnut-shells with scarlet prickles,
amber star-fruit, brown salak, the "forbidden apple," bread-fruit, and durian offer an embarassing
choice. Pineapples touch perfection on Java soil; cherimoya and mango, papaya and the various
custard-fruits, the lovely but tasteless rose-apple, and the dark green equatorial orange of
delicious flavour, afford a host of unfamiliar experiences. The winter months are the season
of the peerless mangosteen, in beauty as well as in savour the queen of tropical fruits. The
rose-lined purple globes, with the central ball of ivory whiteness in each fairy cup, suggest
fugitive essences of strawberry and nectarine combined with orange to produce this equatorial
marvel, also considered perfectly wholesome. The mangosteen, ripening just north or south of
the Equator, according to the alternations of the wet and dry seasons, cannot be preserved
long enough to reach the temperate zone, and though every year shows fresh varieties of tropical
fruit successfully transported to European markets, the mangosteen remains unknown outside
the narrow radius of the equatorial region to which the tree is indigenous. The flower markets
blaze with many-coloured roses, tons of gardenias and a wealth of white heavy-scented flowers,
such as tuberoses and Arabian jasmine. All the spices of the East, in fact, seem breathing
from these mounds of blossom, as well as from gums and essences distilled from them in archaic
fashion. Transparent sachets, filled with the scented petals of ylang-ylang, fill the air with
intoxicating sweetness, and outside the busy passer, a frangipanni-tree, the native sumboya
or "flower of the dead," just opening a white crowd of golden-hearted blossoms to the sun,
adds another wave of perfume to the floral incense, steaming from earth to sky with prodigal
exuberance.

Batavia possesses few objects of interest. The dismal green-shuttered Stadkirche, a relic of
Dutch Calvinism; the earliest warehouse of the Netherlands Company, a commonplace lighthouse,
and the gate of Peter Elberfeld's dwelling (now his tomb), with his spear-pierced skull above
the lintel, as a reminder of the sentence pronounced on traitors to the Dutch Government, comprise
the scanty catalogue. Antiquities and archæological remains fill a white museum of classical
architecture on the Koenig's Plein, a huge parade ground, flanked by the Palace of the Governor-General.
Gold and silver ornaments, gifts from tributary princes, shield and helmet, dagger, and kris,
of varied stages in Malay civilisation, abound in these spacious halls, where every Javanese
industry may be studied. Buddhist and Hindu temples have yielded up a treasury of images, censers,
and accessories of worship, the excavations of ruined cities in Central Java, long overgrown
with impenetrable jungle, opening a mine of archæological wealth in musical instruments, seals,
coins, headgear, chairs and umbrellas of State. Golden pipes and betel-boxes show the perfection
of the goldsmith's art, and metal statues vie with those of sculptured wood or stone. Here
Captain Cook left his treasure trove from the Southern seas, and the Council Chamber of the
Museum contains portraits and souvenirs of the great navigators who sailed into the uncharted
ocean of geographical discovery, and in various stages of their adventurous careers anchored
at Java, to display the wondrous trophies of unknown lands in the island then regarded as the
farthest outpost of contemporary civilisation.

The toelatingskaart, or Javanese passport, formerly indispensable for insular travel beyond
the radius of forty miles from Batavia, though not yet obsolete, proves practically needless,
and is never once demanded during a six weeks' stay. The small addition contributed to the
rich revenue by this useless official "permit," appears the sole reason for retaining it, now
that vexatious restrictions are withdrawn. In the intervals of arranging an up-country tour
from monotonous Weltevreden, destitute of any attraction beyond the white colonnades and verdant
groves flanking sleepy canals and quaint bridges, the local industry of sarong stippling affords
a curious interest. Every city in Java possesses a special type of this historic dress, represented
on the walls of temples dating before the Christian era, and worn by the Malay races from time
immemorial. This strip of cotton cloth, which forms the attire both of men and women, is twisted
firmly round the body, and requires no girdle to secure it. Palm-fronds, birds, and animals,
geometric patterns, religious emblems, fruits and flowers, are represented in bewildering confusion.
The girls, with flower-decked hair and scanty garb, occupy a long, low shed, filled with rude
frames for stretching the cloth, painted in soft-tinted dyes--brown, blue, and amber for the
most part--with tapering funnels. These waxed cloths allow infinite scope for native imagination,
only a small panel of formal design being obligatory, the remaining surface fancifully coloured
at will in harmonious hues. No two sarongs are alike, and the painted battek, notwithstanding
the simplicity of the cotton background, represents an amount of labour and finish which makes
the archaic garment a costly, though almost indestructible production. The graceful slandang,
a crossed scarf of the same material, only serves as a shoulder-strap, wherein the brown Malay
baby sits contentedly, for the ugly white jacket of the Dutchwoman is now compulsory on the
native. Every variety of battek, basket-work, mats, and quaint silver or brass ware, is brought
by native peddlers to the broad verandahs of the hotel, the patient and gentle people content
to spend long hours on the marble steps, dozing between their scanty bargains, or crimsoning
their months with the stimulating morsel of betel-nut, said to allay the hunger, thirst, and
exhaustion of the steaming tropics. The conquered race, cowed by ages of tyranny under native
princes, possesses those mild and effeminate characteristics fostered by a languid and enervating
climate. That the salient angles of the sturdy Dutch character, which accomplished so many
feats of endurance in the earlier days of the colony, should undergo rapid disintegration by
intermarriage with the native stock, must arouse regret in all who realise the claims to respect
possessed by the fighting forefathers of Holland's tropical dependencies.

Educational matters were for centuries in abeyance, and until 1864 the Malays were forbidden
to learn the language of their European rulers. Many dialects are found in Java's wide territory,
but Low Malay has been declared the official tongue, and with the advance of public opinion,
wider views prevail concerning the rights of the subject race. A good Roman Catholic priest,
one of the most enlightened and liberal Dutchmen encountered in Java, asserts that in the schools
of the Colonial Government, the Malay boy possesses a mathematical facility superior to that
of the Dutch scholar, in spite of the advantage accruing from hereditary education.

At the sunset hour, Batavian life awakens from the long slumbers of the tropical afternoon,
and as the golden light filters through the waving palms, the long Schul-Weg, beside the central
canal, fills with saunterers, enjoying the delights of that brief spell, when peace and coolness
fall on the world before the sudden twilight drops veil after veil of deepening gloom, merging
into the "darkness which may be felt," for the twelve hours of the tropical night. Gathering
clouds reveal but scanty glimpses of the moon in these January weeks, but through rifts in
the sombre canopy, the Southern stars hang low in the dome of heaven, and shine like burning
lamps, appearing almost within reach of an outstretched hand.

BUITENZORG.

The first destination of the up-country traveller in Java is Buitenzorg, the Dutch "Sans Souci,"
containing the Governor-General's rural Palace, the houses of Court officials, and the superb
Botanical Garden, which ranks first among the horticultural triumphs of the world. The two
hours' journey by the railway, which now traverses the whole of Java, shows a succession of
tropical landscapes, appearing unreal in their fantastic and dream-like beauty. The glowing
green of rice-fields, the dense forests of swaying palms, the porphyry tints of the teeming
soil, and the purple mountains, carved into the weird contours peculiar to volcanic ranges,
frame myriad pictures of unfamiliar native life with dramatic effect. Villages of woven basket-work
cluster beneath green curtains of banana and spreading canopies of palm, the central mosque
surmounting the tiny huts with many-tiered roofs, and walls inlaid with gleaming tiles of white
and blue. Brown figures, with gay sarong and turbaned headgear, bring bamboo buckets to moss-grown
wells, gray water-buffaloes crop marshy herbage, a little bronze-hued figure seated on each
broad back, and busy workers stand knee-deep in slush, to transplant emerald blades of rice
or to gather the yellow crops, for seedtime and harvest go on together in this fertile land.
Our train halts at Depok, a Christian village unique in Java, for the religious history of
the island shows little missionary enterprise among a race strangely indifferent to the claims
of faith, and lightly casting away one creed after another, with a carelessness which has ever
proved a formidable bar to spiritual progress. The Portuguese Jesuits were expelled by the
Dutch, and English efforts at conversion were succeeded by a general exclusion of foreign missionaries.
Public opinion eventually prevented the continuance of this despotic rule, and at the present
day a certain number of Roman and Protestant clergy are supported by the Government, but Roman
zeal outstrips the niggardly spiritual provision, and proves the appreciation in which it is
held by full churches and devout worshippers. The Mohammedanism of the Malay lacks the fiery
fervour common to Islam, and his slack hands are ever ready to forego all symbols of faith.
From the region of rice and tapioca, maize and sugar-cane, we reach the great cacao plantations,
hung with chocolate-coloured pods, and the ruddy kina-groves on the lower slopes of the mountain
chain. The palms are everywhere, clashing their huge fronds, and undulating in waves of fiery
green, the light and shadow of the golden evening reflected on the swaying foliage. Stately
Palmyra, slender areca, graceful pandang with a length of scarlet crowning each smooth grey
stem, the mighty royal palm, king of the forest, spreading cocoanuts, and a hundred unknown
varieties, soaring among bread-fruit and teak, nutmeg and waringen, reveal the inexhaustible
powers of tropical Nature. Buitenzorg occupies an ideal position between the blue and violet
peaks of Gedeh and Salak, the guardian mountains of the fairy spot, perennially green with
spring-like freshness, from the daily showers sweeping across the valley from one or other
of the lofty crests, and possessing a delicious climate at an altitude of eight hundred feet.
The Hotel Bellevue, where back rooms should be secured on account of a superb prospect, comprising
river, mountain and forest, stands near the great entrance of the world-famous Gardens, and
our balcony commands a profound ravine, carved by a clear river, winding away between forests
of palm to the dark cone of Mount Salak, the climax of the picture. The artist destined to
interpret the soul of Java is yet unborn, or unable to grasp the character of her unique and
distinctive scenery, but a village of plaited palm-leaves, accentuating this tropical Eden,
brings it down to the human level, where soft Malay voices, glimpses of domestic life, and
a canoe afloat on the brimming stream, remind us that we are still on terra firma, and not
gazing at a dreamland Paradise beyond earthly ken. Sleeping accommodation in the hills suggests
little comfort. A hard mattress beneath a sheet is the sole furniture of the huge four-poster,
surrounded by thick muslin curtains to exclude air and creeping things; pillows are stuffed
hard with cotton-down, and no coverings are provided--an unalterable custom possessing obvious
disadvantages in a climate reeking with damp, where the walls of a room closed for a day or
two become green with mould. Rheumatic stiffness on waking is a matter of course in humid Java,
for the hour between darkness and dawn contains a concentrated essence of dew, mist, and malaria,
which penetrates to the very marrow of unaccustomed bones, even when it lacks the frequent
accompaniment of the violent cascade known as "a tropical shower." The glorious Botanical Garden
is approached by a mighty avenue of colossal kanari-trees, over a hundred feet high, with yellow
light filtering through the fretted roof of interlacing boughs, which suggests a vast aisle
in some primeval forest. Stately columns and spreading roots garlanded with stag-horn ferns,
waving moss, white and purple orchids, or broad-leaved creepers, falling in sheets and torrents
of shining foliage and knitting tree to tree, attest the irrepressible growth of vegetation,
which flings a many-coloured veil of blossom and leaf over root, branch, and stem. A fairy
lake glows with the pink and crimson blossoms of the noble Victoria Regia, the huge leaves
like green tea-trays floating on the water, where a central fountain adds prismatic radiance
to the scenic effect of the splendid lilies. Climbing palms and massive creepers, splashed
with orange, scarlet, and gold, tumble in masses from lofty branches, and the dazzling Bougainvillea
flings curtains of roseate purple over wall and gateway. A dense thicket of frangipanni scents
the air with the symbolic blossoms, shining like stars from grey-green boughs of sharp-cut
leaves. A copse of splendid tree-ferns flanks the forest-like plantation known as "The Thousand
Palms," and beneath dusky avenues of waringen (a variety of the banyan species, which strikes
staff-like boughs into the earth and springs up again in caverns of foliage), herds of deer
are wandering, snatching at drooping vines, or sheltering from the fierce sun in depths of
impenetrable shade. Tufts of red-stemmed Banka palms cluster on the green islets of lake and
river, vista after vista opens up, each mysterious aisle appearing more lovely than the last,
and luring the wanderer to the climax formed by a terraced knoll, commanding a superb view
of Gedeh and Salak, the twin summits of chiselled turquoise, gashed by the amethyst shadows
of deep ravines, with Gedeh's curl of volcanic smoke staining the lustrous azure of the sky.
Many-coloured tree carnations, gorgeous cannas and calladiums, copses of snowy gardenia, and
flowering shrubs of rainbow hues, blaze with splendour, or exhale their wealth of perfume on
the languid air, thronged with the invisible souls of the floral multitude. Graceful rattans
shoot up in tall ladders of foliage-hidden cane, climbing to the topmost fronds of the loftiest
palm, and, unless ruthlessly cut down, overthrowing the stately tree with their fatal embrace.
Sausage and candle trees, with strange parodies of prosaic food and waxen tapers, climbing
palms, sometimes extending for five hundred feet, and gigantic blossoms like crimson trumpets,
or delicately-tinted shells of ocean, comprise but a tithe of Nature's wonders, crowned by
the mighty "Rafflesia," the largest flower in the world, with each vast red chalice often measuring
a circumference of six feet. A hundred native gardeners are employed in this park-like domain,
and seventy men work in the adjacent culture-garden of forty acres, where experiments in grafting
and acclimatizing are carried on, as well as in the supplementary garden of Tjibodas, beautifully
situated on the lower slopes of Mount Salak. The white palace of the Governor-General faces
the lake, fed by the lovely river Tjiligong, winding in silver loops round verdant lawn and
palm-clad hill, or expanding into bamboo-fringed lakes, and bringing perennial freshness into
the tropical Eden of sun-bathed Java.

Beyond the fretted arches of the great kanari avenue, the white tomb of Lady Raffles, who died
during her husband's term of office in the island, forms a pathetic link with the past. When
the colony was restored to Holland, a clause in the treaty concerning it, made the perpetual
care of this monument, to one deeply loved and mourned, binding upon the Dutch Governor--a
condition loyally observed during the century since the cessation of English rule. Cinnamon
and clove scent the breeze which whispers mysterious secrets to the swaying plumes of the tall
sago-palms, and dies away in the delicate foliage of tamarind and ironwood tree. A network
of air roots makes a grotesque circle round the spreading boughs of the banyan grove, mahogany
and sandal-wood, ebony and cork, ginger-tree and cardamom, mingle their varied foliage, the
translucency of sun-smitten green shading through deepening tones into the sombre tints of
ilex and pine with exquisite gradation. Flamboyant trees flaunt fiery pyramids of blossom high
in the air, and the golden bouquets of the salacca light up dusky avenues, where large-leaved
lianas rope themselves from tree to tree in cables of vivid green. Bare stems, except in the
palms, are unknown in this richly-decorated temple of Nature; climbing blade-plants with sword-like
leaves of gold-striped verdure, huge orchids like many-coloured birds and butterflies fluttering
in the wind, wreathe trunk and branch with fantastic splendour, and matted creepers weave curtains
of dense foliage from spreading boughs. The austere and scanty vegetation of Northern climes,
which gives a distinct outline and value to every leaf and flower, has nothing in common with
the prodigal and passionate beauty of the tropical landscape, where the wealth of earth is
flung broadcast at our feet in mad profusion. Day by day the marvellous gardens of Buitenzorg
take deeper hold of mind and imagination. The early dawn, when the dark silhouettes of the
palms stand etched against the rose-tinted heavens, the hot noontide in the shadows of the
colossal kanari-trees, the sunset gold transfiguring the foliage into emerald fire, and spilling
pools of liquid amber upon the mossy turf, or the white moonlight which transmutes the forest
aisles into a fairy world of sable and silver, invest this vision of Paradise with varied aspects
of incomparable beauty. The surrounding scenery, though full of interest, seems but the setting
of the priceless gem, and when inexorable Time, the modern angel of the flaming sword, at length
bars the way, and banishes us from our Javanese Eden, the exiled heart turns back perpetually
to the floral sanctuary, the antitype of that Divinely-planted Garden on the dim borderland
of Time which revealed and fulfilled the primeval beauty of earth's morning hours.

SOEKABOEMI AND SINDANGLAYA.

Soekaboemi (Desire of the World), a favourite sanatorioum of the Dutch, is approached by an
exquisite railway, curving round the purple heights of forest-girt Salak. The usual afternoon
deluge weeps itself away, palm plumes and cassava boughs, overhanging the silvery Tjiligong,
drop showers of diamonds into the current, and giant bamboos creak in the spicy wind, redolent
of gardenia and clove. The hills, scaled by green rice-terraces, each with tiny rill and miniature
cascade, are vocal with murmuring waters. Lilac plumbago, red hybiscus, and golden allemanda
mingle with pink and purple lantana, yellow daisies, and hedges of scarlet tassels, enclosing
wicker huts in patches of banana and cocoanut. Brown girls, in blue and orange sarongs, occupy
the steps of a basket-work shrine, from whence an unknown god, smeared with ochre, extends
a sceptred hand, for Hinduism left deep traces on inland Java, dim with the dust of vanished
creeds. The expense and trouble of former travel by the superb post-roads, made at terrible
sacrifice of life in earlier days, is now done away with, though the noble avenues and picturesque
shelters, erected for protection from sun or rain, suggest a pleasant mode of leisurely progress.
No trains may run at night, not only on account of native incompetence, but from dangers caused
by constant geographical changes on this volcanic soil, where rivers suddenly alter their course,
and earthquakes obstruct the way with yawning chasms or heaps of debris. A paternal Government
provides the traveller with a half-way house, erecting a large hotel at Maos, with uniform
rates, entirely for the benefit of the passenger by rail. Trains are built on the American
plan, stations are spacious and airy, refreshments easily secured, and every halting-place
offers an embarras de richesses in the shape of tropical fruits, wherewith to supplement or
replace the solidity of the Dutch commissariat. Coffee and tea plantations in ordered neatness,
contrast with the untamed profusion of forest vegetation, clothing sharp promontory and shelving
terrace. Dusky villages cling like birds' nests to ledges of rock, screw-palms with airy roots
frame mountain tarns, and a Brazilian Emperor-palm, with smooth column bulging into a pear-shaped
base, accentuates the sunset glory from a crag crowned by the black canopy of colossal fronds.
The Preanger Regency was the heart of ancient Mataram, that historic kingdom of old-world Java
round which perpetual warfare waged for centuries.

Language and customs change as we cross the saddle between the blue peaks of Salak and Gedeh;
gay crowds bring fruits to picturesque wayside markets, bearing bamboo poles laden with golden
papaya and purple mangosteen, or plaited baskets containing the conglomerate native cuisine.
The elastic and gracefully-modelled figures of the Soendanese populace betoken a purer race
than that of the steamy Batavian lowlands, where foreign elements deteriorate the native stock.
The Hotel Victoria at Soekaboemi consists of detached white buildings round tree-filled courts,
erected on the "pavilion system." Every two visitors occupy a tiny bungalow of two bedrooms,
opening on a spacious verandah divided by a screen, and each section provided with lamp, rocking-chair,
and tea-table, the long public dining hall being approached by a covered alley. The rain, swishing
down through the night in torrents and cataracts, clears at sunrise, and though heavy clouds
still veil the heights of Salak, the transparent beauty of the morning crystallises the atmosphere,
and sharply defines every feature of the landscape. The country roads, shaded by towering palms
and fruit-laden mangos, glow with a continuous procession of brown figures, the women clad
in the universal sarong, but men and children often in Nature's garb, with touches of orange
or crimson in scarf and turban. Water-oxen and buffaloes, goats and sheep, vary the throng,
but cattle fare badly in fertile Java, where the all-pervading rice ousts the pasture-land.
Glorious bamboos form arches of feathery green meeting across the road, and the busy China
campong, or désar in Preanger parlance, is full of life and movement with the first streak
of day, for all trade in Java depends upon the indefatigable industry of the Celestial. The
idle gambling Malay, though an expert hunter and fisher, takes no thought for the morrow, and
is protected by the Dutch Government from ruin by an enforced demand of rice for storage, according
to the numbers of the family. Every village contains the great Store Barn of plaited palm leaves,
so that, in case of need, the confiscated rice can be doled out to the improvident native,
who thus contributes to the support of his family in times of scarcity. This regulation relieves
want without pauperising, the common garner merely serving as a compulsory savings bank. Many
salutary laws benefit the Malay, possessing a notable share of tropical slackness, and the
lack of initiative partly due to a servile past under the sway of tyrannical native princes.
The little brown people of Java, eminently gentle and tractable, are honest enough for vendors
of eatables to place a laden basket at the roadside for the refreshment of the traveller, who
drops a small coin into a bamboo tube fastened to a tree for this purpose. The customary payment
is never omitted, and at evening the owner of the basket collects the money, and brings a fresh
supply of food for future wayfarers. Country districts demonstrate the fact of Java being a
creedless land. This is Sunday, and the Feast of the Epiphany, but the only honour paid to
the day consists in a gayer garb, and a band playing for an hour in the palm-shaded garden.
Work goes on in rice-field and plantation, but no church bell rings from the closed chapel
outside the gates, and no sign of religion is evident, whether from mosque, temple, or church.
Lovely lanes form alluring vistas. The pretty désas of plaited palm and bamboo, hiding in depths
of tropical woodland, with blue thunbergia clambering over every verandah, and the Preanger
girls, with their brilliant slandangs of orange and scarlet, amber and purple, make vivid points
of colour in the foreground of blue mountain and dusky forest. A copper-coloured boy carries
on his head a basket of gold-fish large as salmon, the westering sun glittering on the ruddy
scales.

Traditional servility remains ingrained in Preanger character, and the crouching obeisance
known as the dodok, formerly insisted upon, is still observed by the native to his European
masters, the humble posture giving place to kneeling on a nearer approach. The kind proprietor
of the Soekaboemi Hotel offers every facility to those guests anxious to penetrate below the
surface of Soendanese life, placing his carriage and himself at the disposal of the visitor,
and affording a mine of information otherwise unattainable, for books on Java are few and far
between, and the work of Sir Stamford Raffles continues the best authority on island life and
customs, though a century has elapsed since it was written. Why, one asks in amazement, did
England part with this Eastern Paradise? rich not only in vegetation, but containing unexplored
treasures of precious metal and the vast mineral wealth peculiar to volcanic regions, where
valuable chemical products are precipitated by the subterranean forces of Nature's mysterious
laboratory. In the far-off days when "the grand tour" of Europe was the climax of the ordinary
traveller's ambition, beautiful Java was relinquished on the plea of being an unknown and useless
possession, too far from the beaten track of British sailing ships to be of practical value.
The remonstrances of Sir Stamford Raffles, and his representations of future colonial expansion,
were regarded as the dreams of a romantic enthusiast, and the noble English Governor, in advance
of his age, while effecting during his brief tenure of office results unattainable by a century
of ordinary labour, found his efforts wasted and his work undone. Instead of returning home,
he applied himself heroically to the developement of Singapore, the eternal monument of patriotic
devotion and invincible courage.

The line to Tjandjoer, the starting point for Sindanglaya, traverses one of the exquisite plains
characteristic of Java. Mountain walls, with palm-fringed base and violet crest, bound a fertile
expanse, where myriad brooks foam through fairy arches of feathery bamboo and long vistas of
spreading palm fronds. Rice in every stage of growth, from flaming green to softest yellow,
covers countless terraces, the picturesque outlines of their varied contours enhancing the
beauty of the fantastic scene. A sado, with a team of three tiny ponies, dashes up the long
avenue leading to the palm-fringed hills, the mighty Amherstia trees forming aisles of dark
green foliage, brightened with the vivid glow of orange red blossoms. The broad road is a kaleidoscope
of brilliant colour, for native costume vies with the dazzling tints of tropical Nature as
we advance further into the Preangers. The gay headgear, worn turbanwise, with two ends standing
upright above plaited folds, and magenta kabajas, with slandangs of apple green, amber or purple,
make a blaze of colour against the forest background, or glow amidst the dusky shadows of palm-thatched
sheds, where thirsty travellers imbibe pink and yellow syrups, the favourite beverages of the
Malay race. The ascending road commands superb views of the mountain chain, and the rambling
two-storied hotel, widened by immense verandahs, stands opposite cloud-crowned Gedeh, half-veiled
by the spreading column of volcanic smoke. The misty blue of further hills leads the eye to
the three weird peaks of the Tangkoeban Prahoe, the boat-shaped "Ark" regarded as the Ararat
of Java, for the universal tradition of the great Deluge underlies the religious history welded
from Moslem, Buddhist, and Hindu elements. Legendary lore clusters round the petrified "Ark"
in which the progenitors of the Malayan stock escaped from the Noachian flood. The storm-tossed
and water-logged boat, lodged between jutting rocks, was reversed that it might dry in the
sun, but the weary voyagers who traditionally peopled the Malay Archipelago remained in the
lotus-eating land, and the disused "Ark" or Prau, fossilizing through the ages, became a portion
of the peaks whereon it rested. The sacred mountain developed into a place of pilgrimage and
prayer, and the ruins of richly-carved temples, together with four broken flights of a thousand
steps, denote the former importance ascribed to the great Altar of Nature, and the power of
religion on the social life of the past. Generations of later inhabitants, dwelling in flimsy
huts of bamboo and thatch, regarded the mysterious ruins of the Tankahan Prahoe as the work
of giants or demons, and the haunted hill as a mysterious resort of evil spirits. In lofty
Sindanglaya, the swaying palms of the lowlands yield to glorious tree-ferns, shading road and
ravine with feathery canopies of velvet green. A lake of azure crystal mirrors a thick fringe
of the great fronds, and on every parapet of the ruddy cliffs the living emerald of the lanceolated
foliage glows in vivid contrast with the splintered crags. Sindanglaya is the refuge of fever-stricken
Europeans from malarial coast or inland swamp, but the hotel is now empty of invalids. The
kind proprietor lavishes time and care on English guests, and the attentive Malay "room-boys,"
squatting on the verandah outside our doors, fear to lose sight of their charges for a moment,
lest some need of native help should arise. They watch hand and eye like faithful dogs, for
their language is unintelligible to us as ours to them, and the only attempt at speech is "Chow-chow,
mister!" when the dinner-bell rings, the mystic words accompanied by a realistic pantomime
of mouth and fingers.

The following morning dawns like an ideal day of June, and we start in chairs, carried by four
coolies, for the beautiful Falls of Tjibereum. A mountain road winds through rice-fields and
tree-ferns towards fold upon fold of lilac peaks, until we reach the mountain garden of Tjibodas,
the beautiful supplement of incomparable Buitenzorg. A strange sense of remoteness belongs
to this lonely pleasaunce of the upper world, on a sheltered slope of ever-burning Gedeh, quiescent
now save for the blue curl of sulphurous smoke, which gives perpetual warning of those smouldering
forces ever ready to devastate the surrounding country. Subterranean activity increases during
the rainy season, and tremors of earthquake occasionally startle the equanimity of those unused
to the perils of existence on this thin crust of Mother Earth, for Java's teeming soil and
population rest upon an ominous fissure of the globe's surface, and twelve of the forty-five
volcanos on this island of terror and beauty are still moderately active, sometimes displaying
sudden outbursts of energy. The green lawns and towering camphor trees of Tjibodas suggest
the spellbound beauty of some enchanted spot, unprofaned by human foot. A glassy lake mirrors
the tall bamboos and feathery tamarinds, their slender and sensitive foliage motionless in
the still air of the dewy dawn. Huge coleas accentuate the spring verdure with heavy masses
of bronze and crimson, and magnolias exhale intoxicating odours from snowy chalices. Blue lilies
and flaxen pampas grass grow in thickets upon the emerald slopes, and the ordered loveliness
of the mountain Paradise, walled in by dense jungle and savage precipice, brings the glamour
of dreamland into the stern environment of mysterious forest and frowning peak. A rudely-paved
and mossy path, shadowed by the black foliage of stately casuarinas, leads into the gloomy
jungle. The forest monarchs are curtained with tangled creepers and roped together with serpent-like
lianas, stag-horn ferns, and green veils of filmy moss fluttering from every bough. A swampy
path through rank grass and rough boulders pierces the dense thickets, matted together with
inextricable confusion, teak and tamarind, acacia and bread-fruit, palm and tree-fern losing
their own characteristics and merging themselves into concrete form. The appalling stillness
and solemnity of the dense jungle appears emphasised by a solitary brown figure, with pipe
and betel-box, beneath a thatched shed at an angle of the narrow track, where he presides over
a little stall of cocoanuts, bananas, and coloured syrups, for the refreshment of coolies on
their way from the Tjibodas garden to villages across the heights of Gedeh. No voice ever seems
raised in these remote recesses of the mountains, where even the children of each brown hamlet
play silently as figures in a dream. Our bearers, swishing through wet grass and splashing
across brimming brooks, push with renewed energies up a steep ascent to the heart of the wild
solitude, where three mighty waterfalls dash in savage grandeur from a range of over hanging
cliffs into a churning river, descending by continuous rapids over a stairway of brown-striped
trap-rock and swirling between lichen-clad banks, to lose itself in the green gloom of the
impenetrable woods. One of these huge cascades would make the fortune of a Swiss valley, and
we need no further efforts of our willing bearers in the cause of sight-seeing, but as neither
words nor gestures prove intelligible to Western obtuseness, a brown coolie seizes each arm,
and rushes us up a grassy hill to a huge cavern, hung with myriad bats, and containing a pool
of crystal water. The simple minds of these kindly mountaineers shirk no trouble for the benefit
of the stranger, who, though regarded as a madman, must be humoured as such, not only to the
top of his bent, but often beyond it. A descent through rice-fields and désas skirts the serrated
cliffs of Gedeh's northward side, though tree-ferns growing in thousands afford shelter from
the daily showers. The sudden passion of tropical rain dies away, leaving an atmosphere of
unearthly transparency. Gedeh, carved in amethyst, leans against a primrose sky, streaked by
the puff of white smoke from the crater. Villagers returning from work brighten the road with
patches of scarlet and yellow; children, clad only in necklaces of red seeds and silver bangles,
running about amid groups of women in painted battek, with brown babies carried in the orange
or crimson folds of the slandang, pause before the doorways of woven basket-work huts, or carry
crates of yellow bananas and strings of purple mangosteens, to supplement the "evening rice"
of their frugal meal. The Malay races have been called "the flower of the East," noted for
their soft voices and courteous manners in the days of old, but European intercourse obliterates
native characteristics, and the inhabitant of the sea-coast, or of the larger towns, unpleasantly
imitates the brusquerie of his Dutch masters, and even exaggerates it. The Soendanese of the
Preanger hills, less in contact with the external world, retains traces of life's ancient simplicity,
and though a keen intelligence forms no part of his mental equipment, his desire to please
and satisfy his employer is of pathetic intensity.

The Governor-General of Java, whose stipend is of double the amount received by the American
President, owns a country palace at Sindanglaya, in addition to the splendid official residences
at Batavia and Buitenzorg. A lovely walk leads from this flower-girt mansion to a pavilion
on the Kasoer hill, commanding a prospect of four mountain ranges, outlined in tender hues
of lavender and turquoise against the cobalt sky. In the foreground stretches a fertile plain,
with bamboo and sugar-cane varying the eternal rice in brilliant shades of green and gold,
always decorative, from the first emerald blade to the amber-tinted straw, for the sacred grain
possesses a beauty far exceeding that of wheat, barley, or rye.

Undulating lines and ascending terraces break the uniformity of the lovely plains with the
fascination of weird contour and fanciful design, intricate as the pattern traced on the native
sarong. The rice-culture of these fields and valleys is a perfect survival of the primeval
system, unchanged since the days when "the gift of the gods" was first bestowed on primitive
man in this land of plenty. The peasant, toiling in the flooded sawas, and occupied from seedtime
to harvest in the arduous labour demanded by the rice-field, combines with his agricultural
work the idea of a sacred duty to the divinities who gave him the staple commodity whereon
his life mainly depends. Cocoanut and sugar-cane, maize and tapioca, banana and cassava, supplement
the rice, but it ranks above all other products of the teeming soil, for sacramental efficacy
and supernatural origin have hallowed the "grain of heaven" from the very dawn of history,
and the hereditary belief in the efficacy of the sacred crop still remains mystically rooted
in the sub-consciousness of the Malay race.

GAROET AND HER VOLCANO.

The occasional drawback of weeping skies is counterbalanced by the gorgeous vegetation only
seen to perfection in the rainy season, and that clouds should sometimes veil the burning blue
to mitigate Equatorial sunshine proves a source of satisfaction to those who fail to appreciate
the Rip Van Winkle life of womankind in Java. The journey to Garoet supplies a succession of
vivid pictures, illustrating the individuality of the insular scenery. The weird outlines of
volcanic ranges, shading from palest azure to deepest plum-colour, the dreamlike beauty of
Elysian plains, and the stately palm-forests extending league upon league, with mighty vans
clashing in the mountain breeze, assume magical charm as we penetrate into the heart of the
alluring land. Two pyramidal peaks, Haroeman and Kaleidon, rise sheer from the fair plain of
Lelés in colossal stairways of green rice-terraces. Knots of palm shelter innumerable villages
which dot the mountain flanks, the woven huts fragile as houses of cards, but built up on identical
sites through countless ages, recorded in perennial characters of living green on these twin
trophies of primitive agriculture. Many travellers have commented on the strange undertone
of music, echoing from a thousand silvery rills and tiny cascades, which follow the verdant
lines of terrace or parapet, and make the shimmering air vocal with melody, like the distant
song of surf on a coral reef. Variety of form belongs to all Javanese agriculture as the result
of handicraft, for the peasant unconsciously puts his own personality into his toil. The exquisite
tints of the rice in different stages of growth display a translucence indescribable except
in terms of light and fire. The amber gleam of young shoots, the green flames of the springing
crop, the pulsating emerald of later growth, and the golden sheen of ripened ears, invest the
"gift of the gods" with unearthly radiance. The Eastern mind has ever responded to Nature's
touch, for the great Mother whispers her closest secrets to simple hearts, and science now
realises that civilisation has broken many of the subtle links which in earlier days were mystic
bonds of union between man and the universe.

Malay idiosyncracy evidences the survival of many primal influences forgotten or denied by
races of higher type and deeper culture. Very little is known concerning the Malayan people
who mingled with almost every Oriental stock. Amphibious tastes suggest picturesque traditions
of prolonged voyaging in search of fresh fishing grounds to supply the needs of a rapidly multiplying
population. A strong Malay element exists even in far-off Japan, and the wide ramifications
of the nomadic stock can be traced to broad rivers encountered on the southward journey, and
luring stragglers from the main body by the mysterious glamour of winding water-ways piercing
the tangled forests, and pointing to unknown realms of hope or promise. The Malay retains many
of the hereditary gifts bestowed on the untaught children of Nature, and, in spreading his
language and customs far over the vast Pacific, adopted few extraneous ideas from the world
through which he wandered. His primeval instincts still sway his life under other conditions.
Marvellous skill in hunting, fishing, boat-building, and navigation in tornado-swept waters,
remains to him. The deft weaving of palm-leaf hut and wall of defence creates a village or
destroys it at lightning speed. Even now his basket-work home is never built on dry land, if
water can be found wherein to plant the supporting poles of the fragile dwellings, suggesting
the impermanence of a nomadic race. The Malay never travels on foot to any place which can
possibly be reached by water, his native element; winds and tides have imbued him with something
of their own unstable and changing character, and the sea which nurtured him is still the supreme
factor in his life. Feet vie with fingers in marvellous capacity, and to see a native cocoanut
gatherer run up the polished stem of a swaying palm, with greater ease and swiftness than anyone
shows in mounting a ladder, transports thought to the distant past, when the ancestral stock,
disembarking from the rude canoes at nightfall, sought an evening meal on the edge of the palm-forest,
bowed beneath the weight of green and yellow nuts a hundred feet overhead. What wonder if in
lands of perpetual summer the syren song of some "long bright river" should lure the storm-tossed
mariners from the perilous seas to the comparative security of inland life! The stern environment
of Northern poverty stands out in terrible contrast with the teeming prodigality of tropical
Nature, offering all the richest fruits of earth in full measure to these early wanderers across
the Southern seas.

The mountain railway, curving round ridge or precipice and spanning sombre gorge with bridge
and aqueduct, affords superb views of the unrivalled plains. Waterfalls foam over granite cliffs;
a sinuous river flings a silver chain round the symmetrical base of Kaleidon, and from our
lofty vantage point we gaze into the luminous green of a million palms, where the warm heart
of a deep forest opens to display the lustre and colour of molten emeralds. The Soendanese
quarter of the island gives place to the ancient Javanese territory, and Malay characteristics,
though underlying and mingling with every insular stock, are here modified by a strain of Hindu
ancestry, which gives refinement of feature and grace of carriage. Well-modelled figures and
delicate hands and feet are attributed to the liberal admixture of royal and noble blood with
that of the peasantry, for the ancient Rulers of Java respected no rights but their own, and
the domestic arrangements of King Solomon prevailed in a kingdom of tyrants and slaves. Hindu
thraldom was intensified under Arab priests, who, following in the train of piratical Moormen,
claimed the sovereignty of Java under their protection. The gold-embroidered jacket of civil
or military rank, with the kris thrust into a brilliant sash, here supplements the universal
sarong, itself of bolder design and glowing colour in this old-world realm of Mataram, the
centre of Java's historic interest. The crooked blade of the kris is still used in divination,
light and shadow playing over the wavy steel, ever suggesting cabalistic signs inscribed by
an invisible hand on the azure surface. The kris is popularly endowed with healing efficacy,
and the availing touch of the sacred talisman is an article of Javanese faith. A hundred varieties
of the weapon are found in the Malay Archipelago, from the gold-hilted and diamond-studded
royal kris to the boat-handled dagger of common use, permitted to all but peasants; women of
the higher class wear it in the girdle, and though unrepresented in the sculpture of Javanese
temples, the kris is ascribed to the days of Panji, a Hindu warrior whose feats form the libretto
of a popular drama, though his authenticity appears uncertain. The changes in local costume
and character, as seen in wayside villages, enliven the journey until we reach the mountain
gateway of Tjadas Pangeran, "the Royal Stone," flanked by flashing waterfalls, and forming
the entrance to the region supreme in natural scenery, archaic art, and literary interest.
The black cone of Goentoer, "the thunder peak," accentuates the red blaze of the declining
sun on the intricate rice-mosaic of green and gold in the divinely beautiful plain revealed
through the rocky cleft. Amid the many glories of Javanese landscape, the poetic glamour of
these palm-girt levels lingers longest in the memory, for the world-famed picture known as
"The Plains of Heaven" might have been inspired by the haunting loveliness of these rolling
uplands. Our railway carriage contains a native Regent, his principal wife, and a pretty daughter.
Javanese princes are made ostensible rulers of native districts, but associated with Dutch
Residents as "Elder Brothers," who may be more accurately termed compulsory advisers. Without
a measure of despotic authority exercised by the fraternal partner, the spendthrift Malay would
cause perpetual hindrance to insular development and commercial prosperity. The old Regent,
with embroidered military jacket glittering above his elaborately-patterned sarong, looks a
grim and forbidding figure, and evidently regards his womenkind as beneath notice. His head
is tied up in a black kerchief, and a brilliant Order conferred by the Queen of Holland adorns
his breast. Madame, in magenta shawl and purple gown, travesties European costume. Diamonds
blaze incongruously on arms and neck, a scarlet flower in oily black braids completing her
startling attire. The girl, in yellow sarong and pink cotton jacket glorified with rubies and
pearls, shows her high breeding in slender wrists, delicate hands, and bare feet of exquisite
modelling, a red stain of henna drawing attention to their statuesque contour. She staggers
beneath a load of impedimenta belonging to her princely father: bags, bundles, and a heavy
cloak. Javanese parents of exalted rank treat their daughters with disdain, the approved discipline
of family life consisting in stamping an impression of abject insignificance deeply on the
plastic mind of girlhood. Fertile plain and wooded slopes are alike destitute of domestic animals.
The sheep was unknown to native races in this pastureless land, and, though introduced by the
earliest colonists, is still spoken of as "the Dutch goat," no other term existing for it in
Malay parlance. Monkeys chatter and rustle in forest trees, gorgeous birds flit past on jewelled
wings, and frogs in this rainy season make a deep booming like the tuning of numerous violoncellos.
At length the little town of Garoet appears in a green valley, encircled by a diadem of peaks
which suggest a tropical Engadine. Volcanic mountains replace Alpine crests, but the white
battlements of Papandayang's smoking crater give the effect of distant snow, and the dark pines
of the Swiss valley are merely translated into the lustrous green of crowding palms. Brawling
river, rustic bridge, and brown hamlets foster the strange illusion, and if it be true that
somewhere in the wide world every face finds a counterpart, natural scenery may be subject
to an identical law, and various ice-bound landscapes be mirrored under Southern skies in pictures
wreathed with palm-fronds and tropic flowers. The Hotel Rupert, garlanded with creepers, the
open lattices trellised with ivy and roses, shows a more poetic aspect than any hostelry of
the distant Engadine. Our hostess is the widow of a German physician, and her fair young daughter,
alert and capable as the typical Hausfrau of her native land, has established a reputation
for supplying the guests with the home comforts and restful atmosphere which make the Hotel
Rupert an ideal abiding-place in stagnant Java, where as a rule the sole luxuries are out-of-doors,
and of Nature's providing. That the Dutchman flourishes on his diet of tinned meat, his appalling
rice-table, and the extraordinary sequence of dishes which probably belonged to the early days
of colonisation, either proves herculean strength or the triumph of mind over matter, but to
those of less heroic mould the unwonted amenities of a more familiar civilisation are welcome
as a green oasis in a sandy desert. A cool and healthy mountain climate gives unwonted zest
for the lovely excursions of which Garoet is the centre. From the little lake Setoe Bajendit,
a covered raft plies to a cupola-crowned hill, facing a noble panorama of volcanic peaks the
Soendanese désa of basket-work huts, through which we pass, presents a curious spectacle, with
the village street lined on either side by rows of kneeling children, clad in Dame Nature's
brown suit alone; each little figure holding up a long-stemmed flower--red hybiscus, creamy
tuberose, or snowy gardenia--the imploring faces raised in silent entreaty to the white strangers
for the infinitesimal coins which suffice to purchase a sheaf of blossom. Changing lights and
shadows sweep across the glancing emerald of the rice-filled vale, darken the purple rifts
of mountain gorges, or intensify the luminous azure of soaring crests. Wayside fruit-stalls
make gay patches of colour among green piles of banana leaves, and thin yellow strips of bamboo,
the approved paper and string of the tropics, in which every parcel is packed. Tall sugar-cane
and plumy maize surround each brown désa beneath the knot of palms, and fields of tapioca vary
the prevailing rice-grounds with sharp-pointed leaves and paler verdure. The entire tapioca
crop of Java belongs to Huntley and Palmer, for use in the manufacture of the biscuits which
make a valuable supplement to the Javanese commissariat, for unlimited rice seldom commends
itself to English tastes. Hot springs abound in this volcanic soil, and in the "five waters"
of Tjipanas, each of different temperature, the native finds a panacea wherein he can indulge
to his heart's content, the healing springs rushing into stone tanks set in sheds of bamboo.
The principal excursion from Garoet is to the active crater of the Papandayang, a long drive
of twelve miles leading to the foot of the volcano. From this point a chair carried by six
coolies is required for the steep road, formed by hundreds of moss-grown steps. Plantations
of coffee, cinchona, and tapioca girdle the lower slopes of the mountain, hedges and thickets
of red and purple coleas bordering the primeval jungle of orchid-decked trees on the higher
levels, the moss-grown boughs wreathed with epiphytal plants, the trunks covered with branching
ferns, and the thick ropes of matted lianas strangling the dense forest in their green embrace.
Wild oleander mingles rosy blossoms with bushes of living gold like tall growths of double
buttercups, and at length the cooler regions show the familiar ferns, violets, and primroses
of the temperate zone. The weird silence of the jungle is emphasised by an occasional cry of
a wild bird, flitting among the tall tree tops, or the crash of a bough, dragged down by the
weight of some climbing rattan. A walk up a boulder-strewn slope reaches the old crater, or
Solfatara, almost surrounded by steep walls of rock. Boiling and wheezing springs, fast-forming
sulphur columns, and clouds of choking steam, rise from the yellow and orange-powdered earth.
A deafening noise issues from the self-building architecture of ruddy pillars, the bubbling
of boiling mud, and the shrill spouting of hot vapours from narrow orifices in the trembling
crust of the fire-charged earth. Golden sulphur-pools shower burning drops on every side, and
from the mysterious kawa or crater, echoes of subterranean thunder sound at intervals, from
the traditional forge where native legends assert that a chained giant is condemned to work
eternally in the service of the Evil One.

At night the broad verandah of the Hotel Rupert is transformed into a stage for a performance
of the topeng or national drama, chartered by an American guest. The weird spectacle, accompanied
by the gamelon music, transports us to the days of old-world Java, story and performance being
of ancient origin and religious signification. The subjects of the topeng are derived from
the Panji group of dramatic poems, the ancient costumes, the curious masks, and the office
of the dalang or reciter, whose ventriloquial skill is required for the entire wording of the
libretto, comprise a valuable memento of bygone days, otherwise entirely forgotten. The wayang-wayang
or "shadow dance" of puppets, vies with the topeng in popularity, but the latter ranks as classic
and lyrical drama. A graceful girl in pink, with floating scarf, and gleaming kris in her spangled
sash, exhibits wonderful skill in the supple play of wrist and fingers, through the process
known as devitalization, a form of drill which gives to the arm a plastic power of detached
movement, fascinating but uncanny. The dusky garden is filled with a native crowd, moved alternately
to tears and laughter by exploits unintelligible to the European spectator, for the story of
every national hero is known to the poorest and most ignorant of the people, from perpetual
attendance on theatrical performances. The al fresco entertainments necessitated by the climate
provide exceptional opportunities of dramatic education in the legends of Java's heroic age.
The spacious verandahs gleaming with the soft light of Chinese lanterns, and set in depths
of shadow, the scented gloom of the tropical night veiling the dusky lawns, crowded with mysterious
figures drawn by the weird music from every quarter, the brilliant robes and grotesque masks
of the actors, compose a picture of archaic charm. Passers-by pause on their way to look, and
listen with unwearied interest to the oft-told tales, for the stories of the world's childhood,
like the fairy lore of our own early days, deepen their significance to the untaught mind by
perpetual repetition. The Hindu cloudland which veils the Javanese past "was reached by a ladder
of realities," for the exploits of gods and mythical heroes were afterwards attributed to native
Rulers, until the medley of truth and fiction, history and mythology, became an inextricable
tangle. The birds' beaks, and hooked noses of the masks in the topeng, and of the puppets in
the shadow-play, were made compulsory after the Arabic conquest, in order to reconcile the
national pastime with the creed of Islam, which forbade the dramatic representation of the
human form. The reigning Susunhan evaded the decree by distorting mask and puppet, but although
the outside world might no longer recognise the heroes of the play, Javanese knowledge of national
tradition easily pierced the flimsy disguise, and credited their deified heroes with a new
power of metamorphosis. The fantastic play lasts so far into the night that the prolonged libretto
is brought to a summary conclusion by the hostess, since European nature can stand no more,
though the rapt attention of the Malay would continue till morning. The satiety of modern days
has never touched these simple minds, and an entire absence of that critical element which
disintegrates so many of life's simple joys, ministers to the supreme satisfaction derived
from the crude ideals of native drama. Silently the brown spectators slip away like shadows
from the dim and dewy garden, for the simple and untaught Malay, though eagerly welcoming the
privileges permitted to him, never encroaches upon them, and the conduct of these Eastern playgoers
affords an example of order and sobriety which shames many an audience of higher education
and social superiority in distant Europe.

DJOKJACARTA.

A long day's journey lies between Garoet and Djokjacarta, which popular parlance abbreviates
into Djokja. From the blue Preanger hills and palm-shadowed upland plains, the railway descends
by steep gradients to the dense jungle and fever-laden swamp known as the Terra Ingrata. Malarious
mists steam from marsh and mere, pink and purple lantana, yellow daisies, and the pallid blossoms
of strangling creepers emphasise the gloom of the matted foliage, forming an impenetrable screen
on either side of the narrow embankment across the dreary morass. The railway through the hundred
miles of this miasma-haunted region was laid at immense sacrifice of human life, even the native
workmen being compelled to sleep in camps far away from the scene of their daily toil. No white
man could even direct the work, and the ubiquitous Chinaman, proof against every ill that flesh
is heir to in Java, was deputed to superintend the solution of abstruse professional problems,
between the short and hasty visits of Dutch and English engineers. Quagmire and quicksand,
stagnant pool and sluggish stream, succeed in weary iteration. Bleached skeletons of dead trees
writhe in weird contortions against the dark background of jungle, as though some wizard's
curse had blighted life and growth amid the rank vegetation rising from this dismal Slough
of Despond. The brooding melancholy of atmosphere and scenery penetrates mind and soul, oppressed
by an intangible weight, and escape from the Dantesque horrors of this selva oscura is accompanied
by a sudden relief and buoyancy of spirit which perceptibly heightens the interest of the old-world
city, once isolated by the woodland fastness of Nature, and belonging to an ageless past, surrounding
the authentic origin of Djokjacarta with thick clouds of fable and myth. The modern name is
derived from Arjudja, a city recorded in Java's ancient annals as being established by Rama,
the incarnate Sun-God. Na-yud-ja, the first king of this Divinely-founded capital, also memorialises
in his name the place which became the nucleus of the ancient Hindu empire. Temples and palaces,
walls and watch-towers, ruined by earthquake, buried in jungle, and blackened by smoke of war,
testify to the splendours of old Mataram. A bitter resistance was offered by the invading hordes
of Islam, whether pirates or prophets, princes or soldiers, and the Hindu territory remained
independent until the fierce conflict in the 18th century with usurping Mohammedans and Dutch
colonists, when family influence was undermined by political intrigues. The Dutch, after many
vicissitudes, became absolute rulers of Java, though native princes, as tributaries, were suffered
to retain a semblance of sovereignty. The shadowy paraphernalia of vanished power is still
accorded to the Sultan of Djokjacarta, in melancholy travesty of past authority, though every
hereditary privilege has been wrested from his grasp. A curious relic of primitive days remains
in the al fresco Throne of Judgment, a block of stone beneath a rudely-tiled canopy, moss-grown
and hoary. Two ancient waringen-trees, their aerial roots, drooping branches, and colossal
main trunks denoting an almost fabulous age, flank the historic seat, where the turbaned Ruler
administered justice to the surging crowd which thronged around him, the indigo garb of the
Soendanese contrasting with the gay sarongs of Central Java, glowing in the hot sunlight as
it poured through the dark trellis of fluttering boughs. The city in the course of ages moved
away from this ancient centre, and the rustic Throne is now remote from the heart of civic
life. The streets of Djokjacarta, and the surrounding roads, consist of shady avenues, where
open tokos (the native shops) vary the monotony of Dutch villas, their white colonnades and
porticos gleaming against the background of stately trees, and rising from a mass of tropical
vegetation. The prevailing indigo of Soendanese dress gives a dull aspect to the wide but squalid
streets, for in native capitals, though Dutch cleanliness may enforce perpetual "tidying up,"
the lacking sense of order produces a strange impermanence in the conditions insisted upon.
The inner court of the Sultan's Kraton, or Royal Enclosure, is now taboo to visitors, for the
barbaric monarch, on the plea of age and infirmity, has obtained the privilege of privacy,
and the Palace can only be seen through a personal interview. The outer courts are accessible
to carriages, which make the square-mile circuit of the spacious quadrangles. Massive gates
and crumbling machicolated walls command a green plain, where immense waringen-trees, clipped
into the semblance of evergreen umbrellas, display the Eastern symbol of sovereignty. Officials
passing to and fro show a continuous procession of these State pajongs. The Sultan's august
head is canopied with gold, edged by an orange stripe, the Crown Prince sporting an umbrella
with a golden border. Sultanas and royal children are known by white pajongs, while the vast
concourse of Court officials, with umbrellas of pink, blue, red, black, purple and green, show
their status to the initiated eye through the sequence of colour by which the pajongs form
a complete system of heraldry. In the dusky angle of a mossy wall, four elephants, used in
State processions, feed upon bundles of bamboo and sugar-cane. Mud huts and bamboo sheds prop
themselves against tiled eaves and windowless houses. Open doors afford glimpses of squalid
interiors, crowded with slatternly women and dirty children, the hereditary retainers and hangers-on
of this effete and moribund royalty. Private troupes of dancing bedayas, gamelon players, actors,
pipe, fan, and betel-box bearers, pertain to the tumbledown Palace, and the patriarchal system
of ancient Java permits the presence of whole families belonging to these indispensable ministers
of the royal pleasure. The people show the same indifference to Mohammedanism as to the perished
faiths of olden time, and a large funeral party encountered on leaving the Kraton displays
painful irreverence, though scattering rice and lighting incense sticks before a white coffin
borne shoulder-high, and decked with a tracery of yellow marigolds and rosettes of pink paper.
No priest accompanies the procession, and the laughter of the white-scarved mourners, preceded
by men carrying ropes and planks, suggests an utter heartlessness and barbarity. Gay passers,
a busy campong Tchina, a very hive of Celestial industry, and innumerable drives beneath over-arching
trees, with distant views of purple peaks, comprise the interests of old-world Djokja, with
the one exception of the famous Taman Sarie, or Water Castle, ruined by earthquake, but remaining
as a pathetic memorial of bygone power and pride. Pavilions and baths, grottoes and fish-ponds,
set in the tangled verdure of a neglected garden, surround the arcaded parapets of a colossal
tower. Green plumes of fern wave from wall and battlement, velvet moss and orange lichen tapestry
the blackened stone, and matted creepers sway their woven curtains in the evening wind. A Dancing
Hall, which formerly rang with the weird music accompanying the "woven paces and waving hands"
of Court bedayas, in their spangled pink robes, now echoes to the tread of alien feet; the
dim arcades teem with ghostly memories, and the mournful desolation of the Taman Sarie borrows
fresh poignancy in the former scene of mirth and music. A moss-grown and slippery stairway
leads to the green twilight of a subterranean grotto, containing the richly-carved stone bedstead
of the Sultan, who sought this cool retreat from the ardour of a tropical sun. A silvery curtain
of murmuring water fell before his sculptured couch, and supplied this haunt of dreams with
an ideal, if rheumatic environment of poetic beauty and lulling charm. Superstition clings
to the deserted resting-place, and to touch even the stone columns of the royal couch is to
invoke the powers of evil, and the presence of Death. The Sumoor Gamelon, or "Musical Spring,"
echoing with the voice of flowing waters, flanks the ancient banqueting hall, and cools a circle
of vaulted grottoes, their shadowy depths bathed in the emerald twilight, deepened by the veil
of verdure and the transparent foliage drooping over open window spaces. The Sultan's oval
bathing tank, with stone galleries and spiral pavilions, occupies a hollow tower, but a touch
of young life dispels the gloom, for a group of brown children swim and dive in the cool depths,
shouting and splashing with a merriment unsubdued by the solemn sadness of the deserted halls.
A Portuguese architect designed this fantastic retreat for an old-time Sultan, who brought
the idea of the Water Castle from a far-off Indian home. The earthquake of 1867 rendered the
Taman Sarie uninhabitable, choked the lake in which it stood, and destroyed the subaqueous
tunnel which ensured the absolute seclusion of Sultan and harem. The famous Marshal Daendels,
weary of waiting for an interview with a dilatory Sultan, yielded to natural impatience, and
hearing the sound of distant music from the watery depths, dashed through the thicket of tamarinds
which concealed the entrance to the water pavilion, and, dragging the Sultan from the place
of dreams, scattered bedayas and gamelon players in terror, forcing the so-called "Regent of
the World" and "Shadow of the Almighty" to accompany him to the Dutch headquarters. Rose garden
and shrubbery, palm grove and pleasaunce, are fast relapsing into impenetrable jungle. Broken
fountains, and mouldering vases once filled with orange-trees, outline the balustraded terraces;
gilt pavilions lift their upcurved eaves above a wild growth of oleander, but the enchanted
scene of old romance is given up to bats and lizards, for the crumbling Taman Sarie is now
a fast-vanishing monument of Java's buried past.

The number of rechas, or sacred stone figures of Brahmin and Buddhist origin, in the garden
of the Dutch Residency, shows the scant care bestowed on the ancient temples, for years used
as mere quarries of broken statuary, and still receiving inadequate recognition as historical
remains, though Sir Stamford Raffles a century ago realised the supreme importance of Javanese
sculpture as an indispensable link in archæological science. Djokjacarta, interesting in itself
as the survival of an ancient dynasty, borrows double attraction from the architectural wonders
which surround it, buried for ages in the deep green grave of tropical vegetation, but now
laid bare as an open book, wherein we may read those graven records which unveil the mysteries
of the past, and enable us to gaze down the long vista of Time and Change.

BORO-BOEDOER.

The archæological interest of Java culminates in the mysterious temple known as Boro-Boedoer,
"the aged thing," with an actual history lost in mist and shadow, though recorded in imperishable
characters on this spellbound sanctuary of a departed faith. The little tramway from Djokjacarta
traverses fields of rice and sugar-cane, indigo and pepper; a range of dreamlike mountains
bounds the view, crowned by the turquoise cone of Soemboeung, the traditional centre of Java,
a green knoll at the base of the volcanic pyramid being regarded as the "spike" which fastens
the floating isle to some solid rock in unfathomed depths of ocean. The fitful fancy of a wandering
race, ever drifting across the changing seas, reflects itself in the legendary lore of the
Malay Archipelago, often represented by weird traditions as though in perpetual motion. The
vicissitudes of volcanic action, whereby islands were sometimes submerged or created, gives
a colouring of fact to the vague ideas entertained by these nomads of the sea. Merbaboe, the
"ash-ejecting," and Merapi, the "fire-throwing," flank the loftier crest, honeycombed with
dim cave temples, now deserted and forgotten, but formerly sanctifying those watch-towers of
Nature which guard the hoary shrine of Boro-Boedoer. At Matoelan we hear that the swift river
separating the great Temple from the secular world is in flood, the bridge broken down, and
the supplementary raft impossible through the swirling current. This untoward event involves
a further expedition to Magelang, a sordid town of continuous markets, the Javanese population
being of pronounced Hindu type, silent and sad, according to the idiosyncracy of their mysterious
ancestors across the sea. The conversational difficulties presented by the Dutch and Malay
languages, combined with the incapacity of our brown driver, eventually land us at Mendoet,
on the wrong side of the turbid stream--the Jordan which divides the weary traveller from his
Land of Promise. Evening draws on, the clear sky flushes pink above the darkness of the palm-woods,
and hope sinks apace, for the surging flood shows no sign of abatement. Suddenly the apathetic
driver rouses himself from what proves a profitable meditation, and, with folded hands, breathes
the magic word pasteur, whipping up his sorry steeds to fresh exertions. We draw up at a white
bungalow on the roadside, close to a rustic church, and find a friend in an English-speaking
Dutch priest, who, after giving us tea on his verandah, suggests inspection of Mendoet's little
moated temple, on the edge of the forest. An ever-growing tangle of lianas and vines buried
this ancient shrine through the lapse of ages, until accident revealed the entombed sanctuary
about eighty years ago. A processional terrace surrounds the walled pavement supporting the
grey edifice, and the sculptured bas-reliefs denote the transitional stage of Buddhist faith,
as it materialised through Jainism into the Puranic mythology of Hindu creed. The central chapel
contains the famous picture in stone known as "The Tree of Knowledge," and represents the Buddha
beneath the sacred Bo-Tree of Gaya. A fluted pajong, propped against the boughs, canopies his
head, one hand being raised in benediction over kneeling converts, offering rice and incense.
Listening angels hover overhead, birds peep out from nests among the leaves, and kids lean
with necks outstretched over fretted crags, magnetised by the mystic attraction of the inspired
Teacher. Long-eared statues show Nepalese influence, even the Buddhist images being girt with
the sacred cord of Brahma. A controversy exists as to their identification with the Hindu Trinity,
but as Eastern cults frequently bestow Divine attributes on mortals, the mysterious figures
may possibly represent the murdered wives of the Rajah who founded the Mendoet temple in expiation
of his crime. Another legend suggests the petrification of a princely family, as a punishment
for marrying within the forbidden degrees, but myth grows apace in this haunted land, and every
century offers fresh variations of old-world stories, until original form is lost beneath a
weight of accretion, like the thick moss blurring the chiselled outlines of some carven monument.
After careful scrutiny of the miniature temple which suggests so many interpretations of symbolic
imagery, we return to the little presbytery to hear of the subsiding river, and the good priest,
announcing that the raft can now be safely negotiated, accompanies us to the tottering structure,
a straw matting laid over three crazy boats punted across the turbulent stream. A half-hour's
stroll beneath the arching boughs of a kanari avenue, ends at a picturesque Rest House, facing
the temple-crowned hill. Surely we have reached the peace and silence of Nirvana at last! and
the exquisite beauty of the surrounding landscape, mountain and forest, park-like valley and
winding glen, transfigured in the deepening gold of sunset, stamps an ineffaceable impression
of Boro-Boedoer in that mystic gallery of imagination and memory which retains earth's fairest
scenes as eternal possessions of mind and soul. A shadowy garden, fragrant and dim, stretches
up to the pyramidal pile which covers the hill. A frangipanni grove scents the air, with gold-starred
blossoms gleaming whitely amid the silvery green of lanceolated leaves, and a shaft of ruby
light striking the stone Buddhas which guard the portico, emphasises the inscrutable smile
of the tranquil faces. Like all stupendous monuments of Art or Nature, Boro-Boedoer at first
sight seems a disappointment, simply because the mind fails to grasp the immensity of the noblest
Temple ever dedicated to the gentle Sage whose renunciation typified the greater Sacrifice
offered by the Saviour of the World. Who that reads the story of Sakya Munyi can doubt that
through the Prince who gave up kingdom, throne, and earthly ties for the sake of downtrodden
humanity, a prophetic gleam of heavenly light pierced the darkness of the future, and pointed
to the distant Cross? Twenty-five centuries have rolled away since Prince Siddartha closed
his unique career, and twelve centuries later the wondrous sanctuary of Boro-Boedoer was erected
in honour of the creed eternally dear to the heart of the mystic East. The eight stately terraces
which climb and encircle the sacred hill rise from a spacious pavement of blackened stone,
and the walled processional paths display a superb series of sculptured reliefs, which would
measure three miles in length if placed side by side. The grey and black ruins, with their
rich incrustations of sacred and historic scenes, remain in such splendid preservation that
fancy easily reconstructs the bygone glory of the golden age, when this mighty Altar of Faith
witnessed the glittering pageantry of Oriental devotion; when gaily-clad crowds flocked to
the morning sacrifice of flowers and music, while monarchs brought their treasures from far-off
lands to lay at the feet of the mystic Sage, prophetically revealed as an incarnation of purity
and peace vouchsafed to a world of oppression and sorrow. Life-size Buddhas, enthroned on the
sacred lotus, rise above the crumbling altars of five hundred arcaded shrines, and stone stairways
ascend from every side, beneath sharply-curved arches bordered with masks or gargoyles. The
last three terraces form sweeping circles, flanked by bell-shaped dagobas resembling gigantic
lotus-buds. Each open lattice of hoary stone reveals an enthroned Buddha, mysteriously enclosed
in his symbolical screen, for these triple terraces typify the higher circles of Nirvana. Each
dreamy face turns towards the supreme Shrine of the glorious sanctuary, a domed dagoba fifty
feet high, and once containing some authentic relic of the Buddha's sacred person. Certain
archæologists recognise in this spire-tipped cupola a survival of Nature-worship, incorporated
with the later Buddhism in a form derived from the tree temples of primeval days, and built
over a receptacle for the cremated ashes of the Buddhist priesthood. A touch of mysticism added
by an unfinished statue in the gloom of the shadowy vault, suggests the unknown beauty of the
soul which attains Nirvana's supremest height, for the supernal exaltation of purified humanity
to Divine union may not be interpreted or expressed by mortal hands, but must for ever remain
incommunicable and incomprehensible. From the central dagoba, ascended by a winding stair,
the intricate design of the spacious sanctuary discloses itself with mathematical precision,
and the changing glories of dawn, sunset, and moonlight idealize the sacred hill, rising amid
the palm-groves and rice-fields of a matchless valley, sweeping away in green undulations which
break like emerald waves against the deepening azure and amethyst of the mountain heights.
The solemn grandeur of Boro-Boedoer blinds the casual observer to many details which manifest
the ravages of time, the ruthlessness of war, and the decay of a discarded creed. Headless
and overthrown figures, broken tees, mutilated carvings, and shattered chapels abound, but
the vast display of architectural features still intact conveys an impression of permanence
rather than of ruin.

For six centuries, Boro-Boedoer was blotted from the memory of the people, and the heavy pall
of tropical verdure which veiled the vast Temple remained unlifted. Superincumbent masses of
trees, parasites, and strangling creepers wove their intricate network of root, branch, and
stem round the monumental record of a dead faith and a buried dynasty. The riotous luxuriance
of tropical Nature triumphed over the glories of Art, hewn with incalculable toil and skill
in the living rock. Seeds borne on the wind, or sown by wandering birds, filled every interstice
of the closely-matted verdure; stair and terrace, dome and spire, sank out of sight into the
forest depths, and when English engineers arrived to excavate the monumental pile, the task
of clearing away the tangled masses of foliage occupied two hundred coolies during six weeks
of arduous toil. The brief English occupation of the island necessarily left the work unfinished,
but Dutch archæologists continued the labour, though with slower methods and feebler grasp
of the situation. A transient cult sprang up among the Javanese populace as the ancient sanctuary
revealed itself anew. The statues were invoked with reverential awe, incense was offered; the
saffron, used as a personal decoration on festive occasions, was smeared over the impassive
faces, unchanged in the eternal calm of a thousand years, and fragrant flower petals were heaped
on the myriad altars. Vigils were kept on the summit, and the sick were laid at the feet of
favourite images. This spurious devotion, hereditary or instinctive, sprang up in responsive
hearts with simultaneous fervour, though the forgotten doctrines of Buddhism were never reinstated.
Sentiment survived dogma in the subconscious soul, and the faint shadow cast by an immemorial
past indicates the depths plumbed by the early creed in the abyss of Eastern personality. The
vague simulacrum quickly faded, like a flickering flame in the wind which fanned it into life;
but simple souls, as they pass Boro-Boedoer in the brief twilight, mutter incantations, and
brown hands grasp the silver amulets which ward off the powers of evil, for the deserted temple
is still regarded as the haunt of unknown gods, who may perchance wreak vengeance on the world
which has forsaken them.

The long scroll of ancient history, unrolled by the sculptured terraces, represents the birth,
growth, and development of Buddhist faith. Queen Maya, jewelled and flower-crowned, with the
miraculous Babe on her knee, sits among her maidens, the earth breaking into blossom at the
advent of her star-born child. His education in the mental and physical achievements imperative
on Eastern royalty, when the sword-pierced heart of the mother who typified the Virgin Queen
of Saints was translated to Nirvana's rest, is contrasted with the sudden realisation of life's
vanity when brought face to face with the world's threefold burden of sorrow, sickness and
death. The renunciation of power, wealth and love follows, liberating the soul for the pilgrimage
along the mystic "path," pursued until "the dew-drop fell into the shining sea" of Eternity.
The manifold details of the Buddha's traditional career are vividly pourtrayed on the hoary
walls of volcanic trachyte in outline clear and sharp, as though the sculptors of the eighth
century had just laid down burin and chisel. The indented leaves of the Bo-Tree, beneath which
the Sage meditates, are so exquisitely carved that they almost seem to flutter in the breeze.
The scene of the deer-park wherein he judges beasts and men, carefully weighing the tiniest
birds in the balance of the sanctuary, suggests a prophetic vision of the greater Saviour,
Who declared that even the humble sparrow is remembered by the Creator. Countless scriptural
truths throw their anticipatory shadows across the life of the Eastern mystic who approached
so closely to the Christian ideal of a later age, for the Buddha's spiritual experiences became
the inspiration of unnumbered hearts, and exercised a purifying influence over every creed
of the philosophic East. The social life of ancient Java, comprising public ceremonials, domestic
occupations, architecture, agriculture, navigation, drama and music, is memorialised by succeeding
terraces of the igneous rock which sufficed for the old-world sculptor as the medium of his
Art. An unknown King and Queen, the traditional founders of Boro-Boedoer, appear in varied
guise, throned and crowned, walking in religious processions beneath State pajongs, kneeling
before Buddha with open caskets of treasure, and receiving the homage of the people, accompanied
by bearers of smoking censers and waving fans. Armed warriors guard the jewelled thrones, and
the popular attitude in every scene of the royal progress evidences the semi-sacred character
awarded to Indian sovereignty. The eighth century A.D. was the meridian of the Javanese Empire,
and in the subsequent changes of nationality the facial type of the past has altered beyond
recognition, for in the ancient civilisation depicted on these sculptured terraces, archæologists
assert that every physiognomy is either of Hindu or Hellenic character. Ships of archaic form,
with banks of rowers; palm-thatched huts built on piles, in the unchanging fashion of the Malay
races; graceful bedayas, the Nautch girls of Java, performing the old-world dances still in
vogue; and women with lotahs on their heads, passing in single file to palm-fringed tanks,
might be represented with equal truth in this twentieth century. Seedtime and harvest, ploughing
and reaping, bullock-carts and water-buffaloes, fruit-laden wagons and village passers, pass
in turn before the spectator in this wondrous gallery of native art. Richly-caparisoned elephants
suggest Indian accessories of royal life and State ceremonial, an occasional touch of humour
enlivening the solemn pageantry. In one grotesque relief a bedaya and an elephant stand vis-a-vis,
the ponderous monster imitating the steps of the slim maiden in floating veil and embroidered
robes, her slender limbs contrasting with the outflung feet of her clumsy partner. Weird myths
of the great fishes which guided and propelled the coracle-like boats of the first Buddhist
missionaries to the shores of Java are perpetuated in stone, and the forest, sloping down to
the wave-beaten coast, shows the rich vegetation which still clothes this island of eternal
summer. The sumboya or flower of the dead, droops over stately tombs; bamboo and palm, banana
and bread-fruit, mingle their varied foliage; mangosteen and pomegranate, mango and tamarind,
acacia and peepul, show themselves as indigenous growths of the fertile soil; while palace
and temple, carven stairway, and flower-girt pavilion, suggest the wealth and prosperity of
the ancient empire. The mighty Temple of Boro-Boedoer, built up through successive ages, indicates
the gradual change from the simplicity of the early faith, at first supplanting, and eventually
becoming incorporated with, the Brahminism which succeeded it in modified form, as though rising
from the ashes of the earlier Hindu creed which Buddhism virtually destroyed. In the higher
terrace, the last addition to this stupendous sanctuary, the images of Buddha represent the
ninth Avatar or Incarnation of the god Vishnu, though he still sits upon the lotus cushion
and holds the sacred flower in one hand. This inclusion of Sakya Munyi within the Puranic Pantheon
was a masterly feat of strategy accomplished by reviving Brahminism, the heresy of the Jains
supplying the link between the rival creeds. All the sculptured figures, leaning forward in
veneration of the mystic statue in the central cupola, are invested with the sacred thread
of the Vishnavite Brahmin. The images of the highest circular terrace are carved in four symbolical
attitudes. The "teaching" Buddha rests an open palm on one knee; in the posture of "learning"
his hands are outstretched to receive the gift of knowledge. In "exposition," one hand is raised
towards Heaven, and in the act of "demonstration," thumbs and index fingers are joined. Ferguson
points out that within the grey lattice of each lotus-bell dagoba, the right palm of the enthroned
Buddha curves over the left hand. This restful posture indicates the state of final comprehension,
when the aspiring soul, raised to the different spheres of Nirvana by steps of ascending sanctity,
receives increasing peace and satisfaction from gradual absorption into the Infinite. No creed
passes unaltered through any crucible of national thought; Indian Buddhism borrowed both form
and colour from races which, in accepting the new faith, retained their own individuality and
modes of assimilation. They gave as well as received, and the value of the gift depended on
the character of the giver.

No inscriptions exist on the stones of Boro-Boedoer. The sculptured reliefs tell their own
story, which admits of diverse interpretations. The relics of the world-renowned Mystic were
dispersed throughout Asia in the sudden impulse of missionary enterprise three centuries after
his death, and every Buddhist temple received some infinitesimal treasure. No record is found
of the date when the precious relic, probably a hair or an eyelash, was deposited in the great
dagoba of Boro-Boedoer, but an Indian prince sailed with an imposing fleet to found a Buddhist
empire in Java at the opening of the 7th century A.D., and a subsequent inscription discovered
on the coast of Sumatra commemorates the completion of a seven-storeyed Vihara, evidently the
colossal Temple of Boro-Boedoer, by the contemporary King of "Greater Java," the ancient name
of Sumatra. In the tenth century, a reigning monarch sent his sons to India for religious education.
They brought back in their train artists, sculptors, monks, priests, and the gorgeous paraphernalia
then used in the ceremonial of Buddhist worship, but the heart of the ancient faith was atrophied
by the indifference of the people, and the zealous attempt to galvanise a moribund creed into
fresh life failed even to arrest the progress of decay. National thought, fickle as the wind,
had turned from an impersonal philosophy to the materialistic cult of Hindu deities, as the
Israelites of old hankered after the visible symbol of Isis and Osiris in the Golden Calf.
No definite creed succeeded in gaining a permanent hold upon the wandering minds and shallow
feelings of a race whose deepest instincts reveal the fleeting fancies and inconstant ideas
indigenous to a sea-faring stock, imbued with the spirit of change and unrest. A magical charm
broods over the mysterious Temple, the materialised dream of a mighty past rescued from the
sylvan sepulchre of equatorial vegetation, and restored to a vivid reality beside which the
paintings of Egyptian tombs sink into comparative insignificance. The seclusion of the memory-haunted
pile enhances the thrill of an unique experience. Vista after vista opens into the world of
long ago so graphically depicted on the monumental tablets of the processional paths, while
type and symbol point also to the infinite future intensely realised by Eastern mysticism.
Mortal life was but a fleeting mirage besides this vision of the life beyond. For the words
"Shadow, Unreality, Illusion," perpetually repeated by the yellow-robed monks on the beads
of the Buddhist Rosary were inscribed on the inmost heart of the faithful disciple, who strove
to attain that detachment from the world of sense inculcated by the creed expressed on the
hoary stones of Boro-Boedoer.

BRAMBANAM.

The ruined temples of Brambanam memorialise that phase of Java's religious history, when the
altars of Buddha were finally deserted, and Hinduism became the paramount creed of the fickle
populace. An archæological report sent to Sir Stamford Raffles a century ago, describes the
remains of Brambanam as "stupendous monuments of the science and taste belonging to a long-forgotten
age, crowded together in the former centre of Hindu faith." A rough country road leads from
the little white railway station, perched on a desolate plain, to these far-famed temples.
A brown village, shaded by the dark foliage of colossal kanari-trees, shows the usual fragility
of structure in basket-work walls and roofs of plaited palm-leaves, but the humble dwellings,
destroyed and rebuilt myriad times on the ancient site of Java's Hindu capital, have supplemented
native workmanship by a multitude of carven stones, broken statues, and moss-grown reliefs,
for the ruins, theoretically guarded from the spoiler's hand, are still inadequately protected,
and the grey recha have been used as seats, landmarks, or stepping-stones over muddy lane and
brimming water-course. The conversion of Java to the materialistic creed for which she forsook
the subtleties of an impersonal Buddhism, though shallow was complete, and the doctrine of
impermanence, inculcated by the discarded faith, continued an essential factor in spiritual
development, for the inconstancy of the national mind only found a temporary halting-place
in each successive creed which arrested it. The seed was sown, the bud opened, and the flower
faded, with incredible rapidity, but the growth while it lasted, showed phenomenal luxuriance.
The erection of these Hindu sanctuaries signalised the zenith of Javanese power; their fame
travelled across the seas, and numerous expeditions sailed for this early El Dorado of the
Southern ocean. Kublai Khan came with his Mongol fleet, but was repulsed with loss, and branded
as a felon. A second and stronger attempt from the same quarter met with absolute defeat. Marco
Polo, compelled to wait through the rainy season in Sumatra for a favourable wind, came hither
in the palmy days of mediæval Portugal, but returned discomfited. Goths from the Northern bounds
of Thuringian pine forests followed in their turn, but the power and prestige of Hindu Java
remained invincible until destroyed by the wayward fickleness of her own children. Brahminism
was finally discarded for the specious promises of Arabian invaders, and the lightly-held faith
succumbed to the creed of Islam. Mosques were built, Hindu temples were forsaken, and Nature's
veil of vegetation was once more suffered to hide altar and statue, wall and stairway, until
every sculptured shrine became a mere green mound of waving trees, strangling creepers, and
plumy ferns. The memory of the past was entirely obliterated from the hearts of the people,
and every year buried the relics of the former religion in a deeper grave.

Siva the Destroyer, and also the Life-Giver, the Third Person of the Hindu Trinity, together
with Parvati and Brahma, were worshipped here in their original character, and an exquisite
statue of Lora Jonggran (Parvati in her Javanese guise) remains enshrined in a richly-decorated
chapel, surrounded by dancing houris, inspired in their sacred measure by the flute-playing
of Krishna. A further instance of the mode already mentioned by which sentiment survives dogma
in the Malay races, is shown by the fact that Lora Jonggran still receives the homage of Javanese
women. Flowers are laid at her feet, love affairs are confided to her advocacy, and as the
shadows deepen across the great quadrangle, a weeping girl prostrates herself before the smiling
goddess, and, raising brown arms in earnest supplication, kisses the stone slab at the feet
of the beautiful statue, popularly endowed with some occult virtue which the loosely-held Mohammedanism
of a later day has failed to discredit or deny. The temples of Brambanam were erected shortly
after the completion of that upper terrace in the great sanctuary of Boro-Boedoer which marks
the traditional epoch between Buddhism and the later Hinduism, including Sakya Munyi among
the avatars of Vishnu. The sacred trees and lions carved here on the walls of the temple quadrangle,
give place in the galleries to scenes from the great Hindu epic of the Ramayan. The familiar
form of Ganesh, the elephant-headed God of Wisdom, looms from the shadows of a vaulted shrine;
Nandi, the sacred bull, stands beneath a carven canopy, and the great memorial of a bygone
faith contains the identical galaxy of gods found in the Indian temples of the present day,
for the thin veil of Javanese thought is a transparency rather than a disguise, softening rather
than hiding the clear-cut outlines of the original idea. The "fatal beauty" of the graceful
waringen-tree has played an ominous part in the destruction of the Brambanam temples, for the
interlacing roots, like a network of branching veins, make their devious way through crevice
and cranny, splitting and uplifting the strongest slab, wherein one tiny crack suffices for
the string-like fibres to gain foothold. Masks and arabesques, fruit and flowers, fabulous
monsters and sacred emblems, encrust the grey balustrades and bas-reliefs of the noble stairways.
Roof and column teem with richest ornament, for Hindu art had reached the climax of splendour
when the great city, formerly surrounding the monumental group of stately temples, attained
to her utmost power and fame. The Greek influences which prevailed in Northern Hindustan were
translated to Brambanam in their attributes of dignity and grace, for the flowing robes and
easy postures of the sculptured figures correct and modify the grotesque and over-laden character
of original Hindu art. The great stone-paved court once contained an imposing group of twenty
pyramidal shrines, but only three remain in the original contour of the so-called "pagoda style,"
peculiar to the Dravidian temples of Southern India, from whence Java derived her special form
of faith. The ruins on the opposite side of the grey quadrangle are mere cone-shaped piles
of rubbish, dust, and broken stone, but the tapering pyramids, with their graceful galleries
and processional terraces, richly carved and adorned with images, enable us to reconstruct
in imagination the stately beauty of the architectural panorama once displayed by the temple
courts. Scenes from the Ramayan and Mahabharata adorn the great blocks of the boundary wall,
sculptured in high relief. The Vedic Powers of Nature, with Indra as the god of storm and hurricane,
manifest the recognition of that earlier belief which became submerged in the vast system of
Pantheistic mythology. The faith of further India takes form and colour from the idiosyncracy
of Java, and the goddess Parvati, or Kali, worshipped under these different names according
to her attributes of glory or terror, becomes Lora Jonggran, the benignant goddess of Java,
popularly known as "the maiden of the beauteous form." Four lofty stairways ascend to the hoary
chapels within each sculptured pyramid, every dusky vault containing the broken image of the
tutelary Deva.

Only separated from Brambanam by a winding path and a green belt of jungle, stands the great
Buddhist temple of Chandi Sewon, and the colossal figures flanking the entrance gate indicate
a decadent phase of the ancient creed which Boro-Boedoer illustrates in the purity of earlier
developement. Chandi Sewon, the "thousand temples," includes in the number myriad unimportant
shrines, ruined, overthrown, or covered with a green network of interlacing creepers. The great
architectural pile, built at a uniform level, surrounds the central sanctuary with five great
enclosures. All the ancient faiths of the world contain foreshadowings or reflections of Christian
truth, and the cruciform temple which forms the climax of this monumental erection shows the
mystic value attached to the sacred Sign so frequently encountered in Buddhist shrines, and
known as the Shvastika. The numerous chapels of Chandi Sewon contained the galaxy of Tirthankas
or Buddhist saints which the materialism of the Jains added to the impersonal subtleties of
esoteric Buddhism. The blank emptiness and desertion of this vast sanctuary produces an impression
of unutterable desolation. The weed-grown courts, the ruined altars, and the moss-blackened
arches, encumbered with indistinguishable heaps of shattered sculpture, lack all the reposeful
charm of Boro-Boedoer, still a sermon in stone which he who runs may read. The degenerate creed
memorialised by Chandi Sewon, has failed to impress itself on the colossal pile which bears
melancholy witness to the evanescent character of the heretical offshoot from the parent stem.
Jungle and palm-forest in Central Java contain innumerable vestiges of pyramidal temples, palaces,
and shrines; vaults hidden beneath the shrouding trees have yielded a rich store of gold, silver,
and bronze ornaments, household utensils, and armour. For many years the peasants of the region
between Samarang and Boro-Boedoer paid their taxes in gold melted from the treasure trove turned
up by the plough, or dug from the precincts of some forgotten sanctuary, buried beneath the
rank vegetation of the teaming soil. The discarded Hindu gods still haunt the forest depths,
and the superstitious native, as he threads the dark recesses of the solemn woods, gazes with
apprehensive eyes on the trident of Siva, or the elephant's trunk of Ganesh emerging from the
trailing wreaths and matted tapestry of liana and creeper, veiling the blackened stone of each
decaying shrine. Nature has proved stronger than Art or Creed, in the eternal growth beneath
an equatorial sun, of the kingdom over which she reigns in immortal life. Silently and insidiously
she undermines man's handiwork, and realisation of his futile conflict with her invincible
power enters with disastrous effect into the popular mind, lacking that immutable force without
which the spiritual temple of faith rests on a foundation of shifting sand. Kawi literature,
popularised by translation, and familiar through the medium of national drama, interprets Javanese
creeds and traditions. This "utterance of poetry" derived from Sanskrit, fell into disuse after
the Mohammedan conquest, though a few Arabic words became incorporated into the two-fold language
comprising Krama, the ceremonial speech, and Ngoko, the speech of "thee and thou," or colloquial
form of address. The island of Bali, and the slopes of the Tengger range, retain a modification
of Hinduism, and Bali treasures a Kawi version of the Ramayan and Mahabharata epics. Many inspiring
thoughts and noble sentiments, expressed in story and song, have become well-known maxims identified
with Javanese life. "Rob no man of due credit, for the sun, by depriving the moon of her light,
adds no lustre to his own." "As the lotus floats in water, the heart rests in a pure body."
"Ye cannot take riches to the grave, but he who succoureth the poor in this world shall find
a better wealth hereafter." A babad or rhythmical ballad of semi-religious character belongs
to every province, but though many details of temple worship--Buddhist, Hindu, and Mohammedan--may
be gathered from the lengthy scroll, heroic and princely exploits, myths and traditions, encumber
the sacred text, which Eastern imagination transforms into a fairy tale. Creeds lose their
chiselled outline, and crumble away in the disintegrating medium of Javanese thought, which
blends them into each other with changing colour and borrowed light. The inconstant soul of
the Malay knows nothing of that rigid adherence to some centralising truth which often forms
the heart of a living faith, and his religious history is an age-long record of failure, change,
desertion, and oblivion, repeated in varying cadences, and inscribed in unmistakeable characters
on the ruined sanctuaries of old Mataram.

SOURAKARTA.

The imperial city of Sourakarta, commonly abbreviated into "Solo," was the hereditary capital
of the Mohammedan emperors, now mere puppet-princes held in the iron grasp of Holland. The
present Susunhan, descended from both Hindu and Arab ancestry, maintains a brilliant simulacrum
of royal state, and his huge Kraton, far surpassing that of Djokjacarta, contains 10,000 inhabitants.
The pronounced Hindu type, though debased and degraded, remains noticeable even amid the all-pervading
environment of squalor and disorder, which dims the gorgeous colour and brilliant ceremonial,
producing the effect of jewels flung in the dust. A dense throng of brown humanity, clad and
unclad, walks to and fro beneath the dusky avenues of feathery tamarinds which shield Solo
from the ardour of the tropical sun. Old crones, with unkempt locks streaming over brown and
bony necks, pass by, their wide mouths distorted and discoloured with sucking the scarlet lumps
of Sarya, from which the native derives unfailing consolation, even the Javanese girl showing
absolute disregard of the disfigurement produced by this favourite stimulant. Deep moats, lichen-stained
walls, and hoary forts, invest Solo with a feudal aspect, and the grim tower of Vostenberg
menaces the Kraton with bristling cannon, reminding the hereditary Ruler of his subserviency
to modern Holland, for only a melancholy illusion of past glory remains to him. The dragon-carved
eaves of the Chinese quarter, the open tokos beneath waringen boughs, the shadowy passer brightened
by mounds of richly-coloured fruits, and the stuccoed palaces of Court dignitaries, framed
in dark foliage, give character and interest to the city, where the life of the past lingers
in a series of street pictures remaining from bygone days of pomp and show. Ministers of State
walk beneath many-coloured official umbrellas, held by obsequious attendants; graceful bedayas,
in glittering robes, execute intricate dances, and gamelon players discourse weird music on
pipe and drum. Court ballet-girls, known as Serimpi, are borne swiftly through the crowd in
gilded litters, and masked actors give al fresco performances of the historic Wayang-wayang,
represented by living persons, for the actual "shadow-play" is impossible in broad daylight.
The colour of the mask indicates the character assumed by the actor. The golden mask signifies
Divinity, heroes wear white, and evil spirits black or red. Here, as elsewhere, the profile
of the grotesque disguise invariably shows either the Greek, or the hawk-nose strangely suggestive
of Egyptian origin, and which, as a variation on human physiognomy, specially commended itself
to Mohammedan thought as a skilful evasion of an inconvenient dogma. Elsewhere the spirit of
concession to alien ideas is almost unknown, even flower and leaf being conventionalised on
those architectural monuments of Islam which form the supreme expression of Mussulman genius.
The suppression of national amusements has ever proved a perilous step, and in the heart of
this ancient kingdom the original setting of Javanese life remained in stereotyped form. The
moving panorama of the tree-shadowed streets possesses a strange fascination, and the light
of the past lingers like a sunset glow over the human element of the changed and modernised
city. The twang of double-stringed lutes, the tinkle of metal tubes, and the elusive melody
of silvery gongs, echo from the ages whence dance and song descend as an unchanged inheritance.
An itinerant minstrel recites the history of Johar Mankain, the Una of Java, who shone like
a jewel in the world which could not tarnish the purity and devotion of one whose heart entertained
no evil thought. In the intricate byways of the crumbling Kraton, a professional story-teller
draws a squalid crowd of women from their dark hovels and cellars, with the magic wand of enchantment
wielded by the reciter of heroic deeds from the Panji, exaggerated out of all recognition by
the addition of fairies and giants, demons and dwarfs, to the simple human element of the original
story. The apathy and decay of native life, lacking all the scope and interest common to a
strenuous age, appears galvanised into some fleeting semblance of vitality by the extravaganza
presented to it, for the language of hyperbole is the natural expression of Eastern thought,
and penetrates into mental recesses unknown and unexplored by the relater of unvarnished facts.
The quick response of the native mind to Nature's teaching, and the wealth of tradition woven
round flower and tree, mountain and stream, foster the love of marvel and miracle in those
whose daily wants are supplied by the prodigality of a tropical climate, for the innate poetry
of the race has never been crushed out by the weight of practical necessities.

A permit being obtained to view the interior of the Susunhan's palace under a Dutch escort,
we present ourselves at the colonnaded portico, where the Prince Probolingo, brother of the
Susunhan, receives his visitors with simple courtesy. This descendant of a hundred kings is
simply attired in a dark brown sarong and turban, the kris in his belt of embroidered velvet
ablaze with a huge boss of diamonds. Attendants, holding State umbrellas over the favoured
guests, usher them through marble-paved courts, in one of which a little prince is seated,
with furled golden umbrella behind him to denote his rank, a group of royal children playing
round him, their lithe brown forms half-hidden in the green shadows of a great tamarind tree.
A superb marble ball-room with crystal chandeliers, forms an incongruous modern feature of
the spacious Palace, but helps to popularise the so-called "Nail of the Universe" among the
European inhabitants of Solo, by the splendid entertainments continually given at the imperial
command. The porcelain and glass rooms convey an idea of the boundless hospitality bestowed;
the thousands of wine-glasses being especially noticeable, for 800 guests are often invited
at a time. Treasures of linen and costly embroidery, silken hangings and velvet banners, gorgeous
carpets and mats of finest texture, are displayed to our admiring eyes, but possession rather
than enjoyment is the keynote of Eastern character, and the bales and bundles of priceless
value, kept in huge cabinets of fragrant cedar-wood, seldom see the light of day. Long counting-houses
are crowded with native scribes, their brown bodies naked except for sarong and kris, the perpetual
rattle of the abacus making a deafening din, for apparently the smallest sum cannot be added
up under Eastern skies without the assistance of this wire frame with the ever-shifting marbles.
Cramped fingers move wearily over the yellow parchments, with their long lists of undecipherable
hieroglyphics, and the turbaned heads are scarcely raised until the entrance of the Prince
necessitates the time-honoured salute of the dodok, the crouching posture assumed in the presence
of a superior. The needs and luxuries of the immense royal household render the counting-house
a feature of the utmost importance. The Prince Probolingo has himself forty wives, and a Harem
in proportion to their numbers, the Susunhan's Imperial Harem far exceeding that of his brother.
Wonderful tales are told of the fairy-like loveliness belonging to these inner palaces, with
their treasures of ivory and sandalwood, cedar and ebony, but they are jealously guarded from
intrusion, and a glimpse of their fantastic glory seldom permitted to Western eyes. After an
exhibition of gold-encrusted litters and painted coaches of State, used in royal processions,
the Prince, a clever-looking man of forty, takes wine with his guests. Each stand of solid
silver contains six bottles, the crouching attendants also carrying silver trays of tumblers
and wine-glasses, a gaily clad servitor with a huge silver ice-bowl bringing up the rear. After
drinking the health of His Royal Highness in iced Rhine wine, we make our adieux, and escape
from our splendid pajongs of rainbow hue on the steps of the Great Entrance, conveying our
thanks through the medium of an interpreter. These fainéant princes learn no tongue but their
own, greatly to the advantage of their Dutch masters. The colossal incomes assigned to scions
of the royal stock only serve the double purpose of political expediency and personal extravagance,
for the luxury of a licentious Court remains unchecked, and the idea of educating or reforming
tributary princes is unknown in Java. Territorial rights were relinquished for pecuniary gains,
and the entire Court of the Susunhan is in the pay of the Dutch, the wealth amassed from the
richest island in the world affording ample compensation for the pensions lavishly bestowed
on the former owners of the tropical Paradise. The Dutch Resident, in his capacity of "Elder
Brother" to the indigenous race, claims the full privileges of his assumed position, but the
advancing tide of social reform has even touched these distant shores, and the alien authority
tends on the whole to the welfare of the community. Hygienic regulations are compulsory, and
even here the traditions of Holland enjoin an amount of whitewashing and cleaning up unique
in tropical colonies. The green and vermilion panelled sarongs of Solo are renowned for their
elaborate designs, and the painting of battek, or cotton cloth, remains a flourishing industry
of the ancient capital. The intricate beauty of the hand-made patterns far surpasses that of
the woven fabrics wherewith new mills and factories begin to supply the market. Centuries of
hereditary training, from the days when royal Solo was a self-supporting city, contribute to
the amazing skill of the battek girls, but the elaboration of native Art is doomed to decay,
for Time, hitherto a negligeable quantity in this "summer isle of Eden," begins to reveal a
value unknown to the Javanese past, and as the poetry of illumination vanished before the prose
of the printing press, so the painting of battek must inevitably give way to the wholesale
methods of Manchester in the near future of Java, just awakening from her spellbound sleep
to the changed conditions of life and labour. An exquisite plain, described by de Charnay as
unrivalled even in Java, surrounds Sourakarta with belts of palm, avenues of waringen, and
picturesque rice-fields of flaming green and vivid gold. Azure peaks frame the enchanting picture.
The storied heights are rich in traditions of gods and heroes, with innumerable myths haunting
the ruined temples which cluster round the base of the mountain range, and suggest themselves
as relics of an earlier creed than Buddhism or Brahminism. Archaic sculptures, obelisks, and
gateways, massive and undecorated, recall the architecture of Egyptian sanctuaries, but no
record exists which throws any light on the origin of the extensive monuments of a forgotten
past, though the triple pyramid of Mount Lawu is still a place of sacrifice to Siva the Destroyer.
Pilgrims climb the steep ascent to lay their marigold garlands and burn their incense-sticks
at the foot of the rude cairn erected in propitiation of the Divine wrath, typified by the
cloud and tempest hovering round the jagged pinnacles of the volcanic range, which frowns with
perpetual menace above the verdant loveliness of plain and woodland. The instinctive worship
seems one of those hereditary relics of a perished faith so frequently encountered in Java;
a blind impulse for which no reason can be ascribed by the devotee, swayed by those mysterious
forces of the subconscious self which seem imperishable elements in the brown races of the
Malay Archipelago. The native Court attracts myriad parasites, and the wealthy Chinese half-castes,
or Paranaks of Solo, with their inborn commercial genius, surpass all competitors in the pursuit
of fortune. The three centuries of mixed marriages have modified Chinese conservatism, and
though the Paranak is severely taxed, and excluded from all political offices, he remains supreme
in the kingdom of finance, regarded even by the Dutch as an indispensable factor in the complicated
affairs of the island.

The great passer of Solo becomes an endless delight, and the interminable corridors, where
the fumes of incense mingle with the breath of flowers, convey strange suggestions of antiquity.
Simple meals of rice and bananas progress round cooking-pots of burnished copper. Pink pomelo
and purple mangosteen vary the repast; strips of green banana leaf folded into cups fastened
with an acanthus thorn, or serving as plates for Dame Nature's prodigality, provide the accessories
of the feast as well as the provisions. The Javanese populace, wonderfully free from those
household cares which involve so much time and trouble in Northern nations strenuously occupied
in keeping the wolf from the door, and left to carry out their own inventions, have evolved
numerous methods of blending the different metals--steel and iron, brass and silver. The veinings
of the kris, beautiful as those of any Toledo blade, are produced by the welding of metals
steeped in lime-juice and arsenic, which destroy the iron and retain the ingrained pattern.
The chains of mingled brass and silver show exquisite designs and a special charm of colour,
in the soft golden hue and subdued gleam of the heavy links, with their richly-enamelled talismans
of ruby and turquoise enamel. Soft voices, tranquil movements, and courteous manners are the
age-long heritage of Malay idiosyncracy, and even in the crowded passer, with its horde of
buyers and sellers, noise and dispute are non-existent. It is a market of dreamland, and though
echoes of marching feet and music of native bands remind us that we are in imperial Sourakarta,
the busy hive of the passer suggests a panoramic picture of native life, rather than the pushing,
jostling crowd represented by the ordinary idea of a market in that Western hemisphere which,
in bestowing so many priceless gifts on humanity, has taken from it the old-world grace of repose.

SOURABAYA AND THE TENGGER.

The port of Sourabaya, supreme in mercantile importance, ranks as the second city of Java,
as it contains the military headquarters, the principal dockyards, and the arsenal. Leagues
of rice and sugar-cane lie between Solo and Sourabaya, the landscape varied by gloomy teak
woods, feathery tamarinds, and stately mango trees. White towns nestle in rich vegetation,
and the green common known as the aloon-aloon marks each hybrid suburb, Europeanized by Dutch
canals, white bridges, and red-tiled houses, planted amid a riotous wealth of palm and banana.
A broad river, brimming over from the deluge of the previous night, flows through burning Sourabaya;
a canal, gay with painted praus connecting it with the vast harbour, where shipping of all
nations lies at anchor, the sheltered roads bristling with a forest of masts and funnels. Bungalows,
in gorgeous gardens, flank dusky avenues of colossal trees, for even Sourabaya, the hottest
place in steaming Java, enjoys "a boundless contiguity of shade." In the sawa fields broad-eaved
huts, set on stilts above the swamp, protect the brown boys who frighten birds from the rice,
for the clapping and shouting must be carried on under shelter from the ardent sun. No air
blows from the rippling water, set with acres of lotus-beds, the fringed chalices of rose and
azure swaying on their plate-like leaves of palest green. The heterogeneous character of Sourabaya
gives unwonted interest to the streets, uniquely brilliant in grouping and colour. Gilded eaves
of Chinese houses, many-tiered Arab mosques, encrusted with polished tiles of blue and purple,
white colonnades of Dutch bungalows, and pointed huts of woven basket-work within wicker gate
and bamboo fence, mingle in fantastic confusion to frame a series of living pictures. Cream-coloured
bullocks and spirited Timor ponies, in creaking waggons and ramshackle carriages, pass in endless
procession. Bronze-hued coolies balance heavy loads on the swaying pikolan, a sloping pole
of elastic bamboo, and strolling players, rouged and tinselled, collect crowds in every open
space where a fluttering tamarind-tree offers a welcome patch of shadow to each turbaned audience,
clad in the paradisaical garb of the tropics. Graceful Malay women flit silently past, in pleasing
contrast to their burly Dutch mistresses, clad in a caricature of native garb which the appalling
heat of Sourabaya renders a more slatternly disguise than even colonial sans géne accomplishes
elsewhere. Orchids spread broad spathes of scented bloom from grey trunks of courtyard trees,
and cascades of crimson and purple creepers tumble over arch and wall. Insinuating Chinamen
untie bundles of sarongs, scarves, and delicate embroideries on the marble steps of hotel porticoes,
where the prolonged "shopping" of the drowsy East is catered for by the industrious Celestial,
when tokos are closed, and the tradesman sleeps on the floor amid his piled-up wares, for the
slumber of Java is too deep to be lightly disturbed, and the solemnity of the long siesta seems
regarded almost as a religious function. In this far-off land of dreams it seems "always afternoon,"
and the complacency wherewith the entire population places itself "hors de combat" becomes
a perpetual irritation to the traveller, anxious to seize a golden opportunity of fresh experience.
The sun sinks out of sight before the sultry atmosphere begins to cool. The weird "gecko,"
a large lizard which foretells rain, screams "Becky! Becky!" in the garden shadows, and a cry
of "Toko! Toko!" echoes from another unseen speaker of a mysterious language, while wraith-like
forms of his tiny brethren make moving patterns on the white columns, as the hungry little
reptiles hunt ceaselessly for the mosquitos which form their staple diet. Lashing rain and
deafening thunder at length cool the fiery furnace, blue lightning flares on the solid blackness
of heaven, and the storm only dies away when we start at dawn for Tosari, the mountain sanatorium
of the Tengger. The flat and flooded land glows with the vivid green of springing rice, tremulous
tamarind and blossoming teak bordering a road gay with pilgrim crowds, for the great volcano
of the Tengger remains one of Nature's mystic altars, dedicated to prayer and sacrifice. Moslem
girls in yellow veils jostle brown men with white prayer-marks and clanking bangles. The sari
of India replaces the sarong of Java, with fluttering folds of red and purple; children, clad
only in silver chains and medals, or strings of blue beads, dart through the crowd, from whence
the familiar types of Malay and Javanese personality are absent. We change carts in a busy
roadside passer, which drives a roaring trade in rice-cakes and fruit, syrups and stews, to
mount through changing zones of vegetation, where palms give place to tree ferns, and luscious
frangipanni or gardenia yields to rose and chrysanthemum. From the half-way house of Poespo,
a forest road ascends to Tosari. Sombre casuarina, most mournful of the pine tribe, mingles
with teak and mahogany in dense woods falling away on either side from the shadowy path. Innumerable
monkeys swing from bough to bough, eating wild fruits, and breaking off twigs to pelt the intruders
on their domains. At length the sylvan scenery gives place to endless fields of cabbage, potatoes,
maize, and onions, for the cool heights of the Tengger range serve the prosaic purpose of market-garden
to Eastern Java, and all European vegetables may be cultivated here with success. A patchwork
counterpane of green, brown, and yellow, clothes these steep slopes, but the extent of the
mountain chain, and the phantasmal outlines of volcanic peaks, absorb the incongruities grafted
upon them. Valerian and violet border the track between swarthy pines with grey mosses hanging
down like silver beards from forked branches, and sudden mists shroud the landscape in vaporous
folds, torn to shreds by gusts of wind, to melt away into the blue sky, suddenly unveiled in
dazzling glimpses between the surging clouds. A long flight of mossy steps ascends to the plateau
occupied by the Sanatorium, with wide verandahs and a poetic garden, like some old Italian
pleasaunce, with fountain and sundial, espaliered orange boughs, and ancient rose-trees overhanging
paved walks, gay parterres, and avenues of myrtle or heliotrope. Flowers are perennial even
on these airy heights, and dense hedges of datura, with long white bells drooping in myriads
over the pointed foliage, transform each narrow lane into a vista of enchantment. Eastern Java
spreads map-like beneath the overhanging precipice, the blue strait of Madoera curving between
fretted peak and palm-clad isle. The velvety plum-colour of nearer ranges fades through tints
of violet and mauve into the ethereal lilac of distant summits. The lowlands gleam with brimming
fish-ponds and flooded sawas, as though the sea penetrated through creek and inlet to the heart
of the green country, the vague glitter of this watery world investing the scene with dream-like
unreality. Brown campongs cling to mountain crest and precipitous ledge. These almost inaccessible
fastnesses were colonised after the Moslem conquest by a Hindu tribe which refused to relinquish
Brahminism. Driven from place to place by the fanatical hordes of Islam on the downfall of
the Hindu empire, the persecuted race, a notable exception to native inconstancy and indifference,
retreated by degrees to this mountain stronghold, where they successfully retained their religious
independence, and defended themselves from Mohammedan hostility. Brahminism through centuries
of isolation, has assimilated many extraneous heathen rites, and wild superstitions have overlaid
the original creed. The worship of the Tenggerese is now mainly directed to the ever-active
crater of the awe-inspiring Bromo, always faced by the longer side of the windowless communal
houses, built to contain the several generations of the families which in patriarchal fashion
inhabit these spacious dwellings. Huge clouds of smoke from the majestic volcano curl perpetually
above the surrounding peaks, and float slowly westward, the thunderous roar of the colossal
crater echoing in eternal menace through the rarefied air, and regarded as the voice of the
god who inhabits the fiery Inferno. These lonely hills, ravaged by tempest and haunted by beasts
of prey, are the hiding-places of fear and the cradles of ever-deepening superstition. Wild
fancies sway the untaught mountaineers, responsive to Nature's wonders, though powerless to
interpret their signification. The constant struggle for existence produces a character utterly
opposed to that of the suave and facile Malay. The graces of life are unknown, but the strenuous
temperament of the Tenggerese is shown by indefatigable industry in the difficult agriculture
of the mountain region, and the careful cultivation of the vegetables for which the district
is renowned. Day by day, the Tenggerese women--gaunt, scantily-clad, and almost unsexed by
incessant toil in the teeth of wind and weather--carry down their burdens to the plain, their
backs bent under the weight of the huge crates, while the brown and wizened children are prematurely
aged and deformed by their share in the family toil. The more prosperous inhabitant carries
his vegetables on a mountain pony, trained to wonderful feats in the art of sliding up and
climbing down walls of rock almost devoid of foothold, for the riding of Tenggerese youth and
maiden rivals that of the Sioux Indian. Misdirected zeal strips the hills of forest growth;
the scanty pines of the higher zone serving as fuel, and the ruthless destruction of timber
brings the dire result of decreasing rainfall. Only bamboo remains wherewith to build the communal
houses, formerly constructed of tastefully blended woods, and the flimsy substitute, unfitted
to resist drenching rain and raging wind, is dragged with the utmost difficulty from cleft
and gorge along rude tracks hewn out in the mountain side. Rice, elsewhere the mainstay of
life in Java, has never been cultivated by the Tenggerese, the sowing and planting of the precious
crop being forbidden to them during the era of gradual retreat before the Mohammedan army centuries
ago, and the innate conservatism of the secluded tribe, in spite of life's altered environment,
clings to the dead letter of an obsolete law. The tigers, once numerous round Tosari, have
retreated into the jungle clothing the lower hills, and seldom issue from their forest lairs
unless stress of weather drives them upward for a nightly prowl round byre and pen. The destruction
of covert renders Tosari immune from this past peril, and the tragic tiger stories related
round the hearthstone of the communal house are becoming oral traditions of a forgotten day,
gathering round themselves the moss and lichen of fable and myth.

The main interest of Tosari centres round the stupendous Bromo, possessing the largest crater
in the world, a fathomless cavity three miles in diameter, veiled in Stygian darkness, and
suggesting the yawning mouth of hell. This bottomless pit, bubbling like a boiling cauldron,
pouring out black volumes of sulphureous smoke, and clamouring with unceasing thunder, was
for ages a blood-stained altar of human sacrifice. Every year the fairest maiden of the Tengger
was the chosen victim offered to Siva, who, in his attribute of a Consuming Fire, occupied
the volcanic abyss. The worship of the Divine Destroyer has ever been a fruitful source of
crime and cruelty, and a tangible atmosphere of evil lingers round those hoary temples of India
dedicated to the Avenging Deity, whose fanatical followers are reckoned by millions. Through
the inversion of creed peculiar to Hindu Pantheism, the propitiation of Divine wrath has become
the fundamental principle of religion, and pathetic appeals for mercy continually ascend from
darkened hearts to those unseen powers vividly present to Hindu thought, which, amid countless
errors and degradations, has never ceased to grasp the central fact of Eternity. The impalpable
air teems with Divinity. Watchful eyes and clutching hands surround the pilgrim's path, and
unseen spirits dog faltering footsteps as they stumble through the snares and pitfalls of earthly
life. In the rude tribes of the Tengger, hereditary faith reflects the uncompromising features
of local environment. The lotus-eating races of the tropical lowlands, with their feeble grasp
on the sterner aspects of creed and character, have nothing in common with this Indian tribe,
remaining on the outskirts of an alien civilisation. The creed for which the early Tenggerese
fought and conquered, has cooled from white heat to a shapeless petrifaction, and weird influences
throng the ruined temple of a moribund faith, but the shadows which loom darkly above the mouldering
altars still command the old allegiance, and a thousand hereditary ties bind heart and soul
to the past.

The expedition to the Bromo, by horse or litter, affords the supreme experience of Javanese
volcanoes. The broken track, knee-deep in mud and rent by landslips, traverses fields of Indian
corn, rocky clefts, and rugged water-courses. The familiar flora of Northern Europe fringes
babbling brooks, their banks enamelled with wild strawberries and reddening brambles. Curtains
of ghostly mist lift at intervals to disclose the magical pink and blue of the mountain distance,
as sunrise throws a shaft of scarlet over the grim cliff's of the Moengal Pass. A chasm in
the stony wall reveals the famous Sand Sea below the abrupt precipice, a yellow expanse of
arid desert encircling three fantastic volcanoes. The pyramidal Batok, the cloud-capped Bromo,
and the serrated Widodaren, set in the wild solitude of this desolate Sahara, form a startling
picture, suggesting a sudden revelation of Nature's mysterious laboratories. The deep roar
of subterranean thunder, and the fleecy clouds of sulphureous smoke ever rising from the vast
furnaces of the Bromo, emphasise the solemnity of the marvellous scene. Native ideas recognise
this terror-haunted landscape as the point where Times touches Eternity, and natural forces
blend with occult influences. Tjewara Lawang, "the gate of the spirits," traditionally haunted
by the countless Devas of Hindu Pantheism, bounds the ribbed and tumbled Sand Sea with a black
bridge of fretted crags, from whence the invisible host keeps watch and ward over the regions
of eternal fire.

By a fortunate coincidence, the annual festival of the Bromo is celebrated to-day, when Siva,
the Third Person of the Hindu Triad, is propitiated by a living sacrifice. Goats and buffaloes
were flung into the flaming crater long after the offering of human victims was discontinued,
but, alas for the chicanery of a degenerate age! even the terrified animals thrown into the
air by the sacrificing priest never reach the mystic under-world, their downward progress being
arrested by a skilled accomplice, who catches them at a lower level, and risks great Siva's
wrath by preserving them for more prosaic uses. The silence of the Sand Sea is broken to-day
by the bustle of a gay market on the brink of the yellow plain. The terrific descent through
a gash in the precipice, carved by falling boulders, landslips, and torrential rains, lands
the battered pilgrim in the midst of a lively throng in festal array. Girls in rose and orange
saris, with silver pins in sleek dark hair plaited with skeins of scarlet wool, dismount from
rough ponies for refreshment, or gallop across the Sand Sea to the mountain of sacrifice. The
turbaned men in rough garb of indigo and brown show less zeal than their womenkind, and betel-chewing,
smoking, or the consumption of syrups and sweetmeats, prove more attractive than the religious
service, for modern materialism extends even to these remote shores, and the Avenging God is
often worshipped by proxy.

The Sand Sea was originally the base of the Tengger volcano, split from head to foot by an
appalling eruption, which forced mud, sand, and lava from the enclosing walls into the surrounding
valley. Fresh craters formed in the vast depths of sand and molten metal; the three new volcanoes--Bromo,
Battok, and Widodaren--casting themselves up from the blazing crucibles hidden beneath the
fire-charged earth. We stand on the thin and crumbling crust of the globe's most friable surface,
a mere veil concealing fountains of eternal fire, foaming solfataras, and smoking fumaroles.
Circle after circle, the great belt of volcanic peaks rises around us, visible outlets of incalculable
forces, ever menacing the world with ruin and havoc.

On the steep descent, a few devout pilgrims offer preliminary sacrifices of food, or flowers,
to the Devas of the mountains, laying the little treasures in oval vaults dug by human hands,
before entering the inner courts of the fiery sanctuary. The yellow Sand Sea, swept by a moaning
wind, sends up whirling eddies, and the dusky haze shimmers in fantastic outlines, which probably
originated the idea of spiritual presences hovering round the scene. Grey heather and clumps
of cypress-grass dot the wild Sahara with their dry and colourless monotony, but give place
on the southern side to patches of fern and turf, the scanty pasture of the mountain ponies,
herding together until sickness or accident breaks the ranks, when the hapless sufferer, deserted
by his kind, falls an easy prey to the wild dogs of the Tengger ranges. A heap of bleaching
bones points to some past tragedy, and terrifies the swerving horses of the native pilgrims.
The ascent of the Bromo is negotiated from the eastern side to the lip of the gigantic crater.
Slanting precipices of lava, their grey flanks scored with black gullies below the volcanic
ash which covers the upper slopes, rise to the jagged pinnacles bordering the black gulf of
eternal mystery and night. A rickety ladder of bamboo, approached through a chaos of boulders,
mounts to the edge of the profound abyss. The ladder has been renewed for this Day of Atonement,
and worshippers clad in rainbow hues crowd round the base of the volcano, while the priests
of Siva, in motley robes of brilliant patchwork, adorned with cabalistic tracery in white,
ascend the swaying rungs, bearing their struggling victims, bleating, crowing, and clucking
in mortal terror. Stalwart arms toss the black goat with accurate aim to an assistant priest,
who passes on his clever "catch" to a third expert in the task of hoodwinking Siva and depriving
him of his lawful prey. Sundry cocks and hens, evidently toothsome morsels, are then thrown
from one priest to another, and saved for the cooking-pot, but a tough-looking chanticleer
of the Cochin China persuasion is finally selected, and cast into the seething pit to propitiate
the terrible wrath of the Avenging Deity at the smallest expense and loss to the astute priesthood.
At the close of the sacerdotal is sacreligious performance, we mount the shaking ladder to
a thatched shed on the rim of the crater. From hence, between the dense volumes of smoke, the
huge cavity is visible to a depth of 600 feet. Sallow clouds of sulphur emerge from a pandemonium
of tumultuous clamour; red-hot stones shoot upward, but fall back into the chasm before they
reach us; burning ashes strike the smooth walls with a weird scream, and then whirl back into
the darkness; yellow solfataras rise in foaming jets, with the fierce hiss of unseen serpents,
and bellowing thunders shake the earth. The superb spectacle of nature's power in her armoury
of terror is unique among the volcanos of Java, for unless the Bromo blazes in the throes of
a violent eruption, when the ascent to the crater becomes impossible, no danger exists in gazing
down into the mysterious abyss. At every gust which rages round this laboratory of Nature,
the vast clouds--black, yellow, and blue--floating away into space, assume grotesque forms
suggesting primeval monsters or menacing giants, darkening the skies with their ghostly presence.
Driving rain and a rising gale hasten a rapid descent to the Sand Sea, but the sudden storm
dies away into sunlit mists. The climb to the Moenggal Pass is complicated by a series of pools
and cascades; the horses pick their own perilous way, but the management of the chairs by the
noisy coolies demands superhuman strength and security of hand and foot, the crazy and battered
doolie escaping falls and collisions by a continuous miracle.

The expedition to Ngandwona, in the heart of the hills, skirts green precipices and traverses
brown campongs forlorn and neglected, like this stranded Hindu race, incapable of adjustment
to life's law of change, and retaining the form without the spirit of the past. The glens lie
veiled in cloud, but the peaks bask in sunshine. Waterfalls dash through thickets of crimson
foxglove, and daturas swing their fragrant bells over the dancing water. A little goatherd,
leading his bleating flock, plays on a reed flute to summon a straggler from a distant crag.
The brown figure, in linen waistcloth and yellow turban, suggests that Indian personality which
has survived ages of exile on these lonely heights. The route to Ngandwona discloses the Tengger
in a different aspect; the volcanos are far away, and this central region is rich in pastoral
pictures full of lulling charm. The voice of the Bromo still breaks the silence of the deep
valley with a mysterious undertone, but only benignant Devas haunt this flower-filled hollow,
remote alike from the terrors of Nature and the influences of the external world.

The following day varies the character of the range, exposed to every vicissitude of temperature
and climate. White billows of fog beat upon the mountain tops like a silent sea, and blot out
the landscape with an impenetrable veil. Thunder echoes through the rocky caves with incessant
reverberations, and rain settles down in a drenching flood. The chill of the wooden Hotel penetrates
to the bone; enthusiasm wanes below zero, and even scorching Sourabaya appears preferable to
this wet and windy refuge on the storm-swept heights. The hurricane proves brief in proportion
to the violence displayed, and the walk to Poespo at dawn, behind the baggage-coolie, is a
vision of delight. Violet mountains lean against the pale blue of a rain-washed sky, tjewara
and teak glisten with jewelled lustre, and the Tengger, bathed in amethystine light, lifts
itself above the world as the realm of purity and peace, ever revealed and prophesied by the
glory of mountain scenery.

CELEBES.

MAKASSAR AND WESTERN CELEBES.

Each island of the great Archipelago offers distinctive interests, for many alien races grafted
themselves on the original stock, after those age-long wanderings across the Southern seas
which probably coincided with the westward march from Central Asia, whereby primeval man fulfilled
the decrees of destiny.

A long pull in a rickety sampan across the harbour of Sourabaya involves numerous collisions
with fruit-boats, canoes, and rafts, before reaching the steamer in the offing. Intervals of
comparative safety permit cursory observation of the gorgeously-painted praus with upturned
stern, curving bamboo masts, and striped sails, the outline of the gaudy boats accentuated
by a black line, and producing the effect of huge shells tossing on the tide. The green isle
of Madoera, and the level morasses of Eastern Java, bound the wide harbour, the blue cloud
of the distant Tengger soaring abruptly on the horizon. The ship becomes our home for a month,
and affords a welcome relief from divers struggles on land, involved by a dual language, official
red tape, and native incompetence. A brilliant sunset flames across the heavens, and we glide
across a golden sea as a fitting prelude to unknown realms of enchantment. The dreamful calm
of the two days' passage obliterates the memory of bygone difficulties and perturbations, the
interval between past and future experiences falling like refreshing dew on the weary spirit,
and increasing the receptive capacity required for the assimilation of new impressions. The
vast extent of the Malay Archipelago, and the stupendous size of the principal islands, comes
as a fresh revelation to travellers whose ideas have been limited by vague recollections of
schoolroom geography. The seven hundred miles of Java's length, Sumatra's vast extent of fourteen
hundred miles, the area of Borneo equalling that of France and Germany combined, and the fact
of Celebes, for which we are bound, exceeding the dimensions of Norway and Sweden, convey startling
suggestions of the limitless space occupied by the great Equatorial group. The palms and flowers
of myriad smaller isles break the blue monotony of these summer seas traversed by the Malay
wanderers of olden days, striving to sail beyond the sunset, and to overtake that visionary
ideal flitting ever before them, and luring them on with the fairy gold of unfulfilled desires.

At length the high blue peaks of central Celebes pierce the silver mists of a roseate dawn,
and beyond a cluster of coral islets, the white town of Makassar gleams against a green background
of palms. Miles of brown campongs fringe the shore, but the gay scene on the wooden wharves
at first occupies undivided attention. Sarongs of crimson, orange, purple, or boldly-contrasting
plaids, enhance the deep bronze of native complexion, the ample folds of the wide skirts drawn
up above the knees. High turbans of white or red cambric, elaborately twisted, add dignity
to the stately figures, deeply-cut features and hawk noses denoting Arab origin, for the Makassarese
is a lineal descendant of the Moslem pirates, once the terror of these island-studded seas.
Proud, courageous, and passionately addicted to adventurous travel in far-off lands, these
sturdy islanders have little in common with the inert races of Java. The normal Malay element
appears extinguished by the fiery superstructure of Arab nature, retaining the vindictive and
fanatical traits of ancestral character. The women, in rainbow garb, use their floating slandangs
as improvised yashmaks, holding the red and yellow folds before their faces in approved Moslem
fashion, when passing a man. Makassar, formerly ruled by a line of powerful princes as an independent
fief, but now subject to a Dutch Governor, has become the capital of Celebes, and occupies
an important commercial position. The wharves are filled with bales of copra, mother-of-pearl
shells, plumage of native birds, dried fish, bundles of rattan, and precious woods from the
primeval forests of the interior. The boom of the fisherman's drum echoes across the water
in constant reverberations, a secularised relic of the religious past, originally serving the
purpose of the Mohammedan call to prayer, but now fulfilling the prosaic office of signalling
the arrival or departure of boats, though the devout mariner still appeals by drum to the Heavenly
Powers for fair weather and a good haul of fish. The official buildings of Makassar, including
the Dutch Governor's palace, face a green aloon-aloon, flanked by superb avenues of kanari
and tamarind trees. The hoary fort, scarcely distinguishable from the solid rock which supports
it, was captured from the King of Goa by a Dutch admiral, who thrust his sword through an adjacent
cocoanut palm, to symbolise his intention of piercing the hearts of all who resisted the Treaty
afterwards drawn up. The sword and cocoanut now form part of the heraldic arms belonging to
Makassar.

Local costume affords a continuous feast of colour, and streets and avenues appear like moving
tulip beds, the broad blue sky and dazzling sunshine of this tropical land intensifying every
glowing tint of robe, fruit, and flower. In the umber shadows of dusky tokos, gold-beaters
fashion those red-gold ornaments rich in barbaric beauty, for which Makassar has ever been
renowned. Portuguese art glorifies native workmanship, and the Dutch carry on the traditions
of the past, merely simplifying the old methods by introducing modern tools to lighten the
labour of production. Silken scarves, and elaborately-painted battek, woven with gold and silver
thread, swing from the black rafters of dim corridors, and countless treasures of the deep,
in shells and coral of rich and delicate colouring, manifest the infinite variety of Nature's
handiwork. From the crowded lanes, with their busy markets and hybrid population, we drive
through the long line of campongs bordering the palm-fringed coast. The bamboo walls of the
fragile houses, standing on stilts or rocking on poles in the rippling sea, show a multitude
of fantastic designs, the broad roofs of thatched grass or plaited palm-leaves extending in
penthouse eaves above carven panels let into the gables. A riot of glorious vegetation frames
and overshadows the clustering huts of deftly-woven cane. Dark faces peer through the narrow
slits of bamboo window-spaces, but Makassar pride contains the elements of self-respect, and
though the stranger attracts a certain amount of interest, no discourtesy mars the pleasure
of exploration. A red road beneath towering palms, skirts rice-fields and bamboo thickets to
the beautiful ford of the Tello, a broad river flowing between vast woods of cocoanut and bread-fruit
trees, with only a tiny dug-out, steered by a brown boy in a scarlet turban, to dispel the
loneliness of the scene. The vicinity of Makassar offers no special characteristics beyond
those of a tropical garden, but the changing aspects of native life provide subjects of unceasing
interest. To-day a great Chinese festa takes place, which attracts all the inhabitants of town
and campong, for amusements are scarce on these distant shores, and no questions of race or
faith complicate the determination to secure a share in the pleasures of the ceremony. When
the usual burst of squibs and crackers, lighting of bonfires, and tossing of joss-papers into
the air, marks the commencement of the holiday, spectators line the roads, climb the trees,
and crowd the fiat roofs of Portuguese houses. The afternoon is the children's portion of the
festival, and the little bedizened figures, with rouged faces, tinsel crowns, and spangled
robes, bestride grotesque wooden dragons, fishes, and birds, brilliantly painted, and drawn
on wheels by masked men in robes of pink and green. A crowd of high-class babies, also bedizened
and spangled, follows in perambulators wreathed with flowers, and pushed by their Chinese nurses.
Hideous gods in glittering robes, and appalling demons painted in black and scarlet, bring
up the rear of the long procession, which traverses every street and lane of the Chinese campong,
the open houses displaying the lighted altars and tutelary gods of Buddhist and Taoist creed,
for the mystic philosophy of the Eastern sages materialises into grossest realism by passing
through the crucible of Chinese thought.

A visit to the so-called "Kingdom of Goa" fills up our last day in Makassar. The Palace of
the tributary Sultan, ten miles from the capital, consists of steep-roofed houses built upon
huge trunks of forest trees, and connected by carved galleries and crumbling stairs with the
Harem at the back of the main edifice. Squalid women in blue yashmaks loll on the crazy verandah,
whence a native secretary marshals us through the dusty and ruinous building. The Sultan, taking
to the hills as a necessary precaution after inciting his subjects to rebellion against the
Dutch, has just been captured, but, whether by accident or design, fell over a cliff, and until
his dead body is brought back to receive the Mohammedan rites of burial, the royal residence
remains in charge of the police. The grass-grown road to the decaying Palace intersects the
rambling and sordid village of Goa, the feudal appanage of the sorry chieftain, a perpetual
thorn in the side of the Dutch Government. The surrounding country appears almost a solitude,
the silence stirred by the song of the distant surf, the chirping of myriad grasshoppers, and
the ceaseless clash of waving palms in the breeze which steals up from the sea. A quaint water-castle,
shaped like a Chinese junk, stands on a rock in a fish-pond reflecting the rosy sky, and the
fretted marble of a beautiful Arabian tomb gleams from a clump of white-starred sumboya exhaling
incense on the air. As the magic and mystery of night shroud Makassar in a mantle of gloom,
the surrounding sea becomes a vision of phosphorescent flame to the furthest horizon. The sheet-lightning
of the tropical sky repeats the wonders of the deep, the glamour of romance gilds the prose
of reality, and we apprehend that spirit of wondering awe which breathes through the records
of old-world voyagers across uncharted oceans, when witnessing the phenomena of Nature in the
sanctuary of her power, before Science had torn the veil from the mystic shrine.

The steamer's course follows the bold and mountainous coast; steep cliffs alternate with forest-clad
ravines, the purple ranges of the foreground melting into the azure crests of soaring peaks.
Skilful navigation is required in threading the blue water-lanes of the Spermunde group, the
scores of palm-clad islets like bouquets of verdure thrown on the tranquil sea. The wicker-work
campongs of the fishing population form a ring round each white beach of sparkling coral sand.
The black bow of the "Bromo," a ship which broke her back on a reef twenty years ago, stands
high above the treacherous rocks, and accentuates the vivid colouring of water and foliage.
At Paré-Paré, a native campong in a deep bay at the edge of a forest, the steamer stops to
discharge cargo, and affords an opportunity of landing. A gay crowd lines the shore of the
picturesque village, the houses of palm-thatched bamboo adorned with carved ladders and upcurving
eaves of white wood. One of the numerous military expeditions to turbulent Celebes has lately
been successful, and the campong, where every hut was closed for a year in consequence of the
local Rajah forcing his people to join in his insurrection, has at last been re-opened, though
under a guard of Dutch and Malay troops. A brown bodyguard of native children, mainly clad
in silver chains and medals, escorts the strangers with intense delight to a shabby little
mosque, where a Dervish, in the orange turban rewarding a pilgrim to Mecca, beats a big drum
in the stone court. The little savages encountered at Mandja on the following day seem equally
free from clothes and cares, but Europeans, though possessing the charm of novelty, are regarded
with awe; a sudden stop, a word, or even a lifted hand, sufficing to make the whole juvenile
population take to their heels, and hide among the palms and bananas until a sudden impulse
of fresh curiosity banishes fear. Clothing is at a discount, but ornaments of brass, silver,
and coloured beads, are evidently indispensable. Natural flowers, like immense red fuchsias
with long white bells, serve as ear-rings, and scarlet caps adorn the sleek black heads of
the elder girls. An al fresco picnic party from the hills occupies a green mound, and boils
a kettle on sticks of flaming bamboo, though a stray spark might easily burn down the entire
campong. A great part of Celebes is uninhabited and uncultivated, but the tribes of the interior,
warlike and treacherous, have never been completely subjugated. The slave trade flourishes
among these lonely hills, murder and violence are rife; the methods of warfare, comprising
poisoned arrows, and bullets containing splinters of glass, denote absolute barbarism, and
the enormous island, which ought to be a field of emigration for some of Java's twenty-seven
millions, except for the coast campongs and the rice-grounds of the far interior, remains one
of the waste places of the earth, in spite of a perfect climate and a teeming soil.

Day by day the scenery becomes more wild and dreary; the forests disappear, and the sun-baked
hills encroach on the low brushwood beyond the white beaches of coves and inlets, without any
sign of habitation. An atmosphere of crystalline purity discloses the highest range of the
interior, a long chain of azure peaks. Our course traverses league upon league of melancholy
solitude, emphasised rather than relieved by the brilliant sunlight and balmy breezes playing
over this realm of neglected possibilities, where the wants of countless sufferers might be
abundantly supplied. Anchoring for an hour in the deep blue bay of Tontoli, we come once more
into the haunts of men, and two picturesque campongs buried in cocoa-palms beneath the wooded
mountains of Tomini are pointed out as exclusively peopled by descendants of the pirates who
infested this western coast of Celebes. From this point the interest of the cruise increases.
Pretty campongs line the shore of every sheltered creek. Boats of quaint form and colour push
off to meet the steamer, quickly surrounded by sampans, blotos (the native canoes), or carved
and painted skiffs, all manned by an amphibious race in Nature's suit of brown, which renders
the wearers indifferent to overturned boats, water-logged blotos, and collapsing rafts, though
the encouraging statements of our Malay crew as to the warmth and shallowness of the water
in case of any contretemps, is less reassuring to the travellers who venture shoreward on the
risky craft. The loan of the captain's boat makes the visit to Dongalla an experience of unalloyed
pleasure, but the people appear morose and sullen. A dignified youth, in purple turban and
checked sarong, attempts to do the honours of his native place, but his comrades, oppressed
by vague suspicions, close the heavy doors of their wooden houses, and peep through the interstices
of the bamboo shutters as we thread the narrow alleys, escorted by the deck steward. A more
genial crowd welcomes us to the palm-groves of Palehle, where a light-hearted bodyguard of
children shows us every nook and corner of the brown campong, with smiling faces and merry
laughter. The heart-whole mirth of these little savages might brighten the saddest soul. Living
in the present, with no artificial wants to create dissatisfaction, and free from the pains
or penalties of poverty, as experienced in Northern climes, the simple life close to the heart
of Nature suggests ideas of Eden's unshadowed joy. Amid the treasures of memory garnered during
the winter's wanderings through the Malay Archipelago, the unclouded merriment which endows
these children of Nature remains as the deepest impression stamped on the memory of the Western
pilgrim. European childhood, at the best and brightest, but faintly approaches this spontaneous
gaiety, the special attribute of untutored souls in a world of primal innocence.

At Soemalata the steep declivities of wooded mountains enclose the harbour, and a narrow pass
leads to the gold mines, where the process of smelting and separating the ore takes place in
a primitive series of conduits, sluices, mills, and pounding machines. The gold concession
granted by the local Rajah prospers in European hands, but the barbaric chieftain adheres to
the ancient custom of having the gold washed from the river sand by his own slaves. The English
engineer of the mines hails a compatriot with delight, and his explanation of the complicated
machinery ends with a welcome invitation to tea in his pretty bungalow. A solitary Englishman
is frequently found stationed in the remotest outposts of civilisation throughout the Malay
Archipelago, enduring a life of unexampled loneliness with the tenacity and determination inherent
in national character. The oft-receding vision of a successful future inspires the dauntless
heart less than a sense of present duty, and these exiles from the social ties of nation and
kindred possess special claims on sympathy and remembrance. Lovely lanes of palm and banana,
brightened by trees of crimson poinsettia, wind upward to the hills, and a cluster of green
islets gems the blue waters; the scarlet-stemmed Banka palm offering a glowing contrast to
the sweeping emerald of the feathery fronds. The little settlement of Kwandang, with a gold
fabrik occupying a wooded islet, completes the circuit of the western coast, for the North-Eastern
Cape comprises a distinctive province, requiring a separate chapter. Intervening mountains,
with jagged cliffs and towering summits, rise like Titanic fortresses from the creaming surf
which washes the yellow bastions, leaving no space for the wicker campongs, impermanent as
a child's house of cards, but perpetually rebuilt in identical fashion, and never developing
into substantial dwellings, or adjusted on the new lines required by varieties of environment.

THE MINAHASA.

Steaming slowly through the phosphorescent seas of the starlit night, we anchor at dawn in
the forest-lined bay of Amoerang, the principal harbour of the Minahasa. The picturesque Northern
Cape of Celebes contains a population differing in origin and character from all other races
of the vast island, and conveys the idea of a distinctive country. The mountain panorama of
shelving ridges and fretted promontories, breaking the outlines of the rocky coast with infinite
variety, culminates in the chiselled contours of volcanic peaks, cutting sharply into the silvery
blue of a stainless sky. Amoerang, half-buried in sago-palms, on the green rim of the secluded
haven, shows slight resemblance to the campongs generally encountered on the western coast.
Wooden cottages, though built on piles of wood or stone, and thatched with atap (plaited palm
leaves) possess many features in common with the screened and balconied dwellings of Japan.
The people, in aspect and feature, also convey suggestions of the Japanese origin ascribed
to them, for ancient traditions assert that the Minahasa was colonised by an Asiatic tribe,
driven out of Formosa by native savages, in one of those wild raids upon the peaceful maritime
population which drove them to face the perils of an unknown sea, rather than fall into the
ruthless hands of the bloodthirsty aborigines who inhabited the forests and mountains of the
interior. Many of the hapless exiles perished through hunger, thirst, storm, and shipwreck
of their slightly-built craft, during the long wanderings which ended as though by chance for
the survivors, in the distant Minahasa. The Malay element in those Japanese refugees, displayed
the usual characteristics of skill in boat-building and navigation, together with that accurate
observation of natural phenomena which alone could compensate for the lack of scientific knowledge.
The women, with oblique eyes and oval faces, wear the gay sarong and white kabaja customary
in Eastern Java. The men, in shapeless gowns and wide trousers, with broad hats of battered
straw on their close-cropped hair, afford a sorry spectacle of unbecoming and disorderly attire,
conveying grotesque hints of Japanese ideas beneath the squalid ugliness overlaying them. The
fishermen, conveniently unclad for the necessities of their calling, wear only a yellow or
scarlet waist-cloth, the bright touch of colour emphasising the deep bronze of their slight
but athletic forms. The people of the Minahasa, Christianised after the Calvinistic methods
of Dutch and German missionaries a century ago, have always been specially favoured by the
Government of Holland, and large sums are annually expended in improving the status of this
distant colony. The making of roads, the building of schools and churches, and the improvement
of social conditions, are liberally catered for, not only for the advantage of the Minahasa,
but that no excuse may exist for any rebellion against such paternal rule. Tribal insurrections
continually recur in the great Archipelago, where a storm in a teacup often swells into dangerous
proportions, and the peaceful adherence of the Minahasa to the powers that be becomes an important
factor in turbulent Celebes. The race, so strangely amalgamated with alien interests, shows
the apathy of a temperament incapable of developement on foreign lines, though unable to resist
the pressure imposed upon it. The pretty campong seems silent as the grave. No native warongs,
or restaurants, enliven the straight roads with their merry crowds or cheerful gossip, and
sellers of food and drink, whose cries echo through the streets of Makassar, are unknown in
this northern port, where even the arrival of the fortnightly steamer fails to excite much
interest in the public mind.

A rash determination to drive across the Minahasa, and pick up the boat at Menado, involves
unimagined difficulties. Heavy waggons drawn by brown sappies (i.e., bullocks), which travel
at the rate of two miles an hour, suffice for native use in remote Amoerang, but at length
a dilapidated gig, with two sorry steeds harnessed in tandem fashion by sundry bits of old
rope, is produced. Having frequently experienced the pace accomplished by many a Timor pony
of emaciated and dejected aspect, faith accepts even this unpromising team for the long drive
of thirty miles. Quaint campongs, with bamboo fences and curiously arched gateways, flank the
woodland road. Each little garden flames with red poinsettia, purple convolvulus, and yellow
daisies. The latticed screens pushed back from open verandahs, show Japanese-looking rooms,
furnished with the European lamps, chairs, and tables, exported by thousands to the Minahasa,
but the same atmosphere of stagnation broods over these quiet villages, and even the children,
returning from a bamboo schoolhouse on the edge of the forest, show the staid and solemn demeanour
of their elders. For a few miles all goes well, with the trifling exception of occasional breakages
in the countless knots of the rope harness. The last whistle of the steamer floats upward as
she leaves her anchorage, and refusing to yield to a faint misgiving as to the success of the
present enterprise, eyes and thoughts concentrate themselves on the increasing beauty of the
mountain road, the living emerald of the rice-fields, and the picturesque mills for husking
the grain, which give special character to this unique district of Celebes. Suddenly the rickety
conveyance comes to a full stop, and a kicking match begins, the plunging ponies refusing to
budge an inch. The incapable Jehu implores his fare's consent to an immediate return, but meets
with an inexorable refusal, the halting Malay sentences eked out with an unmistakable pantomime
of threats and warnings. The driver's whip, supplemented by an English umbrella, produces no
effect on the obtuse animals, which have to be led, or rather hauled, on their unwilling way.
One obstreperous steed becomes so unmanageable that it becomes necessary to hitch him to the
back of the cart, at the imminent risk of overturning it, in his determination to thwart his
companion's enforced progress. Mile after mile the wearisome struggle continues. Even a lumbering
bullock waggon passes us again and again, in the numerous stoppages required for fresh conflict.
The endless hours of the weary day drag on like a terrible nightmare, but a descent into a
profound ravine of these mountain solitudes at length enables the driver to start the team
at a rate which makes it impossible for them to stop, and he vaults lightly into his place
as we spin merrily downhill. Our troubles are not over, for on the next upward grade the old
game of rearing, backing, and futile attempts at buck-jumping, begins again. Despairing eyes
rest on a thatched booth at the roadside, containing a row of bottles hung up by a string,
with the bamboo tube for coins. Holding the ropes, and currying favour with the ponies by leading
them to a patch of grass, it becomes possible for the boy to leave them for a sorely-needed
drink of the sago-wine. The fiendish animals try to upset the cart, and the fight recommences
for the fiftieth time, but the brown huts of a campong in a cactus thicket inspire hope, and
after a furious battle in the street, to the intense delight of the Japanese-looking people,
a man comes to the rescue with a stout pony. The boy mounts one battered steed, the other is
left behind in a hospitable stable, and we trot briskly on through lovely scenery of forest
and mountain to Kanas, at the head of the beautiful lake of Tondano, hitherto seen in glimpses
at an immense depth between encircling peaks. Wearied almost to stupefaction by eleven hours
of a combat, after which victory seems scarcely less ghastly than defeat, we would gladly remain
for the night at the little Rest House of Kanas, but prudence compels us to push on to Tondano,
at the other end of the lake, while a capable pony remains at disposal. The lake road is a
vista of entrancing loveliness, overhung by arching bamboos and great sago-palms, the vanguard
of the forest which clothes the lower spurs of the purple mountain ranges, shutting off the
long blue lake from the outside world. A rudely-built bloto, merely the hollowed trunk of a
tree, crosses the water, with a torch flickering at the prow, for the sun has set, and the
crimson afterglow begins to fade from the serrated crests of the opposite heights. The ripple
of the water in the reeds at the edge of the road, and the sigh of the evening breeze, fluttering
the leaves and creaking the yellow canes of the great bamboos, alone stir the silence, which
comes as a welcome relief after the toil and excitement of the day; but alas! we have all forgotten
the perils of the road at nightfall, and in the sudden darkness, deepened by the shadowy trees,
a false step might precipitate cart and passengers into the deep water. Any advance becomes
dangerous on the winding way, which follows every curve of the irregular shore, so a halt is
called, while the boy rides on towards some twinkling lights denoting a lakeside campong. After
a long wait, he returns in triumph with three matches and a piece of flaming tow in a bottle.
By observing due precaution, we can now follow his guidance, while he holds out the flaring
light with extended arm. As we turn round the foot of the lake into a raised causeway above
fields of ripening rice, the full moon comes up behind the sombre hills, and transfigures the
night with a sparkling flood of silver glory. We reach the white Dutch town of Tondano as the
clock strikes ten, but everyone is in bed at this dissipated hour, and difficulty is experienced
even in getting admission to the little Hotel, though the delight of finding an English-speaking
landlord atones for a somewhat ungracious reception after a long and painful pilgrimage, which
should serve as a solemn warning against the rash attempt to penetrate the wilds of the Minahasa
under native guidance.

Tondano, with houses and verandahs gleaming in spotless whiteness among green spaces and luxuriant
trees, appears a typical Dutch town, incongruous but picturesque. The absolute purity and transparency
of the atmosphere give value and intensity to every shade of colour, and the scarlet hybiscus
flowers show the incandescent glow belonging rather to lamps than to blossoms. The river Tondano
forms a series of lovely cascades below the town, situated four miles from the lake at the
present time, for the marshy flats have been reclaimed as rice-grounds, thus somewhat diminishing
the stretch of water. The steep drive down to Menado offers a succession of lovely views. The
little port, in a nest of verdure, encircles the azure bay, where our steamer, merely a white
speck in the distance, lies at anchor. A turn of the road discloses a glimpse of the mountain
lake, a sheet of sapphire sparkling in the morning sun, but retrospective thoughts in this
instance convey pain as well as pleasure, for "mounting ambition" has for once "o'erleapt itself,"
and failure counterbalances success. Menado, divided by the river, is inhabited by two distinct
tribes of the mysterious colonists who came from the farthest East to these unknown shores.
The ubiquitous Chinaman has found a firm footing in the northerly port of Celebes, and the
splendidly-carved dragons of a stately temple, rich in ornaments of green jade, blue porcelain,
and elaborate brass-work, denote the important status of the wealthy community. A busy passer
supplies the usual pictures of native life, but the people of the Minahasa, here as elsewhere,
lack both the gay insouciance of the South, and the strenuous energy of the Northern mind,
the residuum of apathetic dullness, deprived of all the salient characteristics which constitute
charm and interest. European houses of Dutch officials stand in ideal gardens of brilliant
flowers and richest foliage. The little Hotel Wilhelmina is a paradise of exotic blossoms,
but Menado, apart from a lovely situation, and the usual riot of glorious verdure which makes
every tropical weed a thing of beauty, offers little inducement for a prolonged stay. The bay,
exposed to contrary winds and chafed by conflicting currents, tosses in perpetual turmoil,
though a long jetty diminishes the former difficulties of the stormy passage between ship and
shore. In the amber light of sunset, the dark mountain ranges stand out with unearthly clearness.
The jagged peaks of Klabat and Soedara in the background, bringing into prominence the grey
cliffs and purple ravines of the smoking Lokon. The wonderful scenery of the Malay Archipelago
seldom lacks that element of terror which enhances the radiant loveliness of Nature by painting
it on a tragic background of storm and cloud, the vague suggestion of evanescence intensifying
the mysterious charm with poetic significance. The receding coast discloses a striking panorama
of the mountain heights piled one upon another, the grey towers and bastions guarding this
narrowing Cape of the Minahasa, a veritable outpost of Nature, eternally washed by the restless
seas. As the steamer rounds the savage promontories, and threads the blue straits formed by
two rocky islets at the northern extremity, the weird and desolate landscape conveys a strange
sense of separation even from the alien humanity which peoples the far-reaching peninsula of
the Minahasa, and this northern extremity appears a limitless waste. Chaotic masses of imperishable
granite, splintered reefs thrusting black spikes through the creaming surge, and wind-swept
cliffs of fantastic form, characterise the solemn headland, unpainted and unsung, although
the sea-girt sanctuary of Nature demands interpretation through the terms of Art and Poetry.

GORONTALO AND THE EASTERN COAST.

The steamer's first halt on the wild eastern coast of Celebes is the gold-mining settlement
of Todok, where the Company's rustic offices of palm-thatched bamboo border an enchanting bay,
with a string of green islets studding the shoaling blue and purple of the gleaming depths.
Two passengers disembark for the ebony plantations on the slopes of a volcanic range, declaring
itself by a slight earthquake rocking the atap shanty, where the ship's officer who tallies
the cargo, offers hospitality until the fierce heat modifies sufficiently for a stroll.

A dusty and shadeless road leads up into the wooded hills which bound the prospect, but the
campong, largely consisting of recently-constructed dwellings, occupied by alien employés in
the service of the Gold Syndicate, offers no inducements for exploration, and until the launch
returns, a shadowy palm-grove by the wayside makes a welcome retreat from the dust and glare,
the creaking of innumerable bullock-waggons, and the shouts of crew and coolies, disputing
over the loading of a raft.

The arrival at Gorontalo in the radiant dawn provides a more interesting experience. The river
which forms the beautiful harbour, rushes through a profound ravine of the forest-clad mountains,
which descend sharply to the water's edge. The scene resembles a Norwegian fiord, translated
into tropical terms of climate and vegetation. A narrow track climbs the ledges of a cliff
behind the brown fishing campong of Liato, but a rude wharf on the opposite side affords a
less picturesque though safer landing, for the swirling currents of the swift stream require
more careful navigation than the amphibious boatman, unembarrassed by clothing, is wont to
bestow on craft or passenger. The spirit of enterprise is also in abeyance, scotched if not
killed by the struggles of the memorable pilgrimage through the Minahasa. The quiet haven in
the shadow of the guardian hills looks an ideal haunt of peace. A Dutch battleship lies at
anchor, and the red sails of a wide-winged prau make broken reflections in the rippling clearness
of the green water. A wooden bridge crosses the river at the narrow end of the funnel-shaped
harbour, connecting it with the town in the steaming valley, the usual medley of open tokos
and atap huts, supplemented by two dubious hotels, a green aloon-aloon, and a few stone houses
denoting the presence of the European element. The original inhabitants of Gorontalo are of
Alfoer race--dark, glum, and forbidding. How this ancient stock, indigenous to some of the
southern islands in the Malay Archipelago, wandered from thence to distant Celebes has not
been satisfactorily accounted for. The records of savage tribes depend on oral tradition, but
the outlines of an oft-told tale become blurred and dim during the lapse of ages, when the
mental calibre of the racial type lacks normal acumen. The graces of life are ignored by the
Alfoer woman, her mouth invariably distorted by the red lump of betel-nut, accommodated with
difficulty, and rendering silence imperative. Her bowed shoulders become deformed with the
heavy loads perpetually borne, for the rising trade of Gorontalo supplies the men with more
congenial employment than the field work, which frequently becomes the woman's province. A
straight road between crowding palms crosses a wide rice-plain, opening out of the cleft carved
by the mountain river, and leads to the curious Lake of Limbotto, a green mass of luxuriant
water-weeds, the dense vegetation solidifying into floating islands of verdure, intersected
by narrow channels, only navigable to a native bloto skilfully handled, for Nature alternately
builds up and disperses these flowery oases, blocking up old water-ways and opening new ones
with bewildering confusion. Buffaloes wallow between the tangled clumps of pink lotus and purple
iris, and wild ducks nest in the waving sedges, or darken the air in a sudden flight down the
long lake. A noisy market flanks the water, and bronze figures, in red turbans row gaily-clad
women, laden with purchases, to some distant campong, reached through the mazes of verdure.
The country passer, a shifting scene of gaudy colouring, contains greater elements of interest
than commercial Gorontalo, where the native campong loses individuality in gaining the prosaic
adjuncts of a trading centre. The lovely harbour dreams in the moonlight as we steam slowly
out of the widening estuary to pick up cargo in the great bay of Tomini, which sweeps in a
mighty curve round half the Eastern coast of Celebes. The conical island of Oena-Oena rises
sheer from the waves, the red peak of a lofty volcano composing the apex of a green pyramid,
formed by a forest of palms. Until six years ago no anchorage for ships was possible at this
forest-clad isle, but a volcanic eruption deepened the bay, and a thriving trade in copra was
initiated, for the whole surface of Oena-Oena is clothed with a dense mass of drooping cocoanut
trees. Scattered dwellings nestle in the thick woods, but no regular campong exists in this
thinly-peopled spot, a vernal Eden set in the purple sea. The heat of the day, though intense,
is everywhere tempered by the interlacing canopies of the feathery fronds, until sunset fuses
them into the vivid transparency of green fire, and a fluttering zephyr stirs the whispering
foliage. The shy brown people, who at first hide in their atap huts at the approach of strangers,
venture out to see the last of the departing steamer, which forms the sole link between barbarism
and civilisation, and a month must elapse before any contact with the outside world can vary
the seclusion of this lonely spot, a dreamland vision of repose. At Posso, the next port on
Celebes, we land a Dutch officer, bound for the important barracks on a hill above the straggling
campong, after a successful expedition against the tree-dwellers, cannibals, and slave-traders
of the interior, still sunk in barbarism. An olive-green river, infested with crocodiles, flows
sluggishly through rank vegetation into the sea below the dilapidated huts of the depressing
native town. This forlorn outpost of military duty involves exile from civilisation, and the
risk of occasional raids from the wild tribes of the surrounding hills.

At Parigi, canopied by spreading palms, the atap houses, with bamboo rafters strengthening
the fragile walls, stand in neglected gardens, overgrown with a tangle of flower and foliage.
The low tide makes the dangerous bloto a necessity, though the hollowed tree, top heavy and
water-logged, is in imminent peril of capsizing every minute of the long course between ship
and shore. Objections to a boat upsetting in shallow water being beyond Malay comprehension,
the only way of accomplishing the transit in safety is by a summary command that two brown
boys should immediately jump overboard to lighten the rocking craft. Nothing loth, they swim
to shore in our wake, rolling over in the sand to dry themselves like Newfoundland dogs, and
with less embarrassment on the score of clothing. A native Queen or Maharanee rules Parigi
from her bamboo palace in the deepest recesses of the adjacent palm-forest, but she is invisible
to her subjects, and dwells in the seclusion of purdah, possibly a relic of Indian origin.
Her nominal authority proves insufficient to keep the peace between the native population and
the Dutch, for Parigi has been for months in a state of insurrection and unrest. Only a year
ago a raid was made on the Eurasian merchant's office wherein I take shelter from the noonday
sun, and two white men were attacked by a band who rushed down from the mountains and cut off
their heads. The ringleader of the assassins is now imprisoned for life in the gaol of Batavia,
no capital punishment being permitted in the Netherlands India. An immense cargo of copra and
rattan fills a fleet of boats and rafts. The great stacks of cane cause no annoyance, but the
sickening smell of copra (the dried and shredded cocoanut used for oil) pervades the ship,
and an occasional cockroach of crab-like dimensions clatters across the deck in his coat of
mail from a hiding place in the unsavoury cargo. The philosophic Hollander accepts these horrors
of the tropics with undisturbed composure, but happily for the peace of the English passenger,
the Malay "room-boy" welcomes a new idea, and becomes gradually inspired with the ardour of
the chase. Ominous clouds darken over the Bay of Tomini as we embark once more on the rolling
waters, having completed the circuit of the vast island, possessing a coast-line of 2,500 miles.
Blue peaks and waving palms recede into the mists of falling night. We are once more afloat
on a sleeping sea, the restful monotony of wind and wave enabling indelible impressions of
each varying scene to sink deeply into mind and memory, and preventing the too rapid succession
of travelling experiences.

A GLIMPSE OF BORNEO.

An element of uncertainty attends the cruise among the Malayan islands, through sudden orders
to include strange ports of call in the programme of the route. During the stay at Makassar,
a cable from Batavia necessitates a flying visit to Borneo, and though the détour was made
from the western coast of Celebes, the great sister island demands a special notice. In steaming
thither through the radiant glory of an Equatorial sunset, strange atmospheric effects denote
fresh variations of climate and temperature. The rounded horizon, which suggests the rim of
the terrestrial globe, seems within a stone's throw of the ship, and as the crimson sun sinks
below the sharply-defined curve outlined by the sea, a glowing hearth of smouldering embers
appears burning on the edge of the water. The eastern sky blooms into vivid pink from the reflection
of this fiery incandescence, which fades only to give place to the leaping brightness of phosphorescent
waves, and the nightly pageant of tropical skies ablaze with lambent flames of summer lightning.
Morning reveals the dark forests of mysterious Borneo, rolling back to the misty blue of a
mountain background. The pathless jungles of teak and iron wood, inextricably tangled by ropes
of liana or ladders of rattan, latticed with creepers and wreathed with clambering fern, make
an impenetrable barrier between the settlements of the coast and the unknown interior, where
barbarism still reigns triumphant, and "head-hunting" remains the traditional sport. Insurmountable
difficulties of transit and progress are reported, even by the few enthusiastic botanists,
who merely penetrate the outworks of Nature's stronghold in search of rare orchids, worth more
than a king's ransom if we take into account the sacrifice of life, and the hardships suffered
in wresting these floral gems from their forest casket. Any complete exploration of these tropical
wilds seems at present beyond human means and capacities, but even a few months of the soil
and climate of Borneo can transform a forest clearing into a wilderness of riotous vegetation,
more impassable than that woodland maze of a century's growth encircling the palace of the
Sleeping Beauty in the loveliest of old-world fairy tales. Our present quest has no connection
with the mysteries of the interior, and only concerns itself with the prosaic task of taking
in a cargo of oil, used as the ship's fuel. We steam into a wooded bay, beneath a hill covered
with the brown atap bungalows of European colonists. Colossal oil-tanks, painted red, disfigure
the shore. Each tank holds 4,000 tons of oil, 30,000 tons per month being the usual export.
Kerosene taints the air, but is considered to be innocuous, and to drive away the curse of
mosquitos. The unimaginable and ferocious heat makes every step a terror, during a snail's
progress up a wooded road. Sun-hat and white umbrella scarcely mitigate the scorching rays
on this perilous promenade, but there is only a day at disposal, and it cannot be wasted. Towards
noon a breeze springs up, and exploration of the long line of tokos beyond the wharves is simplified
by the spreading eaves of palm-leaf thatch. A row of workmen's dwellings forms a prosaic continuation
of the campong, inhabited by a mixed population, chiefly imported to Balik-Papan in the interests
of the oil trade. A chance rencontre with the Scotch doctor of the European settlement affords
an opportunity of visiting the Oil Refinery, with the varied distillations, culminating in
the great tank of benzine, a concentration of natural forces like a liquid dynamite, capable
of wrecking the whole settlement in a moment. Endless precautions and vigilant care alone secure
the safety of Balik-Papan from the perils incidental to the vast stores of explosive material.
The raw petroleum brought from the mines of Samarinda, farther down the coast, by a fleet of
hoppers (the local steamers which ply round the indented shore), is extracted by boring a stratum
of coal known as "antichine," and always containing indications of mineral oil. Dutch and English
Companies work this valuable product; fortunes are quickly made, and the industrious inhabitants,
absorbed in dreams of a golden future, appear untroubled by any consciousness of metaphorically
sleeping on the brink of a volcano. Iced soda-water, and a brief siesta, revive drooping spirits
after the broiling exertions of the morning, and as the shadows of the palm-trees lengthen
on the edge of the jungle, it becomes possible to mount the hill behind the wharf to the picturesque
bungalow of another kindly Scot, who invites me to tea. The pretty tropical dwelling of plaited
atap, through which every precious breath of air can penetrate, stands in the midst of a gorgeous
thicket, composed of scarlet hybiscus and yellow Allemanda, the splendid blossoms growing in
wild luxuriance on this sandy soil. The glare of the sun still requires the atap screens to
be closed on the broad-eaved verandah, but the freshness of the evening breeze steals into
the twilight of the pretty drawing-room, the simple but refined appointments of a restful home
intensely refreshing after weeks of ship and hotel existence. The fragrant tea, with dainty
cups and saucers, and the home-made cakes, seem almost forgotten luxuries, for the amenities
of British civilisation stop short at Singapore. A cheery party assembles round the table,
and these exiles on a foreign shore extend the warmest of welcomes to the stray bird of passage,
who will soon leave behind only the shadowy "remembrance of a guest who tarrieth but a day."
The idea so familiar to the self-seeking spirit, that "it is not worth while" to trouble about
a passing acquaintance, finds no echo in this hospitable coterie. To the visitor, the bright
hours of that afternoon, ten thousand miles away from England, remain as an evergreen memory
of genuine human sympathy, the true "touch of Nature" linking hearts and lives. A long walk
through the encroaching jungle fills up the day. The narrow track skirts dark depths of matted
foliage, with strange bird-calls echoing through the gloom. The phenomenal growth of vegetation
in Borneo is so rapid that a month's neglect in cutting back branches, and rooting up masses
of strangling creeper, would entirely obliterate the path. This power grew day by day, and the
delightful correspondence which existed between Bradford Torrey and herself, although they had
never met face to face, bears witness to her constant mental record and memory respecting the habits
of birds and woodland manners. Every year we find her longing for larger knowledge; books and
men of science attracted her; and if her life had been less intensely laborious, in order to make
those who belonged to her comfortable and happy, what might she not have achieved! Her nature
was replete with boundless possibilities, and we find ourselves asking the old, old question, Must
the artist forever crush the wings by which he flies against such terrible limitations?--
a question never to be answered in this world.

Her observations began with her earliest breath at the islands. "I remember," she says, "in the spring,
kneeling on the ground to seek the first blades of grass that pricked through the soil, and
bringing them into the house to study and wonder over. Better than a shopful of toys they were to
me! Whence came their color? How did they draw their sweet, refreshing tint from the brown
earth, or the limpid air, or the white light? Chemistry was not at hand to answer me, and all
her wisdom would not have dispelled the wonder. Later, the little scarlet pimpernel charmed
me. It seemed more than a flower; it was like a human thing. I knew it by its homely name of
'poor man's weather glass.' It was so much wiser than I; for when the sky was yet without a cloud,
softly it clasped its small red petals together, folding its golden heart in safety from the shower
that was sure to come.

How could it know so much?"

Whatever sorrows life brought to her, and they were many and of the heaviest, this exquisite enjoyment
of nature, the tender love and care for every created thing within her reach, always stayed
her heart. To see her lift a flower in her fingers,--fingers which gave one a sense of supporting
everything which she touched, expressive, too, of fineness in every fibre, although strong
and worn with labor,--to see her handle these wonderful creatures which she worshiped, was something
not to be forgotten. The lines of Keats,--

"Open afresh your rounds of starry folds, Ye ardent marigolds!"

were probably oftener flitting through her mind or from her lips than through the mind or from the lips
of any since Keats wrote them. She remembered that he said he thought his "intensest pleasure
in life had been to watch the growth of flowers," but she was sure he never felt their beauty
more devoutly "than the little half-savage being who knelt, like a fire-worshiper, to watch the
unfolding of those golden disks."

The time came at last, as it comes to every human being, for asking the reason of the faith that
was in her. It was difficult for her to reply.

Her heart had often questioned whether she believed, and what; and yet, as she has said, she
could not keep her faith out of her poems if she would. We find the following passage in "Among
the Isles of Shoals," which throws a light beyond that of her own lantern.

"When the boat was out late," she says, "in soft, moonless summer nights, I used to light a
lantern, and going down to the water's edge take my station between the timbers of the slip, and
with the lantern at my feet sit waiting in the darkness, quite content, knowing my little star
was watched for, and that the safety of the boat depended in a great measure upon it.... I felt
so much a part of the Lord's universe, I was no more afraid of the dark than the waves or winds; but
I was glad to hear at last the creaking of the mast and the rattling of the rowlocks as the
boat approached."

"A part of the Lord's universe,"--that Celia Thaxter always felt herself to be, and for many years she
was impatient of other teaching than what nature brought to her. As life went on, and the mingled
mysteries of human pain and grief were unfolded, she longed for a closer knowledge. At first she sought
it everywhere, and patiently, save in or through the churches; with them she was long impatient.
At last, after ardent search through the religious books and by means of the teachers of the Orient,
the Bible was born anew for her, and the New Testament became her stay and refreshment. At
this period she wrote to her friend, Mrs. H. M. Rogers: "K. and I read the Bhagavad Gita every
day of our lives, and when we get to the end we begin again! It is a great thing to keep one's
mind full of it, permeated as it were; and I think Mohini's own words are a great help and inspiration
every- where, all through it as well as in the beautiful introduction. I have written out clearly
on the margin of my copy every text which he has quoted from the Scriptures, and find it most interesting.
'Truth is one.'"

Nothing was ever "born anew" in Celia Thaxter which she did not strive to share with others.
She could keep nothing but secrets to herself. Joys, experiences of every kind, sorrows and
misfortunes, except when they could darken the lives of others, were all brought open handed
and open hearted, to those she loved. Her generosity knew no limits.

There is a description by her of the flood which swept over her being, and seemed to carry her away
from the earth, when she once saw the great glory of the Lord in a rainbow at the island.
She hid her face from the wonder; it was more than she could bear. "I felt then," she said,
"how I longed to speak these things which made life so sweet, --to speak the wind, the cloud,
the bird's flight, the sea's murmur, --and ever the wish grew;" and so it was she became, growing
from and with this wish, a poet the world will remember. Dr. Holmes said once in conversation
that he thought the value of a poet to the world was not so much
the pleasure that this or that poem might give to certain readers,
or even perchance to posterity, as the fact that a poet was known
to be one who was sometimes rapt out of himself into the region of
the Divine; that the spirit had descended upon him and taught him
what he should speak.

This is especially true of Celia Thaxter, whose life was divorced from worldliness, while it
was instinct with the keenest enjoyment of life and of God's world. She liked to read her poems
aloud when people asked for them; and if there was ever a genuine reputation from doing a thing
well, such a reputation was hers. From the first person who heard her the wish began to spread,
until, summer after summer, in her parlor, listeners would gather if she would promise to read
to them. Night after night she has held her sway, with tears and smiles from her responsive little
audiences, which seemed to gain new courage and light from what she gave them. Her unspeakably
interesting nature was always betraying itself and shining out between the lines. Occasionally
she yielded to the urgent claims brought to bear upon her by her friend Mrs. Johnson, of the Woman's
Prison, and would go to read to the sad-eyed audience at Sherborn. Even those hearts dulled
by wrong and misery awakened at the sound of her voice. It was not altogether this or that
verse or ballad that made the tears flow, or brought a laugh from her hearers; it was the deep sympathy
which she carried in her heart and which poured out in her voice; a hope, too, for them, and for
what they might yet become. She could not go frequently,--she was too deeply laden with responsibilities
nearer home; but it was always a holiday when she was known to be coming, and a season of light-heartedness
to Mrs. Johnson as well as to the prisoners.

It is a strange fallacy that a poet may not read his own verses well. Who besides the writer should
comprehend every shade of meaning which made the cloud or sunshine of his poem? Mrs. Thaxter certainly
read her own verse with a fullness of suggestion which no other reader
could have given it; and her voice was sufficient, too, although not
loud or striking, to fill and satisfy the ear of the listener.

But at the risk of repetition we recall that it was her own generous, beautiful nature, unlike that
of any other, which made her reading helpful to all who heard her. She speaks somewhere of
the birds on her island as "so tame, knowing how well they are beloved, that they gather on
the window-sills, twittering and fluttering gay and graceful, turning their heads this way
and that, eying you askance without a trace of fear." And so it was with the human beings who
came to know her. They were attracted, they came near, they flew under her protection, and
were not disappointed of their rest.

Four years before Mrs. Thaxter left this world, when she was still only fifty-five years old, she
was stricken with a shaft of death. Her overworked body was prostrated in sudden agony, and
she, well, young, vigorous beyond the ordinary lot of mortals, found herself weak and unable to
rise. "I do so hate figuring as an interesting invalid," she wrote. "Perhaps I have been doing
too much, getting settled. But oh, I used to be able to do anything! Where is my old energy
and vigor and power gone! It should not ebb away quite so soon!" She recovered her wonted tone and sufficient
strength for every-day needs, and still found "life so interesting." But her keen observation
had been brought to bear upon her own condition, and she suspected that she might flit away from
us quickly some day.

Except for one who was especially dependent upon her she was quite ready. The surprises of this
life were so wonderful, it was easy for her to believe in the surprises of the unseen; but her letters
were full as usual of the things which feed the springs of joy around us in this world. One
summer it was the first volume of poems of Richard Watson Gilder which gave her great happiness.
She talked of them, recited them, sent them to her friends, and finally wrote to Mr. Gilder himself.
Since her death he has said, "I never saw Mrs. Thaxter but once, and that lately; but her immediate
and surprising and continuous appreciation and encouragement I can never forget." How many other
contemporaneous writers and artists could say the same!

The transparent simplicity of her character and manners, her love and capacity for labor, were
combined with equal capacities for enjoying the complex in others and a pure appetite for
pleasure. It would be impossible to find a more childlike power of enjoyment.

A perfect happiness came to her, during the last eight years of her life, with the birth of
her grandchildren. The little boy who surprised her into bliss one day by crying out "I 'dore
you, I 'dore you, granna! I love you every breff!" was the creature perhaps dearest to her heart; but
she loved them all, and talked and wrote of them with abandonment of rejoicing. Writing to her
friend Mrs. Rogers, she says: "Little E. stayed with his 'granna,' who worships the ground he walks
on, and counted every beat of his quick-fluttering little heart. Oh, I never meant, in my old
age, to become subject to the thrall of a love like this; it is almost dreadful, so absorbing, so stirring
down to the deeps. For the tiny creature is so old and wise and sweet, and so fascinating in his
sturdy common sense and clear intelligence; and his affection for me is a wonderful, exquisite
thing, the sweetest flower that has bloomed for me in all my life through."

Her enjoyment of art could not fade nor lose its keenness. Her life had been shut, as we have seen,
into very narrow limits. She never had seen the city of New York, and life outside the circle
we have described was an unknown world to her. She went to Europe once with her eldest brother, when
he was ill, for three months, and she has left in her letters some striking descriptions of what
she saw there; but her days were closely bounded by the necessities we have suggested. Nevertheless
the great world of art was more to Celia Thaxter than to others; perhaps for the very reason
that her mind was open and unjaded. Her rapture over the great players from England; her absolute
agony, after seeing "The Cup" played by them in London, lest she could never, never tell the
happiness it was to her, with Tennyson's words on her own tongue, as it were, to follow Miss Terry's
perfect enunciation of the lines,--these enjoyments, true pleasures as indeed they are, did
not lose their power over her.

Gilbert and Sullivan, too, could not have found a more amused admirer. "Pinafore" never grew
stale for her, and her brothers yielded to her fancy, or pleased it, by naming their little steamer
Pinafore. She went to the theatre again and again to see this, and all the succeeding comedies
by the same hands. She never seemed to weary of their fun.

But the poets were her great fountain of refreshment; "Siloa's brook" was her chief resort. Tennyson
was her chosen master, and there were few of his lines she did not know by heart. Her feeling for
nature was satisfied by the incomparable verses in which he portrays the divine light shining
behind the life of natural things. How often have we heard her murmuring to herself,--

"The wind sounds like a silver wire,"

or,

"To watch the emerald-colored water falling,"

or,

"Black as ash-buds on the front of March."

Whatever it might be she was observing, there was some line of this great interpreter of nature
ready to make the moment melodious. Shakespeare's sonnets were also her close companions; indeed,
she seized and retained a cloud of beautiful things in her trustworthy memory. They fed and cheered her
on her singing way.

In the quiet loveliness of early summer, and before the tide of humanity swept down upon Appledore,
she went for the last time, in June, 1894, with a small company of intimate friends, to revisit
the different islands and the well-known haunts most dear to her. The days were still and sweet,
and she lingered lovingly over the old places, telling the local incidents which occurred
to her, and touching the whole with a fresh light.

Perhaps she knew that it was a farewell; but if it had been revealed to her, she could not have been
more tender and loving in her spirit to the life around her.

How suddenly it seemed at last that her days with us were ended! She had been listening to music,
had been reading to her little company, had been delighting in one of Appleton Brown's new pictures,
and then she laid her down to sleep for the last time, and flitted away from her mortality.

The
burial was at her island, on a quiet afternoon in the late summer. Her parlor, in which the body
lay, was again made radiant, after her own custom, with the flowers from her garden, and a bed of
sweet bay was prepared by her friends Appleton Brown and Childe Hassam, on which her form was laid.

William
Mason once more played the music from Schumann which she chiefly loved, and an old friend, James De
Normandie, paid a brief tribute of affection, spoken for all those who surrounded her. She was
borne by her brothers and those nearest to her up to the silent spot where her body was left.

The
day was still and soft, and the veiled sun was declining as the solemn procession, bearing
flowers, followed to the sacred place. At a respectful distance above stood a wide ring of interested
observers, but only those who knew her and loved her best drew near. After all was done, and the
body was at rest upon the fragrant bed prepared for it, the young flower-bearers brought their
burdens to cover her. The bright, tear-stained faces of those who held up their arms full of flowers
to be heaped upon the spot until it became a mound of blossoms, allied the scene, in beauty
and simplicity, to the solemn rites of antiquity.

It was indeed a poet's burial, but it was far more than that: it was the celebration of the passing
of a large and beneficent soul.

WHITTIER. NOTES OF HIS LIFE AND HIS FRIENDSHIPS

BORN DECEMBER 17, 1807; DIED SEPTEMBER 7, 1892

The figure of the Quaker poet, as he stood before the world, was unlike that of any other prominent
figure which has walked across the stage of life. This may be said, of course, of every individual;
yet the likenesses between men of a given era, or between modern men of strong character and
those of the ancient world, cause us sometimes to exclaim with wonder at the evident repetitions in development.
One can hardly walk through the galleries of antique statues, nor read the passages of Plutarch or Thucydides,
without finding this idea thrust upon the mind. But with regard to Whittier, such comparisons
were never made, even in fancy. His lithe, upright form, full of quick movement, his burning eye,
his keen wit, bore witness to a contrast in himself with the staid,
controlled manner and the habit of the sect into which he was born.

The love and devotion with which he adhered to the Quaker Church
and doctrines served to accentuate his unlikeness to the men of his
time, because he early became also one of the most determined contestants
in one of the sternest combats which the world has witnessed.

Neither in the ranks of poets nor divines nor philosophers do we find his counterpart. He felt
a certain brotherhood with Robert Burns, and early loved his genius; but where were two more unlike?
A kind of solitude of life and experience, greater than that which usually throws its shadow
on the human soul, invested him in his passage through the world. The refinement of his education,
the calm of nature by which, in youth, he was surrounded, the few books which he made his own,
nearly all serious in their character, and the religious atmosphere in which he was nurtured,
all tended to form an environment in which knowledge developed into wisdom, and the fiery
soul formed a power to restrain or to express its force for the good of humanity.

But as surely as he was a Quaker, so surely also did he feel himself a part of the life of New
England. He believed in the ideals of his time; the simple ways of living; the eager nourishing of
all good things by the sacrifice of many private wishes; in short, he made one cause with Garrison
and Phillips, Emerson and Lowell, Longfellow and Holmes. His standards were often different
from those of his friends, but their ideals were on the whole made in common.

His friends were to Whittier, more than to most men, an unfailing source of daily happiness and gratitude.
With the advance of years, and the death of his unmarried sister, his friends became all in
all to him. They were his mother, his sister, and his brother; but
in a certain sense they were always friends of the imagination.

He saw some of them only at rare intervals, and sustained his relations with them chiefly in
his hurried correspondence. He never suffered himself to complain of what they were not; but what they
were, in loyalty to chosen aims, and in their affection for him, was an unending source of pleasure.
With the shortcomings of others he dealt gently, having too many shortcomings of his own, as he
was accustomed to say, with true humility. He did not, however, look upon the failings of his friends
with indifferent eyes. "How strange it is!" he once said. "We see those whom we love going
to the very verge of the precipice of self-destruction, yet it is not in our power to hold them
back!"

A life of invalidism made consecutive labor of any kind an impossibility. For years he was only
able to write for half an hour or less, without stopping to rest, and these precious moments were
devoted to some poem or other work for the press, which was almost his only source of income.
His correspondence suffered, from a literary point of view; but his letters were none the less
delightful to his friends. To the world of literature they are perhaps less important than those
of most men who have achieved a high place.

Whittier was between twenty and thirty years of age when his family left the little farm near
Haverhill, where he was born, and moved into the town of Amesbury, eight miles distant. Long
before that period he had identified himself with the antislavery cause, and had visited, in
the course of his ceaseless labors for the slaves, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington. These brief
journeys bounded his travels in this world.

In the year 1843 he wrote anxiously to his publisher, Mr. Fields, "I send with this 'The Exiles,'
a kind of John Gilpin legend. I am in doubt about it. Read it, and decide for thyself whether
it is worth printing."

He began at this rather late period (he was then thirty-six years old) to feel a touch of satisfaction
in his comparatively new occupation of writing poetry, and to speak of it without reserve to
his chosen friends. His poems were then beginning to bring him into
personal relation with the reading world. Many years later, when speaking
of the newspaper writing which absorbed his earlier life, he said
that he had written a vast amount for the press; he thought that his
work would fill nearly ten octavo volumes; but he had grown utterly
weary of throwing so much out into space from which no response ever
came back to him. At length he decided to put it all aside, discovering
that a power lay in him for more congenial labors.

From the moment
of the publication of his second volume of poems, Whittier felt himself
fairly launched upon a new career, and seemed to stand with a responsive
audience before him. The poems "Toussaint L'Ouverture," "The Slave-Ships,"
and others belonging to the same period, followed in quick succession.
Sometimes they took the form of appeal, sometimes of sympathy, and
again they are prophetic or dramatic.

Such voices could not be silenced.
Though men might turn away and refuse to read or to listen, the music
once uttered rang out into the common air, and would not die.

A homely
native wit pointed Whittier's familiar correspondence. Writing in
1849, while revising his volume for publication, he speaks of one
of his poems as "that rascally old ballad 'Kathleen,'" and adds that
it "wants something, though it is already too long." He adds: "The
weather this morning is cold enough for an Esquimau purgatory-- terrible.
What did the old Pilgrims mean by coming here?"

With the years his
friendship with his publisher became more intimate. In writing him
he often indulged his humor for fun and banter: "Bachelor as I am,
I congratulate thee on thy escape from single (misery!) blessedness.
It is the very wisest thing thee ever did. Were I autocrat, I would
see to it that every young man over twenty-five and every young woman
over twenty was married without delay. Perhaps, on second thought,
it might be well to keep one old maid and one old bachelor in each
town, by way of warning, just as the Spartans did their drunken helots."

Discussing
the question of some of his "bad rhymes," and what to do about them,
he wrote once: "I heartily thank thee for thy suggestions. Let me
have more of them. I had a hearty laugh at thy hint of the 'carnal'
bearing of one of my lines. It is now simply rural. I might have made
some other needful changes had I not been suffering with headache
all day."

Occasionally the fire which burned in him would flame out,
as when he writes in 1851: "So your Union-tinkers have really caught
a 'nigger' at last! A very pretty and refreshing sight it must have
been to Sabbath-going Christians yesterday--that chained court-house
of yours. And Bunker Hill Monument looking down upon all! But the
matter is too sad for irony. God forgive the miserable politicians
who gamble for office with dice loaded with human hearts!"

From time
to time, also, we find him expressing his literary opinions eagerly
and simply as friend may talk with friend, and without aspiring to
literary judgment. "Thoreau's 'Walden' is capital reading, but very
wicked and heathenish. The practical moral of it seems to be that
if a man is willing to sink himself into a woodchuck he can live as
cheaply as that quadruped; but after all, for me, I prefer walking
on two legs."

It would be unjust to Whittier to quote this talk on
paper as his final opinion upon Thoreau, for he afterwards read everything
he wrote, and was a warm appreciator of his work.

His enthusiasm
for books and for the writers of books never faded. "What do we not
all owe you," he writes Mr. Fields, "for your edition of De Tocqueville!
It is one of the best books of the century. Thanks, too, for Allingham's
poems. After Tennyson, he is my favorite among modern British poets."

And
again: "I have just read Longfellow's introduction to his 'Tales of
the Inn'--a splendid piece of painting! Neither Boccaccio nor Chaucer
has done better. Who wrote 'A Loyal Woman's No?' Was it Lucy Larcom?
I thought it might be."

In 1866 he says: "I am glad to see 'Hosea
Biglow' in book form. It is a grand book--the best of its kind for
the last half-century or more. It has wit enough to make the reputation
of a dozen English satirists."

This appreciation of his contemporaries
was a strong feature of his character. His sympathy with the difficulties
of a literary life, particularly for women, was very keen. The appalling green and
vermilion deities who guard the temple courts, indicate fear as the chosen handmaid of faith
in this grotesque travesty of religion, but the costly tiling of violet and azure, the rich
gilding of the curling eaves terminating in scarlet dragons, and the deeply-chiselled ebony,
falling like a veil of thick black lace before the jade and porphyry shrines, prove that even
the despised Chinaman offers of his best to the Divinity dimly apprehended by his darkened soul.

The large Malay School of Amboyna manifests an educational position in advance of the smaller
islands, and knowledge of the wider world beyond the Archipelago stimulates the spirit of enterprise
inherited in different degrees and varying conditions, both from Malay and Portuguese ancestry.

A dilapidated carriage is chartered with difficulty, as only three vehicles belong to the island,
and the driver evidently expects his skeleton steed to collapse at any pace quicker than a
walk. The green lanes, with their hedges of scarlet hybiscus overhung by the feathery foliage
of tamarind and bamboo, wind along the shore, and penetrate into the depths of the hills. Rustling
sago-palms sway their tall plumes on the mountain side, and shadow luxuriant clove gardens,
their pungent aroma mingling with nutmeg and cinnamon to steep the soft sea-wind in a wealth
of perfume. European houses of white stone nestle among palm and tamarind, the broad seats
flanking the central door, and the bulging balconies of old Dutch style recalling the 16th
century dwellings on the canal banks of distant Holland, but the crow-stepped gable here gives
place to the flat roof. Every green garden contains a refuge of interwoven gaba-gaba stalks,
as a retreat during earthquakes, when the overthrow of the flimsy arbour would entail no injury,
though it serves as a shelter from the torrential rains which often accompany volcanic disturbances.
A wayside stall of palm-thatched bamboo provides sageroe for thirsty pilgrims. This fermented
beverage often excites the Ambonese nature to frenzy, though only made from the juice of the
arên or sugar palm. The brown dame who presides over the bamboo buckets, in her eagerness to
honour a white customer, wipes an incredibly dirty tumbler on her gruesome calico skirt before
dipping the precious glass into the foaming pail, and tastes the draught by way of encouragement.
With some difficulty she is induced to wash the tumbler, and to omit the last reassuring ceremony.
The sageroe, sweet and refreshing, gains tonic properties from an infusion of quassia, which
sharpens the flavour and strengthens the compound, packed in bamboo cases or plaited palm-leaf
bags for transport to the neighbouring islands. A grey fort, and weather-worn Government offices,
flank the green aloon-aloon of Amboyna, surrounded by tamarind avenues. The Dutch Resident
finds ample employment, owing to the mania for litigation among the Ambonese. The honour of
appearing before a Court of Justice is eagerly sought, and imaginary claims or grievances are
constantly invented in order to satisfy the ambition for publicity. A modest and retiring temperament
forms no part of native equipment, and the slight veneer of Christianity, in the crudest phase
of Dutch Protestantism, increases the aggressive tendency. The missionary agencies of Calvinistic
Holland seem incapable of practical sympathy with the island people; but half a loaf is better
than no bread, and in any form of Christian faith the Heavenly Husbandman scatters grains of
wheat among the tares, that all His wandering children may reap a share of harvest gold even
from a stubborn and sterile soil.

Amboyna shows signs of commercial prosperity in the crowded passer and the busy Chinese campong,
for the enterprising Celestial forms an important element of the mercantile community in the
Clove Island. Three memorial tablets erected in front of the hoary fort, the bare Dutch church,
and the crumbling guard-house, record the worthy name of Padrugge, a Dutch Governor who restored
Amboyna after complete destruction by a violent earthquake, that ever-haunting terror within
the great volcanic chain of the Malay Archipelago. The steep acclivity behind the palm-shaded
park of the Residency contains a stalactite grotto, infested by a multitude of bats, which
cling to the sparkling pendants of the fretted roof, unless disturbed by the Ambonese coolies,
who regard them as culinary delicacies, and catch them in this ancient breeding-place, with
a noise which brings down the terrified creatures into unwelcome proximity, cutting short any
attempts at exploration, and causing rash intruders to beat a hasty retreat.

In the hush of dawn, when the intensity of calm steals colour as well as sound from the motionless
waters, we embark on an expedition to the Zeetuinen, or Sea Gardens, the fairy world of the
coral reefs, revealed through the magic mirror of the watery depths. As we gaze steadily through
the silvery blue of the glassy sea, a misty vision of vague outline and shifting colour materialises
into an enchanted forest, and appears rising towards the surface. Coral trees, pink and white,
gold and green, orange and red, wave interlacing branches of lace-like texture and varying
form, above the blue water-ways which divide the tremulous masses of rainbow-tinted foliage.
The sinuous channels expand at intervals into quiet pools, bordered with azure and purple sea-stars,
or studded with clumps of yellow lilies, spotted and striped with carmine. A circle of rock,
enclosing a miniature lake, blazes with rose and scarlet anemones, and the boat, floating over
the wilderness of marine vegetation, pauses above a coral growth, varied in form as any tropical
woodland. Majestic trees, of amber and emerald hue, stand with roots muffled in fading fern,
or sunk in perforated carpets of white sponge, and huge vegetable growths or giant weeds, lustrous
with metallic tints of green and violet, fill clefts and ravines of coral rock. A grove of
sea-palms mimics the features of the upper world, as though Nature obeyed some mysterious law
of form, lying behind her operations, to regulate expression and bring order out of chaos.
Giant bunches of black and mauve grapes, like the pictured spoils of the Promised Land, lie
on soft beds of feathery moss, but the familiar greens of the velvety carpet shade into orange
and pink. A weird marine plant shoves long black stems, crowned with a circle of azure blue
eyes, which convey an uncanny sensation of being regarded with sleepless vigilance by mysterious
sentinels, transformed and spellbound in ocean depths. Tree-fern and hart's-tongue show verdant
fronds, flushed with autumnal red or gold, and a dense growth of starry flowers suggests a
bed of many-coloured tulips. Dazzling fish dart through the crystal depths. A shoal of scarlet
and green parrot-fish pursue a tribe striped with blue and orange. Gold-fish flash like meteors
between uplifted spears of blood-red coral, and the glittering scales of myriads, splashed
with ruby, or flecked with amethyst, reflect the colours of the gorgeously-frilled and rosetted
anemones in parterres between red coral crags. Tresses of filmy green floating from the mouth
of a cavern, suggest a mermaid's hair, and her visible presence would scarcely add to the wonders
in this under-world of glamour and mystery. Shells, pink and pearly, brown and lilac, scarlet
and cobalt, strew the flower-decked floor with infinite variety, concave and spiral, ribbed
and fluted, fretted and jagged--the satin smoothness of convoluted forms lying amid rugged
shapes bristling with spines and needles. We gaze almost with awe at the lovely vision of a
dainty Nautilus, sailing his fairy boat down a blue channel fringed with purple and salmon-coloured
anemones, beneath a hedge of rosy coral. The shimmering sail and carven hull of iridescent
pearl skim the water with incredible swiftness, and tack skilfully at every bend of the devious
course, not even slackening speed to avoid collision with a lumbering star-fish encountered
on the way. These submarine Gardens contain the greatest natural collection of anemones, coral
beds, shells, and fish, discovered in the ocean world. The richest treasures of Davy Jones's
Locker lie open to view, as the boat glides through the ever-changing scenery mirrored in the
transparent sea. Opalescent berries resemble heaps of pearls, and the lemon stalks of marine
sedge gleam like wedges of gold in the crystalline depths. The long oars detach pinnacles of
coral like tongues of flame, and a cargo of seaweed, shells, and anemones, fills the boat as
each enchanted grotto contributes a quota of treasure trove, but the vivid colouring fades
apace when the sea-born flora leaves the native element, and the deep blue eyes, gazing from
their dark stems with weird human effect, lose their radiance in the upper world.

We land at the pretty valley of Halong, where a rippling brook traverses a wood of sago-palms,
and falls in a white cascade over the rocks of a sheltered bathing-pool, screened by green
curtains of banana and tall mangosteens, laden with purple fruit. Makassar-trees rain their
yellow blossoms into the water, cloves fill the air with pungent fragrance, and lychees droop
over the clear current. A melancholy Malay song floats up from the sea, but the sad sweet notes
only accentuate the haunted silence of the fairy glen, with an echo from that distant past
which breathes undying music round these enchanted isles. Woodland shadows and wayside palms
disclose the sweeping horse-shoe curves of numerous Chinese tombs, the white stone elaborately
carved and covered with hieroglyphics. Plumy cocoanut and tremulous tamarind wave over the
last resting-places of these exiles from the Holy Land of the Celestial Empire, for the second
generation established on an alien soil is forbidden to seek burial in China. The so-called
Paranak of the Malay Archipelago frequently marries a native wife, and, as purity of race becomes
destroyed, ancestral obligations lose their power even over the mind of the most conservative
people in the world.

The woods of Ambon teem with the abundant bird-life peculiar to the Moluccas. An exquisite
kingfisher, with golden plumage and emerald throat, darts across the stream, and the scarlet
crests of green parrots resemble tropical flowers, glowing amidst the verdant foliage hardly
distinguishable from the fluttering wings of the feathered tribe, which includes twenty-two
species indigenous to the islands. The megapodius or mound-maker, an ash-coloured bird about
the size of a small fowl, grasps sand or soil in the hollow of a powerful claw, and throws
it backwards into mounds six feet high, wherein the eggs are deposited, to be hatched by this
natural incubator, through the heat of the vegetable matter contained in the rubbish heap.
The young birds work their way through the mound, and run off at once into the forest, where
they start on an independent career. They emerge from their birthplace covered with thick down
and provided with fully-developed wings. The maternal instinct of the megapodius ceases with
the laying of eggs, and, having supplied a safe cradle for the rising generation, she takes
no further thought for her precocious progeny, capable of securing a livelihood in the unknown
world from the moment of their first appearance in public.

A merry group, half-hidden in the shadows of clustering sago-palms, gathers the harvest of
precious grain, the pith of a large tree producing thirty bundles, each of thirty pounds weight.
The baking of the sago-cakes made from this lavish store occupies two women for five days,
and the housekeeping cares of the largest family only need quarterly consideration in this
island of plenty, where the struggle for the necessaries of existence is unknown and unimaginable.
Leisure and liberty, those priceless gifts which can only be attained where the pressure of
poverty is unfelt, serve valuable purposes in Ambonese hands, for the European energies fused
into the native race prevent mental stagnation, and spur tropical indolence to manifold activities.
A variety of thriving industries belong to this far-off colony. Mother-of-pearl shells, and
bêche-de-mer (the sea-slug of Chinese cuisine) supplement the important export of the cloves,
the speciality of Ambon, chosen by the East India Company as the sole place of cultivation
for this spice-bearing tree, when the system of monopoly extirpated the clove gardens of the
other islands. Vases, mats, and miniature boats, of fringed and threaded cloves, are offered
as fantastic souvenirs of Amboyna, and the spirit of the place seems imprisoned in these tiny
curios which revive so many haunting memories of the romantic island.

Nominal adherence to Dutch Calvinism fails to repress the natural instincts of a gay and pleasure-loving
race. The national dance known as Menari, and often performed on the shore in honour of the
outgoing steamer, no longer satisfies Ambonese requirements, with the slow gyrations and studied
postures of Oriental tradition. The eager and passionate temperament finds truer expression
in the walzes and galops of European origin, known as dansi-dansi, enthusiastically practised
on those festive occasions, when the full dress of funereal black and white seems specially
inappropriate to the wild abandon of the merry-making populace. In sunny Amboyna the cowl does
not make the friar, and the last recollection of the little Moluccan capital is a vision of
whirling figures and twanging lutes at the water's edge, while the receding steamer furrows
the milky azure of the land-locked bay. The vivid green of one palm-clad shore burns in the
gold of sunset, but the eastern side lies veiled in shadow, and as the sheltered inlet gives
place to the open sea, the luminous phosphorescence of the Southern ocean bathes the rocky
bastions of enchanted Ambon in waves of liquid fire. A strange history belongs to the physical
conformation of volcanic shores, alternately raised and depressed by the agitation of earth
and sea. The coast-line has varied from time to time; straits have become lakes, islands have
severed or united, occasionally rising suddenly from the waves, or vanishing in the bosom of
the deep. Geologists assert that the Malay Archipelago was originally thrown off by volcanic
action from Asia and Australia, and that an interchange of animal and vegetable life has frequently
taken place. Hurricanes have uprooted forest trees, and floods have borne them out to sea,
the tide eventually washing them up on the shores of distant islands. A fresh growth of foreign
vegetation was thus inaugurated, as these sylvan colonists struck their saplings into an alien
soil. Insects, preserved by the bark, propagated themselves in new surroundings, and seeds
drifting on the waves, or clinging to roots and fibres, wreathed unfamiliar shores with exotic
flowers. Animal migration has frequently been caused by natural catastrophes, and to birds
directing their swift flight by faculties now attributed to keen observation rather than to
unreasoning instinct, the change of locality was infinitely simplified. In the Moluccas we
may read a compendium of the wide-spread history which applies to the vast regions comprised
in the mighty Archipelago. The doctrine of earthly changes and chances, too often accepted
as a mere figure of speech, is here recognised as a stern reality; the tragedies of destruction
repeat themselves through the ages, the laboratories of Nature eternally forge fresh thunderbolts,
and the fate of humanity trembles in the balance. Meanwhile a profusion of flowers wreathes
the sacrificial altars, the fairest fruits ripen above the thin veil which hides the fountains
of volcanic fire, and the sweetest spices of the world breathe incense on the air. The uncertain
tenure of earthly joys gives them redoubled zest and poignancy, the passionate love of life
becomes intensified by the looming shadows of Death, and the light glows with clearer radiance
against the blackness of the menacing thunder-cloud.

BANDA.

The exquisite islands of Banda, dominated by the stately volcano of Goenoeng Api (the mountain
of fire), form the climax of the enchanting Moluccas. Contour and colour reach their utmost
grace and softest refinement in this ideal spot, a priceless jewel resting on the heart of
the Malay Archipelago.

The mists of dawn have scarcely lifted their gossamer veils from the dreaming sea, when the
pinnacled rocks of Rum and Aye, the outposts of the Banda group, pierce the swathing vapours.
The creamy cliffs of Swangi (the Ghost Island), traditionally haunted by the spirits of the
departed, show their spectral outlines on the northern horizon, and the sun-flushed "wings
of the morning" span the sapphire arch of heaven as we enter the sheltered gulf of the Zonnegat,
fringed by luxuriant woods clothing a mountain side, and brushing the water with a green fringe
of trailing branches. Gliding between Cape Lantaka and two isolated crags, the steamer enters
a glassy lake, encircled by sylvan heights, with the menacing cone of the Goenoeng Api rising
sheer from the water's edge. A white town climbs in irregular tiers up the shelving terraces
of a fairy island, the central hill crowned by the crenellated battlements of a grey citadel.
The largest ship can anchor close to shore, for the rugged boundaries of Banda descend by steep
gradients into the crystalline depths. Chinese and Arab campongs border European streets of
concrete houses, long and low, with flat roofs and external galleries.

The southern shore of Banda Neira faces the forest-clad heights of Great Banda, clothed from
base to summit with nutmeg trees, shadowed by huge kanaris, their interlacing canopies protecting
the precious spice plantations from the sun. A slender rowing boat, known as a belang, makes
a brilliant point of colour on the blue strait between the sister islands. Red and yellow flags
and pennants flutter above the green deck; the clash of gongs and cymbals echoes across the
water, and a weird chant accompanies the rhythmic plash of the short oars, as the brown rowers
toss them high in air, and bring them down with a sharp splash. A splendid avenue of kanari-trees
extends along the shore, the usual Dutch church symbolises the uncompromising grimness of Calvinistic
creed, and the crumbling fort of Orange-Nassau, the scene of many stirring incidents in the
island past, adjoins the beautiful thatched bungalow of the Resident, the broad eaves emerging
from depths of richest foliage. A subterranean passage connects the deserted stronghold on
the shore with Fort Belgica, the citadel now used as barracks, but formerly for the preservation
of the nutmegs from the fierce raids of foreign powers, when the new-born passion for spices
intoxicated the mind of the world, and kindled the fires of war between East and West. The
lofty peak of the Goenoeng Api still smoulders, although the main crater is supposed to be
extinct. The lower slopes, where not planted with vegetables by enterprising invaders from
the island of Boeton, abound with delicate ferns and rare orchids, for the fertility of the
volcanic soil, rich in metallic ingredients, creates a luxuriant growth. Sulphureous vapours
rise continually from a plateau beneath the summit, where tumbled boulders of blackened lava
lie sunken in deep layers of volcanic ash. Banda Neira evidently rose from the sea in some
long-past eruption of the larger island, now the long ridge of a ruined crater which collapsed
in a fierce outburst, and threw off the fragments of rock which compose the outer group. A
curious fatalism characterises the inhabitants of volcanic districts, and the incalculable
value of Banda in the middle ages outweighed all risks of eruption and earthquake. The history
of island colonisation by Portugal, Spain, and Holland, forms a continuous record of battle,
loot, and persecution, in which the native population was decimated, and even now the inhabitants
would be quite insufficient to cultivate and gather the "golden fruit," without the aid of
innumerable emigrants from Java. Hard measures were dealt out in order to maintain the monopoly
of spices, and the injury to the native races, by destroying the nutmeg trees of the other
islands, crippled the trade which had found a natural outlet in Asia. All the nutmegs were
sent to Europe, but one-fifth of the yearly produce was diverted by smuggling into forbidden
channels, though severe punishment was inflicted upon offenders. Economic administration was
unknown in the 17th and 18th centuries, but the holocaust of spices burnt in the market-place
of Amsterdam, and the extermination of the nutmeg trees in Moluccan islands, sent a thrill
of horror through the European world, which placed such an exaggerated value on the possession
of spices that the wars waged to secure them breathe the romantic fanaticism of a wild crusade.
Monopoly and slavery were at length definitely abolished, and in 1873 the Dutch Government,
realising the necessity of Free Trade, sanctioned the independence of the nutmeg planters.
The far-seeing views of Sir Stamford Raffles during the second brief English occupation of
the Moluccas, from 1810 to 1816, were disregarded in England (knowing little, and caring less,
about the remote Spice Islands), though his counsels were eventually adopted by the Dutch Government
as the only means of ensuring an increased profit. A high-prowed native boat, known as an orembai,
plies across the narrow strait which separates the islands of Banda Neira and Banda Lonthar,
or Great Banda. The long range of hills covered with a dense forest of the precious nutmeg
trees, attains an ideal of sylvan scenery surpassing even the glorious palm-woods of Java.
These may be described in terms of comparative accuracy, and their beauty painted in realistic
language, but none can translate into words the irresistible charm and glamour of the nutmeg
aisles, the exquisite foliage and contours of the spice-bearing trees, the wealth of delicate
blossom and peach-like fruit, and the flickering emerald light from hues shading through the
whole gamut of colour, from the tender verdure of spring to the glossy darkness of winter evergreen.
Colossal kanari-trees, veritable monarchs of the forest, tower over the nutmegs, and form an
unbroken roof of interlacing boughs, for the nutmeg, needing shelter to bring the fruit to
perfection, is not suffered to attain a height of more than seventy feet. The columnar trunks
of the majestic kanaris wreathe their huge girth with lace-like fern and broad-leaved epiphytal
plants, and the symmetrical beauty of the conical nutmeg-trees in these forest aisles suggests
a vast sanctuary of Nature, enshrining the mystic presence of Divinity. Here, as amid the shades
of unfallen Eden, we can imagine a trysting-place of God and man in the perennial "cool of
the day," which breathes through the green twilight of these solemn groves, redolent with the
incense from myriad sprays of creamy blossom and ripened nuts in shells of pink-flushed amber,
for flower and fruit deck the "gold-bearing tree" without intermission, and every day produces
a fresh harvest of nutmegs. The brown kernel of the opening fruit, contained in a network of
scarlet mace, falls to the ground in twenty-four hours, and unremitting care is needed in gathering
and handling the nutmegs with the gaai-gaai, a long stick ending with a prong, to break off
the ripe fruit into the woven basket accurately poised beneath the wooden fork. Only the female
trees yield the precious crop, and the highest point of production, attained at the twentieth
year, continues undiminished through four subsequent decades, after which the strength of the
average tree declines, although it often lives for a century. The cooing of the nutmeg pigeon,
which feeds on the abundant fruit, echoes through the shadowy glades with soothing monotony.
Yellow canaries flit through the vivid green of the pointed foliage, and the scarlet crests
of parrots glow through the dark canopies of the giant kanari-trees. The voices of children
at play, the distant songs of the nutmeg-gatherers, the plash of the waves on the coral reef,
and the scented breeze whispering in the green crowns of a million trees, blend in harmonious
concord to fill the sylvan temple of tropical Nature with mysterious music. At wide intervals
the white houses of the planters gleam amid the drooping boughs, the prevailing green of the
spacious woods relieved by the rosy purple of Bougainvillea mantling a pillared verandah, or
by great vases of crimson and yellow flowers, bordering broad flights of stone steps. Life
on a great nutmeg plantation retains patriarchal character and archaic charm; the multitude
of dependents calls forth, in the present day at any rate, much of kindly solicitude, and though
the unvarying sameness of existence sometimes proves the serpent which destroys the peace of
the idyllic Eden in young and eager hearts, the ramifications of the large family party, gathered
under one roof, mitigate the monotony of daily tasks, and supply the necessary mental friction.
Work in the nutmeg-woods begin at 5 a.m., when a pealing bell summons the labourers to each
plantation for their different duties of gathering the nuts, drying the mace, or sorting and
liming the fruit. The beautiful forest constitutes the world of the nutmeg-gatherer, both for
labour and recreation. In these dusky avenues youth and maiden tell each other Love's eternal
story, wandering away into the dreamland shadows, vocal with sweeter melody than that of bird
or breeze. The musical call of the nutmeg-pigeon serves as a danger-signal, uttered by sympathising
friends, when love must yield to life's stern realities in the person of the overseer. An ardent
courtship often contributes to the rapid filling of the nutmeg-basket in the hand of a rustic
beauty, whose admirers strive to secure for her the premium awarded for special diligence,
and a judicious official learns on occasion to be conveniently deaf to the feigned voice of
the manoek faloer. If the chivalrous zeal of the brown lover is apt to overleap frontiers,
and to fill the baskets of one plantation with the produce of the other, the ethics of Banda
demonstrate the identity of human nature when swayed by the passion which, according to circumstances,
wrecks Troy or raids a nutmeg orchard. A story is told of a planter who, in consequence of
engaging a bevy of attractive maidens for the year's work, was rewarded by a phenomenal harvest
of nutmegs, though the adjacent estates were barren of fruit. Evening shadows darken apace
in the woodland world, and work ceases at three in the afternoon, when the store of gathered
fruit is brought to the pagger, where drying and liming sheds surround the central warehouse.
The nutmeg-pickers sort the ripe nuts in an open gallery before taking them to the drying-shed,
where they are spread on a platform of split bamboo, twelve feet above a smouldering fire.
The process continues for six weeks, the nuts being repeatedly turned until they begin to rattle.
Only a slow method of drying prevents the escape of the essential oil, necessary to the flavour
of the fruit, which must afterwards be dipped in slaked lime to preserve it from insects. The
coral-like mace contains a rich supply of aromatic balm, and when loosened from the nutmeg
can be dried in the sun. The delicate scarlet branches, spread on wickerwork frames in open
spaces of the woods, contrast vividly with the shaded verdure of the beautiful trees. The mace,
trodden flat for facility in packing, resembles a dainty growth of finest seaweed, and in the
16th century shared popularity with the nutmeg which produced it. Even in the present day a
pewter spice box is an indispensable present on that sixth anniversary of a Dutch marriage
still known as "the pewter wedding," and a nutmeg-box, with a grater, remains as a favourite
bridal gift, the fashion originating when the passion for spices first pervaded mediæval Europe.
Trade, as well as Science, wrote many chapters of romantic adventure in the long history of
the world's social development, and modern thought but dimly realises the magnetic spell of
the days when the veil was first lifted between East and West, and the wonders of untrodden
shores disclosed to the pioneer. Heine, in his Lieder, chants of the mystic nutmeg-tree as
the ideal growth of the tropical forest, for every stage of life and growth reveals some fresh
beauty in delicate bloom, glistening foliage, and fruit of roseate gold. The spreading boughs,
with their perfect contour and emerald depths of light and shadow, suggest a typical picture
of that unfading Tree of Life in the midst of the earthly Paradise, round which the passing
ages weave innumerable dreams, while faith transplants it to a fairer Garden than that of Eden.
Where the winding woodland roads lead along the shore, colossal screw-palms and silver-flowered
Barringtonias border the rocks, the sparkling azure of the sea visible through the fantastic
boughs, and the eternal song of the surf vibrating through the still air with mysterious undertones.
The brown campong of Banda Lonthar stands at the foot of the mossy steps which lead to the
summit of the wooded range, and command a superb view of the island group. A further flight
of stairs descends to the outside coast or Achterval, but wherever we go, to quote the words
of a modern traveller, "we may imagine ourselves transported to the holy groves whereof ancient
poets sing." From the rich carpet of velvety moss and plumy fern to the green vault of the
leafy roof, the eye for once seems "satisfied with seeing," for no hint of imperfection breaks
the fairy spell of enchantment in this poetic nutmeg-forest. Among serpentine kanari roots,
which stream across the mossy turf as though poured out in liquid form and then petrified,
we come across brown babies sleeping in the shade, and cradled softly in the tender lap of
earth, while the mother, crooning a low song, pursues her work among the rustling leaves. Terrace
after terrace, the green aisles mount to the summit of the great ridge, and the ruined forts
on each wooded promontory recall the long-past days when the "fruit of gold" demanded the increasing
vigilance of military power to defeat the onslaught of merchantman or privateer, willing to
run every risk in order to capture a cargo of spices, and secure fabulous gains by appeasing
the frantic thirst of Europe for the novel luxury of the aromatic spoils. The mediæval craze
has died away, and the pungent spices of the Orient have taken a permanent position of reasonable
proportion in the culinary art of modern times, but the glamour of the past, like the amber
haze of a tropical sunset, still environs the poetic tree in the island home where, amid evergreen
foliage and waxen flowers, the famous "fruit of gold" still opens each coral-lined censer to
exhale a wealth of undying fragrance on the balmy air.

THE SOELA-BESSIR ISLES.

Outside the fairy circle of the exquisite Moluccas, a tiny cluster of palm-clad islets gems
the wide blue spaces of the lonely sea, unbroken for many leagues by any foothold possible
for human habitation. The Dutch steamer only calls thrice a year at the remote Soela-Bessir
group, in quest of rattan, a plentiful product of these fertile isles, where the leafy ladders
of the aspiring parasite climb to the green crowns of the tallest palms, wrapping them in the
fatal embrace which eventually levels the strongest monarch of the tropical forest to the earth.
The thick mantle of glossy foliage often hides the multitude of hooks, loops, and nooses which
the pliant cane flings round branch and stem, gripped by long ropes of flexible fibre, hardening
into thick coils, rigid and unyielding as iron. The immense export of rattan for chairs, couches,
and innumerable domestic purposes, indirectly results in the preservation of myriad palm-trees,
by releasing them from the deadly grasp of the tenacious creepers. The waving cocoanut trees
of Senana, the principal island of the Soela-Bessir group, kiss the blue water with sombre
plumes, bowed down by the wealth of heavy fruit lying in green and golden clusters between
frond and stem. The steamer anchors far from the shore, and the launch proving unable to cross
the shallow bay, the landing of passengers can only be accomplished by two crossed oars, carried
and steadied by four of the crew. The mode of progression is wobbling and risky, but the improbability
of revisiting Senana supplied a mental argument of unfailing force in balancing pros and cons.
The secluded island, so slightly influenced by the outside world, changes but little with the
lapse of time, and the triple-tiered roofs of numerous thatched Messighits rising above the
palm-leaf huts of the brown campong, assert the hereditary creed. The green banner of Islam
was planted here centuries ago by a fanatical horde of Arab pirates, who added religious enthusiasm
to love of plunder and thirst of conquest. Their fiery zeal, though not according to knowledge,
ensured a vigorous growth of the foreign offshoot from the questionable faith of these Arab
corsairs, who left indelible traces on the whole of the Malay Archipelago. The Messighits of
Senana are now only the ruined shrines of a decadent creed, but the simple islanders remain
nominal adherents to the Monotheism of the past. Canoes and blotos, rowed by lithe brown figures,
come out to welcome the steamer, and a fantastic boat, with carven prow, darts from beneath
a green bower of tangled foliage, laden with golden bananas. Merry-faced little savages line
the shore, eagerly awaiting the arrival of the white strangers, who supply them with the amusement
afforded by a travelling circus to the more sophisticated children of the West. An eager desire
to please and gratify the extraordinary visitors, mingles with the uncontrollable delight,
manifested in capering, dancing, and gay laughter, as they beckon us to follow them through
the narrow lanes of the long campong. Naked brown forms dash into their native huts at sundry
points of the route, to summon friends and kinsfolk, until the procession swells into formidable
proportions, for the whole campong is eventually in tow, with the exception of the men and
boys occupied in lading cargo. Through the dappled sunlight and shadows of the sweeping palms
which flank the glassy bay, we are personally conducted to the principal Messighit, a bare,
whitewashed building, without any decoration beyond the blue and white tiles outlining the
horse-shoe arch of the Mihrab looking towards Mecca. The exterior with three roofs of mossy
thatch supported on bamboo poles, offers a shelter from the sun on a flight of crumbling steps,
overshadowed by the spreading eaves. A big cocoanut frond serves as an improvised broom in
a dusky hand, and the central step is carefully swept before the stranger, with respectful
salaams and gesticulations, is invited to sit down. A turbaned Imaum, the custodian of the
decaying sanctuary, comes forth from his dilapidated hut among the palms behind the shrine,
at the unwonted excitement breaking the silence and solitude of the ancient mosque, but he
evidently belongs to the dreamland of the past, and retires quickly from the disturbing present
to meditations or slumbers in his obscure dwelling, closing the bamboo door against all intruders.
This day's incident of the cruise in the Malay Archipelago seems absolutely cut off from ordinary
experience--a solitary Englishwoman, resting in the shadow of the rustic mosque, and surrounded
by a half-barbaric tribe of unfamiliar aspect, the dark woolly hair, flat noses, wide mouths,
and dazzling teeth suggesting a liberal admixture of negro or Papuan blood. Native intelligence
simplifies a halting conversation, carried on by means of the indispensable Malayan phrase-book.
Wistful eyes rest on the stranger whose lot is cast under happier auspices, and unmistakeable
characteristics manifest the Soela-Bessir islanders as a gentle and teachable race. Alas! the
Dutch Government plants neither schools nor missions in distant Senana, too far from the beaten
track to commend itself to the religious or educational care of a nation apparently indifferent
to the claims of small communities, in the vast Archipelago subject to Holland. Only the quarterly
call of the Dutch steamer stirs the stagnation of ages on the Soela-Bessir isles, but although
the young, sharing in that wondrous heritage of mirth and gladness peculiar to the joyous early
life of the tropics, recognise no limitations in their lot, the mothers sadly repeat the complaint
heard elsewhere that no chance of improvement is given to them. The steamer, frequently bringing
hither the inhabitants of more favoured islands in the interests of trade, already begins to
stir feelings of unrest, and vague longings for the better things as yet withheld. A chieftain's
daughter joins the throng round the old messighit. A red-cotton drapery, thrown over bronze
limbs, is her only garment, but a diamond glistening on her dark hand looks incongruous with
the scanty clothing. The gem seems a talisman or heirloom, but a request to examine it terrifies
the owner, and she rushes away into the woods to safeguard the precious possession from perils
suggested by the presence of the white pilgrim from across the seas. The delicious breeze which
always spring up after ten o'clock in these latitudes renders walking a delight, the two following
hours being invariably cooler than the trying time between eight and ten, when the fierce sun,
on a level with the face, creates an atmosphere of blistering glare. The brown procession forms
an orderly escort to the lading shed beneath a clump of tall cocoa-palms, and the kindly merchant
who negotiates the commerce of the Soela-Bessir isles for the Dutch Government, sends a native
boy up the smooth stem of a colossal tree in search of a fresh cocoanut, which fills two tumblers
with refreshing sap. The thatched campong stands against a background of green hills and dense
woods, rich in tropical verdure, but lacking the loveliness of the Moluccas. The return to
the ship involves a bloto across the bay, with many misgivings as to the seaworthy capacities
of the clumsy craft, but four bamboo safety-poles, fastened by forked sticks to the sides of
the hollowed log, suffice to steady it enough to avoid capsizal. In the Soela-Bessir Isles,
as in many other far-off and forgotten regions, the genius of commerce begins to awaken the
desire of civilisation in untutored hearts, for Trade sharing in the romance no longer regarded
as the exclusive attribute of Art or Science, now helps to fuse opposing elements into unity
and order. The simple inhabitants of distant Senana seem only waiting for an outstretched hand
to lift them to a higher level of creed and culture, for the modern pioneers of missionary
enterprise raise the superstructure of Christianity with unexampled success on the substratum
of truth contained even in imperfect and erroneous creeds. That solid foundation stone of belief
in the One Eternal God, laid by Arab pirates centuries ago, amid the lust of rapine and the
smoke of war, which ever heralded the onward march of conquering Islam, should serve as a firm
basis for building up these simple children of Nature into the mystical sanctuary of the Christian
Church. The lapse of time obliterates countless landmarks of Moslem creed in localities removed
from external contact, but amid the dust of disintegrating forces and forgotten forms, the
central Truth remains imbedded, like a wedge of gold trodden in the mire, but retaining intrinsic
value and untarnishable purity.

SUMATRA.

THE WESTERN COAST AND THE HIGHLANDS.

Passing through the straits of Saleir, between a cliff-bound island and the south-eastern Cape
of Celebes, the returning steamer in due time reaches her moorings in Sourabaya, and a rapid
railway journey through Java connects with the outgoing boat from Batavia to Padang, a three
days' voyage through a chain of green islands breaking the force of the monsoon on a desolate
and harbourless shore. The forest-clad ranges of Sumatra draw nearer at Benkoelen, buried in
cocoa-palms on the rim of a quiet bay, within a terrific reef which makes landing impossible
in stormy weather. Fort and Residency, villas and gardens, manifest Benkoelen as an oasis of
civilisation, the steeply-tiled roofs remaining as relics of the English occupation a century
ago. Beyond the little military settlement, the Sumatran mountains tower in majestic gloom
beyond a broken line of bristling crags, like granite outworks guarding the eleven hundred
miles of coast-line facing the Indian Ocean. The author supplicated the critic to attend the first appearance
of his play. Janin would not promise to go, but put him off indefinitely, and presently the
poor man went away. He tingled all over with indignation at the treatment the man received, but
Janin looked over to his wife, saying, 'Well, my dear, I treated this one pretty well, didn't I?'

"'Better
than sometimes, Jules,' she answered."

Altogether it was a strange scene to the young American observer.

"July, 1867.--Passed the day at Nahant. As Longfellow sat on the piazza wrapped in his blue cloth cloak,
he struck me for the first time as wearing a venerable aspect. Before dinner he gathered wild
roses to adorn the table, and even gave a careful touch himself to the arrangement of the wines
and fruits. He was in excellent spirits, full of wit and lively talk. Speaking of the use
and misuse of words, he quoted Chateaubriand's mistake (afterwards corrected) in his translation
of 'Paradise Lost,' when he rendered

"'Siloa's brook that flowed Fast by the oracle of God,'

as

"'Le ruisseau de Siloa qui coulait rapidement.'"

In talking about natural differences in character and temperament, he said of his own children that
he agreed with one of the old English divines who said, "Happy is that household wherein Martha
still reproves Mary!"

In February, 1868, it was decided that Longfellow should go to Europe
with his family. He said that the first time he went abroad it was
to see places alone and not persons; the second time he saw a few
persons, and so pleasantly combined the two; he thought once that
on a third visit he should prefer to see persons only; but all that
was changed now. He had returned to the feeling of his youth. He was
eager to seek out quiet places and wayside nooks, where he might rest
in retirement and enjoy the consecrated memorials of Europe undisturbed.

The
following year found him again in Cambridge, refreshed by his absence.
The diary continues: "He has been trying to further the idea of buying
some of the lowlands in Cambridge for the colleges. If this can be
done, it will save much future annoyance to the inhabitants from wretched
hovels and bad odors, beside holding the land for a beautiful possession
forever.

Little campongs of palm-thatched huts stand on piles at the water's edge, and skirt the over-shadowing
forest; fairy islands, encircled with red-stemmed arén-palms, lie like green garlands on the
indigo sea, dotted with the yellow sails of native proas, and the little train which conveys
us to Padang, the western capital, seems an incongruous feature in a scene suggestive of primeval
peace and solitude. A sylvan charm belongs even to this Sumatran township, for the wooden houses,
with pointed roofs of dried palm-leaves, and broad eaves forming shady verandahs, stand far
apart in flowery gardens, aflame with orange or scarlet cannas, and fragrant with golden-hearted
frangipanni. The sweeping boughs of giant cocoanut trees make a green twilight beneath their
interwoven fronds, Bougainvillea drapes crumbling wall and forest tree with curtains of roseate
purple, and thatched stalls of tropical fruits and glowing flowers brighten the dusky avenues
with patches of vivid colour. The determined aspect of the Sumatran people denotes the superior
calibre of the ancestral stock which colonised the Archipelago, for foreign intercourse, which
elsewhere modified national character, scarcely affected the Sumatran Malays, independent of
the servile yoke imposed by the mighty princes of Java. The forty Soekoes, or clans, of Sumatra,
are sub-divided into branches consisting of numerous families, all descended from a common
stock in the female line. This curiously constituted pedigree is known as the Matriarchate,
an ancient social system only retained in Western Sumatra, and among certain South American
tribes. The resolute mien and dignified carriage of the Sumatran woman denote clear consciousness
of her supreme importance. The cringing submission so painfully characteristic of Oriental
womanhood is wholly unknown, and though nominally of Mohammedan faith, the humble position
prescribed by the Korán to the female sex is a forgotten article of Sumatra's hereditary creed.
After marriage (forbidden between members of the same clan) both man and woman remain in their
own family circle. The husband is only an occasional visitor, and the wife is regarded as the
head of the house. Her children remain under her exclusive care, and inherit her property,
together with the half of what their father and mother earn together. The other half goes to
the brothers and sisters of the husband, whose titles descend to his own brothers and sisters.
Sumatra is veritably El Dorado to the Eastern wife and mother, conversant with every detail
respecting the management of land or money, and jealously guarding the time-honoured rights
and privileges of her exalted position.

The hereditary chieftains of Sumatran clans exercise a patriarchal rule of uncompromising severity,
and combine in every district to form the Laras or local Council, the distance separating forest
and mountain campongs often necessitating sub-division into a village assembly. The Laras,
and those rural chieftains nominated by popular consent, possess a seat on the Supreme Council
of the Dutch Government, thus forming the transitional element between Asiatic and European
rule. There is no Sumatran nobility, and although the hereditary chief of a clan is invested
with official authority, the stringent regulations of the Matriarchate acknowledge no superiority
of social status as an appanage of his power.

The hothouse atmosphere of Padang is gladly exchanged for the freshness of the mountain heights,
approached by a cog-wheel railway, and affording truer pictures of Sumatran life than the hybrid
port of the steaming Lowlands. The luxuriant verdure of the swampy plain basks in the sunshine
of a blazing March day, and children in gaudy sarongs drive a brisk trade at palm-thatched
wayside stations, with bamboo trays of sliced pineapple sprinkled with capsicum, the approved
"pick-me-up" of Sumatra. The little train burrows through a forest-lined pass, and skirts the
chafing waters of the Anei river, foaming over swarthy boulders. The turbulent stream, now
deeply sunk between granite cliffs, rises with terrific violence when lashed by the wild mountain
wind known as the bandjir, and rushes up the rocky walls, overthrowing bridges, and dragging
along immense crags with resistless impetus. The shrill laughter of the black bush-apes echoes
from sombre masses of matted foliage, as the train ascends the lofty range, and curves round
the basin of a sparkling waterfall, dashing from a fern-draped height. Granite cliffs soar
above tropical jungle and solemn forest; the narrow gap of the Anei widens into a luxuriant
valley; sago-palms rustle in the breeze, and tree-ferns spread their green canopies over the
brawling river. The splendid scenery is viewed to advantage from a platform of the foremost
railway carriage, the train being pushed up the mountains by an engine in the rear. Beyond
the climbing forests, a bare plateau affords a glimpse of ever-burning Merapi, with wooded
flanks and lava-strewn summit, from whence a grey cloud of smoke mounts in a spiral curl to
the azure sky. Beyond this point of view lies the green plain of beautiful Fort de Kock, the
gem of the Sumatran Highlands, to be numbered henceforth among those ideal scenes which remain
permanently photographed on mind and memory. The crystalline atmosphere seems the very breath
of life after a long sojourn in the steaming tropics, and Fort de Kock, under the shadow of
mysterious Merapi, an Elysium of health and repose. The little Hotel Jansen offers clean and
comfortable accommodation, the kindly German hostess proving a model landlady. As a Residency
and the headquarters of a Dutch garrison. Fort de Kock provides all the necessaries of life,
and the broad military roads of the vicinity simplify exploration. The little white settlement
beneath the wooded volcano possesses a bright and cheery character, in keeping with the exhilarating
climate, and the beautiful Sturm Park, from palm-crowned hill and flowery terrace, commands
an exquisite prospect of the blue peaks belonging to the borderland of those Native States
extending to the Dutch possessions on the Eastern coast. The curious houses of the Sumatran
Highlands, with their adjacent rice-barns, form distinctive features of this unique island.
The ridge of the steep thatch rises in sharp horns, interlaced with black fibres of arén palm,
or covered with glittering tin. These tapering points are considered talismans of good fortune,
a fresh horn being added on every occasion of marriage, for the married daughters, under the
provisions of the Matriarchate, remain in the home of their childhood, and portions of the
central division belonging to the house are reserved for their use. Manifold horns frequently
bristle above the lofty roof, and the front of the main building is the common living room
for unmarried members of the large household. Houses and rice-barns stand on high poles, after
the Malay fashion, which originated in the malarious districts of the Lowlands. The typical
rice-barns are lavishly decorated with gilding, carving, and colour, inlaid with glass mosaic,
and edged with balls of red and blue crystal, the upward sweep of the slender horns sharply
silhouetted against the glowing cobalt of heaven. In every kota (the Sumatran word signifying
a fortified place, or village), the beauty of the picturesque roofs culminates in Messighit
and Balei, respectively the Mosque and Hall of Consultation for the Village Council. The roofs
of the Mosque rise on thatched tiers, mounted on slender pine-stems, and the long Balei, with
mossy thatch prolonged into an open verandah on either side, shows a multitude of curving horns
pointing to Heaven, and symbolically invoking celestial aid for the solemn assembly gathered
beneath them, when the full moon floods upland Sumatra with molten silver. Primitive hospitality
provides a roemah negari, or "House of Strangers," in every village rich enough to erect this
refuge for the toil-worn wanderer, but where no special resting-place for pilgrims can be offered,
lodging can always be had in the open Balei, on application to any member of the Village Council.
The primitive simplicity of Sumatran life remains practically unchanged in these remote hamlets
of the Western Highlands, and though Fort de Kock poses as the nucleus of modern progress,
European influences glance off the indurated surface of native character like water poured
over a granite slab.

Across the rice-plain of Agam, dotted with brown kotas, crowned by myriads of interweaving
horns, we reach the scattered village of Paja-Kombo, shadowed by dense woods of cocoanut palms,
and famed for one of the most picturesque native markets in the East. The women of Paja-Kombo
are noted for their beauty, enhanced by the splendour of many-coloured sarongs, gleaming with
gold and silver thread. Gay turbans swathe the stately heads, and the golden filagree of barbaric
breastplates, heavy earrings, and broad armlets, lights up the shadowy gloom of stone galleries
and al fresco stalls, beneath the drooping boughs of ancient waringen-trees. The Sumatran Malays
are energetic traders, and the dignified personality of the Sumatran woman is perpetually in
evidence. Keen, thrifty, economical, and thoroughly versed in all the details of commerce,
she shows herself the predominant partner in domestic life, and to her all decisions on financial
matters are referred, in accordance with the laws of the Matriarchate, which protects her independence. It
isn't there--you're making it up!

[She snatches the card, reads it, and tears it up.

Dolph. Temper--temper! Never mind. Now we'll try FREDDY. What's his shade of 'air? I should say
about the colour of spoilt 'ay, if I was asked.

Carrie (with temper). You're not asked, so you needn't give your opinion!

Dolph. Well, keep your 'air on, my dear girl, and we'll call FREDDY's "Fair." (Reading card.)
"A gentleman with this colour of hair will be assiduous in his occupation--"

Carrie (warmly). What a shame! I'm sure he isn't. Are you, FREDDY? [FREDDY smiles vaguely.

Dolph. "Not given to rambling,"--Except in his 'ed,--"very moderate in his amorous wishes, his mind much
given to reflection, inclined to be 'asty-tempered, and, when aroused,"--'Ere,
somebody, rouse FREDDY, quick!--"to use adjectives." Mustn't use 'em
'ere, FREDDY! "But if reasonably dealt with, is soon appeased." Pat
his 'ed, CARRIE, will yer? "Has plenty of bantering humour." (Here
FREDDY grins feebly.) Don't he look it too! "Should study his diet."
That means his grub, and he works 'ard enough at that! "He has a combination
of good commercial talents, which, if directed according to the reflection
of the sentiments, will make him tolerably well off in this world's
goods."

Carrie (puzzled). What's it torking about now?

Dolph. Oh,
it on'y means he's likely to do well in the cat's-meat line. Now for
your fortune, FREDDY. "It will be through marriage that your future
will be brightened."

Carrie (pleased). A wild river swirls through the deep ravine, opening towards the ethereal
blue of clustering peaks, which lie fold upon fold in the hazy distance of the Native States,
and disclose a mystic pathway into dreamland.

Another deep gully of yellow tufa-rock behind Fort de Kock, forms the first stage of the romantic
route to Lake Manindjoe. Crossing the twin rivers which have carved their winding gorge in
the bosom of the hills, the rude track through the mountains ascends to smooth plateaux forming
a flight of gigantic stairs, supported by rocky girders like natural cross-beams. In early
days of Dutch colonisation these successive points of vantage, occupied by hostile tribes,
were stormed in vain by the invading army, and eventually only captured by surprise. The beauty
of upland Sumatra culminates at this mountain lake, lying within the foundered crater of the
Danau. The volcanic walls rise fourteen hundred feet above the dark blue mere, a glitting sheet
of lapis lazuli set within the black cleft of the profound chasm. Brown and purple rocks enamelled
with orange lichen, and garlanded with waving verdure, open to display a mysterious vision
of the glistening sea, with one white sail like a butterfly's wing, crossing the distant waves.
The flushing rose-tints of a tropical sunset glorify the landscape into transcendent beauty;
the rude sculpture of the river crags, the black shadows of primeval forest, and the far-off
gleam of the Indian Ocean, composing an ideal picture, enhanced by vague impressions of Infinity
and Eternity.

The great Lake of Sinkarah, flanked by volcanic ridges, and by the dense foliage of palm forests
and coffee plantations, also presents a succession of entrancing landscapes. White and purple
orchids wreathe the forest trees, troops of red monkeys chatter among the boughs, and woodland
vistas reveal leagues of emerald rice and golden millet. Beyond Sinkarah lies the famous coal
district of the island, where Chinamen, convicts, and Hindu coolies, in perpetual bustle and
commotion, manifest an activity unique in the thinly-populated interior of Sumatra, dependent
on the labour of alien races. Javanese act as woodmen, gardeners, and road-makers; the Klings
serve as cowherds and drivers of ox-waggons; the Bengalese prove efficient policemen, and the
Boyans skilful carpenters; the clearing of the forest pertaining to Malays and Batteks, also
responsible for the building of the marvellous rice-barns, the apotheosis of Sumatran architecture.
The ordinary tourist omits Sumatra from his itinerary. Occasional elephant-hunters penetrate
the dense forests of the interior, and engineers or tobacco-planters flock to the monotonous
levels of the eastern coast, but the glorious Western Highlands, the Sumatran Bovenland, is
seldom visited. Warlike Acheen, for ever at feud with the Dutch Government, is forbidden ground
to the European traveller. The unconquerable independence of the Achinese, fiercely resenting
the sovereignty of Holland, proves an insoluble problem to the Dutch methods of subjugation.
The bold and lawless character of this rebellious clan defies military discipline. The spirit
of insurrection animates every man, woman, and child of the brave but treacherous race, and
Acheen remains the dark centre of countless tragedies, due to the spurious patriotism which
counts a stab in the dark, a poisoned arrow, or a cruel betrayal, as heroic and laudable modes
of resistance to the hated invader of Sumatra's ancient liberties. The forest-clad interior
of the vast island remains an unknown wilderness. Cannibals still lurk in the black depths
of the pathless jungle; weird tribal customs linger unchanged in barbarous campongs, where
strange gods are worshipped with the immemorial rites of an ageless past, rude carvings and
weird symbols showing the personification of those natural phenomena deified by primeval tribes.
Sumatra, with her wealth of mines and forests and her important geographical position, remains
as yet an almost undiscovered country, and though her undeveloped resources excite the cupidity
and arouse the envy of European nations, political greed and private enterprise have proved
powerless to open up the hidden treasures of the vast island, apparently intended by Nature
to become the key of the Southern Seas.

A VIEW OF KRAKATAU.

Emma-Haven, the little port of Padang, twenty minutes by train from the palm-girt Sumatran
capital, scarcely mars the beauty of the secluded inlet with the red and white warehouses standing
against the sylvan verdure which fringes the blue arc of the deep bay. Cloud upon cloud, the
spectral vision of distant mountains gleams through the vanishing veil of mist melting in the
sunrise, and the departing steamer, hugging the shore, but halting for cargo at sundry barbaric
campongs, affords numerous glimpses of native life. Passengers are forbidden to land at these
rural ports of call, for a herd of twenty frolicsome elephants battered down one brown village
of palm-thatched bamboo only a week ago, and although the ruined architecture possesses the
advantage of being as easily restored as destroyed, the unpleasant proximity of the dark jungle
suggests the need of prudence. At another point of the little voyage, we anchor for a cargo
of rattan before a thatched shed on a shell-strewn beach, but even here a solitary elephant,
disturbed in bathing, has lately attacked a woman, rescued with difficulty from formidable
tusks and lashing trunk. A tribe of coolies come on board from the pepper plantation on a terraced
hill, covered with the vivid green of the festooning creeper, twined round long poles, and
resembling hop-vines in growth and foliage. The landing of this contingent involves a call
at Anjer, the northern extremity of Java, distinguished by the white column of the colossal
Pharos on the green headland. A halt at nightfall outside a bristling reef, in consequence
of a Malay lighthouse-keeper omitting to trim his lamp, after the fashion of his unthinking
kind, secures the compensation of steaming within sight of world-famous Krakatau, the volcanic
cone, which in 1883 was split in half by the stupendous eruption affecting in various degrees
the whole of the world. The successive waves of atmospherical disturbance, travelling with
the velocity of sound, were traced three times completely round the globe. Krakatau, though
uninhabited, was the occasional resort of fishermen who plied their calling in the Sunda Straits.
A Dutch record exists of a violent eruption in 1680, but the Krakatau volcano was afterwards
considered extinct, and until the spring of 1883 no signs of activity occurred. At this date,
smoke, pumice, and cinders, fell without intermission. For eight weeks Krakatau blazed and
thundered, the explosions being audible at Batavia, eighty miles off. As the fatal dawn of
an August morning broke with lurid light, the culminating shock of an appalling detonation,
described as "the very crack and crash of doom," echoed across the ocean, and was heard even
in India and Australia, two thousand miles away. Gigantic tidal waves swept the Sundanese shores,
destroying the adjacent villages, 36,000 people being either washed away or buried under the
boiling rain of mud, fire, and ashes. The Royal Society estimated the altitude of the vast
black and crimson column of flame and smoke, mounting from the volcano, at seventeen miles.
The ashes fell at Singapore and on the Cocos Isles, respectively five and eight hundred miles
away, the ejection of volcanic matter being computed at more than four cubic miles in extent.
Krakatau, reduced from thirteen to six square miles, from the northern portion of the symmetrical
pyramid being completely blown away by the volcanic fires, retains the conical peak of Mount
Radaka, nearly three thousand feet high. Some of the contiguous islands sank beneath the waves,
others changed their shape, and the formation of various banks and shoals added fresh difficulties
to the intricate navigation of reef-bound seas. Thrilling stories are told of the enveloping
pall of smoke and ashes, which shrouded Java in midnight gloom, amid the continuous roar of
violent explosions which led up to the awful climax of the final catastrophe. Red-hot stones
and burning cinders fired the ships, the weight of pumice sinking praus and fishing smacks
as it fell into the hissing sea, and a 600-ton schooner, thrown by the force of the world-shaking
concussion into a mountain cleft of the opposite coast, still lies wedged between the black
walls of rock. The floating pumice, which filled the harbour of Batavia with layers so deep
that planks resting upon it made a safe bridge over a mile in length, drifted even to Zanzibar
and Madagascar. The fine dust, expelled into the upper air, painted the sunset heavens with
these translucent green and violet tints which enhanced the pageantry of cloudland throughout
the world for many months after the fiery forces had expended themselves. Smoke still issues
from Krakatau, though the vast rent in the cloven pyramid must materially diminish the power
of any future eruption, and Nature's busy hand already covers the torn side of the precipitous
cone with a green veil of sparse vegetation. A curious marine growth of weed and moss rooted
itself on Krakatau three years after the phenomenal eruption, from seeds floating on the tide
or carried by the wind. The thin soil formed by these decaying plants, and enriched by the
chemical ingredients of disintegrating volcanic ash, in time produced a more luxuriant verdure,
and in the interval elapsing since the threefold ravages of fire, flood, and earthquake, caused
by Krakatau, convulsed the East with terror, the dread mountain has become wreathed with flower
and fruit, for orchards and gardens, tended by the Malays from the surrounding islands, now
flourish at the foot of the quiescent peak. Javanese colonists, who experienced the terrors
of the overwhelming catastrophe, assert that no similes drawn from the most appalling thunderstorm,
or from the roar of the heaviest artillery, could convey an adequate idea of the stupendous
detonation which seemed to shatter earth and sky, as the pent-up fires burst forth in the final
explosion, which tore the mountain asunder and poured forth the devastating forces of the abysmal
depths over land and sea. Crimson lava-flood and burning hail, blackened heaven and rocking
earth, roaring sea and clamouring volcano, represented an Apocalyptic vision of Divine wrath,
but probably no survivor remained to record the actual sight of the unprecedented phenomenon,
transcending every terrestrial convulsion recorded in the chronicles of scientists. Only a
slender feather of grey steam now issues from the lofty crater. Leaves and grasses flutter
in the soft breeze, and a shower of white petals drifts upon the iron boulders, once incandescent
amid the red torrents of rushing fire. A sheer precipice remained as the severed half of the
shattered cone, when the rent cliffs shivered into fragments, and toppled over into the sea.
Nature again breathes "peace and safety," as she did before "the sudden destruction" gave the
lie to her mocking voice, and as the ruined pyramid of terrible Krakatau sinks below the horizon,
and the good ship speeds on her way, a weight of awe seems lifted from the mind, oppressed
by imagination and association with the ghastly tragedy of those untameable forces which defy
calculation or comprehension.

History has often proved the truth of the assertion that Time turns memories into dreams, but
in the presence of Krakatau's smoking crater, the memories looming over the haunted volcano
translate themselves into a nightmare of horror, for the shadows of doom still cling to the
monumental pyramid, a menacing witness to the existence of those occult laws which baffle human
investigation with their insoluble problems, and compel the defeated scientist to acknowledge
himself a mere chronicler of inexplicable mysteries. The extent of the volcanic zone encircling
the Malay Archipelago minimises the risk of catastrophe by numerous safety valves for the imprisoned
forces of Earth's fiery abyss. In isolated Krakatau only one outlet existed for the vast accumulations
of destructive agencies, gathering irresistible impetus through the protracted period of condensation
and suppression which heated this mighty furnace of Nature's subterranean laboratory with sevenfold
power. A generation has grown up since the hell of devouring fire swept across land and sea
from this solitary mountain peak; villages have been rebuilt on their ancient sites, and the
activities of life go on from year to year undisturbed. The story of Krakatau, told under the
drooping boughs of dusky waringen-trees in the evening hour of leisure, seems veiled in the
mists of legendary lore to youth and maiden, listening to the oft-told tale. Poverty clings
to familiar soil, and in the deep groove of a narrow existence the popular mind takes little
thought for the future. The realities of life are bounded by the daily needs, and the shadow
of Krakatau fails to destroy the present peace of the simple folk, who, like children gathering
flowers on the edge of a precipice, heed none of the grim possibilities of a perilous environment.

PENANG.

Poelo-Penang, The Isle of the areca-nut, separated by a narrow strait from the Malay Peninsula,
was ceded to England in 1785 by the Rajah of Kedah, from whom the present Sultan of Johore
is lineally descended. The little territory, chiefly consisting of a mountain covered with
palm-forests, was then almost uninhabited, but the strategetic importance of the position resulted
in the establishment of an English Presidency, until the phenomenal growth of Singapore made
it the eventual centre of local authority. "Sinhapura," "the City of Lions" (or, more accurately,
of tigers), founded by the Hinduized Malays, and developed by Sir Stamford Raffles into the
principal trading port of the Eastern seas, of necessity drew off from Penang a large contingent
of the polyglot races which flocked thither from all parts, when the British flag first waved
above the newly-built fort, but at least 100,000 inhabitants still occupy the verdant island,
where the graceful areca palm attains unexampled perfection. Penang was merely regarded as
an unimportant appendage of ancient Malacca, captured in 1311 by Albuquerque, and though the
territory of the principal Sultan underwent innumerable vicissitudes through the changing fortunes
of war, the royal line retained Johore at the foot of the Peninsula, up to the present day,
the last scion of the old-world dynasty now accepting the suzerainty of England.

A tribe of Klings (the Malay corruption of the word Telinga), sailing from the Coromandel coast,
were the first immigrants under British rule. It is the two W's, Work and Weather, that are
playing the mischief with us.... You must not open a book; you must not even look at an inkstand.
These are both contraband articles, upon which we have to pay heavy duties. We cannot smuggle them
in. Nature's custom-house officers are too much on the alert."

In 1880 he again wrote, describing the wedding of the daughter of an old friend:--

"A beautiful wedding it was; an ideal village wedding, in a pretty church, and the Windmill Cottage
of our friend resplendent with autumnal flowers. In one of the rooms
there was a tea-kettle hanging on a crane in the fireplace.

"So begins
a new household. But Miss Neilson's death has saddened me, and yesterday
Mrs. Horsford came with letters from Norway, giving particulars of
Ole Bull's last days, his death and burial. The gloomy blue of the Kedah mountains on the peninsula of
Malacca, with black thunderclouds gathering round their serrated crests, heightens the brilliant
loveliness of immediate surroundings, steeped in the ruby glow of the magical evening. Every
road is an over-arching avenue of gorgeous foliage--dark tunnels of interwoven cocoa-palms,
huge Amherstias alight as with lamps of fiery orange, tremulous tamarinds, and, more wonderful
than all, a wide highway roofed by a continuous aisle of ansena-trees, the golden canopy of
blossom overhead rivalled by the thick carpet of yellow petals, which deadens every sound,
for the prodigal bounty of tropical Nature quickly replaces the loss of falling flowers. Exquisite
lanes, smothered in glorious vegetation, surround the picturesque Racecourse, that sine-qûa-non
of English occupation. Stately emperor palms, kitools with crimped green tresses, fan and oil
palms, with the slender areca in countless thousands, vary the shadowy vistas branching out
in every direction, with huge-leaved creepers and glossy rattans garlanding the gnarled trunks
of forest-trees. The sculptured outlines of the splendid traveller's palm adorn the green lawns
of European bungalows, embowered in torrents of trailing creepers, the scale of colour descending
from white and pink to royal purple and burning crimson. Snowy arums and golden lilies choke
the brooks, overflowing from the constant showers combining with a vertical sun to foster the
wealth of greenery, the incandescent scarlet and yellow of hybiscus and allemanda glowing with
the transparent depth of hue, beside which the fragile fairness of European flowers, is but
a spectral reflection of those colour-drenched blossoms fused into jewelled lustre by the solar
fires. Night drops her black curtain suddenly, with no intervening veil of twilight to temper
Earth's plunge into darkness. Great stars hang low in the sombre sky, and the open interiors
of Malay huts, aglow with lamp or torchlight, produce Rembrandtesque effects, revealing brown
inmates cooking or eating their "evening rice."

Georgetown, loyally named by British pioneers after a monarch eminently incongruous with any
ideas belonging to a tropical fairyland, possesses neither architectural beauty nor salient
character; wooden warehouses, Malay shanties, and white-washed streets being merely attractive
from the ever-changing scheme of colour painted by varieties of race and costume. Tamils of
ebon blackness drive picturesque teams of humped white oxen in red waggons laden with purple
sugar-cane. Noble-looking Sikhs, in spotless linen, stride past with kingly gait. Brown Siamese,
in many-coloured scarves and turbans gleaming with gold thread, chaffer and bargain at open
stalls with blue-robed Chinamen, and the bronze figures of slim Malays, brightened by mere
wisps of orange and scarlet added to Nature's durable suit, slip through the crowds, pausing
before an emporium of polished brass-work, or a bamboo stall of teak wood carving. The sloping
black mitre of a stout Parsee merchant, accompanied by a pretty daughter in white head-band
and floating sari of cherry-coloured silk, varies the motley headgear of turban and fez, straw
hat and sun-helmet, worn by this cosmopolitan population, the pink headkerchiefs, tinselled
scarves, and jewelled buttons of the beautiful Burmese dress, drawing attention to the energetic
bargaining of two astute customers for cooking utensils; these elegantly-attired but mahogany-coloured
dames, rivalling the Sumatran women in business capacity, and equally determined on securing
the quid pro quo. The long esplanade between town and sea borders a series of green lawns,
where carriages draw up round a bandstand, and the youthful element of European Penang plays
tennis with laudable zeal in the atmosphere of a stove-house. Chinese and Malay boyhood look
on, and listen to the regimental music. The pallid English occupants of the carriages, in spite
of diaphanous muslins and fluttering fans, appear too limp and wilted to bestow more than a
languid attention to their surroundings, until the sea-breeze, springing up as the sun declines,
revives their flagging spirits. The smartest turnout and the finest horses generally belong
to John Chinaman, got up in irreproachable English costume, with his pigtail showing beneath
a straw hat, though considerably attenuated, and lacking those adornments of silken braid and
red tassels, generally plaited into the imposing queue of the orthodox Celestial. The indefatigable
Chinese, frequently arriving on an alien shore without a dollar in their pockets, continually
prove potential millionaires. Immune from climatic diseases, working early and late, tolerant
and unaggressive, the iron hand in the velvet glove disentangles and grasps the threads of
the most complicated commercial enterprise, for the idle Malay, "the gentleman of the East,"
here as elsewhere, cares for little beyond the sport of hunting and fish-spearing, which satisfies
the personal necessities of his indolent existence. The wonderful solidarity of domestic life
is an important factor in the Chinese career, for centuries of ancestor-worship, in spite of
their arrestive tendency, have strengthened the bonds of family union and filial obedience
by insisting on the supreme sanctity of blood-relationship.

The luxuriant Botanical Garden, situated in a green cleft of an angle formed by encircling
hills, is a paradise of dreamland, though but a miniature when compared with Buitenzorg for
extent and variety. In the restful charm of the Penang garden Art and Nature go hand in hand,
giving it an unique character among the horticultural pleasaunces of the Eastern world. The
rolling lawns of the exquisite valley, the song of the waterfall which bounds the view as it
leaps down the lofty cliffs, the abundant shade of tamarind and palm, and the gorgeous flowering
shrubs, suggest nothing artificial or conventionalised in the deep seclusion of the fairy glen.
Tall bamboos mirror fluffy foliage and white or golden stems in stream and pool. Orchids of
the Brazils festoon unknown trees with the rose and purple butterflies formed by their brilliant
blossoms, and colossal traveller's palms, so-called from the draught of water obtained by incision
of the stem, stud the glades with stiffly-fluted fans. Lilac thunbergia wreaths over-arching
boughs, and passion-flower flings white and crimson garlands over turf flushed with the pink
blossoms of the sensitive plant. Gold mohur and red poinsettia blaze with fiery splendour,
and huge crotons, with velvety leaves of pink, violet, and chocolate, grow to the height of
forest trees. The tangle of brilliant flowers, systematically arranged by the concealed art
of the Eastern horticulturist, shows many weird botanical forms. Green spears, bristling on
mossy banks, are starred with crimson and barred with orange. Wine-coloured cacti twist blue-green
spikes and stems in grotesque contortions, and topaz or ruby-tinted calladiums flame in thickets
of hot colour outside cool green dells, filled by a forest of tropical ferns, mosses, and creepers.
Lack of botanical knowledge constitutes a sore disadvantage in this treasury of floral beauty,
but happily we may "consider the lilies," without cataloguing them, in this garden, "beautiful
for situation," and worthy to be a "joy of the whole earth." The sombre jungle on the mountain
side supplies the atmosphere of mystery which enhances the ideal peace of the cloistered Paradise,
wrapt in the embrace of the haunted hills, and numbered among those visions of an earlier Eden,
only realised in the Asiatic birthplace of Humanity which contained the typical Garden of the
World, Divinely planted, where the Voice from Heaven deepened the music of whispering leaves
and sighing breeze.

A purple-red pat--for even the jasper-tinted tropical soil is beautiful, climbs through the
glorious woods to the chief Sanatorium of the Malay Peninsula. A free fight among the coolies
before starting demands a lengthy exercise of that stolidity with which the Western pilgrim
must invest himself, as the invulnerable armour needed by the conflict of daily life. As a
mere matter of personal convenience, this quality bears scant resemblance to the weapons enumerated
by S. Paul in the Christian panoply. The oppressive heat, the futility of argument in an almost
unknown tongue, and the general uncertainty of the subject in dispute, gradually producing
this spurious virtue as the external decoration of sorely-exasperated souls. The exertion of
the long ascent in the steaming heat requires six coolies for every chair. I have on my mind the
creation of a town on the banks of the St. John. The three years since we came this side of the
river have called into life and growth a thousand peach-trees, a thousand orange-trees, about
five hundred lemons, and seven or eight hundred grapevines. A peach orchard, a vineyard, a lemon
grove, will carry my name to posterity. I am founding a place which, thirty or forty years hence,
will be called the old Stowe place.... You can have no idea of this queer country, this sort
of strange, sandy, half-tropical dreamland, unless you come to it. Here I sit with open windows,
the orange buds just opening and filling the air with sweetness, the hens drowsily cackling,
the men planting in the field, and callas and wild roses blossoming out of doors. We keep a little
fire morning and night. We are flooded with birds; and by the bye, it is St. Valentine's Day....
I think a uniform edition of Dr. Holmes's works would be a good thing. Next to Hawthorne he
is our most exquisite writer, and in many passages he goes far beyond him. What is the dear
Doctor doing? If you know any book good to inspire dreams and visions, put it into my box.
My husband chews endlessly a German cud. I must have English. Has the French book on Spiritualism
come yet? If it has, put it in.... I wish I could give you a plateful of our oranges.... We
had seventy-five thousand of these same on our trees this year, and if you will start off quick,
they are not all picked yet. Florida wants one thing,--grass. If it had grass, it would be paradise.
But nobody knows what grass is till had grass, it would be paradise. But nobody knows what
grass is till they try to do without it."

Three months later she wrote: "I hate to leave my calm isle of Patmos, where the world is not,
and I have such quiet long hours for writing. Emerson could insulate himself here and keep his
electricity. Hawthorne ought to have lived in an orange grove in Florida.... You have no idea
how small you all look, you folks in the world, from this distance. All your fusses and your fumings,
your red-hot hurrying newspapers, your clamor of rival magazines,--why,
we see it as we see steamboats fifteen miles off, a mere speck and
smoke."

Again she writes: "You ought to see us riding out in our mule-cart.
Poor 'Fly!' the last of pea-time, who looks like an animated hair-
trunk and the wagon and harness to match! It is too funny, but we
enjoy it hugely. There are now in our solitude five Northern families,
and we manage to have quite pleasant society. The dewy areca-palms throw a dark network of interlacing
shadows across the red road, winding for miles through the sylvan scenery, the alchemy of the
rising sun transmuting the myriad feathery fronds into fountains of green fire. Only the creaking
of a bullock-waggon, or the thud of a falling cocoanut, breaks the hush of the tropical daybreak,
when the leaves only whisper in their dreams, and the vernal earth, fresh as from her Creator's
hand, renews her strength for the heat and burden of the coming day. The colossal pile, consisting
of temple, monastery, and innumerable shrines, amid fountains and fish-ponds, bridges and balconies,
courts and terraces, gleams whitely against the green gloom of the vast palm-forest on either
side, sloping sharply to the shimmering sea. The usual appalling images of vermilion and gold
guard every sculptured gateway, and surmount the painted shrines encircled by parterres of
votive flowers, for the philosophic Buddhism of Ceylon and Siam gathers the moss and weeds
of many an incongruous accretion in countless ages of pilgrimage through the Eastern world.
The transcendental mysticism which spun the finest cobwebs of human thought, crystallises into
concrete form when interpreted in the terms of China, where dim reminiscences of early Nature
worship, and the terrors which upheld the authority of many obsolete creeds, have been incorporated
into the vague ideals of Prince Gautama's prophetic soul. Altars, strewn with fragrant champak-flowers,
stand beneath lace-carved alcoves of black teakwood, on the broad plateaux which form welcome
resting-places beside each flight of steps on the marble stairway, the gilded pinnacles and
aerial spires of the white temple sparkling against the sea of rich foliage. A knot of Burmese
worshippers, with rose-coloured scarves and turbans, throw their infinitesimal coins on the
palm-leaf mats of a red-roofed shrine, and tell the wooden beads of the Buddhist rosary, chanting
the perpetual refrain of "Pain, Sorrow, Unreality," as a warning against the temptations of
Maya, the world of illusion. The brown faces raised imploringly to the presiding deity, a leering
demon with green face and yellow body, inspire the hope that the grotesque monster may prove
his own unreality by vanishing from the hearts of his devotees into the limbo of nightmares
from which he has emerged, for the philosophic quietism of Buddhist creed offers no disguise
to the horrors of a hell far surpassing the terrific literalism of Dante's Inferno. Rippling
conduits edge pillared courts and cloistered arcades, resplendent with frieze and cornice of
blue and scarlet, a central fountain falling in prismatic showers over a sacred pond of golden
carp. A white-robed monk smilingly conducts us across hump-backed bridges and colonnaded galleries
to a bench beneath a grey frangipanni tree, starred with fragrant flowers, and brings welcome
cups of tea, before another struggle up the interminable steps, which symbolise the mystic
"path" leading to Nirvana's rest. Further hospitality meets us at a yellow kiosk, higher up
the sacred hill, where a dainty breakfast of eggs, cakes, and honey stands on a white table-cloth,
bearing a steaming coffee-pot. The temple paraphernalia of Buddhist worship strangely resembles
Catholic imagery. Incense rises from open censers on the dais, the blue cloud enveloping a
gorgeous altar, encrusted with gold. The central figure of Gautama Buddha, on the lotus leaf
expresses supernal calm, and the symbolic flower, in bud, blossom, or foliage, forms the prevailing
design of vase and amphora, within golden lattice-work. Hanging lamps glow on rapt faces of
attendant saints, or on those supplementary local Buddhas which Chinese doctrine adds to the
comparative simplicity of the original system. The foreshadowing of Christian truth culminates
in the fact stated by a Buddhist priest, that bread and wine of mystic meaning are reserved
on the altars of many among the forty subdivisions of Buddhism. The mountain Sanctuary, though
marred by debased decoration and heathenised by the lurid figures of the guardian demons, inspires
a reverent devotion, and exercises a solemnising influence on many souls whose faith differs
from that of the white-clad monks, who seek to scale the dim heights of perfection from this
lofty peak. "The Light which lighteth every man" must needs throw a faint and far-off ray even
on an erroneous creed, groping through the darkness for the outstretched Hands which embrace
all Humanity with boundless Love.

Penang, as a little field of missionary enterprise, possesses many privileges often denied
to the further islands of Malaysia. The variety of immigrant races, the constant intercourse
with the Indian mainland, and the needs of travellers belonging to every nation, keep the settlement
in touch with a multitude of spiritual needs. Christianity, both in Anglican and Roman guise,
sows diligently in fields gradually whitening to harvest. The English Church, with reverent
services and kindly priest, remains a little centre of cherished associations. The S. Francis
Xavier Institute, which brings many Chinese boys into the Christian fold, through the labours
of another Communion, carries on the work of the great mediæval missionary, who reached the
farthest East in his apostolate of love. The scarlet, yellow, and white veils of Eastern converts,
the crowd of Eurasian Christians in both churches, and the presence of a devout Malay priest
assisting at the English service, add unfamiliar notes of colour among the snowy muslins and
flower-decked hats of English residents, but correctness of costume, both in men and women,
contrasts refreshingly with the slovenly déshabille of the Netherlands India, the last and
easily-snapped link between civilisation and barbarism.

An opportunity occurs for a visit to Taiping, the capital of the Native Federated States, and
situated in Province Wellesley. The launch crosses to Prai, the rising port of Malacca, and
the northern terminus of the railway, sure to upset the passenger lists of the great steamers
by traversing the entire peninsula to Johore. Through a channel bordered with weird mangroves,
the boat enters a long, slow river, flowing between boundless palm-forests. The "black but
comely" captain of the snorting boat escorts his European passengers to the station, arranges
tickets, and waits on the platform till the train starts; the portly sailor in spotless linen,
surmounted by his genial ebony face, waving encouragement as long as we remain in sight. The
perils and dangers of the way are nil, and none of the threatened contingencies arise, but
to Eastern thought risks, however remote and improbable, add to the value of a journey. Real
drawbacks seem seldom mentioned, but imaginary lions in the way offer unlimited scope to Oriental
fancy, and help to create a thrilling drama of destruction. Green paddi-fields, tall sugar-canes,
and a world of palms, rise from the alluvial flats of Province Wellesley. The great rubber
plantations, which form the chief source of wealth in Malacca, follow in endless succession,
but, as usual, the astute Chinaman has obtained almost a monopoly of the industry, from which
the greatest fortunes of the tropics are now derived. The bushy trees, with their black stems
and ragged foliage, are destitute of the beauty so lavishly bestowed even on the weeds of this
fertile soil. The tangled splendour of the wild jungle, which presently borders the track,
demonstrates the immense difficulty of pioneering in a tropical forest, where the interlacing
boughs of the myriad trees, with their impenetrable screen of climbing parasites, make perpetual
walls of living green, defying human progress. Malay villages, brown and palm-thatched in the
immemorial style, stand on piles above the swampy ground, which seems the approved site of
habitation. A barren district devastated by a forest fire, contains the disused pits of ancient
tin-mines, but these unsightly hollows have been decorated by Nature's hand with a luxuriant
growth of the frilled pink lotus. Malay children, themselves unadorned, stand on wayside platforms,
every brown hand filled with the rosy chalices of the sacred Buddhist emblem. Tradition says
that the blossom, drawn up from the mire by the rays of the morning sun, symbolised the earth-stained
soul, made pure and stainless by the attraction of that Divine Glory which Buddhism, though
in distorted form, strove to attain.

At the end of the sixty-mile journey, the English station-master at Taiping proved a veritable
friend in need, arranging for a hot breakfast at the station, chartering rickshaw coolies,
and--greatest blessing of all--directing the route, with a menacing pantomime concerning any
shirking of duty, which saved all further trouble. Taiping is in an early stage of progress,
and the open tokos in waringen-shaded streets, show nothing but the necessaries of life, with
terrible mementos of Birmingham in petroleum lamps, hideous oleographs, and machine-made household
goods. Pretty bungalows stand beyond the interlacing avenues of dusky trees, and a framework
toy of a church in the green outskirts, contains numerous brass tablets recording English lives
laid down in this weary land. These pathetic memorials seem the only permanent features of
the frail edifice in the shadowy God's-acre already filled with graves. The newly-planted park,
with a lake fringed by a vivid growth of allemanda and hybiscus, stands below the purple heights
of a long mountain chain, but Taiping offers few inducements to a prolonged stay, and after
a hurried glimpse of terrific beasts and snakes of the jungle, preserved in the local museum,
we return to the station, the kindly chef-de-gare disturbing his wife from her siesta in the
adjacent bungalow, to feast us on tea and bananas. Darkness falls before the train reaches
Penang, but a Chinese gentleman acts as pilot across some rocking boats, with only a faint
flare from expiring torches to light the way, and starts the cringing coolies, with true politeness
to the "foreign devils," but manifest wonder at their eccentric customs. Chinese womanhood,
painted, bedizened, and tottering on the pink and gold hoofs which cause a sickening shudder
to the Western spectator, indicates the barrier of prejudice to be surmounted before China
can mould national ideals into harmony with modern progress.

The vicinity of Penang to the Equatorial junction of the maritime world, widens local interests
by the development of the Malay Peninsula, partly governed through the instrumentality of native
Sultans under English guidance, but the abiding charm of the island lies beyond the radius
of the thriving port. Nature still reigns supreme in this jewel of the Equator, where the amber
swathes of Indian laburnum, the golden-hearted whiteness of luscious frangipanni blossom, and
the red fire of the flamboyant tree, light up the endless aisles of swaying palms, where temple-flower
and tuberose mingle their fragrance with the breath of clove and cinnamon, interpreting the
imagery of the Eastern monarch's bridal song, and luring each lover of Earth's manifold beauty
to "go down into her garden of spices and gather lilies."

EPILOGUE.

The infinite variety of interests connected with the vast Malay Archipelago, mainly dominated
by European authority, can only be inadequately mentioned in the simple record of a half-year's
wandering through scenes which stamp their unfading beauty indelibly on mind and memory. Virgin
fields of discovery still invite scientific exploration, and the green sepulchre of Equatorial
vegetation retains innumerable secrets of Art and architecture. The geological mysteries of
these volcanic shores offer a host of unsolved problems, the surpassing magnificence of flower
and foliage makes every island a botanical Paradise, and the varieties of race and language
which moulded and coloured the destinies of the Equatorial world, supply historian and philologist
with opportunities of unlimited research. The dim chronicles of a distant past, inscribed in
vague characters with faint traces of the earliest Malay wanderers, link their shadowy pages
with historic records of falling dynasties and warring creeds, preceding the eventful period
of colonial enterprise, initiated by the wild campaigns in quest of the precious spices. Although
the Malay voyagers remain veiled in the twilight which clouds the verge of authentic history,
the track of their keels may yet be followed through the conflicting currents of that hitherto
unknown ocean which they opened to a future world. The forests and fishing grounds of every
coast and island still support the manifold divisions of the nomadic race which forms the substratum
of island life, and the star of hope which led them onward, shone for many subsequent adventurers
across those Southern seas which aroused the energies and ambitions of later ages. The symbolical
stories of the world's infancy join the actual experience of struggling humanity to the dreamland
from whence it emerged, as some syren song lured it into unknown regions. The old-world legends
of mankind "launching out into the deep, and letting down the nets for a draught," repeat themselves
from age to age, for the human heart has ever sacrificed comfort and safety in order to set
sail upon some trackless ocean, on the chance of reaping that harvest of life's sea for which
man yearns with insatiable desire. The wanderings of Odysseus, in the youth of the world, illustrate
the eternal pursuit of a visionary ideal, in those adventures which breathe the undying romance
of the sea. The resemblance between the traditions of savage and civilised nations appears
too strong to be fortuitous, and indicates the underlying unity of feeling and purpose implanted
in the human race. Modern environment renders it impossible to calculate the tremendous force
of the mysterious impulse which swayed the onward march of primeval tribes; even the later
obstacles, overcome by bold spirits who followed in their wake, can never be adequately realised
amid the artificial conditions of our present life. The charmed circle of the "Equator's emerald
zone," encloses a region of marvel and mystery, where Imagination, the fairy with the magic
mirror, helps to interpret and reveal the secrets of Beauty and Truth, which transfigure material
form and colour with the halo of idealism. The tale of the mysterious ages when "the threads
of families" were first "woven into the ropes of nations," still sways mind and fancy, but
the romance of the world continues, though the progress of Humanity varies the pictured page.
In the warm heart of the tropical Archipelago, Nature, triumphing in eternal youth, seems to
mock the transient phases of aspiration and achievement, which vanish by turn into the misty
past. The great Mother chants her "Song of Songs" throughout the myriad changes of Time, in
terms so similar to the imagery of the Divine Epithalamium that, from a human standpoint, it
seems swept by the spice-laden breezes of the Malayan Lotus-land, rather than by the fainter
fragrance wafted from the orchards and gardens of Palestine or Egypt. Possibly the Syrian fleet,
in search of ivory and peacocks, touched at the enchanted shores where "all trees of frankincense"
perfumed the air, and produced those aromatic "powders of the merchant," regarded as priceless
treasures both in primitive and mediæval days. The story might well capture the fancy of the
royal poet, and enrich the music of his verse with the luscious fragrance of a more luxuriant
land than even his own pastoral Canaan, flowing with milk and honey. The hyperbole of Eastern
thought often rests on a solid foundation of fact, and the Hebrew love-song weaves tropical
Nature's lavish wealth of flower, fruit, and fragrance into a symbolic garland, flung in passionate
rapture at the feet of the beloved one. The spiritual significance of the sacred lyric only
transposes the mystic melody into a higher key, and heaps the thurible of the sanctuary with
the frankincense of praise, to celebrate the typical bridal of Earth and Heaven.

The diadem of palms on the last outlying islet of the Malay Archipelago, stands out in dark
relief against the golden haze of the afterglow, which floods the sky, and changes the purple
waters into a sea of fire. The pageant of sunset lingers for a moment, and then vanishes beneath
of the pall of the swiftly-falling night. The fairyland of eternal summer sinks below the horizon,
and realities melt into the shadows of that mental subconsciousness which holds the wraiths
of departed joys. Memories of the golden hours spent in threading the flowery maze of the vast
Archipelago, seem a mere handful of shells gathered on the surf-beaten shores, but if even
the empty shell can hold the sound of the waves, this brief record of a cruise in sunny seas
may also convey faint whispers of that syren voice which echoed through the ages of the past,
and still allures the spellbound listener to the swaying palms and spice-scented bowers of
Malaya's Island Paradise.

Inconsistencies in the hyphenation of words retained. (dream-like, dreamlike; ear-rings, earrings;
re-adjustment, readjustment; sandal-wood, sandalwood; sub-consciousness, subconsciousness;
sub-divisions, subdivisions; thunder-clouds, thunderclouds; waist-cloth, waistcloth; white-washed,
whitewashed; wicker-work, wickerwork)
