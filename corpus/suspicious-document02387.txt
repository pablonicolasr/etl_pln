PREFACE.

This volume presents the first publication of the famous lectures of Governor Robert L. Taylor.
His great popularity as an orator and entertainer, and his wide reputation as a humorist, have
caused repeated inquiries from all sections of the country for his lectures in book form; and
this has given rise to an earlier publication than was expected.

The lectures are given without the slightest abridgment, just as delivered from the platform
throughout the country. The consecutive chain of each is left undisturbed; and the idea of
paragraphing, and giving headlines to the various subjects treated, was conceived merely for
the convenience of the reader.

In the dialect of his characters, the melody of his songs, and the originality of his quaint,
but beautiful conceptions, Governor Taylor's lectures are temples of thought, lighted with
windows of fun.

                                                            DELONG RICE.

  Temples of Thought,
     Lighted with
       Windows
       Of Fun.
