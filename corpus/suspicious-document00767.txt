Through Veld and Forest, by Harry Collingwood.

The hero of the story is Edward Laurence, an 18-year-old living on a farm in South Africa.
The date is in the earlier part of the nineteenth century.  The boy is sent off on a shopping
expedition which will take several days, but when he gets back he finds that there has been
an attack on the farm, his father and mother are dead, and all the stock has been taken away.
He goes to the neighbouring farm, and finds that the same applies there, except that he realises
that the young 12-year old daughter, Nell, has been taken away alive.  Edward's father had
always spent the profits on improving the breeding-stock, so Edward has very little money in
hand.  He goes to a town where he has friends, and one of them advises him to spend what he
has on setting up an expedition to the north, where he may be able to get enough ivory and
hides to make a good profit.  And, it is suggested, he may even be able to get gold, silver
and diamonds.

Edward sets up this expedition, and sets off.  We will not spoil the story for you except to
say that he spends some time on the way with a witch-doctor, who is able to conjure up for
him a vision of where little Nell is.  His adventures thereafter are many and various, and
some of them are hair's-breadth escapes from very dangerous situations.

Collingwood is a superb writer, with a magnificent power of description, so it is a very nice
book to read or listen to.

THROUGH VELD AND FOREST, BY HARRY COLLINGWOOD.

CHAPTER ONE.

VAGUE HINTS OF POSSIBLE TROUBLE.

The blazing midsummer sun of South Africa had sunk to within a hand's breadth of the ridge
of the southern spur of the Tandjes Berg, softly outlined in blue some forty miles distant
on the western horizon, when I, Edward Laurence, having taken a long afternoon ride round the
farm to assure myself that the sheep were being properly looked after, arrived within a mile
of my home--the long, white, one-storey thatched house picturesquely perched yonder on a mound
which formed one of the southern spurs of the Great Winter Berg.

The house--which, together with the farm of two thousand five hundred and sixty acres, was
known as Bella Vista--was the property of my father, Henry Laurence, ex-colonel of the --th
King's Own Regiment of Dragoon Guards; and he had purchased it some fifteen years prior to
the date upon which this story opens, having been so severely wounded during the battle of
Waterloo as to necessitate his retirement from the army. His retirement, of course, left him
without an occupation; and as he was then still quite a young man, being only thirty-three
years of age, as soon as he had recovered from his wounds--so far as recovery then seemed possible--he
began to cast about for something to do.  It was at this juncture that he made the acquaintance
of a Miss Violet McKinnon, the lovely daughter of an impecunious Scottish laird, and fell desperately
in love with her; and as my father happened to be a strikingly handsome and attractive man
his affection was speedily returned, and marriage quickly followed.  To marry under such circumstances
was perhaps something of an imprudence, for my father had nothing but his pension, while his
bride--sixteen years his junior--had nothing but her trousseau; but the pair turned a deaf
ear to all advice and remonstrance, with the result just mentioned, when of course it became
more imperatively necessary than ever for the ex-colonel to discover some means of earning
a living, especially as I was born within a year of the date of the marriage.  The state of
his health demanded that the occupation chosen should enable him to live an outdoor life: and
farming at once naturally suggested itself.

Then, in the nick of time, he made the acquaintance of a Mr William Arbuckle, a friend of his
father-in-law, and a South African sheep farmer, home for a holiday; and this man strongly
urged him to emigrate to South Africa and take up sheep farming.  The idea powerfully appealed
to my father from the very first, and the upshot was that, after due enquiry into details,
my parents took the decisive step and--my father having commuted his pension--sailed for South
Africa, of course taking me with them.  This event occurred early in the year 1818.  Arbuckle
returned to South Africa in the ship which took us out; and at his urgent invitation we became
his guests for a short time upon our arrival at the Cape.  But the warm-hearted Scotchman's
kindness did not end there; he instituted enquiries, and eventually learned that a certain
small farm, known as Rooikop, in the Albany district, was for sale, the Dutchman who owned
it being averse to the British rule and intending to move up-country beyond the borders of
the colony.  This farm Arbuckle and my father visited together, with the result that, upon
the urgent advice of his friend, the ex-colonel purchased it, just as it stood, house, stock,
and implements, all complete.  But he did not buy the furniture, having brought out from England
all that he required; also the Dutchman needed it to take up-country with him to the spot where
he might ultimately establish his new home: thus both parties were equally satisfied.

The first thing that my father did after entering into possession was to change the name of
the farm from Rooikop to Bella Vista, on account of the magnificent prospect obtainable from
the stoep of the house, which faced due south, and consequently was in grateful shadow all
day.  The building stood on a kopje or hill rising out of one of the lower spurs of the Great
Winter Berg range of mountains, the bald summits of which towered into the rich blue of the
South African sky some seven miles in the rear of the house, their rugged slopes bush-clad
for two-thirds of their height.  On the left, or toward the east, other spurs of the range
gradually lost themselves in a wide expanse of gently rolling, bush-clad plateau extending
beyond the blue distance to the sea, one hundred and eighty miles away, where the Great Kei
River discharges itself into the Indian Ocean.  A similar prospect stretched in front of the
house, the ground growing more rugged toward the right as the spectator's gaze swept westward,
until, looking due west from the house, one perceived, in the immediate foreground, a moderately
steep declivity running down to a spruit or small stream, having its rise high up toward the
summit of the mountains and discharging into the Great Fish River, some seven miles distant.
On the far side of the spruit the country was flat enough to enable one to catch a glimpse,
here and there, of the Great Fish River itself winding southward through the plain, and, in
the extreme distance, the soft blue masses of the Tandjes Berg spurs, on the hither side of
which the white houses of Somerset East, some twenty-eight miles away, might sometimes be seen
on a clear morning when the sun shone strongly upon them.

Such, very feebly and sketchily described, was the splendid prospect visible from the stoep
of our house as I first knew it; and the passage of the years effected little or no change
save the gradual disappearance of the nearer clumps of bush, as my father caused them to be
cleared away in order to furnish additional grazing ground for our steadily increasing flocks
of sheep and herds of cattle, and the occasional appearance of a new house somewhere in the
distance, as neighbours gradually began to gather in our vicinity.  The greatest change of
all, however, was that occasioned by the erection of our own new house; for, as time went on,
my father's health improved so greatly that he became as strong and robust as ever, with the
promise of a ripe old age before him.  Moreover, he began to make money rapidly as his flocks
and herds increased; and, as the money came in, so his views with regard to the comforts of
home life expanded.  The house standing on the property when my father purchased it consisted
of a sitkammer, or general sitting-room used for all day purposes, and three bedrooms; and
this amount of accommodation served our purpose well enough for the first five years of our
residence upon the farm.  But by that time my father had made a very considerable sum of money
by his annual sales of wool and hides; and one of his theories was that money was useful merely
as a means by which life might be made more comfortable and enjoyable.  He therefore planned
a new and much more commodious house, built it of stone quarried from the mountain side within
a quarter of a mile of the chosen site, filled it with new and handsome furniture, pictures,
and a piano for my mother, all imported from England at great expense, and laid out a beautiful
garden of about five acres in extent all round the house, converting the place into a perfect
miniature Paradise.  Also, the time had arrived when my education must be thought of; and,
as at that period there were no schools of any importance nearer than Cape Town, and my mother
objected to my being sent so far away--I being an only child--my father decided to secure the
services of a private tutor, and in due time Mr John Nesbitt, a Cambridge man, and a very fine
fellow in every respect, became a member of our household.  To him I hold myself indebted for
a most excellent education, and for many other things beside.  He continued my education until
I attained the age of fifteen years, after which he remained on as a sort of general factotum
to my father, while I devoted myself to the management of the farm, relieving my father of
all the hard work and so leaving him free to enjoy himself in his own way. Such, briefly stated,
was the general condition of affairs at Bella Vista on the afternoon referred to at the beginning
of this chapter--on which day, by the way, I attained to the age of seventeen years; except
that, after building and furnishing his new house, my father regularly employed all his surplus
cash in extending the area of his property, and improving his flocks and herds by the frequent
purchase of valuable animals for breeding purposes.

As I have said, on the afternoon that marks the opening of my remarkable story I had arrived
within a mile of the gate in the stout picket fence which surrounded our garden as a protection
against the invasion of predatory animals, when my horse, Prince, suddenly pricked up his ears,
and, looking away to the eastward, whinnied, while at the same moment the rhythmical beat of
cantering hoofs came softly to my ear from a considerable distance, floating on the gentle,
almost imperceptible, easterly zephyr that happened to be breathing at the moment.  Aroused
thus from some day-dream into which I had fallen, I glanced up, and, looking in the direction
of the sound, became aware of a small cloud of dust gleaming yellow in the afternoon sun, about
a mile away to the eastward; and in the midst of it appeared two mounted figures which, even
at that distance, I identified without difficulty as Mr Lestrange, our next-door neighbour
at Triannon, some fourteen miles away, and his eleven-year-old daughter Nell.  They must have
seen and recognised me at the same moment, for a few seconds later a shout from Mr Lestrange
reached me; and, turning Prince's head in their direction and pressing my unarmed heels gently
to his sides, I cantered off to meet them.  Some three or four minutes later we came together,
and, all reining up as I wheeled my horse alongside them, we proceeded toward Bella Vista at
a walking pace, as their horses were sweating and it was desirable that they should be allowed
to cool off a little before being stabled.

"Many happy returns of the day, Ned!" exclaimed Nell, with a bright smile, as I shook hands
with her.  "You see I have not forgotten that to-day is your birthday; and--here is my birthday
present to you," handing me a small parcel neatly tied up in paper.

"I also wish you many happy returns, Ned," remarked Mr Lestrange, reaching across in front
of his daughter to shake hands with me.  "I haven't brought you any present, however, so you
must take the will for the deed and accept Nell's present as coming from us jointly.  The young
minx has been working at them like a Trojan for the last fortnight; so, as a reward for her
extraordinary industry, I have allowed her to ride over and present them herself.  They are
a pair of Berlin-wool slippers, made after the pattern of an old one that Nell surreptitiously
begged from your mother when we were last at Bella Vista.  And that reminds me to enquire how
they all are at the house.  Quite well, I hope?"

"Yes, thank you, all quite well," I replied.  "I don't need to ask how you and Nell are; I
can see for myself that there is nothing the matter with either of you.  They will be tremendously
glad at home to see you both; we have not had a single visitor since you last came--how long
ago was it?  It must be quite six weeks."

"More than that," answered Mr Lestrange; "it is two months ago to-day by the almanac.  And
I believe you've grown since then," he continued, eyeing me over.  "How tall are you?  Did
you think of measuring yourself this morning to see how tall you are at seventeen years of age?"

"No," I laughed, "but the pater did; and according to him I stand just six feet and a quarter
of an inch in my stockings."

"Ay, I dare say you do," he said, "although you scarcely look it, you are so broad across the
shoulders.  What will you be when you are twenty-one?"

"I am almost afraid to think of it," I replied, rather ruefully.  "I ride within four pounds
of thirteen stone now.  If I go on at this rate until I am twenty-one I shall not be able to
find a horse fit to carry me!"

"You will have to get the colonel to breed one specially for you," remarked Lestrange, with
a loud laugh.  "By the way," he continued, "talking of horses, I wonder if you happen to have
anything that would do for Nell.  Punch there is getting old and a little groggy in the fore
legs.  He came down with her the other day, and the child had rather a nasty spill.  I shall
not let her ride him any longer than I can help. But I have nothing on my place suitable for
her; I don't go in much for breeding horses, you know."

"No," I concurred, "I know you don't.  But we have the very thing for her, a two-year-old filly,
unbroken, all but thoroughbred, with the makings of a splendid horse in her.  If you care to
ride down to the vley I will show her to you; it won't take us much more than a mile out of
our way, and I should like Nell to have her."

Mr Lestrange agreeing, we forthwith made off toward the flat where the horses were turned out
to graze, and presently I had caught the filly, which was a very gentle creature and quite
a pet of mine, and led her up by her long forelock for inspection.  She was a bright bay, with
very long dark mane and tail, and of course very ragged-looking as to her coat, never having
been groomed in her life; but that did not matter, her points were quite unmistakable, and
Mr Lestrange, to say nothing of Nell, fell in love with her on the spot.  Then, when the visitors
had done admiring the animal, we turned our horses' heads and rode toward the house, on the
broad veranda-covered stoep of which we could see my father and mother, the latter waving her
handkerchief by way of welcome to Mr Lestrange and Nell.  A quarter of an hour later we had
dismounted at the foot of the broad flight of steps leading up to the stoep, which my father
and mother had descended in order to extend greeting to the visitors, and the "boys" were leading
the horses away to the stable at the back.

The usual interchange of greetings having passed, we learned that Mr Lestrange and his daughter
had come prepared to pass the night with us; and when our guests had been taken to their rooms
and had refreshed themselves after their journey we all gathered on the spacious front stoep
and chatted until dinner was served.  Our subjects of conversation were naturally rather limited,
isolated as we were in what was then practically a wilderness, where it sometimes happened
that several weeks elapsed between the departure of one visitor and the arrival of another.
Like my father, Mr Lestrange had devoted himself to sheep farming, and the conversation therefore
turned chiefly upon the most approved methods of dealing with the several diseases to which
the sheep were subject, the best dip to use, how to determine the precise moment for shearing,
to secure the best quality of wool, and so on.

Yet it seemed to me that through it all Mr Lestrange's mind was dwelling upon something else,
something that he was anxious to speak about as soon as a favourable opportunity should arrive.
That opportunity, however, did not occur until after my mother and Nell had retired for the
night, for we Laurences happened to be enthusiasts in the matter of music.  My mother was not
only a brilliant pianiste, but she also sang exceedingly well.  My father possessed a chamber
organ, Nesbitt owned a very sweet-toned violin from which he could extract the most wonderful
music, and, lastly, I had learned to tootle fairly well upon the flute; therefore whenever
we had visitors we were generally required to organise an impromptu concert for their benefit,
as was the case on the evening in question.  But at length the instruments fell silent, my
mother and Nell bade us good night and retired to their rooms, and, a table under the veranda
having been set out with decanters, glasses, cigars, and tobacco, we males adjourned to the
front stoep for a final gossip before separating.  And then it was that Mr Lestrange found
opportunity to broach the matter which, as I conjectured, had been occupying his thoughts all
the evening.

Having mixed himself a glass of grog and lighted his pipe, he drew his chair close up to the
one occupied by my father, and, lowering his voice to a confidential tone, said:

"Look here, Laurence!  The real reason why I rode over here this afternoon was not personally
to congratulate Ned upon the occurrence of his birthday, but to ask you how you happen to be
off for ammunition.  I have been wondering whether you could spare me a little."

"Well," said my father, "I think we can let you have a little, though not very much, for our
own stock is growing rather low.  How much do you want?"

"Could you let me have, say, twenty pounds of powder and--?" began Lestrange.

"Twenty pounds!" ejaculated my father in surprise.  "No, that I certainly cannot; for I do
not think we have more than half that quantity altogether.  But I dare say we can let you have
four or five pounds to tide you over until you can replenish your stock, if that will be of
any use to you."

"Thanks very much," answered Lestrange; "but it would not be enough, and moreover it would
be depriving you.  No; I must see if I cannot somehow arrange to send in to Port Elizabeth
for a supply.  The nuisance of it is that I have nobody about my place whom I can trust upon
such an errand--"

"Oh, as to that," interrupted my father, "if you are so hard up as that, Ned shall go in and
get it for you!  We are not very busy here just now, and a trip to Port Elizabeth will do him
no harm.  But why do you require such a large quantity?  Are you contemplating an up-country
jaunt; or what is in the wind?"

"No," answered Lestrange; "I am certainly not contemplating an up-country expedition of any
sort.  And as to what is in the wind, I don't know; I very much wish I did.  But during the
last month I have heard a thing or two with regard to the natives that make me feel just a
trifle uneasy, and I thought I ought to mention the matter to you--if it has not already reached
your ears."

"No," said my father, "we have heard nothing here.  What is it?"

"Well," said Lestrange, "I have heard nothing very definite, thus far-- only enough, in fact,
to render me somewhat uneasy.  Just vague hints, more than anything else, you know.  But I
have been putting two and two together, and therefrom I deduce the fact that the natives are
growing a bit restive at the steadily increasing number of whites who are coming into the country--"

My father interrupted with a loud laugh.  "Is that all, my dear chap?" he exclaimed.  "Why,
it has been like that ever since I came here, sixteen years ago.  There were rumours then that
the natives intended to rise and drive us all into the sea; but nothing has ever come of it,
excepting an occasional small raid upon some outlying farm, and the driving off of a few sheep
or cattle.  Surely you have been here long enough to know that these mysterious hints and rumours
should not be taken seriously!"

"Yes, I have," returned Lestrange.  "But, to my mind, things look a bit different just now.
From what I have heard I gather that there is somebody--whether a white man or a native I cannot
make out, but it looks rather like a white man--who is going round among the natives, urging
the various tribes to combine together for the purpose of attacking and exterminating the whites
forthwith; pointing out that, unless this is very speedily done, the whites will get such a
footing in the country that it will be impossible to drive them out, with the result that the
natives will be robbed of their land and driven into the interior, to perish on the points
of the spears of the powerful and ferocious Zulus.  Now, that is an exceedingly dangerous doctrine
to preach to such ignorant, credulous folk as are the Tembu, the Pondos, and the Griquas; the
more so since there is a soupcon of truth in it, as is evidenced by the increasing numbers
of the Dutch who are pressing over the border in order to escape from British rule: and this
time I am really inclined to believe that the agitation may lead to more or less unpleasant
consequences.  Not, mind you, that I think the disturbance is at all likely to reach as far
as here; still, one never knows, and it is wise to be prepared for the worst--which is the
reason why I am anxious to replenish my stock of ammunition as quickly as possible."

"Yes; quite so," agreed my father.  "But," he continued, "who or what is your authority for
the statement that somebody--possibly a white man--is endeavouring to stir up the natives against
us?  For my own part I can scarcely credit such a thing as possible.  Why, assuming for a moment
such a thing to be true, the fellow himself would be in the direst peril, for the natives could
hardly be expected to discriminate in his favour; he would be just as likely to be wiped out
in the convulsion as any of us."

"I think not," said Lestrange, "for I take it that, if such a man exists, he is some schelm
devoid of all kith or kin, and fully prepared to throw in his lot with the Kafirs, in the hope
of living a safe and easy life with them; or, possibly, he may have some notion that he can
persuade them to make him a chief if he should succeed in bringing off a successful rising
against the whites.  As to my authority--well, one of my Totties, a man named Klaas, who is
a rather intelligent fellow, has overheard a good deal of mysterious talk among my `boys' of
late, which he has repeated to me; and although nothing has been said of an absolutely definite
character, the remarks which he has repeated certainly seem to point pretty conclusively to
the fact that something is really brewing.  Moreover--and this, in my opinion, is the most
sinister indication of all--my native `boys' are all going back home, upon one pretext or another."

"A-h!" ejaculated my father, "now you are coming to something definite. How long has this been
going on?"

"Oh, not very long!  Only within these last few days," answered Lestrange.  "But within that
time more than half of them have gone.  And they are mostly Pondos or Griquas."

"By Jove, Pater, there may be something in it, after all!"  I exclaimed. "Our `boys' are mostly
Totties, as you know, but we have had a few Griquas--about half a dozen--until within the last
few days; now they are all gone, two or three of them without waiting to get their pay.  I
did not think very much of that, however, for they have done the same thing before; but in
the light of what Mr Lestrange has just told us it certainly looks a bit suspicious."

"Yes, it certainly does," agreed my father, "although, after all, there may really be nothing
in it.  At the same time it will be well to be prepared; therefore to-morrow you shall take
the wagon and make an errand to Port Elizabeth.  I believe some of our stores are running rather
low, so there ought to be no difficulty in arranging for the trip without unnecessarily alarming
your mother.  And you can complete your back load by bringing as much powder and lead as the
wagon will conveniently carry.  I have no doubt that our friend Lestrange here will willingly
take half of what you bring."

"Ay, that I will, and be glad to get it," answered Lestrange.  "And if you will take my advice,
Ned, you will not loiter unduly on the way.  If a rising is really meditated it may occur at
any moment, although I do not believe it is exactly what you may call imminent; were it so,
I think we should have heard a little more about it.  Still, there is nothing like being prepared
in good time; in a case like this it is better to be a couple of months too early than a day
too late."

So it was arranged, and for the next half-hour we were all busy discussing the question of
what precisely I should bring out with me, and preparing a detailed list of our various requirements;
for a wagon journey to Port Elizabeth was no trifling matter, the distance across the veld
and by road being about one hundred and seventy miles, and occupying the best part of nine
days each way.  By the time that we had finished it was past midnight, and I went to bed and
slept soundly, for, to be quite truthful, I had no very profound belief in the threatened rising,
despite the ominous departure of the Griquas; such things had happened before--were constantly
happening, in fact--and nothing ever came of it, although more or less alarming rumours were
continually arising, nobody quite knew how.  As a matter of fact I felt quite easy in my mind
about it, for I was confident that, even should a rising take place, it would be suppressed
very promptly; and in any case I did not believe for a moment that the savages would dare to
penetrate so far into the colony as Bella Vista, or even as far as Triannon: while the "scare",
trifling and unfounded as I believed it to be, afforded me an excellent excuse for a trip to
Port Elizabeth, which town I had not visited for more than six months, my father having accompanied
the wagon on the previous journey; also it justified me in my determination to purchase a new
rifle--one of the very newest and most up-to-date weapons that I could possibly procure, the
rifle which I had been using for the previous six years being a flintlock affair, and worn
out at that.  On the following morning we were astir at an even earlier hour than usual, for,
the trek oxen not having been worked for some time, I was anxious to make a good start and
get well on my way before the heat of the day set in.  My mother expressed some surprise at
the apparently hurried character of the expedition; but when it was explained that Mr Lestrange
had run out of ammunition, while our own stock was running low, she was at once satisfied,
for at that time hunting was practically the only amusement open to the farmer, and it was
also imperatively necessary that he should be amply provided with means to check the increase
of the more predatory animals in the neighbourhood of his farm. Also my mother, being a good
housewife, was far more inclined to avail herself of the opportunity afforded by the trip to
provide herself with an ample stock of such things as could only be procured at Port Elizabeth
than she was to search curiously for another and deeper motive for the trip than the one which
my father had given her.

The wagon, with a light load of skins and horns, got away early, in charge of Jan, the Hottentot
driver, and then we all sat down to breakfast, as merry and jovial a party, probably, as any
in South Africa that day, much of our amusement arising from the fact that my mother and Nell
were continually thinking of some fresh commission which I was to be sure to execute for them
before leaving Port Elizabeth, the pair of them keeping me so busy jotting down their instructions
in my notebook that I could scarcely find time to eat or drink.  But at length the merry meal
came to an end: we all rose from the table and adjourned to the stoep, before which Piet, my
after-rider, was walking the horses to and fro, with Thunder and Juno, the two big hounds that
always accompanied me everywhere, trailing at their heels and whining with impatience to be
off.  Arrived there, another commission or two were remembered and had to be jotted down, upon
which my father laughingly exclaimed, as I finally closed my notebook and slipped it into my
pocket:

"There, that will do, Ned; now you had better mount and ride, or you will not get away at all
to-day.  Goodbye, boy; remember me very kindly to Mr Henderson and such other friends as you
may see at the Bay, and-- don't forget the new rifle!"

This last sally produced quite an explosion of laughter at my expense, for I had announced
my determination to treat myself to the best weapon I could find, and the enthusiasm with which
I had dwelt upon the achievements that would be in my power when it came into my possession
rendered it the most unlikely thing in the world that I should forget to purchase it.  Joining
in the laugh, I shook hands with Mr Lestrange, Nesbitt, and my father, kissed Nell and my mother,
and ran light-heartedly down the steps, swung myself into the saddle, and, with a final farewell
wave of the hand, cantered off down the broad path leading to the gate, with the dogs bounding
along ahead and Piet, mounted upon a sturdy grey gelding, bringing up the rear.

It was a glorious morning, such as I think one never finds anywhere but in South Africa; the
sky overhead a deep, rich, cloudless blue, shading away on all sides to a soft, warm, delicate,
almost colourless grey at the horizon, the air, already warming beneath the ardent rays of
the sun, clear and pellucid as crystal and as invigorating as champagne with the fresh, clean
smell of the dew-saturated vegetation.  Around on every hand stretched a brilliant, sun-kissed
picture of rugged mountain slopes, scored deeply by the storms of ages; deep kloofs, precipitous
of side, shaggy with their vesture of dense bush, and mysterious with their broad masses of
dark shadow; rolling uplands, dotted here and there with clumps of timber and bush or with
our grazing flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and horses, sweeping gently down toward the
wide-stretching, bush-clad plains, through which wound tiny spruits, like threads of silver,
hurrying to lose themselves in the broader waters of the Great Fish River.

Riding at an easy canter, the track across the veld being a very gentle downward slope all
the way, I overtook the wagon at a distance of about six miles from the house; when, dismounting,
I took my rifle from its slings under the wagon tent, loaded it, slung my powder horn over
my shoulder, slipped a few wads and bullets into my pocket, and then, accompanied by the two
dogs, walked on ahead of the wagon toward our first outspanning place, my horse Prince following
me, as he had been trained to do, with the bridle hanging loose upon his neck.  I had of course
an ample supply of provisions in the wagon, including the shoulder of a sheep that had been
slaughtered that morning; but mutton naturally formed the staple of our fare at Bella Vista
when there was no buck meat in the house, and I was very heartily tired of both.  I was therefore
on the lookout for a pauw or a koraan--the great and small bustards of South Africa--and hoped
to get one in time to have it cooked for my luncheon instead of the shoulder of mutton.  And
presently, when I had got about half a mile ahead of the wagon, I suddenly caught sight of
a fine koraan on the ground about three hundred yards to my right front, as it emerged from
behind a big clump of melkboem, feeding busily.  The bird instantly sighted me and, pausing
but the fraction of a second to look straight at me, took to flight, making the air throb with
its harsh, discordant cry of alarm as it did so.

It was a long shot for my old rifle, which was only sighted up to one hundred yards; but I
had used the piece for six years and knew to a nicety what it would do.  Moreover--I am now
an old man and may therefore perhaps venture to speak the simple truth without being suspected
of boasting--I seem to have been endowed, from my earliest years, with the gift of straight
shooting; it was just a knack, I suppose, but I seemed to be able to judge distances accurately
by intuition, and to allow the correct elevation and windage under the most diversified conditions,
so that I very rarely made use of the sights on my rifle.  Nor did I ever need to aim consciously;
I just flung the weapon to my shoulder, keeping my eye meanwhile upon my mark, pressed the
trigger at precisely the right instant, and--down dropped the quarry: I had in fact by long
practice become a dead shot, and could scarcely remember when I had last failed to bring down
what I aimed at. Nor did I fail now; as the bird rose it flew straight away from me, and it
was still uttering its alarm cry when I pressed the trigger and down it fell, stone-dead, shot
clean through the body.  At the whip-like crack of the rifle the two dogs dashed forward into
the thick clumps of low milk-bush into which the bird had fallen, and presently reappeared,
Thunder dragging the bird along the ground by one of its legs, while Juno romped round him
uttering low, sharp yells of delight, varied by sudden dashes of pretended threat to snatch
the koraan away from him.

CHAPTER TWO.

A TRAGIC HOMECOMING.

In due time our first outspan was reached--a wide vley with a small spruit meandering lazily
through it, and plenty of rich grass for the oxen--and here a halt was called for a couple
of hours during the hottest part of the day; then on again to the next outspan, which was reached
about an hour before sunset.  Here my aversion to mutton again asserted itself; and while the
"boys" watered the oxen, built the camp fire, and generally made preparations for the coming
night, I took my rifle, and, accompanied as usual by the two dogs, and by Piet, carrying my
double-barrelled 12-bore shot gun, I sauntered off in search of something acceptable for supper.

The spot where we had outspanned for the night was the one which I usually chose as the termination
of the second stage of my journey when going to Port Elizabeth.  It was an extensive flat,
dotted here and there with big clumps of bush, and with a wide, shallow depression in the ground,
about a mile distant from the wagon.  Into this the same spruit alongside which we had outspanned
at midday found its way and widened out into a broad, shallow, reed-bordered sheet of water,
much frequented by wild duck, widgeon, and geese, and also the favourite drinking place of
all the game haunting its immediate neighbourhood.  I felt pretty certain, therefore, of getting
a shot at something by ambushing myself among the reeds, and to this spot I accordingly made
my way.  As it happened, we arrived in the very nick of time, for we had scarcely taken up
a position among the reeds, in a situation that enabled me to command a view of a good wide
stretch of water, when I saw a faint smudge against the clear sky southward, which rapidly
resolved itself into a big flight of wild duck heading directly for the end of the pond near
where I was ambushed; and I had only time to pass my rifle to Piet and receive from him the
shot gun in exchange when, with much quacking, the flight wheeled and proceeded to settle down
upon the surface of the water.  As they did so I raised my weapon, and, aiming into the "brown",
pressed both triggers, one immediately after the other, with the result that five of the duck
dropped dead, while another half-dozen fell wounded, the whole being promptly retrieved by
Piet and the dogs, who all dashed into the shallow water and brought them ashore.

Eleven birds constituted an ample supply for our immediate requirements, both for supper that
night and for breakfast next morning; and as I made a point of never destroying the wild things
except as a matter of necessity, we forthwith returned to the wagon and proceeded to pluck
and prepare as many of the duck as we needed for supper, afterward roasting them over the camp
fire.  By the time the meal was ready for consumption the soft, velvet darkness of the South
African starlit night had fallen, and we ate our meal to the accompaniment of the usual night
sounds of the veld where water happens to be near--the soft, subdued quacking of drowsy waterfowl,
the occasional "honk" of a belated goose, the stealthy splashing of bucks wading warily into
the deeper and cleaner water clear of the rushes before venturing to drink, mysterious rustlings
among the reeds, the distant call of buck to each other in the bush, the sharp bark of the
jackal, the blood-curdling laugh of the prowling hyena, and the occasional roar of the leopard;
the whole dominated by the incessant noise of millions of frogs, and the continuous chirr of
many more millions of insects.

I slept that night on the cartel, which is a light hardwood frame, closely strung lengthwise
and across with rimpi, or thin strips of hide, and which, slung to the framework of the interior
of the wagon, under the tent, serves as a bedstead.  Upon this, if furnished with a mattress,
a pillow, and a pair of blankets--as in my own case--it is possible to enjoy a perfect night's
rest.  The next morning we were all astir with the dawn, and while the "boys" prepared breakfast
I made my way down to the spruit, bathed, with the dogs for company, and got back to the wagon
just in good time for the first meal of the day, with an appetite to which a keen edge had
been put by the fresh, clean air of the open veld.  Then, immediately after breakfast, the
oxen were inspanned, and, pushing forward a little more rapidly than on the first day, we forded
the Great Fish River shortly after noon before outspanning for the midday halt.

In this fashion, then, we journeyed, day after day, quietly and uneventfully, toward Port Elizabeth,
where we arrived without mishap during the afternoon of the ninth day after leaving Bella Vista.
Leaving the wagon outspanned on the outskirts of the town, I rode in and called in the first
instance upon a certain Mr Henderson, who was a friend of ours, and from him received, as I
fully expected, a very cordial invitation to make his house my home during the period of my
sojourn in the town.  The following day was a busy day with me, for I had a great many commissions
to execute; but by arranging them systematically I contrived to wipe the whole of them off
my list before the stores closed, including even the purchase of the new rifle which I had
promised myself.  This was a very expensive but beautiful weapon, very light compared with
my old rifle, for it weighed, all complete and including the shoulder strap, less than six
pounds.  It had a plain blue cylindrical barrel, gauged to take a half-inch spherical bullet
with three drachms of powder, was fitted with a nipple for percussion caps, and provided with
a fixed sight for a range of one hundred yards and two flap sights for two hundred and five
hundred yards respectively, the latter being regarded in those days as an exceptionally long
range. Also, with a normal pull upon the trigger of six ounces, it was fitted with an ingenious
arrangement which, by pressing a small lever, converted this into a hair trigger.  Lastly,
it bore the name of a certain famous London maker, which alone was a guarantee of its excellence.
The storekeeper from whom I bought it had other guns by the same maker, and he finally tempted
me to buy a very beautiful double-barrel sporting gun as a present for my father, the right
hand barrel being a Number 12 smooth-bore, while the left barrel was rifled, this piece also
being fitted for use with percussion caps.

The next day, which was the eleventh day from that of my departure from Bella Vista, immediately
after breakfast I rode out to the wagon, gave orders to inspan, and accompanied it into the
town, where, having unloaded my hides and horns, which I had disposed of at a very good price,
I proceeded to load up the powder, lead, and other things that I had been charged to procure,
and left Port Elizabeth again on my return journey about mid-afternoon, trekking a distance
of ten miles on my homeward way before outspanning for the night.

Of course I was all on fire for an opportunity to try my new rifle, and the chance came that
same afternoon.  For when about six miles out from Port Elizabeth, I met a Boer who was trekking
in from Uitenhage, and who informed me that, about a mile back, he had been obliged to abandon
one of his oxen in a dying condition; and, sure enough, a quarter of an hour later we saw the
poor beast lying by the side of the road, with the aasvogels, or vultures, already gathered
about it.  A round dozen or more were squatted on the ground in a circle round the dying ox,
while others, mere specks in the deep--blue sky, were winging their way to it from all quarters.
The method of these new arrivals was to maintain their lofty flight until they arrived immediately
above their destined prey; then they would begin to circle slowly downward in a wide spiral,
finally hovering for some three or four seconds at a height of about twenty yards before awkwardly
settling upon the ground.  This was my chance; an aasvogel more or less in South Africa mattered
nothing, there were plenty of them and to spare, and they were such disgusting creatures that
I had no compunction at all about abandoning my usual rule, and shooting one or two of them
merely in order to test my new weapon.  And a very good test they afforded too, for although
their downward sailing upon outstretched, motionless wings was a perfectly steady movement,
it was rather deceptive as to speed, and, the movement being a circling one, it was necessary
to fire at exactly the right instant, or the range would be wrong and a miss would result.

I decided to begin the test by firing at a descending vulture at what was supposed to be the
extreme range of accuracy of the weapon, namely, five hundred yards; and as this was a good
long distance--quite far enough to enable the bird to swerve at the flash and so cause me to
miss--I came to the conclusion that the right thing to do would be to allow the vulture to
sweep past until it was flying away from me, and then pull the trigger.  Accordingly I loaded
the piece, threw up the five-hundred-yard sight, and then walked forward, choosing a particular
bird as I did so, and following it with my eye until I judged it to be at the right distance
and position; then I flung up the rifle, pressed it firmly to my shoulder, covered the vulture
with the sights, and fired.  The next second I saw the feathers fly, the great wings flapped
once, convulsively, and as the "smack" of the bullet reached my ears the bird turned a complete
somersault in the air and fell to the ground stone-dead, to the accompaniment of loud shouts
of wonder and admiration from my Totties.

Needless to say, I was vastly proud of my achievement, for it was far and away the longest
shot that I had ever attempted.  But instead of being satisfied with my success, I must needs
attempt something still more difficult.  Flapping down the back sight, and entirely dispensing
with its use, I reloaded the weapon and determined to rely upon my eye and my judgment alone,
or, in other words, upon that faculty which, by constant use, had become a sort of instinct
with me.  Accordingly I selected as a mark another vulture which had been in the act of descending,
but which, apparently alarmed at the unusual manner in which its predecessor had accomplished
the last part of its descent, was now wheeling slowly round at a height of, as I estimated,
fully eight hundred yards above the earth.  Training my rifle upon it, I followed the movements
of the bird until it had wheeled away from me, when, carefully judging the amount of elevation
required, I pressed the trigger, and was delighted the next moment again to see the feathers
fly, to note the convulsive stroke of the great pinions which indicated a hit, and to see the
ponderous bulk of the bird come hurtling earthward.  It was a magnificent shot--I felt that
I was justified in admitting that much to myself--and it satisfied me that, even now, at the
beginning of my acquaintance with my new rifle, I was as much master of it as I was of my old
one, and could rely upon it as implicitly.  I felt that I had no need to test its capabilities
further; but I once more loaded it and, walking to where the dying ox was lying, with the circle
of vultures closing in around it, put the foul birds to flight, with many a croak of protest
from them at my interference, placed the muzzle of the weapon at the ear of the ox, pulled
the trigger, and put the poor beast out of its misery, besides saving it from the possibility
of attack by the ravenous birds before the breath had entirely left its body.  Three miles
farther on we outspanned for the night.

The return journey--until its last stage--was as uneventful as the outward one had been.  For
the first three days we met, on an average, half a dozen wagons a day, trekking to Port Elizabeth
from various farms in the outlying districts; but after that they became less numerous, and
after the fifth day we met no more, nor did I call at any farms--which, at that length from
the Bay, were few and far between--although we occasionally sighted one in the distance to
the right or left of the track we were following.

On the twentieth day after my departure from Bella Vista, about an hour after we had inspanned
for the day's trek, which was to end with our arrival home shortly before sunset, as we topped
a slight rise the kopje or hill upon which the house stood swung into view for the first time
since I had lost sight of it some three weeks earlier; but it was still at such a distance
that, with the house turning its shadowed face to me, I could not distinguish it with the naked
eye, and it happened that upon that particular occasion I had forgotten to put into the voorkissie,
or wagon chest, upon which the driver generally sits, the telescope that I usually carried
with me upon such excursions.  Nevertheless I knew that my people would be expecting my return
on that day; therefore, when we outspanned about midday, instead of lighting only one fire,
for the purpose of cooking our midday meal, I caused three to be lighted, at a distance of
about one hundred feet apart, which was my usual method of advertising my impending arrival,
feeling sure that somebody about the house would be on the lookout, and would see the three
sparks of flame and columns of smoke, we being by that time within some ten miles of the place.
At this distance I was generally able, in clear weather, to distinguish the long, white front
wall of the house standing out against the purple shadows of the Great Winter Berg range, but
on this occasion I could not, although the day was as fine and the air as clear as usual at
that time of the year.  Yet, strangely enough, the circumstance did not strike me as being
in the least peculiar or significant, although Piet, my after-rider, made some passing reference
to it.  Later on in the afternoon, however, when we had again inspanned, and had been trekking
for about an hour, it began to dawn upon me that things were not quite as usual at Bella Vista.
In the first place, of all our flocks and herds which should have been grazing somewhere on
the plain or the foothills ahead, not a horn or a hoof was to be seen.  Also, the house looked
different: it had the appearance of being not as high as usual; I could not see the grey thatch
of its roof; and the walls, instead of being pure white, as they had been when I last saw them,
were white only in comparatively small patches, the remainder being brown, and in some places
black!

By the time we had approached close enough to distinguish as much as that, we all came to the
conclusion that we knew what had happened; and I saddled and mounted my horse and, followed
as usual by the two dogs, rode forward at a hand gallop to investigate.  There had undoubtedly
been a conflagration, which had destroyed the house; and my father and mother, with the house
"boys", had in all probability gone over to Triannon, whither, no doubt, the stock had also
been driven.  Still, I thought it rather strange that they had not dispatched a "boy" to meet
me and explain what had happened, and whither they had gone, or at least left one about the
place to afford me full information on my arrival.  I finally concluded that they had done
the latter, and that the lazy rascal was in his hut fast asleep, instead of keeping a watch
for me, as he ought to have been doing.  This last thought caused me to look particularly for
the huts, and then I understood another thing that had been puzzling me: the huts no longer
existed!

Seriously alarmed now--for the destruction of the house by fire by no means necessarily involved
the destruction of the huts, which had stood about a quarter of a mile from the former--I pressed
my heels into Prince's flanks and urged him up the rise at his best speed, fears--born of Lestrange's
news on that night when he had ridden over to borrow ammunition--at last gripping my heart
lest what he had then apprehended as just a very remote possibility might have actually come
to pass.  And as I at length drew near enough to observe that the massive gate in the high
fence which surrounded our extensive garden was off its hinges and lying flat on the ground
just inside the opening, those fears increased, and were still further strengthened when, as
I rode through the opening, a whiff of tainted air like the odour of carrion reached my nostrils.
Then, as I glanced about me, with eyes prepared to behold I knew not what of horror, I perceived
that many of the ornamental flowering shrubs on either side of the path leading to the house
were beaten down and withered, as though stampeding cattle--or a host of men--had swept over
them; while far up the pathway, and even upon the stoep of the house itself, a multitude of
aasvogels were squatted motionless, apparently gorged, while others were waddling slowly and
heavily to and fro.  Half a dozen paces farther on Prince suddenly shied so violently that
he almost unseated me, as a loud flapping of wings and a great croaking arose on my right,
and some fifteen of the obscene birds rose heavily into the air and winged their way a hundred
yards or so farther up the garden before again settling.

The pathway was bordered, from the house to the gateway, with a hedge of flowering shrubs,
backed on either side by rows of peach trees; and it was impossible for me to see from the
path what lay beyond those peach trees.  I therefore dismounted, and, throwing the reins to
the ground, so that Prince might not walk away to the stable, forced my way through the hedge
and the rows of peach trees into the more open part of the garden; and there I beheld what
I was by this time fully prepared to see, but what was nevertheless a sight revolting beyond
all possibility of description.  I will not enter into unnecessary details, but will simply
say that scattered about here and there all over that part of the garden lay the disfigured
remains of some sixty or seventy Tembu warriors--they were easily identifiable by the shape
of their shields and spears and the general character of their war equipment--who had evidently
been shot down during a most determined and pertinacious attack upon the house.  The other
half of the front portion of the garden presented a similar sight, the whole bearing mute but
indubitable testimony not only to the implacable determination of the savages but also to the
resolution of the defenders.  Yes, the worst had happened: the house had been attacked and
finally destroyed, notwithstanding the desperate nature of the defence put up by its inmates;
and now--my mother and father, and good old Jack Nesbitt, where were they?

To discover the answer to this momentous question was my next task, and how shall I find words
to describe the passion of grief and apprehension with which I set about it?  It must go undescribed,
for there are certain emotions of the human heart and mind which mere words are powerless to
portray.  Perhaps it is well that this should be the case, for no one who has not passed through
such an experience as mine could possibly understand what I endured as I made my slow way toward
the ruined house, subconsciously noting, as I went, the evidences which met me on every hand
of the protracted, stubborn implacability of the attack, and the resolute, unyielding character
of the defence.  The savages had indeed succeeded, but at what a cost!  As I made my way up
through that shambles of a wrecked garden I acquired a new impression of the invincible courage
of the South African native which I have never since had occasion to modify.

In the face of such evidence of deadly resolution on the part of the combatants on both sides
as I beheld all round me, I felt that it was hopeless to dream of the possibility that the
inmates of the house had made good their escape at the last moment, for clearly the building
had been completely surrounded, and the attack simultaneously delivered on all sides.  The
question was, had they finally met death on the points of the enemy's spears, or had they fallen
alive into that enemy's hands? I shuddered with greater horror than ever as the latter possibility
occurred to me, for I had not lived nearly sixteen years in South Africa without hearing something
of the unspeakable barbarities inflicted by the savages upon those unhappy beings who chanced
to be taken alive in battle by them.  Better a thousand times--ay, ten thousand times--that
my dear ones should perish quickly in the heat and excitement of the fight than that they should
survive to be carried off to suffer--!  I put the thought from me, for I felt that I should
go mad if I permitted my mind to dwell upon it.

Yet it thrust itself persistently upon me again and again as I approached the smoke-blackened
walls of the ruined building and gazed with horrified eyes at the constantly accumulating evidences
of the desperate character of the attack and defence.  I believed I could pretty accurately
picture what had happened.  My father had evidently not been taken entirely by surprise, or
there would not have been so many dead savages lying around the house: he had probably obtained
an inkling of what was toward in time to put the building into some sort of state of defence;
possibly he had found time to barricade the doors and windows, and from the general aspect
of things outside I surmised that he had somehow contrived to get half a dozen or more of the
Totties into the house to assist in its defence.

The attack had probably occurred about two or three o'clock in the morning, when the whites
might be expected to be sound asleep, and from the appearance of the slain I believed that
it had taken place about thirty-six hours before my arrival on the scene.  In any case the
attack was unwisely planned, from the native point of view, for it was about the time of full
moon, and the South African night, with a full moon riding high in the sky, is almost literally
as light as day, and the defenders, being doubtless on the qui vive, would perceive the first
stealthy approach of the savages and at once open fire upon them.  And I knew enough about
my father's and Nesbitt's marksmanship to feel assured that every time they pressed a trigger
an enemy would fall.  But even their deadly skill with the rifle would not account for the
many bodies lying round the house, and thus I was brought to the conclusion that some of the
Totties, armed with shot guns loaded with loopers, or slugs, must have assisted in the defence.
Time after time the enemy must have charged toward the house, and time after time must they
have been driven back from those stout stone walls and barricaded doors and windows by the
withering volleys of lead poured into them at close range.  But the weak point of Bella Vista
was its thatched roof, which was the universal form of covering to every farmhouse at that
day, on account of its coolness.  It was, however, easily capable of being set fire to, and
in all probability the Kafirs, after being several times repulsed, had made a concerted rush,
in the course of which they had succeeded in hurling several spears, with bunches of burning
grass attached to them, into the thatch, where they had remained, setting the roof on fire.
Then, as the house was only a one-storey building, it would quickly fill with smoke, and the
inmates would be faced with the alternatives of suffocating, being burnt to death beneath the
blazing roof when it should fall in, or yielding themselves to the tender mercies of the ferocious
Tembu.  I thought I knew which of the alternatives my father would choose, provided, of course,
that he survived long enough to avail himself of the choice; but did he?  That was the question,
and--merciful heaven! if he did not, what had become of my mother?

Frenzied at the thought of what her fate might be if she had fallen alive into the hands of
the savages, I dashed up the front steps to the stoep, clubbing my rifle and striking out right
and left at the gorged aasvogels congregated there, which seemed disposed to resent my intrusion.
And as I mounted to the top step I at once perceived that I had now arrived at the spot where
the fight had raged most fiercely and stubbornly, for the ornamental guard rail and one of
the veranda posts were broken-down, the climbing roses which had been trained to screen the
railing were crushed and trodden into the earth, and the whole stoep was choked with the bodies
of Tembu warriors who had evidently met death in a desperate attempt to force their way into
the house through the barricaded doors and windows. 

Were we watchful and took advantage of these seasons to tell them of God and heaven we would be
workers together with him, and he would reward us by faithful children. The communication
of the Spirit with the hearts of children is more wonderful and frequent than we may sometimes
understand. A lady recently told us that her parents never taught her to pray, but very early
in life she was inclined by the Holy Spirit to kneel at her bedside and pray when unobserved.

Who
is the reader that can not remember instances in his early life when he felt the influence
of some good spirit and had thoughts of God? Had he in those tender childhood days been rightly
instructed he could have been led into the beautiful walks of a Christian life. We remember a
child of less than ten years of age, who, hearing his father using bad language, fell upon his
knees and clasping his arms around his father told him of his sin and besought him to pray
for forgiveness.

A lady writer in one of her excellent works (“Mothers’ Counsel to Their Sons”), records the
instance of a little girl of four and a half years who felt the guilt of sin, and by her Christian
mother was led to Jesus, and there she was blessed by him, even to the witnessing of his Spirit
that her sins were gone and she was his child. The child was at one time moved to plead with
an unsaved relative to come to Jesus. She lived triumphant in the sweetness of redeeming grace
until the age of fifteen, when her mission on earth was ended and
she went to her home in heaven.

Oh, how glorious! What if that mother, when this child came expressing her sense of guilt, had not instructed
her in the ways of salvation? In all probability it would have resulted in a lost soul.

When our children are brought into a Christian experience the victory is only partly won; life
lies before them with its temptations. Many are the allurements to turn those young feet into
worldly paths. We have witnessed the bright, happy conversion of many children. We have seen
their countenances beaming with the light and joy of Christian love
and heard their voices ring with spiritual praise, only to soon yield
to the influence of the world and lose that sincere devotion to God.

This is not the inevitable course, thank God, but it is the course of many. To teach our children
the fear of God and enable them to retain in their hearts a deep reverence and devotion to him
has been a subject of much prayer with us. We find the Christian life is a warfare. There are
temptations to be resisted, there are watchings and prayings, there must be a constant looking
upward to God for his aid and direction.

One trouble with many parents has been that as soon as their children were converted they seemed
to think the battle was over and the victory was won, when really the battle was only begun.
The first thing necessary in keeping our budding “olive plants” in deep spirituality is to
keep very spiritual ourselves. Now whatever means are necessary to promote a growth of spirituality
in our hearts, the same means are necessary to develop and deepen the spiritual life of our
children. A habitual effort to cultivate a deeper sense of the divine presence is necessary and
one of the most beautiful employments of the sanctified heart. Those reverential feelings toward
God must daily become stronger. Those inmost affections of the soul must reach out with greater
yearnings and deeper longings toward the Holy One. A benevolent regard in our hearts for our
fellow men must become stronger and more true. O beloved, if you would have your child to
grow up into a beautiful Christian character you must teach him to suppress every selfish feeling,
to banish every idle, careless thought, and to resist all temptations to envy or impatience. The
purest of meditations must be entertained. We and they must be strictly disciplined by the sacred
Scriptures, “Watch and pray.” Spiritual prayer unfolds the life into
the beautiful life of God as the bud unfolds into the blooming rose.

A Christian Home.

Nowhere is Christianity more effectual and more beautiful than in the home life. Nowhere is
the power of divine love so truly manifested as in a sincere Christian home. We will set a
picture before you. A father and mother with their children are grouped together for the evening
worship. The father out of the deep affections of his soul, in spiritual tones, speaks of God
and his holy commandment. A tear of gratitude and joy is glistening
in the mother’s affectionate eye.

The children’s faces are beaming with admiration as they hear extolled the character of Christ. They
kneel in prayer; a holy awe and sacredness rests upon the scene; their prayers arise as sweet
incense into the nostrils of God and delight his great heart.

Such a scene as we have pictured only fitly represents a true Christian home. The father is
all tenderness and love to his wife and children. He is kind and sympathetic. He regards his
wife as the weaker vessel and is mindful of her happiness. The wife deeply reverences her husband.
Affection and appreciation sparkle in her eye. To attend to the husband’s wishes is her delight.
They love their children and in gentleness are bringing them up in the nurture and admonition of the
Lord. The children love each other and are kind and self-denying. They obey their parents through
love. Alas! such a family is rarely found upon this sin-cursed earth. But such is taught and commanded
in the Bible, and it is possible.

If a father and mother and children lived toward each other just as the Bible says they should
live, we would have a scene that would fitly represent heaven. It is our privilege to have just
such a home. “Ask, and it shall be given you.” A happy home life is the most blessed life
on earth. 128:3.

Duty Of Children To Parents.

It was the original design of God that children should be a blessing to their parents. “My son,
be wise, and make my heart glad.” Prov. 27:11. Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and
she that bare thee shall rejoice.” Prov. 23:24, 25. “A wise son maketh a glad father.” Prov. 15:20.

You
will observe, children, in each of the above texts that it is wisdom in a child that makes parents
rejoice. Then you should “seek wisdom, seek understanding.” “Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore
get wisdom.” Prov. 4:7. What is wisdom? “The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.” The highest
honor a child can pay to a true parent is to honor and obey God: “And shalt return unto the Lord
thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all I command thee this day, thou and thy children,
with all thine heart and with all thy soul.” Deut. 30:2. 12:1.

The duty of children is to fear their parents: “Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father.”
Lev. 19:3. 20:12. This, it is true, is an old-time commandment, but the spirit or principle
of it is carried into the dispensation of the gospel. “Honor thy father and mother.” Eph. 6:2.

Children
should attend to the faithful instruction of their parents: “My son, hear the instruction of thy father,
and forsake not the law of thy mother; for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy heart,
and chains about thy neck.” Prov. 1:8, 9. “Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father.” Prov.
4:1. 6:20. “Children, obey your parents in the Lord; for this is right.” If it is right to obey,
it is wrong to disobey. Many children do not have a due regard for the instruction of the father
and mother. They oftentimes think they know more than their parents and so follow their own ways
without natural affection.

Children should imitate the example of righteous parents, but are commanded not to walk in the footsteps
of the unholy: “But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes
of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves
with their idols.” Ezek.

20:18.

One important duty of children is to care for the parents. If the parents become old and feeble,
or the mother a widow, the Word of God places children under the obligation of caring for them.
“But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and
to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.”

Duties Of Masters To Servants. 6:9.

In our land the days of slavery are no more, but men and women have their hired man and maid
servant. Their duty toward such servants is to treat them with kindness, not to threaten them, or
treat them in an overbearing, authoritative manner because they are servants. Be as kind and mild and
respectful to them as to the children of the rich, for God is no respecter of persons.

Masters should give unto their servants that which is just and right for their labor done. If a man’s
labor is well worth two dollars per day, but because he is needy
(or for any cause) and must work at any price, you take advantage
of him and give him but one dollar, you are a dim light in the world.

In truth your light has gone out, and your deeds have become darkness. “Knowing that ye also
have a Master in heaven,” are contained also in Eph. 6:9, where masters are commanded to forbear
threatening. They are intended to impress the master with his obligation of dealing with his
servants in the fear of God, before whom he must some day appear and give an account for the
deeds done in the body, or in this life. 5:4.

Duty Of Servants To Their Masters. 6:1. 6:2. 6:5. The servant’s service to his master should not be
wholly for the hire. He should not fear to do him ill service because of not receiving his wages,
but his service should be in singleness of heart—an honest, upright purpose—as unto Christ.

They should seek to please their masters: “Exhort servants to be obedient
unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things.” Titus
2:9.

They are to be subject to them: “Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear: not only
to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.” 1 Pet. 2:18. Servants are to do good service and not
defraud their masters, and thus adorn the doctrine of God. The word “purloin” is from the Greek
word “nosphizomai,” and means “to hide or to secrete, to steal.”
In this text it would include the idling away of time that belonged
to the master.

We believe we have done justice to the subject of “Domestic Relationship.” In conclusion we
would be pleased to set before you a picture, not to be excelled in sublimity, sacredness,
elevation of character, or soul inspiration by anything on earth.

128:2, 3. This picture is set in a beautiful frame, found in the preceding verse and the one
following, “Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord; that walketh in his ways.” Ver. 1.
“Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord.” Ver. 4. The picture of a happy
Christian man, a loving wife, devoted children, embossed with the blessings and glory of God,
is one of greatest admiration.

Chapter XIV. Evil Habits And Injurious Indulgences.

The Word of the Lord may not denominate in plain terms every particular sin and evil practise
man may engage in; however there are general terms and principles of righteousness that prohibit
and condemn every possible sinful act man may perform. The words card-parties, picnics, fairs,
shows and theaters are not found in the writings of the apostles; however indulgence in these
is “revelry,” “living in pleasure,” “rioting” and worldliness, of
which the Scriptures say the participants do not love God and can
never enter heaven.

Also the terms “whisky,” “alcohol,” “opium,” “morphine,” “tobacco,” “tea,” and “coffee,” “secret
vice,” etc., are not made use of by the New Testament writers. They are included, however, in
the general term “lust of the flesh.” To make mention of all the things that may be done as
a lust of the flesh would make a lengthy catalogue indeed. Anything, no matter what it may be,
if done to satisfy the lust of the flesh is very damaging to spiritual life. 2:11. “This I say
then, walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. “For if ye live after
the flesh ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye
shall live.” Rom. 8:13.

By these tests we plainly understand the “flesh” to be antagonistical to the Spirit. God has
created us with a fleshly nature, or made us a fleshly being. He has also created things for
the sustenance of this fleshly life. He has created food and drink for man’s use. A proper use
of these is not a lust of the flesh. An improper use may be considered lust. Our eating and
drinking should be to the glory of God. The primary object in our eating should be to sustain life
and promote health and strength, that we may be able to labor for and glorify God.

If we have a pure and undefiled conscience and are conscientious before God, and fully comprehend that
we are not our own, but that we are God’s property and that we should glorify him in our body
and our spirit, we then most certainly would eat and drink such things to the extent of our
knowledge as are most conducive to development of physical energy, and mental activity. It
is not a lust of the flesh if we eat and drink to the glory of God. Temperance in natural God-given
food and drink is the law of Heaven. It is of surfeiting that the Son of God warns us to beware.
Luke 21:34. There are a great many things in creation which God never designed for the use of
man as food and drink. Temperance does not mean a moderate use of these things. Their use is
wholly forbidden.

Again man may by certain processes change the natural into an unnatural and make it in opposition
to God’s law. Because man has not always had the glory of God as his object in eating, drinking,
and clothing, but became intemperate in the things which he allows, many have through the lust
of the flesh been led to indulge in things from which the Word of God and the laws of health
demand total abstinence. The injurious indulgences are so many and various as to furnish subject
enough for volumes. We can only mention briefly the ones that are most generally indulged
in, and which are destroying soul and body.

Alcohols.

All whiskies, rums, brandies, and fermented wines contain a certain amount of alcohol. It consists
of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen, and is a powerful antiseptic. It is the intoxicating ingredient found
in distilled liquors. An appetite for spirituous liquors is unnatural. It is true this appetite
may be inherited, but because the child apparently takes naturally to these strong drinks is no proof
they are a natural drink.

The word alcohol is not used by any of the writers of the New Testament. Paul speaks of wine and
says that the bishop must be a man “not given to wine” (1 Tim. 3:3; Titus 1:7), and of the deacon,
“not given to much wine.” Ver. 8. To the church at Ephesus he says, “Be not drunk with wine,
wherein is excess: but be filled with the Spirit.” Eph. 5:18.

He recommends wine to Timothy: “Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s
sake and thine often infirmities.” 1 Tim. 5:23. There is nothing in this text for the consolation
of the wine-bibber. The professed follower of Christ who loves to sip the wine-cup, and by this
text persuades himself to believe he is not violating God’s law, wrests it to his own hurt. That
Timothy had some stomach trouble is very evident from this text. We are not ready to admit
that it was fermented wine Paul advised him to use. It often happens that water, especially
if it is not pure, will distress a diseased stomach. This wine was recommended as a hygienic law.
When an individual is troubled with constipation he will find bread
made from unbolted wheat flour to be much more healthful for him than
bread made from fine white flour.

We would not advise the use of this merely as a luxury, nor as a medicine, but as a common-sense
law of health. The juice of the grape contains a considerable portion of water, so much that
one can get all the water the system requires and not drink the sweet juice to an excess. From
the text it is natural to conclude that water was hurtful to Timothy, since he is advised to
drink no longer water.

In cities and certain countries travelers often find the water disagreeable and unhealthful to them.
It would be wisdom to use unfermented wine, or boil the water and add the juice of a lemon or
some fruit to make it palatable. It would be very unwise for us on such an occasion to justify
ourselves in the use of narcotic and fermented drinks. They are as injurious to the stomach as impure
water, and were we compelled to drink either, we would feel more in God’s order to trust him
to counteract the poison in the water rather than the poison of fermented wines and narcotic
teas and coffees.

The drinking in moderation or “not to excess” of unfermented wine is healthful, and in harmony
with divine laws: but total abstinence from spirituous liquors is the command of God. While alcohol,
whisky, and brandy are words not used in the New Testament their use is none the less objectionable
and sinful. The reader will only have to refer to any authentic medical or hygienic work to
learn of the injurious effects of alcohol upon the human system.

“Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.” Prov.
20:1. Look not thou on the wine when it is red, when it giveth his color in the cup, when it moveth
itself aright [is fermented].

At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.” Prov. 23:29-32.

We would say again that in all things God has given us to sustain life and make us healthful,
comfortable and happy he would have us to be temperate and “keep
our body in subjection.” But there are some things which he would
have us “touch not, taste not; handle not.” Col. 2:21.

Tobacco.

Very
few people especially among the religious class, are not willing to
admit that drunken debauchery and carousal is altogether outside the
realms of Christianity, and can only be engaged in by those wholly
devoid of the love and grace of God. It is however a source of astonishment
to the pure-hearted child of God to find so many professing Christ,
yet unwilling to admit that tobacco using is a lust of the flesh.
Oftentimes when speaking to a man concerning the tobacco habit, he
will say, The word tobacco is not mentioned in the Bible. This is
true. As we have before said, the word alcohol is not found in the
Scriptures, but its effects upon the human system are mentioned, and
no one can thus affect his body without placing his soul in great
danger.

Tobacco is not mentioned in the Scripture, but its effects
are, and we are positively commanded to remedy such effects. One effect
of tobacco using is “filthiness,” from which we are commanded to cleanse
ourselves. But few people are not ready to admit that using tobacco
is a filthy habit. Then since the Word of God condemns filthiness,
the tobacco habit stands condemned. It is indeed a sin-seared and
tobacco-stunned conscience that denies the use of tobacco being a
lust of the flesh. It can be nothing else but a fleshly lust. How
frequently the lust of the flesh is condemned in the Holy Scriptures.
It wars against the soul. It is enmity against God. It lusteth against
the Spirit.

Dear reader, will you listen to reason and truth? We
are aware how difficult it is for man to see and acknowledge the truth
when some cherished idol stands between him and the truth. It is not
a difficult thing to help him to comprehend the sinfulness of some
evil thing which his heart is not set upon, but he is blinded to any
sin in the cherished object of his affections.

Recently there were
in a meeting two middle aged ladies. One of them was fashionably dressed,
while the other was uncommonly plain in her apparel. The lady in the
plain dress was addicted to the habit of using snuff. The lady in
the fashionable dress abhorred such a filthy practise. When the Word
of God was read on the comeliness and plainness of female attire,
the lady in the plain dress smiled and nodded assent. The lady whose
heart was set on costly apparel, expressed a rejection of God’s Word
in her countenance and manner. In the discourse the subject was changed
from the wearing of gay clothing to the practise of tobacco using.
When the habit of using snuff was mentioned the plain lady’s smile
was turned to a sneer, and the fashionable lady’s sneer was turned
to a smile. Afterwards in conversation the fashionable lady said she
believed it was a sin to use snuff, but she could not see any evil
in wearing gay and fine clothing. The plain lady said she thought
it was a sin to wear such plumed hats and beaded dresses, but she
could see no harm in using snuff.  And when I had done all that was possible the wagon
was inspanned, and with a heavy heart I wended my way, accompanied by my little following,
to Somerset East, where I arrived late in the afternoon of the following day without having
encountered anything of an untoward character on my way.  There was but one farm between Bella
Vista and Somerset East, situate about halfway between the latter and the Great Fish River,
and when in the course of my journey the house came in sight, I jumped on Prince's back and
galloped forward, with the view of ascertaining what, if anything, had happened there.  But
upon my arrival I found the farm silent and deserted, with not so much as a dog about the place.
The house, however, was undamaged, all the doors and windows were fastened, and upon looking
through the latter I perceived that the rooms were empty of furniture; I therefore concluded--which
afterwards proved to be the case--that the owner had obtained timely warning of the rising,
had hurriedly packed all his belongings into wagons, and, driving his stock before him, had
hastily retired to Somerset East.

The town of Somerset East was in a terrible commotion when I reached it, some fifty fugitive
families from the outlying districts, with their stock and belongings, having already taken
shelter there, while others were hourly arriving; and every man had a story to tell of some
farm that had been attacked, its inhabitants murdered, and its stock driven off.  Something
very nearly approaching to a state of panic prevailed, for the town at that time contained
only some three hundred inhabitants, of whom three-quarters were women and children; moreover,
it lay quite open and unprotected on every side, and might easily be rushed by a sufficiently
strong body of the enemy.  But there were a few cool heads among those congregated in the town,
one notable being a certain Major Henderson, who, like my father, had held a post in the British
army, and who at once naturally came to the front and took the lead in preparing the place
to meet successfully a possible attack.

A laager, consisting of wagons interlocked, was constructed at each end of the single street
that then ran through the town; the inner ends of the narrow lanes giving off the main street
were securely barricaded, thus forming a number of culs-de-sac in which, if the attacking savages
dared to venture there, they would be swept out of existence by the defenders behind the barricades;
and every back door and window of every house accessible from the veld was strongly protected
by heavy timber and loopholed for rifle fire: thus when Henderson's scheme of defence was complete
the town presented a very tough nut to crack for an enemy without artillery or firearms.  The
greatest difficulty, it appeared, was the shortness of ammunition, consequently my arrival
with a wagon-load of the commodity was regarded as scarcely less than a special interposition
of Providence.  Then the male inhabitants voluntarily placed themselves under martial law,
under Henderson's command, taking it in turns to perform sentry-go day and night; while the
best mounted among us undertook to act as scouts, riding forth from the town daily in various
directions in quest of news of the enemy, and returning in the evening with such intelligence
as we had been able to gain.  This daily scouting service proved to be of the utmost value,
for in the first place it prevented the possibility of a surprise attack, and so enabled the
stock congregated in the town to be daily driven forth to graze and water; and it also was
the means whereby in the course of a few days we were able to gather something like a clear
general idea of what had happened and was still happening in the colony.

Thus it soon transpired that, in the eastern provinces, an imaginary line drawn from the mouth
of the Great Kei River through Triannon and Bella Vista, and thence northward along the meridian
of 26 degrees east longitude to the Zour Bergen, represented the southern limit of the savages'
depredations; while beyond the Zour Bergen, to the north and west, we were unable to learn
anything definite.  On the fifth day after my arrival in Somerset East a detachment consisting
of two companies of infantry, accompanied by baggage and ammunition wagons, under the command
of a Captain Fletcher, arrived from Port Elizabeth, and encamped within half a mile of the
town in an excellent strategic position, which they at once proceeded to entrench strongly;
and there they remained nearly a week, awaiting instructions from their general, who was preparing
a plan of campaign while moving toward the centre of disturbance the few troops at his disposal,
and collecting information.

During the week that followed the arrival of the troops we received intelligence of several
attacks upon isolated farms, and even small villages, in the outlying and more sparsely populated
districts; from which it speedily became apparent that the regular troops, consisting, as they
did, entirely of infantry, and hampered, as they were, by their baggage wagons, were altogether
too slow-moving to be effective in overtaking and bringing to action the nimble bodies of savages,
who were encumbered with no impedimenta of any description whatsoever excepting their weapons--a
shield, knobkerrie, and sheaf of assagais; who slept under the stars, quenched their thirst
at every stream or runlet that crossed their path, and eat whatever came to hand, whether it
chanced to be buck, bullock, or green mealies.

Therefore it seemed, upon careful consideration of the situation, that if the ravages of the
blacks were to be stopped there was only one course to be pursued, and that was to dispatch
against them a force of irregular cavalry composed of farmers, hunters, transport riders, and
others, men who had lived long enough in the country to become inured to the climate and accustomed
to the methods of travel in it, who could move as independently of impedimenta as the savages
themselves, and, being mounted, as swiftly, and who, being provided with firearms, might hope
to cope successfully with a foe considerably stronger in point of numbers than themselves.
And there were plenty of such men to be had-- farmers who had fled from their farms to the
towns and villages upon the first news of the outbreak, transport riders whose occupation had
ceased upon the outbreak of hostilities, hunters who were in like case with the transport riders,
and a few who, like myself, had lost everything but life itself at the hands of the savages;
and we speedily banded ourselves into troops, in some cases numbering not more than twenty
or thirty, in others amounting to a hundred or more, each band under its own elected leader
and subordinate officers.  The corps to which I attached myself--and which dubbed itself the
Somerset East Mounted Rifles--consisted of one hundred and seven men under the command of Major
Henderson, divided into two troops of fifty men each--the right troop under the command of
"Captain" Henry Jackson, and the left troop under the command of "Captain" Pieter Van Rhyn,
with a sergeant in command of each of the two squadrons which composed a troop.

Each man provided his own horse, weapons, and ammunition; we were not in uniform, and were
volunteers in the strictest sense of the word, for we drew no pay, and acknowledged allegiance
to no man save our own officers, although it was of course fully understood by everybody that
we were always to be ready to co-operate with and support the regular troops in the event of
our encountering any.  This, however, was exceedingly unlikely, at least in the earlier stages
of the campaign, for so lightly equipped were we that we could perform forty-mile marches day
after day with ease, and were confident that we could not only get into touch with, but could
also reduce the enemy to subjection, long before the regulars could arrive at the scene of
hostilities.  And although we did not substantiate our boast or achieve our ambition in its
entirety, I think I am justified in claiming that the honours of the campaign fell chiefly
to the various bodies of irregulars who so self-sacrificingly took the field on that occasion;
for it was we, and not the regulars, who followed up and hunted down so relentlessly the marauding
bands of savages who swept the colony like a storm wave, causing such a loss of life and property
as it took the colonists the best part of a generation to recover from.

It is not my purpose to write a history of the Kafir War of the year 1835, for that has already
been done by far abler hands than mine, and with a fullness of detail which leaves nothing
to be desired; moreover, I have another and entirely different, although, as I think, equally
stirring story to tell.  I will therefore dismiss the events connected with my service in the
ranks of the Somerset East Mounted Rifles with the bare statement that during the nine months
so covered I participated in many deeply stirring episodes, and on several occasions found
myself involved in situations so desperate that nothing save the steadfastness and invincible
courage of every man present saved us from absolute annihilation.  It is not to be supposed
that a mere handful of men composed of burghers and farmers, with practically no knowledge
of military science, and quite unaccustomed to anything in the nature of military discipline,
could pass through so trying an ordeal as that which we cheerfully faced without suffering
heavy loss; and, as a matter of fact, by the time that the campaign was so far over that the
regular troops were able to cope with the situation, and the Government had therefore no further
need of our services, the Somerset East Mounted Rifles had become reduced to less than half
their original strength: yet fortune so far favoured me that when at length the corps was disbanded
I was one of the very few who escaped without so much as a scratch to show for my nine months'
service.

The corps was disbanded where it had originated, in the town of Somerset East; and on the following
day I found myself face to face with the exceedingly perplexing problem of the future.  I was,
it must be remembered, not yet quite eighteen years of age.  I was therefore still young enough
to be able to start life afresh; but I was without a single relative in the world, and my worldly
goods consisted solely of two thousand five hundred and sixty acres of pasture land which,
although it was undeniably an exceedingly valuable possession, and likely to increase very
greatly in value with the passage of the years, was just then incapable of returning me a single
penny of income.  True, there was a sum of a little over three hundred pounds sterling standing
to my credit in the bank, such being the proceeds of the sale of my wagon, oxen, and the ammunition
with which I had trekked into Somerset East upon the outbreak of hostilities, though this was
far too insignificant a sum to be of any use in restocking the farm, rebuilding the house,
and beginning life afresh as a sheep farmer, on ever so modest a scale: and I also possessed
my horse Prince, who had carried me through many a wild and stirring adventure, and, like myself,
had emerged unscathed, together with a saddle and bridle, my trusty rifle, and the double-barrelled
sporting gun which I had purchased in Port Elizabeth for my father, little dreaming, at the
time of the purchase, that he would not live to use it.

I have said that I was without a relative in the world, which was the literal truth; but it
was impossible that I should participate in such a campaign as the one I had just passed through
without making many stanch friends, both Boers and English: and some of these, middle-aged
men who knew perfectly well what they were talking about, strongly advised me to raise money,
either by selling a portion of my farm, or by means of a mortgage upon it.  But my father had
instilled into me a perfect horror of anything that savoured of getting into debt, while the
mere idea of selling any portion of the property which he had accumulated, almost acre by acre,
was absolutely abhorrent to me; therefore, although I had the greatest respect for the judgment
of my friends, and fully believed in the financial soundness of their advice, I determined
that only in the last resort would I avail myself of it.

In this resolution I was fully supported by Major Henderson, who was as well qualified to advise
in such a matter as anyone, having been in the country for over thirty years, and knowing it
a good deal better than most.  He had a farm up under the southern slopes of the Tandjes Berg,
and upon the dissolution of the corps he was good enough to invite me to take up my quarters
at his place while thinking over my affairs and deciding what to do.

It was while we were sitting out on the stoep of his house, one night after dinner, that the
conversation occurred that decided my course of action and ultimately launched me upon the
great adventure which, while leading me into many strange and terrible perils, was so profoundly
to influence the whole of my after life.  I remember that I was in a very pessimistic, downcast
mood that night, and expressed the opinion that there appeared to be nothing for it but for
me to erect a sort of glorified Kafir hut on my land, invest my money in a small flock of sheep,
shepherd them myself, and so gradually build up my fortunes afresh from that modest foundation.

"No," said the ex-major, "I would not advise you to do that; certainly not.  The process is
too slow; and unless you should happen to meet with such a persistent run of good luck as no
man has a right to expect you would be a good way past middle age before you could restore
Bella Vista to what it was a year ago.  What I would advise you to do, Laurence, is this--and,
mind you, if I had not watched your behaviour through our recent short but exceedingly arduous
campaign, and with my own eyes witnessed your indomitable pluck and resource, I would not advise
it; for to undertake and succeed in what I am going to suggest a man must possess courage that
will quail at nothing, infinite resource, the ability to decide and act with lightning promptitude
in the face of any emergency, a profound knowledge of the ways of the natives, and, lastly,
the thews and sinews of a Hercules, and perfect health."

"But, my dear Major," I protested, "I do not possess half of the qualities which you deem essential
to success in this enterprise, whatever it may be.  It is true that my health at the present
moment is all that I could possibly desire; I am fairly strong--well, perhaps unusually strong
for my age; and I believe that I understand the natives pretty well: but, apart from that--"

"Yes, apart from that," interrupted my companion, "you possess all the qualities that I have
credited you with.  Now, don't contradict me, youngster, for I have watched you, and I know!
To continue from the point at which I interrupted myself, what I would advise you to do is
what I would unhesitatingly do myself were I in your predicament, what I would even join you
in doing were I younger by thirty years than I happen to be, and had no wife or family to think
about and make me falter and lose courage on the brink of every extra hazardous adventure;
and it is this.  I would recommend you to draw the whole of your money out of the bank, buy
a good wagon and a team of salted oxen, invest about twenty pounds in beads, copper wire, and
Kafir `truck' generally, lay out the remainder of your money in an elephant gun and ammunition
for it, your rifle, and your sporting gun, and--trek right up-country into the interior after
ivory and ostrich feathers.  By the time that you have completed your preparations the war
will be over and the natives will be not only perfectly quiet and peaceful, but more than eager
to trade with you upon highly advantageous terms.  By so doing, you could, in the course of
six months, load your wagon to its utmost capacity with tusks and feathers, get back to the
coast, and dispose of your load at a price which would cover all your expenses and leave you
a very handsome profit upon your outlay of time and money.  But," continued the major, unconsciously
dropping his voice to a confidential tone, "I do not advise you to limit your energies to that
programme; very far from it.  Were I undertaking the expedition I should cache my ivory in
comparatively small parcels, at frequent intervals, so that I might not have the trouble of
dragging it about the country, but could collect it on my return journey, if I wanted it, and
should push on right into the interior, up into Mashonaland, and, possibly, farther still.
The Mashonas are queer chaps, I'll allow; but they're all right if you take them the right
way, make their headmen a few presents, take care to obtain permission before entering their
country, and make it perfectly clear to them that your only object in desiring to enter their
territory is sport, and trade with them.  I've been up among them, and I know.  And, my dear
chap, there is gold--plenty of it--up there; and thus far they don't know the value of it!
They'll swap you a nugget as big as your fist for a yard of copper wire.  Therefore, my advice
to you is: Go up there, trade your truck for gold, and bring back as much of the stuff as your
wagon will carry.

"And now of course I know exactly what you are going to say.  You are going to ask: If I am
telling you the truth, why the dickens did I not do as I am advising you to do, and bring back
a wagon-load of gold with me?  My dear chap, I did!  That is to say, I got the gold all right.
But, unfortunately for me, I had a partner in the expedition, a Boer named Van Raalte, who
was cursed with an outrageously quarrelsome disposition and a vile temper, especially where
natives were concerned; and it was he who spoiled everything.  Our expedition--which had originally
been a hunting trip, pure and simple, you must understand-- had been brilliantly successful;
we had enjoyed magnificent sport--lion, elephant, rhinoceros, buffalo, giraffe, no end--and
had filled our wagon chock-full of ivory, skins, and horns, and had then found out about the
gold.  Of course we at once threw everything overboard and loaded our wagon afresh with gold,
as much of it as the blessed thing would carry or the oxen drag.  And then what must that born
idiot Van Raalte do but quarrel with one of the indunas about some trumpery thing, and slash
the man across the face with his sjambok!  Of course the fat was in the fire at once; we were
set upon, seized, bound hand and foot with reins, and flung just anyhow into a hut.

"That occurred during the afternoon.  About an hour before sunset they came and dragged out
Van Raalte, and carried him away, leaving me where I was; and shortly afterward I heard a man
start screaming as I wish never again to hear a man scream, so long as I live.  The screaming
lasted for hours, until past midnight I should think; and all the while I was lying there in
that hut, as helpless as a baby, and sweating with horror at the awful, hair-raising sounds
that pierced my ears.  At length, however, the shrieks grew weaker and more intermittent, and
finally they died away altogether.  The night seemed endless, for what with the horror that
seized me as I lay there listening and trying to imagine what was happening, and the excruciating
pain of my tightly bound limbs, sleep was an impossibility; but the morning dawned at last,
the village awoke, and an hour or two later I was unbound and led forth. They took me to a
place about a quarter of a mile away, and showed me-- something which they told me was all
that remained of Van Raalte.  I will not attempt to describe to you what I saw, but--well,
let it pass! It was a full quarter of an hour before I recovered sufficiently from the sickness
that followed to permit of intelligible speech on my part, and then they took me back to the
village, where the induna was awaiting my return.

"`White man,' he said, `have you seen?'

"`I have seen,' I replied, and with much difficulty conquered the tendency toward sickness
that again came upon me.

"`Good!' said he.  `Now I give you your choice.  Either leave this village, now, just as you
are, without wagon, oxen, weapons, or goods of any kind, promising never to return; or--'

"`I will leave,' said I.  And I did, there and then, more than thankful, I can tell you, that
the alternative had been given me.

"I couldn't tell you--there are no words strong enough to describe it-- what I endured while
making my journey home from Mashonaland.  I had no weapons wherewith to procure food, and I
was obliged to live upon just what I could pick up, chiefly roots.  But twice I was fortunate
enough to come upon the partially devoured `kill' of a lion--once it was a zebra, and the other
time it was a giraffe--still comparatively fresh; and if it had not been for them I believe
I should not have survived, for I was literally at the end of my tether when I came upon them.
And I had no means of making a fire, you will understand.  I struggled along, however, as best
I could, losing all count of dates, and crazy as a loon more than half the time; and ultimately,
a few miles on the other side of the Orange River, I fell in with an elephant hunter named
King, who took care of me and finally handed me over to some friends of mine who at that time
lived in Cape Town.  But although I told King--and a good many other people, for that matter--what
happened to me in Mashonaland, and how I came to be in such a terrible plight, I always omitted
that part about the gold; and you, Ned, are the first and the only one to whom I have ever
mentioned it.  And I would not have mentioned it to you if I had not felt convinced that you
possess all the qualities necessary to enable you to go up there, get a load, and safely bring
it back with you."

CHAPTER FOUR.

I START UPON MY GREAT ADVENTURE.

In the privacy of my own room that night, after I had parted from the major, I gave my most
careful consideration to the suggestion which he had thrown out; and despite the gruesome fate
of the Dutchman, Van Raalte, at the hands of the Mashonas, which my host had hinted at rather
than described, the project decidedly appealed to me.  It is true that I possessed no personal
knowledge of the Mashonas, but I had an idea that, in essentials, they would probably resemble
pretty closely the Zulus, of whom I knew something; and, if so, I could understand not only
their treatment of Van Raalte--and of my friend Henderson too, as Van Raalte's companion and
partner--but also that it might be quite possible for a white man possessed of a certain amount
of tact and a tolerably comprehensive knowledge of the nature of the South African savage to
enter their country and leave it again in safety.

That there was gold in Mashonaland was news to me; for although I had once or twice heard the
general opinion casually expressed that South Africa would perhaps some day be found to be
rich in minerals, I had never until now heard of the precious metal having actually been found,
and I felt sure that, had such a rumour ever gained currency, not even the formidable reputation
of the Mashonas would have sufficed to prevent a rush of prospectors into the country.  No
such rush had ever occurred, for, if it had, the news of it would have spread like wildfire,
and every individual in the colony, to its most remote outskirts, would have heard of it. 
The fact, therefore, that no rush had occurred was conclusive proof that my friend Henderson
was the sole repository of the momentous secret, which he had contrived to keep strictly to
himself all those years.  And now at last he had imparted it to me, and I was free to go up
there, if I pleased, and acquire a fortune.  True, there was a certain element of risk and
danger in the project, for there were a thousand miles or more to be traversed through a roadless,
savage country, of which little or nothing was then known except that it was infested by several
of the most ferocious species of animals and reptiles, as well as millions of even more ferocious
natives.  And during a journey of a thousand miles through such a country almost anything was
possible.  But the spice of danger attaching to the journey appealed to me as an attraction
rather than a deterrent; I should enjoy some of the finest sport that the world had to offer,
and, with luck, might return a wealthy man.  These alone were sufficient inducements; but there
was another and still stronger one, which was--Nell Lestrange. She was so young at the time
of her abduction, was so young still, that I hoped nothing very terrible had thus far happened
to her; but it was unthinkable that a white girl should be permitted to grow up to womanhood
among savages, and I was not altogether without the hope that during the progress of my journey
I might be able to ascertain her whereabouts and effect her rescue.  With so many strong inducements
in favour of Henderson's suggestion, and only one--that comprised in the element of danger
and uncertainty--against it, it is not to be wondered at that before I slept that night I had
definitely decided to act upon the major's advice and undertake the journey.

This decision I duly communicated to my host on the following morning over the breakfast table,
and thereupon we proceeded forthwith to discuss details.  The major was of opinion that I ought
to begin my preparations forthwith, for the season was rapidly advancing; it was then precisely
the right time to start upon an up-country trek, for the rainy season was over, the rivers
were low and everywhere fordable, and the young spring grass was at its best and richest. 
On the other hand, the dry season had set in, water would every day be growing more scarce,
the grass more parched, and the ground harder; in a word, there was not a moment to lose if
I desired to avail myself to the fullest possible extent of all the advantages of the season.

Having agreed upon this, we passed on to the consideration of ways and means, and Henderson
proceeded to jot down rapidly a list of the various items which he deemed absolutely indispensable,
supplementing it with another and much shorter list of further items which, although not positively
necessary, would be highly desirable if the available funds would permit.  Then the estimated
cost of the several items, both indispensable and desirable, was jotted down, and the conclusion
was finally arrived at that, if the various purchases were carefully made, the available money
ought just about to suffice for the indispensables, with the possibility that, if luck attended
me, one or two desirables might also be included.  It is due to my friend the major to say
that when the total of his original estimate was ascertained, and found to exceed the amount
of my capital, he at once offered to advance me such further funds as might be needed to complete
my equipment; but I gratefully yet steadfastly refused to avail myself of his generous offer,
feeling that I had no right to risk the property of another. Then we sallied forth and proceeded
to make our purchases, beginning with the wagon and team of oxen, and then proceeding with
the remainder of the items until the resources of Somerset East were exhausted.  The ammunition
was the most important item of all, and I had early foreseen that it would be necessary to
send down to Port Elizabeth for that.  I did so, therefore, instructing the dealer to wrap
the one-pound flasks of powder separately in waterproof paper, pack them in half-dozens in
soldered-up tins, and enclose the whole in a stout wooden case, by which means I hoped to preserve
effectually my entire stock of powder from the ordinary accidents of travel in a country subject
at certain seasons to torrential downpours of rain, and intersected at pretty frequent intervals
by rivers deep enough to flood a wagon during its passage across.  The case of powder, which
also contained the necessary complement of wads and percussion caps, arrived at Somerset East
exactly a fortnight after the dispatch of the order for it, by which time the remainder of
my preparations were completed.  Nothing therefore remained but to bid my numerous friends
goodbye and make a start forthwith.

I suppose it is hardly necessary to state that, when discussing the forthcoming expedition
with my various friends, I carefully abstained from all mention of the word "gold".  The major
and I let it be understood that I was going to try my hand at elephant hunting as a business,
and many were the valuable hints which I received from one and another as to the spots where
I should be most likely to find the biggest herds.  The last embers of the war were still smouldering
in the north-eastern districts of the colony when I was ready to start, but everybody was of
opinion that all was quite quiet in the north; therefore, instead of striking eastward and
working north along the low land between the Drakensberg range and the sea, as I had at first
intended, I decided to strike right away north at once between the Tandjes Berg and Great Winter
Berg mountains, across the Zour Bergen, and so over the Orange River and right through the
very heart of what is now known as the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal, but was then
a practically unknown wilderness.

Behold me, then, trekking out from Somerset East about ten o'clock on a certain glorious mid-October
morning, accompanied by a brand-new, well-loaded wagon drawn by a team of sixteen "salted"
oxen--that is to say, oxen immune to the terrible lung sickness which is the bane of South
Africa--driven by Jan, my former Hottentot driver, who, with Piet, my former after-rider, had
contrived to pick up a living in Somerset East during the war, and now--also with Piet--was
more than willing to re-enter my service and accompany me to the uttermost parts of the earth,
if so it might please me.  The dogs, Thunder and Juno, also formed part of my train, having
found a home with Piet during my absence at the war.  Also, in addition to Prince, there were
two other horses, one being a fine, sturdy iron-grey Basuto cob named Tempest, and the other
a very useful chestnut named Punch, which I had purchased chiefly for Piet's use when we should
arrive in the elephant country.  The remaining member of my retinue was a Bantu boy named 'Ngulubi,
about sixteen years of age, who acted as voorlouper, or leader of the front span of oxen of
the team.

We trekked at a moderately easy pace to start with, doing, on an average, about twenty miles
a day, and contriving, during the first four days of our march, to outspan each night in the
vicinity of a farmhouse, where, in accordance with the custom of the country, I obtained hospitality
for the night.  After that, however, the farms became more widely scattered, and I was obliged
to content myself with the cartel in my wagon, which, to be perfectly truthful, I found far
more comfortable, because more cleanly, than some of the beds I had slept in.  On the evening
of the eighth day, about half an hour before sunset, we successfully forded the Orange River
and outspanned on its northern bank, by which time the oxen were actually going better than
at the start, and were in harder condition.

It was a glorious evening, the sky cloudless, the heat of the day over; and there was just
the softest breathing of a cool, refreshing air from upstream.  The country, low-lying along
the margin of the river and rising very gently as it swept away northward, presented just the
combination of rich grass land and bush that seemed to promise an abundance of game, and about
a mile upstream from our outspan the river broadened out and was rush-fringed in such a fashion
as to suggest almost a certainty of wild duck; therefore, while the "boys" outspanned and attended
to the cattle, I took from the wagon the double-barrelled combination of rifle and smooth-bore
that I had purchased for my father a year before in Port Elizabeth, and, accompanied by the
two dogs, set out for a little walk upstream, partly for the enjoyment of the walk and partly
in the hope of securing something a little more appetising than buck meat for supper.

Keeping closely along the river margin, and walking slowly, with the dogs close at heel, I
soon became lost to everything but the entrancing beauty of the evening, its perfect peacefulness
and quietude, emphasised rather than broken by the gentle gurgle and ripple of the river along
its banks and the soft sigh and rustle of the wind among the reeds; while the swift changes
of light and colour flooding the landscape as the sun sank rapidly in the western sky afforded
a picture the surpassing loveliness of which there are no words to describe. Unconsciously
I halted that I might the better be able to watch the wonderful play of prismatic colour upon
the bosom of the river, upon the gently swaying reeds along its margin, upon the broken ground
ahead in its emerald mantle of lush grass, dotted here and there with broad clumps of bush,
and upon the gently swelling contours of the distant hills, blushing rosy red in the evening
sunshine; and for a space of perhaps ten minutes I stood spellbound, conscious of nothing but
the surpassing loveliness of God's handiwork as manifested in the scene before me.

Then, suddenly, I was jerked back to a realisation of the more prosaic side of things by an
outburst of loud bellowing which seemed to proceed from the farther side of a low ridge about
a hundred yards ahead, and, getting into motion again, I hurried forward to ascertain what
was the matter.  For there was a note of mingled anger and terror in that bellowing which told
me plainly enough that some creature was in trouble not far away.  It was not one of my own
oxen; they were all right in plain view from where I stood, grazing contentedly close to the
wagon in charge of the umfaan 'Ngulubi: nor was it a domesticated ox of any kind, for there
was no farm anywhere within sight, and no wagon excepting my own; moreover, the sound was too
deep and powerful to issue from the lungs of a domestic animal, the obvious inference therefore
being that the bellowing proceeded from a wild buffalo.  And so indeed it proved, for upon
topping the intervening ridge I beheld a splendid buffalo bull some fifty yards away standing
breast-deep in the river, struggling violently and uttering bellow after bellow, except when
for a moment or two the poor beast's head was dragged under water.

I saw at once what was the matter; the brute had wandered down to the river to drink, as most
animals do, at eventide, and, plunging rather too deeply into the water, had been seized by
the muzzle by a crocodile, and was now, despite his frantic struggles, being slowly dragged
into deep water, where of course he would presently be drowned and become the prey of the fierce
saurian.  Now the wild Cape buffalo is a distinctly vicious creature, easily angered, and ready
to fight upon the slightest provocation; it is, indeed, with perhaps the exception of the rhinoceros--and
many who know both intimately would not even except the latter--the most dangerous animal in
Africa, and therefore to be let carefully alone by people who are not looking for trouble:
but in the present case my sympathies were all with the buffalo, for the fight did not seem
to be a fair one; the advantage was all on the side of the crocodile.  Therefore, in order
to even matters a little, I decided to take a hand in the game, and forthwith started at a
run for the scene of action.  And I arrived not a second too soon, for when I reached the spot
the buffalo, notwithstanding his immense strength and the desperate resistance which he had
offered, had been dragged slowly forward through the yielding mud until he was submerged mid-shoulder-deep,
while, his head being held under water, he was already half-drowned and his resistance decreased
every moment.  Nevertheless he was still making a gallant struggle, occasionally contriving
to raise his head above water and secure a gulp of air, notwithstanding the fact that, in order
to do so, he had practically to lift the entire weight of the crocodile a foot or more; and
of course upon these occasions the crocodile's head was lifted at least partially out of the
water, far enough to disclose the brute's merciless eyes.  This happened a second or two after
my arrival upon the scene, when, quick as light, I tossed my weapon to my shoulder, sighted
the reptile's left eye, and pulled the trigger.

It was enough: the bullet penetrated to the creature's brain, the great jaws slowly relaxed
their grip, and with a smothered bellow which may or may not have indicated relief, the great
bull swerved round, staggered out of the water and up the bank, and fell in a heap just as
he reached the crest, where he lay, panting heavily and moaning with pain as the blood gushed
from his lacerated muzzle.  For a moment, as I stood to reload my rifle, I was more than half-inclined
to put a bullet into the poor beast's brain and so end his misery, but upon reflection I decided
that it would be rather unsportsmanlike to take advantage of his helplessness.  I therefore
determined to give him a chance, and went upon my way, leaving him to recover if he could.
And when I retraced my steps about an hour later the brute had vanished, though he had probably
not gone very far.

Resuming my walk, I reached the spot for which I had been making, just in time to secure a
shot at a flight of teal as the birds arrived in what were evidently their night quarters,
and was fortunate enough to bag two and a half brace, with which I returned to the wagon, lighted
on my way by the rays of the newly risen almost full moon.

On the following evening, after a long and fatiguing day's trek over broken and continuously
rising ground, we outspanned close to a Basuto village, the inhabitants of which welcomed our
arrival with such extreme cordiality that I felt sure they wanted something from us.  And later
on, after I had dined, and was thinking of retiring for the night, my suspicion was verified.

As is the custom when the natives are inclined to be friendly, the headman of the village and
some half-dozen others came out to fraternise with my "boys", and, incidentally, to share their
evening meal, which, as usual, consisted to a large extent of buck meat.  Now, at the time
of which I write, the Basutos possessed no firearms, therefore they had to depend chiefly upon
pitfalls and similar primitive contrivances for their supply of meat, except upon the very
rare occasions when they succeeded in working themselves up to such a pitch of extravagance
as to slaughter an ox; consequently meals of which flesh formed a part were few and far between.
But they knew that the white man and his followers could always get meat in abundance; therefore
when a white man passed through their country--which might occur, upon an average, twice a
year--they always made a point of inviting themselves to supper, as in the present case, knowing
that the white man, understanding their custom, would be sure to provide the wherewithal for
an abundant feast. And as they eat they talked, for the Kafir is an inveterate gossip, and
in this way the white man might sometimes acquire an item or two of information of real value
to him.

Now, I had given my "boys" instructions to avail themselves to the fullest extent of every
opportunity that should offer to make cautious enquiry among the natives with whom we might
chance to come into contact, with the object of gaining some clue to the whereabouts of Nell
Lestrange; for I knew that a white child could not be spirited off into the wilds without a
good many natives acquiring an inkling of the direction in which she had gone: therefore upon
occasions like the present it was the custom of Piet, my after-rider, ably seconded by Jan,
cunningly to lead the conversation round to the subject of the recent war, and then listen
intently to all that was said, helping the conversation along, where needful, by an artfully
framed question or two.  And these tactics they followed on the evening in question.

Having taken a walk out on the veld to enjoy the beauty and silence of the prospect under the
silver flooding of the moon, I returned to the wagon with a pleasant sense of coolness and
fatigue, and was about to begin my preparations for a night's repose when Piet, my Tottie after-rider,
rose from his place among the others round the fire and approached me.

"Baas," he said, "'Ngaga, a Basuto, the headman of the village, would speak with you.  Shall
I say that your ears are open?"

"Yes," answered I.  "Let him come hither and speak freely."

Accordingly, Piet having signified that I was graciously willing to accord an audience, 'Ngaga
approached, halted at the distance of six feet from me, flung up his right hand, and sonorously
uttered the salute "'Nkos'!"  Then he stood motionless, awaiting my pleasure.

"S'a bon' (literally, I see you), 'Ngaga!"  I replied.  "You would have speech with me?  Then
say on.  My ears are open."

"Baba (Father)," began the savage (he was at least forty years of age, while I was only eighteen),
"thy children are in trouble; therefore there was great rejoicing in the village when Mafuta,
the nyanga (witch doctor), this morning announced that a white man was on the way and, with
his fire weapons, would be with us before nightfall.  He said--"

"Stop!" interrupted I.  "Before you speak further, tell me how Mafuta came to know that I was
on the way?  I believed that my entry into Basutoland was unknown, and was wondering whether
it would be better for me to see Moshesh in his kraal, or whether it would suffice for me to
send a messenger with gifts.  Perhaps you can tell me?"

"Doubtless the king will be glad to see thee at his kraal," cautiously answered the man, "especially
if the news goes forward that thou hast done us, his children, a service.  And if thou wilt
do us that service I will see that the news of it does go forward to the king's ear, ensuring
thee a welcome."

"Very well," said I.  "I will gladly do what may lie in my power. Therefore, say what is thy
desire, and I will consider the matter.  But thou hast not yet told me how Mafuta came to know
of my presence in Basutoland.  I saw no man yesterday.  But perchance one of you belonging
to the village saw my wagon from afar, and hastened to spread the news?"

"Nay," answered 'Ngaga; "no man saw thy wagon, from afar, or brought news of thine approach
to the village.  Mafuta is a great nyanga, and perchance he saw a vision of thine approach
in his magic smoke.  How should I know?  It is not good for mere ordinary mortals to enquire
too curiously into the doings of the nyangas."

This reply at once powerfully aroused my curiosity, for I perceived that 'Ngaga was referring
to those strange occult powers with which the witch doctors are credited by the white men who
have been thrown into most intimate contact with the natives.  I had heard many extraordinary
and apparently well-authenticated stories told respecting the alleged power of the nyangas
to visualise distant happenings, to foretell coming events, to discover the whereabouts of
lost articles, to read the thoughts of men and lay bare their most cherished secrets, and also
to inflict upon their enemies loss, suffering, and even death.  I had no doubt that many of
the strange stories to which I had listened had originated in some very trivial and ordinary
circumstance which had been magnified and distorted into a weird and supernatural happening
by the superstitious credulity of the original narrator; but there were others of an equally
weird and unaccountable character, which had been told by hard-headed, intelligent, unimaginative
men as having come within the scope of their own personal experience, that seemed to indicate
that the nyangas really possessed powers denied to the great majority of their fellow-men.
Moreover, it must be remembered by the sceptical that all who have ever been intimately associated
with the African savage are fully agreed that he is gifted with certain strange, uncanny powers
quite incomprehensible to the white man, as was indubitably demonstrated during the last Zulu
war, when the natives exhibited an intimate knowledge of certain events--notably the disaster
to the British troops at Isandhlwana--within an hour or two of their occurrence, and several
days before the news became known through the ordinary channels of communication.

Now, taking into consideration such facts as these, which are common knowledge and yet are
quite inexplicable by the most profound students of ordinary science, one is inclined to ask,
if such things are possible to the ordinary savages, why should not other and still more extraordinary
powers be possessed by those among them who have inherited the secrets handed down to them
by others who, through many generations, have made it the sole business of their lives to study
what we, for want of a better term, are pleased to designate the occult?  I confess that I
am not of those who will believe only what they are able to understand; upon what principle,
therefore, shall I say that I will believe a certain thing although I do not understand it,
but will not believe something else for the same reason?  Now, I was keenly interested in the
subject of the nyanga's alleged powers for a variety of reasons, two of which will, I think,
justify me in determining to put them to the test, now that I had the opportunity: one reason
being simple curiosity, and the other the desire to obtain information as to the whereabouts
of Nell Lestrange.  Therefore I said to 'Ngaga:

"Very well; let that matter pass.  You were about to tell me that there is trouble in the village,
of a kind that I can cure.  Was it not so?"

"Even so, 'Nkos'," answered 'Ngaga.  "The trouble is this.  A leopard has lately taken up his
abode yonder," pointing to a spot about half a mile distant, where a great granite kopje towered
some sixty feet above the general surface of the ground, forming a hill of about three or four
acres in extent.  "He haunts a cave in the rock," continued 'Ngaga, "and comes every night
to the village, stealing our chickens, killing our dogs and cattle; and last night he even
entered a hut and carried off a two-year-old child from its sleeping mother's side.  We have
tried to kill the beast; but he is too wise for us, for while we are watching for him in one
place he goes round by another way, and all our efforts thus far have been in vain.  So to-day
we consulted Mafuta upon the matter; and after he had heard us, and had shut himself up in
the hut for as long as it takes the sun to travel that far through the sky,"-- indicating an
arc which would represent about half an hour--"he came forth and said that a white man--yourself,
'Nkos'--would arrive at the village to-night, and would undertake to free us of the beast.
Will you do this for us, O my father?  He is very wary, and will not allow us to approach him
within the length of a spear cast; but he cannot escape your fire weapon: and it shall be that
if you slay him, I, 'Ngaga, will send forward a messenger to the Great One, Moshesh, announcing
thy coming to his kraal, and taking with him a tale that shall cause the Great One's face to
smile upon thee."

"Very well," I said; "I am willing to do what I can for thee and thine, O 'Ngaga, and thus
will I do it.  Thou shalt to-night station two men in a place from which they can watch the
path leading from the leopard's den to the village; and it shall be that if the beast shows
himself, one man shall hasten hither to the wagon with the news, while the other remains to
watch, and if need be follow him.  Thus shall we know where to find the leopard, and I will
come and slay him with my fire weapon. But if the beast remains in his den all night, then
will I go up in the morning and slay him there.  Is the plan good?"

"It is good," answered 'Ngaga, "and I will go even now to the village and send out two trustworthy
men to watch, and do thy bidding," and the man flung up his hand in farewell salute before
turning to leave me. But I stopped him.  "Stay, 'Ngaga," said I; "I have not yet finished speaking
with thee.  I will slay this beast that despoils the village and carries off its young children;
but, in return, the village must do something for me.  I am engaged upon a certain quest; and
if Mafuta is as great a nyanga as thou believest him to be, it may be that he can help me.
Therefore, if I kill the leopard, Mafuta must to-morrow exercise his magic to find out for
me what I want to know."

'Ngaga seemed suddenly disconcerted.  He stood silent for a full minute or more, apparently
plunged in disquieting thought.  Then he spoke, deprecatingly.

"'Nkos'," he said, "how shall I answer thee?  Mafuta is a strange and wilful man, impatient
of authority, and distrustful of strangers; moreover, he loves not white men: therefore it
may well be that he will refuse what thou dost ask of him.  Yet he seemed not displeased to-day
when the knowledge of thy coming was revealed to him, and it may be that he will consent. 
I know not how he will act.  It may be that if I ask him now he will refuse, whereas if I ask
him to-morrow, when thou hast slain the leopard, he will consent.  What wilt thou have me do,
my father?"

"Leave it until the morrow," answered I.  "Then, if he refuses thee, I will see him.  Perhaps
he will not refuse me."

"Good!" agreed 'Ngaga.  "Thy decision is a wise one, for Mafuta is of those who like not to
bind themselves by promises.  I go now to find and send out the watchers.  Sala guhli (farewell),
'Nkos'!" and, saluting, the savage swung round upon his heel and strode away.  Thereupon I
climbed into the wagon, and, having carefully examined my weapons and satisfied myself that
they were all loaded and the powder well up in the nipples, retired to rest.

It was about an hour after midnight when Jan awoke me.

"Baas," he murmured, shaking me gently by the shoulder, "there is an 'mfaan (boy) who bids
me tell thee that the leopard is abroad and making down toward the village, and that if you
will come quickly you will have a good chance to kill the beast."

"All right," I replied drowsily, as I sat up on the cartel and began to feel about for my boots.
"Find the tinder box, Jan, and light the lamp."

A minute later the lamp was lighted, and I proceeded hurriedly to get into my clothes.  Then,
taking my rifle, and instructing Jan to follow me with the double-barrel, I emerged from the
wagon, to find a well-grown Basuto lad of about eighteen years of age impatiently waiting to
guide me to the scene of action.

"Well, 'mfaan," said I, "so the leopard is abroad.  Whereabout is he?"

"He is somewhere on the other side of that ridge, 'Nkos'," answered the lad.  "He came out
from behind the krantz and, entering the long grass, disappeared.  But my brother yonder is
watching his movements, and if we hasten we may cut him off before he reaches the village.
See, 'Nkos', there is my brother--you can see his head and shoulders above the ridge; he is
waving us to hasten."

I looked in the direction toward which the lad pointed.  The moon was high in the heavens,
almost overhead in fact, and the entire scene was flooded with her white rays.  Before us the
ground rose slightly to a ridge about one hundred yards distant; past this lay a depression
through which a small stream ran, while beyond the stream the ground rose again in a long,
bush-clad slope, which swept away into the extreme distance, grey and mysterious, forming the
background of the scene.  The foreground and nearer distances were brilliantly illuminated
by the cold rays of the moon, rendering objects within a quarter of a mile almost as distinct
as though it were midday; and, clearly defined against the ghostly grey of the grass-clad ridge,
I could see the head and shoulders of a savage, the white moonlight gleaming upon his ebony
skin as he waved his arm, signalling to us.

"This way, 'Nkos', this way!" whispered my guide excitedly, leading the way toward the lower
edge of the depression; and, walking fast, I followed him, with Jan bringing up the rear. 
Five minutes of quick wading through the long, dew-saturated grass carried us over the ridge,
but much lower down than where the watcher was stationed; and the depression--which was scarcely
deep enough to be termed a ravine--lay before us.  Here we paused a moment to reconnoitre,
but, seeing nothing, moved rapidly forward again, aiming for a small clump of bush that stood
solitary at a distance of about fifty yards from a wide-open space which the leopard must needs
cross on his way to the village.  Behind this we all three posted ourselves, to await the arrival
of the brute, for the position was an excellent one in every respect, the bush being between
us and the spot where we supposed the leopard to be, while what little wind there was blew
from that direction toward us, and in front stretched a wide, open, grassy space, with the
stream trickling through its midst.

We had scarcely settled ourselves behind the bush when our Basuto guide gently touched me on
the arm and silently pointed between the branches toward a spot where the grass seemed to be
swaying a little more strongly than the soft breathing of the wind alone would account for;
and, looking intently, I presently perceived that this peculiar swaying motion of the grass
was stealthily progressing across the open space, as though something hidden by the tall growth
were cautiously moving there. Apart from the peculiar motion of the grass, however, nothing
was to be seen, which was not surprising, since the growth down there was breast-high; but
a little farther on, where the village herd had been turned out to graze, it was not so long.
The oxen were there now, at the far side of the patch of short grass, lying down asleep in
charge of a couple of boy herds, and it seemed to me that the mysterious movement in the grass
was progressing toward them.  Presently one of the oxen suddenly flung up his head, seemed
to sniff the air for a few moments, and then, with a low moan, rose to his feet, switching
his tail from side to side.  The movement aroused the rest of the herd, who in turn scrambled
to their feet and stood, switching their tails, and all facing the same way, namely, toward
the spot where I had observed the suspicious motion of the grass.  But the motion had ceased
now, and for nearly a quarter of an hour we all stood there tense, waiting and watching.

Then suddenly I detected anew the curious quivering and swaying of the tufts, though so slight
was it that for at least a couple of minutes I could not be sure that my senses were not deceiving
me.  At length, however, the movement grew sufficiently pronounced to convince me that the
leopard was once more creeping forward, and a few minutes later it reached the spot where the
grass had been kept comparatively short by the grazing of the herd.  The next instant I caught
the merest glimpse through the shortened herbage of a moving something that I knew could only
be the back of a crouching animal of some sort sneaking toward the now fully awakened herd;
and throwing up my rifle, I tried to imagine the entire animal from the little of it that I
saw, aimed for the spot among the grass which I pictured as being just behind the shoulder,
and pulled the trigger.  The sharp crack of the rifle broke in upon the stillness of the night
with startling effect.  I heard the thud of the bullet, instantly followed by a savage snarl
that ended in a moan, and as the smoke drifted away I caught a momentary glimpse of a great,
tawny, black-spotted form writhing convulsively in the air from its death spring and then collapsing
inertly where it fell.  Jan and the Basuto, uttering yells of delight, instantly started to
run in upon the fallen leopard; but I stopped them with the reminder that the beast might not
yet be dead, and, exchanging weapons with the Hottentot, proceeded to approach, with all due
caution, the spot where it lay.  But we need not have been under any apprehension, for when
we came to it we saw that the animal--which, by the way, was the biggest leopard that I had
ever seen--had been shot clean through the heart, and was stone-dead.

CHAPTER FIVE.

MAFUTA, THE BASUTO WITCH DOCTOR.

On the following morning, when I turned out and walked down to the river to bathe, I debouched
a little from the direct road in order to take a peep at the dead leopard by daylight, the
carcass having been left where it had fallen.  As I approached the place I saw that Piet and
Jan, my two Hottentots, were already busily engaged upon the task of removing the skin; and
I observed that both were looking, as I thought, very much annoyed, and a little apprehensive.
I was not long in discovering what was the matter, for as I halted beside them Piet held up
first the two front paws and then the two hind paws of the beast, when I instantly saw, to
my intense annoyance, that every one of the claws had been removed, and that therefore, as
a trophy, the skin was quite useless. Of course I knew that this was a common practice among
the Kafirs, the claws of the lion and the leopard being either worn by them as potent amulets,
or converted into muti, that is to say, medicine, which is implicitly believed by them to impart
the quality of courage to the one who takes it; but I had been foolish enough to think that,
having solicited me to destroy their enemy for them, they would have regarded the carcass as
sacred from mutilation.  They had not done so, however, and that ended the matter, for I knew
that it would be quite useless to make a fuss about it: not a soul in the village would ever
admit the least knowledge of the theft.

While I was taking breakfast, about an hour later, 'Ngaga came up from the village to express
the hearty thanks of himself and the rest of the inhabitants for the service which I had rendered
them by destroying the leopard; and when we had chatted for half an hour or so, and 'Ngaga
had accepted a present of a yard of brass wire, a handful of parti-coloured beads, and a cotton
handkerchief gorgeously emblazoned in red, blue, green, and yellow, he said:

"'Nkos', after I left you last night I went to the hut of Mafuta and was permitted to enter.
I told the nyanga that you had undertaken to slay the leopard that had been troubling us, and
after I had spoken many words concerning the greatness of the boon you would thus confer upon
us, I ventured to mention that you were desirous of consulting him in relation to a certain
quest which you have undertaken.  I think, 'Nkos', that if you would go now with me to Mafuta's
hut, perhaps taking with you as a gift another handkerchief such as this, the nyanga would
be willing to grant your request."

"You think so?"  I said.  "Then in that case let us go."  And, extracting from the voorkissie
a handkerchief distinguished by a particularly startling combination of colours, which I tucked
into my belt in such a manner that it could not fail to attract attention, I set out for the
village, accompanied by 'Ngaga, who, I understood, proposed to act as a sort of sponsor for
me, and to introduce me personally to the great man.

The nyanga's hut was, as is generally the case, built at some little distance--in the present
instance about a quarter of a mile--from the village proper, standing quite by itself, close
to the stream, and close under the shadow of a great clump of bush.  Apart from this circumstance
there was nothing to distinguish it from the rest of the huts, it being of the usual beehive
shape, constructed of closely interwoven wattles, thickly thatched with reeds and grass, and
having an entrance so small that it was necessary to bend double and stoop low in order to
pass through it.  Also it was windowless, the only illumination of the interior being derived
from such light as came through the low door; consequently when one first entered such a hut
the contrast between the obscurity of the interior and the glare of the blazing sunlight outside
produced an impression of profound darkness, this only passing away as the eye gradually accustomed
itself to the gloom, after which one found, somewhat to one's surprise, that there was light
enough to see everything with a very tolerable degree of distinctness.

As 'Ngaga preceded me into the hut I heard a low murmur of greeting pass between him and someone
else, which told me that the owner was at home; then I followed and stood upright in what was,
to my eye, inky blackness.

"S'a bon', 'mlungu (I see you, white man)!" said a deep, resonant voice from the depth of the
darkness.

"Yebo (yes), Mafuta," answered I, that being the usual interchange of salutations between the
native and the white when the former esteems himself the equal of the latter; and I stood,
blinking and striving to penetrate the obscurity.  Gradually the darkness melted into a sort
of sombre twilight, which by imperceptible degrees grew stronger, and presently I saw that
I was in a hut the sole furniture of which consisted of a pallet, raised about a foot from
the floor, and covered with rich karosses or skin rugs--one, I observed, being made entirely
of leopard-skins.  On one end of this pallet was seated a man of perhaps forty years of age,
wearing a keshla, or head ring, and a mucha, or apron, made apparently of monkey skins.  The
man's shield and sheaf of assagais stood close at hand against the wall of the hut, and a ponderous
knobkerrie hung just overhead, slung by a loop of rimpi; but the hut contained nothing to distinguish
it from that of any other native, and I confess that my first feeling was one of disappointment,
for I had never before been in the hut of a nyanga, and I had been led to believe by those
who had that I should see all sorts of strange and weird-looking objects if I ever happened
to penetrate to the interior of a Kafir witch doctor's hut.  The owner seemed to read my disappointment
in my eyes, for he laughed softly as he waved his hand, indicating the emptiness of the hut.

"I do not need the things for which you are looking, 'mlungu," he said; "my magic is different
from that of all other nyangas--and much more potent, as mayhap you shall see for yourself.
Be seated," he continued, waving me toward the other end of the couch; "and as for you, 'Ngaga,
having brought the 'mlungu hither, your task is accomplished, and you may depart."

So, while I deposited myself upon the pallet, 'Ngaga bade us both a somewhat ceremonious farewell,
and vanished through the opening into the blazing sunlight without.

Then Mafuta began to talk to me about my journey and the incidents, such as they were, that
had thus far marked it; and I confess that I was astounded at the intimate knowledge of these
matters which he displayed. Of course I knew that my "boys" might have, and very possibly had,
spoken of them to 'Ngaga and the other Basutos during their gossip round the fire on the previous
evening; yet this man, Mafuta, seemed to know more about the details of them than was likely
to have transpired during such a conversation, which was probably of an exceedingly desultory
and general character.  Yet even this was not so surprising as the knowledge he displayed of
the twofold object of my journey, which I knew he could not have acquired from my "boys", because
even they were ignorant of it, all that they actually knew being that the journey was ostensibly
undertaken for the purpose of collecting ivory.  But without questioning me at all upon the
subject, the nyanga made it clear to me that he was fully aware of the fact that one great
object of my journey was to get gold rather than ivory.

"Yet even that," said he, "is not all that you seek upon this journey; important as it is that
you should find the yellow metal which the white man values so greatly, you are even more anxious
to find something else: is it not so?  And so anxious are you to find it that, although you
doubt Mafuta's power, you have come to him to see if he can help you."

"It is true," I admitted; "and the fact that you know so much of my most secret desires and
intentions inclines me to hope, and almost to believe, that you can help me.  Do you think
you can?"

"It may be, 'mlungu; it may be," he answered.  "The white 'ntombozaan (girl) still lives and
is well, for I last night took the trouble to seek for and find her; but where she is I cannot
say, for the place is strange to me, I having never seen it with my bodily eyes."

I fairly gasped with amazement, for this was the first time that Nell Lestrange had been mentioned
since my arrival in the village, and it was not I who had spoken of her, but a savage to whom
even the bare fact of her existence might be supposed to be unknown--unless--unless those who
originally carried her off had chanced to pass this way.  Yet, even then--

"Tell me," I shouted, seizing the nyanga by the arm, rather roughly, I am afraid, in my excitement,
"what do you know of her?  How long is it since you saw her?  And who are they who carried
her off?"

"Gahle (gently), white man! gahle!" returned Mafuta, snatching his arm out of my grasp.  "I
know nothing of the 'ntombi save what I saw last night.  But you came hither to procure my
help to find her, and such help as I can give shall be yours.  As I told you, I know not where
she is, for I never saw the place with my bodily eyes, but I will show it to you, so that if
ever you come to the place you may know it.  Will that satisfy you?"

"But," I objected, "if you are able to show me the place, surely you can tell me the name of
it, and in which direction I should travel to reach it?"

"Nay, 'mlungu, I cannot do that," answered Mafuta.  "My power is not so great as that.  I can
but show you the person whom you desire to see; it must rest with you to note that person's
surroundings so carefully that, should you ever arrive at the place, you will recognise it
again.  Or perhaps by describing it to others you may be able to find someone who has been
there and who, recognising it from your description, will be able to tell you its name and
where it is."

"Very well, then," said I; "do what you can to help me, Mafuta, and I will be for ever obliged
to you."

"Muchli (good)!" exclaimed Mafuta.  "Sit where you are, and do exactly as I bid you."  He rose
from his seat, groped among the thatch of the hut for a moment, and presently produced a small,
circular object about the size of an ordinary coat button.  It was as brightly burnished as
the surface of a mirror, and he placed it upright on the floor of the hut in such a position
that, while itself in deep shadow, it strongly reflected the light which entered through the
doorway right into my eyes, dazzling them to such an extent that, for a few moments, I could
scarcely bear to look at it.  Presently, however, that feeling passed away, and I was able
to gaze upon it without discomfort.

"Now," said Mafuta, "look steadfastly at that, never removing your eyes from it for a moment,
and see what happens."  And, thus saying, the man went and squatted himself upon his heels
in the centre of the floor, and began to chant, in a low, monotonous voice, certain words the
meaning of which I could not comprehend.

For a few minutes nothing particular seemed to happen: the disk continued to shine strongly
in the midst of the deep shadow, and Mafuta's low, monotonous song went on.  Then, so gradually
that I knew not when the change began, I lost consciousness of everything except the gleaming
disk and the sound of Mafuta's voice, from which all semblance of words had passed.  Then the
disk seemed slowly to fade out of sight, Mafuta's voice died away to silence, and I found myself
seemingly standing upon gently rising ground, with a native village, of such dimensions that
it deserved rather the name of a town, about a quarter of a mile distant on my left front.
The first thing that I particularly observed about this place, apart from its exceptional size,
was that it was built in the shape of a circle, and was entirely fenced in with a strong, high
palisade.  There was a gate in the fence, nearly opposite me, and a number of people, mostly
men, were coming and going through the gateway.  They were splendid specimens of the South
African savage, but, look as I would, I could discover nothing either in their cast of features
or in their trappings by which to identify them.

The town was built upon the top of the slope on which I stood, and about a quarter of a mile
distant from it I noted a rather remarkable kopje which I thought would surely enable me to
recognise the place if ever I should chance to set my bodily eyes upon it.  It was perhaps
seventy or eighty feet high, and at its summit it measured, as nearly as I could guess, about
two hundred yards long.  It was hog-backed in shape, and was strewn here and there with great,
tumbled masses of dark-coloured rock, among which grew a few straggling bushes.  The most remarkable
thing about this particular kopje, however, was that, notwithstanding its close proximity to
the town, it appeared to be the haunt of innumerable vultures, some forty or fifty of which
were perched upon the rocks at that moment.  The landscape on which this unknown savage town
was set was of the usual South African type, namely, gently undulating, the hills retiring
one behind the other into the extreme distance until, toward the west--I got my bearings from
the sun, of course--they merged into what might almost be termed mountains, while eastward
the land stretched away in a vast plain.  The soil was densely covered with long, thick grass,
which was already beginning to look bleached and parched here and there for want of rain; and
scattered pretty thickly over the country were the usual patches of bush.  On my right the
land fell away to a spacious flat, a thousand acres or more in extent, upon which vast herds
of cattle were grazing, and through which a stream some thirty feet in width gently meandered.

As I stood noting all these details, three young girls emerged from the main gate of the town,
two of them being dark-brown, while the third was white--Nell Lestrange!  I recognised the
dear child instantly, although she had altered greatly--as I thought, for the better--since
I had seen her last.  She was talking and laughing gaily with her companions, I was glad to
see, for that indicated that she was well and happy; yet, even as this thought flashed through
my mind, she fell silent for a moment and a look of sadness clouded her face.  She was bareheaded
and barefooted, the garment which she wore being a sort of frock apparently modelled from those
which she had worn while at Triannon, and made of a peculiar kind of cloth the nature of which
I could not recognise. Instinctively I stretched out my hands toward her and strove to call
her name, but no sound passed my lips, and, to my intense disappointment, I found that I could
not move.  The trio passed me about a hundred yards distant, and I distinctly heard their voices,
but could not catch the words they spoke, otherwise I might possibly have recognised the language
and thus gained a clue to the locality; and although, just as they were passing before me,
Nell looked straight in my direction, and even paused for an instant, she immediately went
on again, casting a single glance back over her shoulder and then continuing on her way until
she disappeared beyond a clump of bush near the river.  And with her disappearance the whole
scene vanished and I found myself back in Mafuta's hut, with the disk still gleaming brightly
out of the deep shadow, and Mafuta still squatting on his heels in the centre of the floor.

"Well, white man," he said, as I came to myself, "have you seen aught?"

"I have," said I, "and I feel bound to admit that you are the possessor of most extraordinary
powers, Mafuta.  Yes, I saw the 'ntombozaan; and, as you said, she seems to be both happy and
in the enjoyment of excellent health.  But what I now want to know is where she is.  Surely
there are not so many big kraals scattered about in Kafirland that the one which you have just
shown me should be difficult to find?"

"What did it look like, 'mlungu?" demanded Mafuta.

"What did it look like?"  I repeated.  "Is not that a quite unnecessary question to ask, Mafuta?
You must have seen everything that I saw, otherwise--"

"Nay," interrupted Mafuta, "I saw nothing; nor do I know what you saw, excepting that I willed
you to see the 'ntombi.  Tell me everything that you beheld, and maybe I can help you to find
the place."

Thereupon I proceeded to describe minutely the entire scene as I had beheld it, the big town
with its huts, to the number of two thousand or more, symmetrically arranged within its circle
of stout, high palings; the kopje close by, with its scattered piles of rock interspersed with
straggling clumps of bush, and its vultures; the great plain with its herds of grazing cattle
beside the stream--in short, every feature of my vision, as I vividly recalled it.  And when
I had finished, Mafuta sat for several minutes ruminating deeply.  At length, however, he looked
up, and, shaking his head, said:

"White man, I have never seen the place you describe, otherwise I am sure that I should recognise
it.  The kopje with its rocks and its aasvogels would alone suffice for its identification.
That kopje is doubtless the place where criminals are executed; the presence of the aasvogels
seems to indicate that.  And the size and general importance of the place lead me to believe
that it is where a king sits; but what king I know not.  Of one thing, however, I can assure
you; it is not Moshesh's Place."

"Well," said I, "that at least is something to know, for it is one place the less to trouble
about.  And that is all the help you can give me?"

"That is all the help I can give you," repeated Mafuta.

"But surely it is much, is it not, 'mlungu?  You have seen the place with the eyes of your
mind, seen it as plainly as if you had beheld it with your bodily eyes; and you will remember
what it looks like.  You will be able to describe it minutely to others; and as you go upon
your way you will have opportunity to speak of it to others, and--yes, it comes to me that
eventually you will meet with one who will enable you to find it."

"Thanks, very much," said I.  "That is a most comforting thing to know, and, since you say
that such a thing will happen, I quite believe it will, after the exhibition of your powers
which you have already given me.  Will you accept this as a gift from me?"  I added, producing
the brilliantly marked handkerchief from my belt and offering it to the nyanga.

"My thanks, 'mlungu," answered the man, taking the handkerchief and depositing it upon the
pallet.  "And now," he continued, "I think you will do well to proceed without undue delay
to Moshesh's kraal.  'Ngaga has already dispatched a messenger apprising the king of your presence
in his country, and, if you ask permission to pass through and hunt in it, the Great One will
doubtless give it, especially as you have rendered his people the service of slaying the leopard
that has been preying upon them.  But the king is jealous of his own authority, and is apt
to resent intrusion into his country without permission first asked; also he is a little distrustful
of the white man, whom he suspects of a desire to steal the black man's land.  Therefore present
yourself before him as early as may be."

"Thanks, Mafuta, I will do as you say.  Farewell, and may all prosperity attend you," said
I, as I took my leave.

"Sala guhli (farewell), 'mlungu!" replied the Kafir, following me out and standing by the door
of the hut.  "I see much trouble and many dangers before thee; but be of good heart, for thou
shalt overcome them all."

Two days later I arrived at the king's kraal.

It was near mid-afternoon when I halted the wagon and ordered Jan to outspan at a point about
half a mile from the kraal: and I immediately dispatched Piet with a message to the effect
that I, Edward Laurence, an Englishman, had arrived at the kraal for the purpose of personally
soliciting permission from King Moshesh to hunt in and pass through his country; and that for
this purpose, and that I might crave His Majesty's acceptance of certain presents, I might
be granted the favour of an early audience.  Then I opened the voorkissie and proceeded to
select the presents which I would offer for the savage king's acceptance.

Gaudily coloured handkerchiefs, and, more particularly, brilliantly hued articles of costume
have from time immemorial strongly appealed to the taste of the untutored savage, and I had
kept this fact prominently in mind when purchasing the goods which I intended to use as presents
and for the purposes of barter; therefore, among other things, I had bought several cast-off
British uniforms of various descriptions, these being designed especially for presentation
to the several savage monarchs with whom I expected to be brought into contact.  So now, after
due consideration, I drew forth a drum-major's scarlet tunic, stiff with tarnished gold braid,
minus its regimental buttons, shockingly soiled, and otherwise very much the worse for wear;
a pair of ditto blue trousers, with gold braid running down the outer seam; a naval lieutenant's
cocked hat, in which I inserted a bunch of cock's tail feathers; an infantryman's white leather
belt, with bayonet and sheath; and a small round shaving mirror in a metal frame, which had
cost me sixpence, if I remember rightly: and made up the whole into a neat bundle, in readiness
for the moment when I should be summoned to the royal presence.  Then I proceeded to take particular
note of the capital of Basutoland.

It was a place of considerable importance, consisting of about a thousand huts enclosed, like
the place of my vision, in a very strong and high palisade, rendered unclimbable by having
the upper extremities of the palings trimmed into long sharp points.  It was built upon the
summit of a low knoll, was rectangular in plan, and covered an area of about twenty acres of
ground; and that was about all that I could discover concerning it in the meantime, since the
palisading was much too high to permit of my seeing anything inside it.

After an absence of nearly an hour Piet returned with the information that he had been detained
at the outer gate of the kraal while my message was conveyed to the king, and that during his
detention he had been subjected to a pretty severe cross-examination by an induna or chief,
respecting the purpose of my journey, my destination, and so on; that, finally, a message had
been returned by the king that when he was ready to see me he would send for me, and meanwhile
I was to remain where I was and not attempt to enter the kraal.  I confess that I was a trifle
disappointed at this reception, which I regarded as distinctly chilly; but Mafuta had afforded
me a little insight into the king's character, and I trusted that a personal interview, coupled
with a sight of the resplendent drum-major's tunic and the rest of the outfit, would, arouse
a feeling of greater geniality in the breast of the savage autocrat.  So I hung about the wagon
for the remainder of that day, waiting for a summons which did not come.  Nevertheless, although
the king did not condescend to manifest any undue eagerness to see me, I was not exactly left
to pine in solitude, for several of the inhabitants of the town came out to gossip with my
"boys", while no less than three indunas suffered their curiosity to overcome their dignity
so far as to pay me an informal visit and ask me countless questions--for it must be remembered
that, at the time of which I am now writing, it was very unusual for a white man to cross the
border of his own territory into the wilds, and one of the men who on that occasion spoke to
me had only once before seen such an individual.

It was amusing to note the rapid change of manner in these men as they conversed with me. 
Upon their first approach they began to question me with a certain curt abruptness which I
easily interpreted as being intended to convey the idea that their visit was more or less of
an official character; but all the while their eyes were wandering hither and thither, taking
in every detail of my dress and equipment, as well as the wagon and its contents, and it was
not very long before they began to enquire what was the use of this, that, and the other. 
Of course I answered all their questions as fully as I could, and not only so, but I also exhibited
a few of my gewgaws, hinting that certain of them might become their own property before long,
although I did not then offer any presents for their acceptance, it being contrary to savage
etiquette to do so before the king had been interviewed and propitiated.  They were, of course,
intensely interested in my guns, and were full of amazement when I bowled over a carrion crow
at a distance of six hundred yards with a rifle bullet; and they did not hesitate to hint plainly
that nothing could possibly be more acceptable to the king than the gift of one of my fire
weapons.  I explained, however, that the fire weapon was very powerful and very dangerous magic,
subservient only to the white man, and that I dared not allow any of them even to touch one,
lest it should turn upon and slay them.  But they were quite as profoundly impressed by my
exhibition of the powers of the burning-glass, several of which I had taken the precaution
to include in my stock; and when they saw me kindle a fire with its assistance they could find
no words in which to express adequately their wonder and admiration.

It is more than probable that, upon their return to the kraal, they found means to convey to
the king's ear some impression of the wonders which the white man had revealed to them, for
I had scarcely finished my breakfast on the following morning when a messenger arrived at the
wagon with the intimation that King Moshesh commanded my immediate presence before him.

I at once arose and, unarmed, accompanied the messenger, with Piet in close attendance, bearing
the parcel containing the presents which I designed to offer for His Majesty's acceptance.
As I approached the open gate in the palisade a number of people, both men and women, were
passing in and out, all of whom regarded me curiously.  A few of the men saluted me with upraised
right hand and the exclamation "'Nkos'!" but for the most part they seemed undecided whether
to regard me as a friend or an enemy, and therefore preferred for the moment to maintain an
attitude of neutrality.  Immediately inside the gate there stood a guard of twenty men, fully
armed with shield, assagai, and knobkerrie, under the command of an induna, and here we were
stopped, for the induna seemed indisposed to allow Piet to accompany me; but I explained that
he was my body servant, and that the bundle which he bore contained presents designed for the
king's acceptance, whereupon we were, somewhat reluctantly, permitted to pass on.  Naturally,
we were no sooner inside the gate than I began to look about me, and the first thing that struck
me was the admirable arrangements which had been made for the defence of the place in case
of attack.  For while the top of the palisade was, on the outside, about fifteen feet above
the surface of the ground, on the inside it had been backed up with earth forming a platform
about twelve feet wide and just high enough for a man of average height to see between the
sharpened points; while at a height of about four feet above the level of the platform there
was a continuous row of slits, about eight inches high by two inches wide, and about nine inches
apart, the obvious purpose of which was to afford the occupants of the platform an opportunity
to thrust with their spears at a foe attempting to scale the palisade from the outside, without
unduly exposing themselves.  Approach to the summit of the platform was obtained by a continuous
flight of rough steps cut in the earth all along its face, and next the foot of the steps was
a road of about twelve feet wide.  Then came the outer row of huts, between which and the next
row was another road, about eight feet wide.  There were four rows of huts running entirely
round the enclosure, inside of which again was another palisade, equally as strong and as high
as the first.  And, as in the case of the first palisade, this also had a single gate, guarded
by twenty fully armed men under the command of an induna.  We were permitted to pass through
this second gate unchallenged, and having done this I found myself in an open square of about
five acres in extent, near the far side of which were seven huts, or houses, rather, for they
were considerably larger and in every way more important than the ordinary Kafir hut.  Six
of these--square structures built of "wattle-and-daub" and roofed with thatch, the largest
of them measuring about twenty feet by twelve, and about seven feet high to the overhanging
eaves--were built in a row, with spaces of about six feet between them; while the seventh,
which I rightly conjectured to be the itunkulu, or King's House, stood about twelve feet in
front of the others, and was about the same size as the largest of them.

We were now upon what may be termed sacred ground, that is to say, ground reserved for the
exclusive use of the king himself and the members of his immediate household; nobody being
permitted to enter here except persons belonging to the royal family, those especially invited
by the king, the chief witch doctor, and the king's own bodyguard, consisting of one hundred
specially picked men, under the command of an induna who also filled the office of chief adviser,
or prime minister, to the king.  At the moment of our entrance not a person but ourselves was
visible in the square, except the guard at the gate; but a few seconds later twenty soldiers
under the command of a very splendid-looking officer emerged from one of the buildings and
took up a position on either side of a chair hewn out of a solid block of wood and draped with
a magnificent lion-skin kaross, which stood some half a dozen paces in front of the itunkulu.

These men were the finest-looking body of savage warriors that I had up till then ever seen,
every one of them being quite as tall as, and far more firmly knit than myself; while the chief
was a truly magnificent man, standing at least six feet two on his bare feet, with the limbs
and frame of a Hercules.  They were all dressed in leopard-skin muchas, with bracelets, armlets,
garters, and anklets of cows' tails; all wore keshlas; and each man carried a long shield and
three throwing assagais in his left hand, while in his right he held a stabbing assagai with
a terrible double-edged blade about six inches wide and eighteen inches long.  Their commanding
officer was similarly armed; but in addition to the leopard-skin mucha he wore a leopard-skin
cloak, a necklace of lions' teeth and claws, and a headdress made of beads and ostrich feathers.
Every man of these twenty-one savage warriors showed upon his person the scars of many wounds,
and carried himself with a pride of bearing which forbade him to display the slightest sign
of consciousness of our presence.

CHAPTER SIX.

MOSHESH, THE KING OF THE BASUTOS.

A minute later the curtain of reed matting that hung in the doorway of the itunkulu was thrust
aside, and a man came forth.  He was slightly above medium stature, and a trifle lighter in
colour than the average Basuto; he was much more simply attired than the officer of the guard,
his clothing consisting simply of a leopard-skin mucha and a lion-skin mantle: but the assured
dignity of his carriage and the expression of arrogant pride upon his well-formed features
would of themselves have sufficed to tell me that the man was none other than Moshesh, the
king of the Basuto nation, even had the guard not given him the royal salute by raising their
stabbing assagais aloft in their right hands as they thundered out the word "Bayete!"  As for
me, I had not the remotest notion of the kind of salutation which His Majesty would expect
from me; I therefore contented myself by standing at attention in military fashion and giving
him a military salute.  The action, which is certainly a very expressive one, seemed to meet
with the royal approval, for the king acknowledged it by the slightest possible uplifting of
the right hand as he seated himself in his chair and the guard formed up behind him.  Then,
gazing at me steadfastly for a moment, he said:

"S'a bon', umulungu!"  Then, without allowing me time to make the stereotyped reply, he continued:
"For what purpose have ye come hither into my country?"

"I have business in the far north," said I; "and to reach my destination it is necessary for
me to pass through thy country.  Therefore have I come hither to offer presents, and to ask
thy permission to pass through thy country and hunt therein."

"Au!" commented the king in a tone of displeasure; "I like it not.  If I give thee leave to
travel and hunt in Basutoland, others of thy countrymen will claim the same privilege, and
it will end in so many coming that there will be no room left for me and my people.  Was it
not this same apprehension that caused the Tembu, the Pondos, and the Griquas to arise and
unite in an attempt to drive the white man into the sea?"

"It was," I said.  "But the apprehension was quite unjustified: the English had no thought,
no desire, no intention to steal the land of the black man; their own land is amply large enough
for all their needs. But the Kafirs would not believe it, therefore they treacherously arose
and swept down upon the white man's land, attacking isolated farms and murdering their inhabitants--my
own parents died upon the spears of the Griquas.  And what have the black men gained by their
treachery? Nothing!  And what have they lost?  Everything!  Thousands of them have perished
in the war of retribution which they have provoked; and the end of it all is that, by way of
further punishment--and as a warning to others--the white man has seized their land and driven
them out of it."

"Au!" ejaculated the king again.  "So have I heard.  And I tell thee again, white man, that
I like it not.  If it be as thou sayest, that thine own land is large enough for thy need,
why hast thou not remained there?  Why comest thou to my country?"

"Because," answered I, "as I have already said, I have business in the far north, and to get
there I must needs pass through Basutoland."

"And what is thy business in the far north?" demanded Moshesh.  "I have a right to know, since
thou sayest that it necessitates a passage through my country."

"I think not," said I.  "Nevertheless I will tell thee, since the matter is no secret.  When
the southern Kafirs took up their spears to drive the white men into the sea, my father's farm
was one of the last which they attacked.  They slew my parents, burnt down the house, and drove
off all the cattle, leaving me with only sufficient means to buy a wagon and oxen, and weapons
to undertake a hunting expedition.  The land itself remains, and is mine, but I have not the
wherewithal to put fresh stock upon it; therefore nothing remains for me but to hunt ivory
and so procure the means to purchase fresh stock.  Also I am hoping to find gold; but most
of all am I anxious to find a white 'ntombozaan who was captured and carried off by the Kafirs."

"Ou!" ejaculated the king.  "Now I begin to understand.  At first I feared that thy business
was to spy out the nature of the land in this my country, so that, if it were found suitable,
thou and other white men might come in and try to take it from me; but since thou dost indeed
merely desire to pass through it, I give thee free leave to do so, the more readily that I
learn thou didst help my people by slaying a leopard that was troubling them."

"It is well, O king, and I thank thee," said I.  "And now, in acknowledgment of thy friendliness,
I ask thine acceptance of certain presents," and I beckoned Piet to approach with his parcel,
which I forthwith proceeded to open.

The trousers were on the top of the parcel, and as I unfolded them and turned them about, showing
off their gold braid, I saw the king's eyes begin to glisten, for finery appeals quite as strongly
to the savage as it does to the child.  He took the garment in his hands, inspected the gold
braid narrowly, and seemed more than half-inclined to insinuate himself into the article there
and then; but his dignity rose superior to the strain upon it, heavy as it was, and with a
sigh he handed the trousers over to the captain of the guard to hold for him.  Then, with a
suitable flourish, I displayed the drum-major's tunic in all its bravery of soiled scarlet
and tarnished gold lace; and as I turned it about to exhibit its varied splendours even the
iron discipline to which the guards were subjected so far broke down as to elicit from them
a low "Wao!" of admiration.  As for the king, he did not attempt to conceal his delight, even
forgetting himself so far as to direct the induna's attention to its beauties; and for several
minutes he continued to fondle the coat, seeming quite unable to allow so precious a thing
to pass out of his own hands.  At length, however, I created a diversion by producing the belt
and bayonet, withdrawing the latter from its sheath and explaining that it was used as a sort
of rapier.  This also received its due meed of appreciation, but the royal glances still clung
fondly to the tunic; therefore I produced the cocked hat with its plume of feathers, putting
it upon my own head for a moment to show how it ought to be worn, and then handing it to the
king, who immediately clapped it upon his own pate, and kept it there.  And, finally, I produced
the shaving mirror, of which the king at first seemed somewhat afraid, pronouncing it "'mkulu
'mtagati" (great or powerful magic); but when I had succeeded in making him thoroughly understand
what it was, he was as delighted as a child, sitting in his chair intently studying his own
countenance for several minutes, and then bursting into rapturous laughter.

When the first acute spasm of delight at seeing his own physiognomy reflected in a mirror had
passed, I suggested to the king that if he would like to try on his new garments I should be
very pleased to instruct him as to the proper method of getting into them, an offer which he
instantly accepted; and he would have donned the clothes there and then, in the presence of
his guards, if I had not whisperingly hinted that it would be much more effective to get into
them in the privacy of his own house and then reappear en grande tenue.  His Majesty immediately
recognised the force of this, and thereupon retreated to the interior of the itunkulu, taking
me and the clothes with him; and there, in feverish haste, he proceeded to array himself under
my direction.  By a miracle the garments fitted him almost as though they had been made for
him--for he was at this time still a young man, and had not yet begun to put on flesh.  The
poor man must have felt horribly hot and uncomfortable in his unaccustomed rig, for the perspiration
literally streamed from him; but no matter, he was about to appear before the eyes of his faithful
subjects--or at least a portion of his bodyguard, who would not fail to talk about the matter
to the rest of the people--apparelled in unimaginable splendour, and such a trifle as a little
discomfort from excessive heat was as nothing compared with the sensation which he expected
to produce.

And really, when at length he was completely rigged in tunic and trousers, with the cocked
hat on his head, the belt about his waist, and the drawn bayonet in his hand, his appearance,
although just a trifle incongruous to my critical eye, was well calculated to produce a profound
impression upon his unsophisticated subjects, as was evidenced by the note of admiration which
rang unmistakably in the ecstatic shout of "Bayete!" with which his guards greeted him upon
his reappearance. He strutted up and down the compound for a few minutes, showing off his fine
feathers; called his chief induna to him, and instructed the man in my presence that I was
to be permitted to go wherever I pleased in Basutoland, stay in the country as long as I pleased,
and kill as much game as I chose; and then, dismissing me rather abruptly, retreated to the
interior of the itunkulu, and, as I afterwards learned, sent for his wives, that they might
behold him in his unaccustomed bravery.

That I had been lucky enough to make an exceedingly favourable impression upon the king was
perfectly evident; but by what magic the intelligence should instantaneously become disseminated
among the people I know not.  Yet so it was; for while upon my approach to the town it had
been quite exceptional for a native to salute me, upon my departure from it every man I met
punctiliously gave me "'Nkos'!" as I passed him. And in less than an hour after my return to
the wagon an induna arrived from the town accompanied by a couple of natives leading a pair
of superb Basuto ponies--a stallion and a mare, both unbroken--as a present from the king.
And as the Basuto horses are far and away the finest horses in South Africa, and the pair presented
to me were exceptionally fine animals of their kind, the gift was an exceedingly valuable one,
although, being unbroken, I anticipated plenty of trouble with them before they would be of
any use to me.  But I may say here that in this anticipation I was very agreeably disappointed,
for although they were as wild as deer when first brought to me, I took them in hand forthwith,
and by dint of patience and making pets of them I soon had them both so docile that they would
come at my call; and within a month I had backed them both.  But, after all, valuable as they
were for breeding purposes, they were not of very much use to me personally, being scarcely
up to my weight.  Nevertheless, I frequently rode them for an hour or two, just to keep them
in training, and to ease my other horses a little.  They were both coal black, and I called
them respectively Jack and Jill--not very high--flown names, perhaps, but exceedingly handy.

There was a good deal of singing and dancing going on in the town that night, the rumpus being
so great that it was well on into the small hours before it subsided sufficiently to allow
me to get to sleep; and on the following morning I learned, through my boy Piet, that so great
had been the king's gratification at the result of his interview with me that he had given
ten oxen from his own private herd as a feast in celebration of my arrival.

Anxious to press forward upon my journey, and anxious also to get away from Moshesh's kraal
while the relations were so exceedingly cordial, I sent a message to the king, early upon the
following morning, requesting his permission to depart.  But instead of receiving a gracious
assent to my request, I was somewhat perturbed to see Moshesh himself, splendidly mounted,
and attired in his new rig-out, accompanied by some ten or a dozen indunas and about a thousand
of his troops, all mounted, filing out of the gate and heading straight for the wagon--for,
to be quite candid, the South African savage is a little uncertain in his moods, and the man
who is to-day in high favour may, as likely as not, find himself staked out on an ant-heap
to-morrow, to die the awful "death of the ants" in revenge for some unknown and unintended
offence.  But upon the arrival of the cavalcade I was quickly reassured by the cordial tone
of the king's greeting and the respect with which the indunas saluted me; and presently Moshesh,
informing me that he was about to hold a review of his own especial regiment of lifeguards,
invited me to accompany him and witness the evolutions.  This, of course, was a very exceptional
display of royal favour, and although I was anxious to press forward upon my journey there
was obviously nothing for it but to accept the king's invitation with a good grace and every
outward sign of gratification.  At the same time I could not avoid a suspicion that there must
be something behind such a signal mark of favour, and presently I got an inkling of what it
was when, as Piet led up my horse, saddled and ready for me to mount, the king said:

"I am told, white man, that you possess a wonderful fire weapon with which you can slay at
a distance far beyond that to which the strongest of my warriors can hurl an assagai.  Is that
the truth?"

"It is the truth, O King," said I.  "Would you like to see it?"

The king intimated that he would, whereupon I directed Piet to bring me my rifle, together
with the powder horn--the belt, with pouch containing bullets, wads, and percussion caps, was
already buckled round my waist; and upon receiving the weapon I held it up for His Majesty
to look at, keeping it, however, in my own hands.  But this did not suit Moshesh at all; he
must needs handle it himself.  Therefore, rather unwillingly, I must confess, I offered the
gun to him, first taking care to remove the cap and lower the hammer down on to the nipple,
for the piece was loaded, and I was particularly anxious that no accident should happen.

Unobtrusively, however, as the deed was done, my action did not escape the sharp eyes of the
king, and he turned upon me quickly with the demand:

"Why did you do that, white man?"

"Because this," said I, holding up the percussion cap, "is very powerful magic, obedient only
to the white man.  Without it the fire weapon is as harmless as a stick; with it the fire weapon
is deadly, and not to be handled with impunity by anyone but its rightful owner.  Therefore,
since you wish to see my rifle, and take it into your own hands, I must needs remove the magic,
else would it turn upon you and do you a serious hurt, possibly slay you."

"Au!" ejaculated the king, regarding the rifle doubtfully, and not offering to take it into
his own hands: "I like it not; take it away, I will not touch it; the thing is more dangerous
than a she leopard robbed of her cubs!  Yet I would fain see what it can do, therefore bring
it with thee, white man; it may be that, as we go, we may meet a leopard, or a lion, or a buck
for thee to slay."

"Nay," said I, "it is not likely that either of the beasts which thou hast named will show
in the open in the presence of so many men and horses.  Nevertheless I will take the rifle,
for even though no beast should show itself I may be able to shoot a bird or two."  So saying,
I swung myself into the saddle, and, accepting the king's invitation to ride beside him, proceeded
at a gallop, with the thousand bodyguards thundering along in the rear.  And, watching my opportunity,
it was not long before I contrived to set my rifle to half-cock and replace the cap on the
nipple without attracting the king's attention.

Our way lay along what at the beginning was simply a very shallow depression between two low
ridges; but as we proceeded the depression rapidly became deeper and the ridges higher, until,
by the time that we had ridden a mile, we were sweeping through a ravine with high, steep,
bush-clad slopes rising to right and left of us, these slopes terminating about half a mile
farther on in a couple of lofty, perpendicular rocky cliffs, some six hundred feet high, and
about three hundred feet apart, forming a sort of natural gateway to a circular basin about
three miles in diameter, the floor of which was perfectly level, clothed with long lush grass,
still looking quite fresh and green, and with only a few small, widely scattered clumps of
bush here and there.

"This," explained the king, as we dashed through the natural gateway at the head of the galloping
regiment, "is the exercise ground where I bring my regiments from time to time to exercise
them in the tactics of war."

"And a very excellent place it is for such a purpose," I agreed, as my eye took in the wide
area of level, unbroken ground.  "There is room enough here in which to fight a battle of quite
respectable dimensions. But what are those moving objects yonder?"  I interrupted myself eagerly,
as my gaze was arrested by a group of some ten or a dozen dark dots moving slowly among the
long grass at the opposite extremity of the valley.  "Surely they must be buffalo, or I am
greatly mistaken."

"You are not mistaken, they are buffalo; and you have a marvellously sharp eye, white man,"
returned the king.  Then he flung up his hand, and the galloping regiment came to a sudden
halt, reining-in their sweating horses so sharply as to throw the animals back upon their haunches.
At the same moment we also reined up.  Then the king called his indunas round him, instructing
one of them to take fifty men, and with them ride round the outside of the basin until they
reached the only other exit from the valley, and block it, so that the buffalo might not escape
through it; while a second induna was also to take fifty men and block the exit through which
we had just passed, thus rendering escape from the valley an impossibility, for, as the king
now informed me, the surrounding cliffs were everywhere vertical, so that no animal, save,
perhaps, a baboon, could possibly enter or leave the basin except by one or the other of the
two natural gateways in the cliff.

"Now, white man," said the king, turning to me with sparkling eyes and pointing toward the
buffalo, "there is your opportunity.  Kill me two or three of those with your fire weapon,
and then you shall see how the Basuto hunt buffalo."

"Very well," I said; "I will see what I can do.  But we shall have to get very much nearer
to them than we are at present; for even my fire weapon will not kill at such a distance as that."

"No?" demanded the king.  "Then how close must you get before it will kill?"

"Oh," I said, "perhaps one-sixth of the present distance of the buffalo."

The king was evidently disappointed to learn that there was a limit to the range of the rifle,
and for the moment seemed inclined to regard it somewhat contemptuously.  Without wasting further
words upon so very ineffective a weapon, he proceeded to issue his orders to the other indunas,
in obedience to which the regiment divided itself into two, one half riding to the left and
the other to the right, and stringing themselves out, single file, close in under the shadows
of the overhanging cliffs, where they quickly became so inconspicuous as to be practically
invisible.  Then, accompanied by a body of twenty picked men, who spread themselves out in
open order in our rear, the king and I advanced toward the buffalo at a slow walking pace.

It fortunately happened that the wind was blowing across the basin directly from the buffalo
toward us, consequently it was a long while before the brutes became aware of our presence;
indeed, we had arrived within about three-quarters of a mile of them before they betrayed any
sign of uneasiness, and even then it was toward the upper end of the valley, and not toward
us, that their attention seemed to be directed.

"It is Bulangu and his party that they scent," said the king, referring to the squadron of
men whom he had sent round outside the basin to bar the upper exit; and, sure enough, a minute
or two later the whole herd swung round and began to move toward us.  But the moment that this
occurred they of course caught sight of us and at once came to a halt, tossing their heads
impatiently, lashing their flanks with their tails, and emitting low, moaning bellows of annoyance.
After a short pause, however, accompanied by the display of many indications of rapidly increasing
anger, the herd again began to move toward us, first at a walking pace that rapidly merged
into a trot, till finally the whole herd broke into a gallop as the induna Bulangu and his
party appeared at the far end of the plain.

"Now," said I to the king as the herd rapidly approached within range, "I will show you what
the fire weapon is capable of doing.  Watch the old bull who is leading the herd and see what
happens.  And perhaps you had better dismount, for your horse is unused to fire weapons, and
when I shoot he may possibly swerve suddenly and throw you."

"Nay," answered the king, "I will not dismount; for now that you have warned me I shall know
what to expect, and shall not be taken unawares." And he gathered in the slack of his single
bridle, tightly gripped the animal between his knees, and sat prepared for whatsoever might happen.

The herd, meanwhile, had approached to within about eight hundred yards of us, and were thundering
straight in our direction at a somewhat ungainly but nevertheless rapid gallop, with heads
down and tails up, giving vent to low, angry bellows as they came.  I was riding Prince, upon
whom I knew I could absolutely depend; therefore, instead of dismounting, I turned him to the
right with a touch of my heel and a slight pressure of the rein, very nearly broadside-on to
the approaching herd, and flung the rifle up to my shoulder.  It was a rather long shot, and
at eight hundred yards even a buffalo, coming head on, presents but a comparatively small target,
especially when the grass happens to be breast-high; nevertheless I got the sights to bear
dead upon the centre of the bull's forehead, about halfway between the horns and the eyes,
and, watching for the proper moment, pressed the trigger.  The flash and report of the piece
were immediately followed by sounds of fierce stamping and plunging close at hand, and out
of the corner of my eye I saw that the king's high-mettled stallion was fighting hard to break
away and make a bolt for it; then, just as the bull stumbled, recovered himself, and finally
turned a complete somersault, I heard the loud thud of the bullet on the thick skull, and knew
that my shot had got home.

"W-a-a-u!" ejaculated the king, giving vent to a long-drawn expression of amazement; "yena
chiele (he is hit)!  The fire weapon is indeed 'mkulu 'mtagati (great magic)!  The beast fell
dead as though smitten by lightning.  Can you do that again, white man, or was it merely chance?"

"You shall see," said I, as I rammed a wad down upon a fresh powder charge and slipped a bullet
in after it.  As I set the trigger to half-cock I saw that the powder was well up in the nipple;
therefore, slipping on a cap and setting the trigger to full-cock, I again levelled the piece
and bowled over the leading buffalo.

"It is enough!" exclaimed the king soberly.  "No wonder that you conquered the tribes who rose
against you if you were all armed like that!  Now, children," he continued, throwing up his
hand as he addressed his little body of immediate followers, "show the white man how the Basuto
kills buffalo!"

The herd had originally numbered eleven, nine of which were still upon their feet, and, with
the vindictive fearlessness which is the chief characteristic of the Cape buffalo, charging
straight down upon our party; at a word, therefore, from the induna who was in command of the
contingent, nine of the warriors flung away their shields and casting assagais, and, gripping
the single bangwan, or stabbing assagai, with which each of them was also armed, drove their
heels into their horses' flanks and dashed forward to meet the bellowing foe.  To see those
nine men fearlessly charge the rushing herd was a distinctly thrilling sight; for none knew
better than they the implacably savage nature of the brutes they were about to contend with,
or the deadliness of the peril to which they were so light-heartedly exposing themselves. 
Yet not one of them manifested the slightest disposition to shirk the encounter: possibly they
all knew that to perish upon the horns of a buffalo would be preferable to the punishment that
surely awaited them should they disgrace themselves and their king by showing fear in the presence
of a white man.  But if the riders scorned to exhibit fear, the horses were animated by no
such scruples, for when they had approached to within about two hundred feet of the charging
buffalo, the low, fierce, grunting bellows, the blazing eyes, and the sharp, threatening horns
of the latter seemed to strike such panic into them that suddenly, as though by concerted arrangement,
they wheeled sharply round, and, despite their riders' utmost efforts, bolted ignominiously
in all directions.

I had by this time succeeded in recharging my rifle, and, slipping on a fresh cap, I raised
the piece to my shoulder and held myself ready to shoot upon the instant that I dared do so
without the risk of hitting a Basuto, for a tragedy seemed imminent.  But Moshesh, who was
now with difficulty restraining his own mount from bolting, stopped me.

"Wait, white man, and watch!" he enjoined me; and as the words passed his lips I saw the nine
warriors throw themselves very cleverly from the backs of their bolting horses, wheel round
as upon a pivot, and dash back until they were immediately in the path of the furious buffalo,
which seemed now to have marked down as their destined victims the little body of men of whom
the king and I formed a part.  In the twinkling of an eye each warrior had selected one buffalo
in particular as his own especial foe, and had planted himself with uplifted bangwan square
in the brute's path, while the buffalo, promptly accepting the challenge, responded to it with
fierce bellows and savage flourishings of the terrible horns.  Three breathless seconds later
the leading buffalo, with head lowered and slightly turned to allow of a more effective thrust
of the sharp, upturned point of its murderous horn, was upon his antagonist, and I caught my
breath sharply, fully expecting to see the man impaled, or at least tossed high in the air.
But instead I beheld as splendid an exhibition of courage and alertness as I think I have ever
witnessed, for the man, firmly standing his ground to the very last fraction of a second, sprang
nimbly to one side at the precise moment when, as it seemed, the point of the horn was about
to be dashed into his naked body, and then, as the great beast thundered past within reach
of his hand, down flashed the formidable, broad-bladed bangwan, with so sure and strong a stroke
that the buffalo crashed headlong to the ground dead, with its fierce heart cleft in twain.

And in like manner perished seven of its companions, the ninth buffalo wreaking its revenge
for the death of the other eight in a peculiarly ghastly manner.  Precisely how the tragedy
happened none of us knew, for it chanced that our attention was concentrated elsewhere at the
moment; but a sharp, shrill scream of mortal agony sounding out on the hot air apprised us
that something untoward was happening.  Glancing quickly in the direction from which the sound
proceeded, I was horrified to see that one unfortunate warrior had somehow failed to avoid
a buffalo's charge, and was now writhing transfixed on one of the horns of the great brute,
which the next instant flung the poor fellow high in the air, and then, with a savage bellow,
swerved and came thundering straight toward the king and myself, where we sat on our horses
close together watching the exciting scene that was being enacted before us.  A startled cry
from the induna commanding the squad which was at that moment in special charge of the king's
person caused the eleven men who had until now sat quiescent upon their horses to fling themselves
hastily to the ground and dash forward to protect their monarch.  But there was no time for
this; the buffalo was within a dozen yards of us, and I could see that he had singled out Moshesh
as the particular object of his attack, attracted, no doubt, by His Majesty's scarlet tunic.
The king might of course have escaped by promptly wheeling his horse and galloping away; but
his pride and self-esteem would have suffered a mortal wound had he been driven to flight in
the presence of a white man, although there was a certain quality in his hurried glances to
right and left that seemed to tell me that he meditated something of the sort, rather than
stand his ground and take his chance.  Fortunately I had reloaded my rifle a minute or two
earlier, and now I saw my opportunity to render the king an important service by sparing him
the ignominy of flight: I therefore flung up my piece and pressed the trigger, and the buffalo--an
enormous and most formidable brute--stumbled and fell dead literally at our horses' feet.

"That was well done, 'mlungu," exclaimed the king, with just the faintest suggestion of a feeling
of relief in the tones of his voice; "that was marvellously well done!  But for thy quickness
and sureness of eye and hand I should have been overthrown, and the Basutos might have been
obliged to choose another king.  'Mtala," to the induna, "let them see to yonder clumsy fool
who allowed the buffalo to catch him; and if he be not dead let four of thy men make a litter
and carry him back to the kraal."

The induna saluted, and, beckoning to four of his men, proceeded in person to examine the unlucky
wight who had been gored; but such examination was scarcely necessary, for even from where
I sat it was apparent that the unfortunate man's injuries were of such a dreadful character
that survival was impossible, and a few minutes later 'Mtala returned to report that the victim
was quite dead.

"It is well!" commented the king briefly.  "Let the carrion be moved out of the way; and let
the regiment form up and be put through its evolutions."  Whereupon, at a word from the induna,
a man dismounted, and, uncoiling his hobble rope, slipped the noose round one of the ankles
of the corpse, attached the other end to his horse's girth, and, mounting, galloped off toward
the edge of the plateau, dragging the body after him until it was removed to a sufficient distance
to be quite out of the way of the manoeuvring troops, when it was abandoned to become a prey
to the jackals and vultures!

Meanwhile the troops were recalled and formed up in the centre of the plain, where the king
critically inspected them, while I, at his invitation, rode beside him.  And I feel bound to
say that seldom have I seen a finer body of men, either savage or civilised, which, after all,
is not to be greatly wondered at, seeing that, as the king's own special regiment of bodyguards,
they were, naturally, the very pick and flower of the entire nation.

The inspection occupied about a quarter of an hour, and at its conclusion the regiment as a
whole was put through a number of movements, which they executed very creditably.  Then they
were divided into two equal parts, which were marched to the opposite extremities of the plateau,
when they faced about, and, charging down upon each other, engaged in a very realistic sham
fight, lasting for the best part of an hour, and resulting in quite a number of casualties,
several of the men being unhorsed and sustaining more or less serious injuries; after which
the regiment re-formed, and we all returned to the kraal at a gallop, a party being detailed
to remain behind and bring in the injured at a more sober pace.

I soon found that Moshesh, like all other savages, possessed his full share of vanity, which
he was quite unable to conceal; also, it was evident that he was inordinately proud of his
regiment, and was not above fishing for compliments upon it: I therefore dutifully did what
was manifestly expected of me, and immensely gratified His Majesty by being as complimentary
as I possibly could be without unduly straining the truth.  But when all was said and done
I had a very shrewd suspicion that while Moshesh might perhaps be credited with a genuine desire
to show me some honour by inviting me to witness the review of his troops, he was principally
animated by a craving for his own glorification, and, incidentally, was glad to seize the occasion
as affording him an early opportunity to exhibit himself before his people in all the magnificence
of his new "toggery."

CHAPTER SEVEN.

STRANGE OCCURRENCES IN THE WILDERNESS.

About an hour after sunrise on the following morning I again presented myself before the king,
with the request that I be permitted to continue my journey.  I was very cordially received
by His Majesty, who again thanked me for the service which I had rendered him on the preceding
day by slaying the buffalo, and so saving him from the ignominy of flight, or the almost equally
unpleasant alternative of submitting to be charged by the brute.  In the privacy of his itunkulu
he was much more expansive than he had been on the previous day in the presence of his indunas,
unhesitatingly admitting that, had he been compelled to accept either of the above-mentioned
alternatives, he would have suffered serious loss of prestige in the eyes of his own people.
He informed me that upon his return to the kraal on the preceding day he had given instructions
that a body of men should be dispatched to bring in the carcasses of the slaughtered buffalo,
which had been done, and he now made the offer that, if I pleased, he would have the skins
carefully dressed, and the skulls and horns preserved, so that I might take the whole back
with me to civilisation, as trophies, upon my return.  Of course I thanked him for his exceedingly
generous offer, which I gladly accepted so far as the three buffalo killed by myself were concerned;
and therewith we parted upon the very best of terms, the king according me full permission
to go where I pleased in his country, remain in it as long as I chose, and kill all the game
that I had a mind to, while I made His Majesty inexpressibly proud and happy by presenting
him with a burning-glass and showing him how to kindle a fire by its means.  Then, my ceremonial
visit being at an end, I returned to the wagon, ordered the oxen to be inspanned, and resumed
my journey.

The ensuing fortnight was spent in progressing slowly northward through that part of Basutoland
which lies between the Machacha mountain range and what is now known as the Caledon River,
hunting all the way.  But although the sport, such as it was, was good, enabling me to bag
five lions, eight leopards, and three splendid specimens of rhinoceros, and although buck of
all kinds, and buffalo, were plentiful enough to have enabled me to fill the wagon with their
skins and horns, had I desired to do so, the sport was not the kind that I desired; I was out
after elephant, and Basutoland was not elephant country.  Therefore, at the end of the fortnight,
I crossed the headwaters of the Caledon, and entered what in after years became the Orange
Free State, and, still later, the Orange River Colony.  Thence, passing between the two mountain
ranges which later received the names of Witte and Roode Bergen, we "struck" a wide expanse
of level, open country; through this a stream flowed in a northerly direction, along the left
bank of which we trekked for a full week, not only for the sake of the water and the richer
grass growing in the immediate vicinity of the stream, but also because if there was any game
in the neighbourhood it was sure to be found within easy reach of the water.  And here I got
my first slice of luck, potting a brace of elephants, both of them magnificent tuskers, as
well as another rhinoceros, three giraffes, and seven cock ostriches in perfect plumage.  Then,
crossing the Wilge River, and, two days later, the Klip River, we entered the country now known
as the Transvaal, the Klip River being, as a matter of fact, the headwater of the Vaal.

And now I found myself in a very hunter's paradise, for the country was literally swarming
with game of almost every description, consisting of eland, gemsbok, springbok, reitbok, and
antelope of all kinds, often in herds numbering several thousands; also that curious-looking
beast the gnu, of which I now got my first glimpse; troops of quagga and zebra; giraffes, rhinoceroses,
lions, leopards, and ostriches; hippopotami and crocodiles in the rivers; but still very few
elephants, and those so shy that it was only with the utmost difficulty I succeeded in securing
three within the first fortnight after crossing the Klip River.  And during all this time,
although I enjoyed some splendid hunting, I did not meet with a single adventure worthy of
record, and met very few natives, while those whom I encountered were either very friendly
disposed on the one hand, or, on the other, too shy to come near me. But I saw several very
curious sights, one or two of which I may perhaps be excused for recording.

For instance, about a week after crossing the Klip River we found ourselves striking northward
across a tract of practically level country, dotted here and there with herds of various kinds
of game, which took but little notice of us beyond moving leisurely out of our way when we
seemed to be approaching them rather too closely for their liking.  Piet and I were, as usual,
riding forward about a mile ahead of the wagon, on the lookout for ostriches or elephant spoor,
when we sighted a troop of the great birds which we were seeking some two miles ahead of us,
immediately in line with a range of those curious flat-topped hills which are such a distinctive
feature of the South African landscape.  Away to our left, about a quarter of a mile distant,
was a small kopje, about two hundred feet high, consisting of an outcrop of rock the sides
of which, although almost perpendicular, were so rough that I believed they might be easily
climbed; and as the summit of the kopje promised to afford an excellent spying place from which
to observe the movements of the ostriches, we turned our horses' heads toward it and approached
it at a gallop, reining up at its base.  Upon arriving at the foot of the kopje I at once saw
that it might be scaled without the slightest difficulty, for not only were the rocky projections
so bold and rough as almost to amount to steps, but on the southern or shady side of the hill--which
was the face that we approached--a multitude of tough, fern-like plants were sprouting from
the interstices, affording excellent hold for the hands; therefore, dismounting and handing
my horse's bridle to Piet, and bidding him remain where he was, in the shadow of the rock,
I took my rifle in one hand, and with the small but very powerful telescope which I always
carried when out after game slung over my shoulder, proceeded to scale the kopje.

Reaching its summit without difficulty, I found, as I had expected, that my lofty perch afforded
a magnificent outlook over the plain in every direction.  The ostriches whose movements I particularly
desired to watch were now in plain view, and with the aid of my telescope I could not only
distinguish the cocks from the hens, but could also perceive that the plumage of the former
was in the very pink of perfection.  But, in addition to the ostriches, there were several
other exceedingly interesting objects and sights clearly distinguishable from the summit of
the kopje, of which no hint was obtainable from the level of the plain below.

For instance, upon removing the telescope from my eye, after an exhaustive study of the movements
and behaviour of the great birds, I allowed my gaze to travel over the surface of the grassy
plain immediately before me, and presently became aware of a solitary antelope, of a species
which was quite new to me, grazing at a distance of some two hundred yards from the base of
the kopje.  The creature was about the size of a bushbok, was a dirty white in colour, and
carried a pair of horns about two and a half feet in length, slightly curved, enormously thick
at the base, strongly ridged for about half their length, and thence sweeping smoothly away
to points as sharp apparently as those of bayonets.  The most curious thing about it, however,
was that its coat was long and thick, like that of a goat, but apparently very much finer and
more silky; and I was speculating upon the possibility of capturing and domesticating a few
specimens, with the view of testing the commercial value of the hair, when suddenly the animal
ceased feeding, threw up its head, twitched its long ears nervously to and fro, and proceeded
to sniff the air anxiously, turning its head hither and thither as it did so.

Finally it faced right round, almost broadside-on to me, and stood motionless, very erect,
and with its body seemingly braced in readiness to bound away upon confirmation of its evident
suspicion that an enemy was somewhere in its immediate neighbourhood.  I knew that the suspected
enemy could not possibly be myself, for I was dead to leeward of the animal, and I therefore
proceeded to reconnoitre with the view of ascertaining whether danger was threatening it from
some other quarter. And presently I became aware of certain suspicious-looking movements of
the long grass, about a hundred yards distant, suggestive of the presence of an animal of some
kind approaching the antelope cautiously along a sort of wavering, serpentine course.  When
I first discovered this movement the creature that caused it was at such a distance that it
was completely concealed among the long grass, even from the elevation which I occupied; but
a minute later I was able to catch occasional glimpses of a darkish grey body, thickly dotted
with irregularly shaped spots of lighter grey, slinking toward the antelope, which still remained
perfectly motionless and expectantly watchful.  The course pursued by the approaching creature
was such as gradually to bring it into full view from where I crouched on the summit of the
kopje, and at length I made it out to be also an animal hitherto unknown to me, about the size
of a half-grown leopard, and of very similar build and shape, except that its tail was only
about a foot long, thick, and of uniform dimensions right to its extremity; its ears were tufted
like those of a lynx, and indeed in general appearance it greatly resembled a lynx, excepting
that it was very much larger.

It was very interesting to watch the progress of this little drama--was it a tragedy?--which
was rapidly unfolding itself almost at my very feet, and I was curious to see what steps the
threatened antelope would take to provide for its safety--for it was certain that the creature
was fully conscious of the fact that danger threatened it.  Why did it not seek safety in flight,
as most creatures of the antelope species are wont to do?  Or did some subtle instinct warn
it that flight could but prolong its agony, and that the superior endurance of its approaching
enemy would cause it to be run down and brought to bay sooner or later; and that its best chance
lay in facing the danger now, before its strength should be worn out by a prolonged and exhausting
flight? Apparently some such instinct or conviction must have possessed it, for the antelope
remained standing motionless, as though carved out of stone, the only signs of life which it
betrayed being a continuous quivering of its nostrils and an occasional slight twitching of
its forward-pointing ears, while its enemy slunk sinuously toward it, foot by foot, like a
cat stalking a bird.  At length the would-be destroyer arrived within about twenty feet of
its quarry--at which distance I suspected that each animal was able to obtain at least an occasional
partial glimpse of the other--when it halted, and seemed to be gathering itself together for
a sudden rush, while the antelope still stood as though rooted to the spot.

Why did not the latter take to its heels and run?  I wondered.  Was it that the creature was
paralysed with terror, and so unable to make any effort to save itself?  I thought not, for
I could detect no sign of terror; all the indications were in favour of the conviction that
while the antelope was undoubtedly fully aware of the close proximity of its enemy, and was
alertly watchful for the next movement on the part of the latter, its attitude and aspect were
in nowise suggestive of a feeling of dismay--on the contrary, the idea conveyed to me was that
of reckless temerity.  Yet surely the poor, misguided beast could never be so foolish as to
imagine that it stood the slightest chance of victory in the event of a fight?  I was not allowed
very much time to ponder the question, for, after a pause of about half a dozen seconds, the
lynx-like creature made a sudden lightning-like dash at the motionless antelope, which I fully
expected to see go down instantly, with the formidable fangs of its enemy buried deep in its
throat.  Not so, however, for as the lithe, spotted form darted through the grass the antelope
rose from the ground, as though shot into the air by a powerful spring, descending fair and
square upon its enemy's back, its four sharp-pointed hoofs digging viciously through the spotted
hide and extorting a scream of mingled rage and pain from the astonished assailant; and then,
so quickly that the eye could hardly follow the movement, a second vigorous leap landed the
antelope fully twenty feet away, while the power expended in the leap sent the screaming, snarling
enemy rolling and sprawling helplessly in the grass.

"Well done, antelope!" thought I.  "Now is your chance to make a clean bolt for it, before
your enemy has time to recover from his amazement."

But not a bit of it; evidently the very last thing that the antelope contemplated was flight,
for no sooner did its hoofs touch the earth than it swung round like lightning, facing toward
its adversary, while the latter picked itself up and, with four little streams of blood trickling
down its sides, proceeded afresh to the attack.  Again it crept up to within a short distance
of the waiting antelope, paused, and suddenly dashed in; and again the antelope leaped into
the air, alighted upon its enemy's back, inflicting four fresh wounds with its stabbing hoofs,
and sprang away, spurning the snarling foe with such violence that once more it was sent sprawling
in the grass.

This performance was repeated some eight or ten times, until at length it became quite evident
that the antelope was getting very much the better of the fight, for thus far it had not received
a single scratch, while its enemy's back was punctured all over with wounds that, although
none of them were very deep, were bleeding freely, and in the aggregate were probably very
painful.  It was clear that matters were fast nearing the point at which the grey-spotted beast
would be more than willing to regard the fight as a drawn battle, for every bout left it less
willing to continue the fight; but the plucky little antelope evidently disapproved of half-measures,
and was determined to press the matter to a definite conclusion, for when his antagonist began
to betray a disinclination to continue the fight he no longer waited for the onset, but boldly
advanced, leaping hither and thither with astounding rapidity, each leap landing him nearer
his enemy, until the latter was compelled, in self-defence, to continue.  But at length a moment
arrived when the feline lay moaning and snarling, covered with blood, and either unable or
unwilling to continue the combat; and then the antelope, after approaching the enemy by the
usual bewildering series of leaps and bounds, stood for several seconds meditatively regarding him. 

How sad it is that a mother who loves her child will find sometimes a feeling of hatred in
her heart against it. We have heard mothers in a time of provocation use such words as these,
“You foolish thing;” “You naughty little imp;” “You mean thing, I have a mind to put you out
where the dogs will get you;” “You do that again and I’ll give you to the bad man;” “I’ll slap your head
off;” “I wish you were dead,” etc. How awful! Mothers, who, if their little one was sick, would
gladly sit night after night and watch by its bedside—no slumber for those eyelids now, for
baby is very sick—when the dear one is restored to health and provokes the mother, she uses
some of the above expressions, or similar ones.
  Then, after satisfying himself, by sight and smell,
that nothing further was to be feared from his victim, the conqueror bent his head and resumed
his grazing as calmly as though nothing had happened.

The extraordinary combat took some twenty minutes to reach its unexpected conclusion, and then,
there being nothing to detain me any longer on the summit of the slope, I descended, rejoined
Piet where he was patiently awaiting me within the shadow of the rock, remounted, and rode
forward, our appearance at once putting the plucky little victor to precipitate flight.  I
had a mind to secure the skin of the conquered lynx-like creature, not only as a curiosity
and an interesting memento of a rather remarkable occurrence, but also because of its interest
to the zoologists upon my return to civilisation; but when we presently found the carcass it
proved to be so terribly mauled that I saw it would be impossible to remove the pelt otherwise
than in fragments, and so abandoned the idea.  But we went after the ostriches, and succeeded
in securing the two full-grown cocks of the troop, with the result that I became the richer
by about ten pounds' worth of the most magnificent plumes I had ever seen.

A few days later, our route at the time lying through hilly country, it became a question whether
we should enter a long ravine which divided a range of hills ahead, trusting to the possibility
of our being able to pass through it and emerge at the other end, or whether it would be necessary
to make a rather wide detour round one or the other extremity of the range.  The route through
the ravine would suit us best from every point of view, provided that it did not prove to be
a cul de sac, because it led straight in the desired direction, and appeared to be tolerably
level, also it would probably save us nearly forty miles; therefore I ordered Jan to outspan
upon his arrival at the mouth of the ravine, while Piet and I rode on ahead to reconnoitre,
taking our rifles with us, as usual, as well as the two dogs, Thunder and Juno.

The range of hills lying in front of us was about twenty miles in length, running almost due
east and west, and the ravine which it was my purpose to explore pierced it as nearly as might
be in its middle, running practically north and south; and even at the first glance I was impressed
by the remarkable character of the place.  For the ravine irresistibly suggested the idea that
at some time in the more or less remote past a giant had taken a shovel measuring about a quarter
of a mile in width, and with this gigantic tool had cut a gap right through the range.  The
most singular feature of the case, however, was that, although the gap was undoubtedly there,
and although a vast quantity of material must have been removed in order to create it, there
was nothing whatever to show what had become of that material.  The floor of the gap was quite
smooth and level, unencumbered by boulders or debris of any kind, and its rocky sides were
absolutely vertical, rising in the centre to a height of very nearly three thousand feet, which
height they maintained for about half a mile before they started to dip toward the far end.
Small patches of wait-a-bit and other thorn bushes sparsely dotted the floor of the ravine,
or gorge, and about halfway through there was a little grove of mimosa, in the midst of which
we caught fleeting, indistinct glimpses of certain moving things which Piet declared were giraffes.

Now, I had not yet shot a giraffe, and was rather anxious to obtain a really good--or it would
be nearer the truth to say an exceptionally fine--specimen; therefore, hastily taking cover
behind the nearest clump of bush, we proceeded to approach the creatures warily until we had
arrived within about half a mile of them.  Then, detecting certain signs of growing uneasiness
among them, which I attributed to the possibility of their having sighted our moving figures,
I dismounted, and, leaving Piet with the dogs and horses well sheltered behind a big clump
of bush, took my rifle and set off to complete the stalk through the long grass alone and on
foot.  I reckoned upon being able to manage this without very much difficulty, for the wind
was blowing from the west right across the ravine, while the giraffes were upon the eastern
side, and I was to the southward of them; therefore I knew that I ought to be able to get quite
close to them before they could wind me, while the grass was tall enough to enable me to approach
them unseen.  Nevertheless, although I was stalking them with the utmost caution, using the
wind to guide me, and only raising my head to reconnoitre at rare intervals and with the exercise
of the greatest care, I was annoyed to observe that the uneasiness of my quarries was rapidly
increasing; they had ceased to feed, and were standing at attention, with their ears switching
quickly to and fro and their heads continually turning this way and that, as though they scented
danger of some sort but could not determine its character or, more important still, from which
direction it was coming: and I began to fear that before I could get near enough to put in
a decisive shot they would stampede and I should lose them altogether. And, sure enough, that
was precisely what they did, a great bull giraffe, evidently the leader of the herd, and the
animal which I had finally fixed upon as my own particular prey, suddenly tossing up his head
and breaking away up the valley in a long, lumbering, ungainly canter, instantly followed by
the rest of the herd.

I was not only intensely annoyed but also greatly puzzled at this behaviour on the part of
the great, long-legged, long-necked creatures, for I could not believe that the flight had
been the result of any carelessness on my part; but while I stood watching them rapidly increasing
the distance between themselves and me I became aware of a curious dimming of the atmosphere
along the top edge of the cliffs on the western side of the ravine, and while I was still wondering
what this might be, a low, murmurous, rumbling sound gradually evolved itself out of the faint
sigh of the breeze over the grass and through the foliage of the bush--a sound which, as I
listened, rapidly developed into the beat of innumerable hoofs, mingled with the bleatings
and barkings of a veritable army of bucks of various descriptions.  Then I knew that the dimming
of the atmosphere along the summit of the western cliffs was due to a cloud of light, impalpable
dust, swept along before a great migrating army of game crossing the mountain range, probably
on the march in search of water, and I waited to see what would happen when the vanguard of
the army should reach the edge of the cliffs.

I had not very long to wait; the dust cloud rapidly thickened, and the low rumbling beat of
hoofs on the hard dry soil of the hill crest quickly increased in volume until it became like
the thunderous roar of surf upon a rock-bound shore, mingled with the continuous cries of a
countless host of animals all herded together under the influence of some mysterious but powerful
influence.  And presently the advance guard of the great army appeared against the skyline
on the edge of the beetling cliffs, almost immediately opposite where I was standing; first
a solitary eland, then three gemsbok, closely followed by seven or eight hartebeeste, then
a small troop of quagga, upon the heels of which came a herd of some fifty klipspringers. 
All these advanced right up to the edge of the cliff, halted abruptly, staring down into the
ravine below, and then, wheeling sharply to right and left, threw up their heads and, with
characteristic cries of dismay, took to their heels and galloped furiously along the very edge
of the cliff, in an evident effort to escape the pressure of the great army in their rear.
But as these first arrivals wheeled and sped, terrified, to right and left, others appeared
in increasing numbers and, suddenly realising their danger, sought to escape it, some following
in the footsteps of the vanguard, while others faced about and strove to retreat along the
way by which they had come.

It soon became evident, however, that escape was impossible, for even as I stood watching their
efforts the front rank of the main body appeared, a great compact mass of animals extending
fully half a mile along the edge of the cliff; and although it was evident that this front
rank now realised that danger threatened it in front, and was trying to hang back, the pressure
of the vast multitude in its rear was irresistible, and foot by foot it was pushed forward
until in a few seconds I was gazing at the awful spectacle of hundreds of helpless animals
being thrust over the cliff edge and falling to their death more than two thousand feet below,
while the air throbbed and vibrated with their cries of terror.  It was a terrible experience
to stand there and helplessly watch those unfortunate creatures pouring over the cliff like
the waters of a cataract, to listen to their cries as they found themselves being irresistibly
thrust forward to their death, and to see the long and rapidly growing pile of the dead stretching
along the foot of the cliffs.

There were several varieties of animals in this great migrating army which was being so disastrously
wiped out, some of them being of a kind that set me wondering by what extraordinary accident
they could have become entangled among such incongruous companions.  For example, tightly wedged
in among a herd of blesbok I saw a full-grown lion forced over the cliff; and the only way
in which I could possibly account for the presence of the beast was upon the assumption that
he had been following the herd, and in springing upon some victim had become so closely involved
that he had found it impossible to make his way out again.

I have always stoutly maintained that animals possess the power of communicating with each
other, and what I witnessed now only tended to confirm me in my belief: for after the thing
which I have been attempting to describe had continued for some ten minutes it suddenly came
to an end; the remainder of the army had evidently halted, for although the cries from above
still created a tremendous volume of sound, indicating that an innumerable multitude of animals
survived up there on the top of the cliff, the thunder of the trampling hoofs had died down
to almost nothing, while the animals, instead of being thrust helplessly over the edge, advanced
thereto in little groups, gazed down into the ravine, and then retired again.  When this had
continued for some few minutes the sound of hoofs again became audible; but now the hoofs were
retiring instead of advancing, and in the space of ten minutes had become inaudible.  The creatures
had retired to seek a safer road elsewhere.

Then, emerging into the open, and beckoning Piet, who also had quitted cover, to join me, I
walked over to the foot of the fatal cliff to examine more closely the ghastly pile of carcasses
that lay there, and by the time that I arrived the air was already darkening with the vast
flock of vultures which was gathering to the feast thus bountifully provided for them.

The lion that I had seen come hurtling over the precipice in company with the herd of blesbok
happened to be lying in such a position that I could get at him without very much difficulty,
and I determined to have his hide if upon examination it should prove worth taking.  Accordingly,
upon the arrival of Piet, we both clambered up on the mound of dead and dying animals until
we reached the spot where the lion lay doubled up in a heap and partially buried beneath the
carcasses of the animals that had fallen on top of him.  He was quite dead, his spine, and
almost every other bone in his body apparently, being broken; but his skin was uninjured, so
far as we could see.  Piet and I therefore each seized one of his great fore paws, and, with
a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together, contrived to drag him clear and roll him
down to the bottom of the heap, to which we quickly followed him.  He proved to be a magnificent
beast, quite young but full-grown, in perfect condition, with a most formidable set of claws
and fangs, a smooth, glossy hide of a rich deep tawny hue, and a splendid mane, of so deep
a tint as to be almost black; altogether he was a specimen well worth having, and we quickly
stripped him of his hide, taking also the head, which we deposited in close proximity to an
ants' nest in the full assurance that the industrious little creatures would clear the skull
of every particle of flesh in the course of a few hours.  Then, leaving Piet to clean the skin
and prepare it for packing, I sprang into the saddle and, taking my rifle, cantered off down
the ravine to explore the remaining portion of it and ascertain whether, as I conjectured,
there was a means of egress at the far end.

I found that, as I had anticipated, the ravine, or gorge, passed right through the range of
hills, and gave access to the open country beyond; that the route was quite practicable for
a wagon throughout its entire length; and that by making use of it I should save a distance
of about forty miles, or the equivalent of two days' trek: and having satisfied myself upon
these points, I turned my horse's head and proceeded to ride leisurely back to the wagon, intending
to pick up Piet and the lion's skin on the way.

I had returned about three miles along the ravine, allowing Prince to proceed at his own pace,
with the bridle hanging loose upon his neck, when I was aroused from a reverie into which I
had fallen by a low whinny from my horse as he suddenly flung up his head, twitched his ears
forward, and directed his glances toward a point some distance ahead and to the left.  I knew
at once that he had either sighted or scented something, or both; and, glancing in the direction
indicated, I became aware that we were approaching an enormous flat boulder, which had attracted
my attention some two hours earlier on my outward journey because of its immense size and the
impossibility of accounting satisfactorily for its presence just where it was.

But now the boulder was remarkable for quite another reason; for whereas when I first passed
it its flat top was perfectly bare, I perceived that in the interim it had become a scene of
feverish activity, a troop of quite a hundred monkeys seeming to have taken possession of it.
There was of course nothing very extraordinary in that; the strangeness of the matter consisted
in the fact that they were all hard at work, apparently in concert with another troop of their
brethren down below who seemed to be rushing to and fro between the rock and an adjacent clump
of thorn bush.  A touch on the bridle brought Prince to a halt, and I then produced my telescope
and brought it to bear upon the busy party, when I perceived, to my amazement, that the gang
of monkeys who were rushing to and fro between the clump of bush and the boulder were engaged
in collecting and dragging to the rock a great number of branches of thorns, which they were
passing up to their comrades upon the surface of the rock; and that these, in their turn, as
it seemed to me, were constructing a scherm, or hedge of thorns, working in such feverish haste
that their lives might have been depending upon its speedy completion.

The behaviour of that active gang of simians was so extraordinary that I determined to wait
and see the thing out.  I therefore remained where I was, at such a distance that my presence
would not be likely to disturb or alarm them, and kept my telescope focused upon them, with
the result that I soon began to realise, from their behaviour, that, rapid as were all their
movements, the monkeys were nevertheless taking considerable pains to preserve silence.  I
noticed that none of them attempted to drag the thorns after them through the grass; every
branch was carried at arm's length overhead; and when it was passed up to those on the top
of the rock it was not permitted to scrape or grate against the surface of the rock, but was
carefully held away from it, although it was evident that some of the monkeys got more or less
severely pricked during the process.  I also observed that those monkeys who were actually
engaged in the construction of the scherm laid the bunches of thorns in place with elaborate
care and, as it appeared to me, with quite amazing skill and cunning.

Some ten or twelve minutes after I had come to a halt the scherm was finished, and then came
an end to the silence which the monkeys had been at such pains to observe during the progress
of the work; for, with its completion, the creatures set up a sudden chattering and howling
and shrieking which distinctly reached me even at the distance of a good half-mile.  And with
the outbreak of the clamour, all hands beat a precipitate retreat from the surface of the rock,
and arranged themselves in a circle round it down below, at a sufficient distance away to enable
them to see anything that might happen on the top of the boulder.  But what, I asked myself,
could happen up there; why had those monkeys taken the trouble to construct that fine scherm;
and why, in the name of fortune, were they exerting themselves to create such a terrific row?
The answer was not long in coming; for, as I sat there intently scanning the scene through
my telescope, I saw the head and about six feet of the body of an enormous python upreared
from inside the scherm, its appearance being greeted by a yell of delight from the monkeys
that caused Prince to snort and stamp with excitement.  I saw the huge reptile up-rear itself
still further and attempt to get out of the scherm; but it could not do so without crawling
over the hedge of thorns, and the moment that its body touched these it recoiled, its immense
jaws gaped open, its tongue flickered in and out, and I could in imagination hear its angry
hisses as plainly as I could hear the howls of derision and defiance with which the monkeys
greeted its appearance.

And then I understood, or believed I understood, the whole thing.  The python, doubtless, had
its lair somewhere in the immediate vicinity of the boulder, the flat top of which was probably
its favourite basking place; the troop of monkeys, perhaps gambolling about on the face of
the adjacent cliff, had chanced to see the huge snake lying asleep upon the rock, and, instantly
seizing the opportunity to take their enemy at a disadvantage, had, with diabolical ingenuity,
hastened to enclose the creature in a circular fence of thorns, from which it now seemed that
it would find it impossible to escape--for I saw it make several attempts, at various points
around the circumference of the scherm, and upon each occasion, when it essayed to crawl over
the thorns, it shrank back, baffled by the innumerable sharp points which everywhere met it.
At length, after I had watched its unavailing efforts for about a quarter of an hour, I cantered
up to the rock--putting the monkeys to flight amid a chorus of angry protests--and, after a
careful survey, proceeded to climb to the top, taking the precaution to carry my rifle with
me.  I now found that the scherm, constructed of small branches of formidable thorns--each
thorn being nearly three inches long, and sharp-pointed as a needle--was about waist high,
a yard in thickness, and some ten yards in diameter, completely hemming in the great python,
who was now wideawake and rapidly circling the interior of his prison, in an atrociously bad
temper, vainly seeking some spot through which he might force his way and escape.  But the
monkeys had evidently known quite well what they were about; instinct or observation had taught
them that, once completely surrounded by a ring of thorns, the creature could not possibly
escape, because its every effort would result in the self-infliction of so many severe wounds
that it would rather remain a prisoner than persevere.  And that was precisely what was happening;
the moment that, in attempting to crawl over the barrier, the python's ponderous weight was
thrown upon the encircling fence, the long, sharp thorns pierced it in twenty or thirty places,
and already, as it circled inside the enclosure, it was leaving a broad trail of blood behind
it and emitting a powerful, sickening, musky odour which I only endured with difficulty.  The
creature glared at me murderously every time it came opposite me in its frantic circling of
the scherm, and once made a determined effort to reach me, but the thorns were too much for
it; and finally, when I was at length convinced that it could not possibly escape, I levelled
my rifle and sent a bullet crashing through its enormous head, instantly thereafter beating
a hasty retreat from the top of the rock, in order to avoid the terrific threshing of its convolutions,
which now, in its death agonies, sent the thorns flying in all directions.

CHAPTER EIGHT.

AN EXCITING DAY.

By the time that Piet and I got back to the wagon it was within an hour of sunset; I therefore
decided to remain for the night where we were, the grass being good, and our outspan situated
within half a mile of a considerable stream of water with which we should lose touch upon entering
the gorge, since the river turned eastward immediately opposite the spot where we were outspanned.
But although I decided not to move the wagon until the morrow, I was not disposed to remain
personally inactive; for I had observed that about two miles to the eastward the river flowed
through a slight depression, which had thus become converted into a water vley, or wide sheet
of shallow water, where I thought it not improbable that I might find a few widgeon to afford
a welcome change from the buck meat that had now become our almost continuous fare.  Moreover,
I had begun to break to the saddle the two ponies which Moshesh had given me, and had already
advanced so far in the matter of their education that they would both allow me to mount them,
and I regarded the present as a favourable opportunity to give Jack, the stallion, a little
gentle exercise.  Therefore I instructed Piet to shift my saddle from Prince to Jack, and,
taking my double-barrelled sporting gun and a few cartridges, I mounted and cantered away along
the river bank, with Thunder and Juno, the two dogs, bounding gaily along on either hand, and
with Jack pulling hard upon his snaffle and doing his utmost to break away, for he was so fresh
as to be almost unmanageable.  A good brisk five-mile gallop over the veld to the farther extremity
of the vley, however, somewhat calmed his exuberant spirits, and when at length I dismounted,
the youngster was placid enough to be quite willing to follow at my heels with the bridle resting
loosely upon his neck, or to stand still when it was allowed to trail upon the ground.

The sun had already vanished in a haze of regal purple hanging low along the western horizon
when at length I managed to bag three brace of the widgeon that I had been hoping for; and
with these neatly strung together by the feet, and slung across Jack's shoulders in front of
the saddle, I was just preparing to mount and canter away back to camp when, looming monstrously
through the thin, grey mist that was insidiously rising from the veld, I beheld a long procession
of enormous forms gradually resolving out of the fog wreaths about half a mile away. Vague
and shapeless as were those vast, ghostly objects, I knew at once that they could only be elephants
coming over the veld to the great pool to drink and bathe; and I at once determined to ascertain,
if possible, how many of them there were, for I estimated that there must already be between
twenty and thirty in sight, while others were momentarily emerging into view from out the veil
of mist.  Therefore, instead of mounting, and thus rendering myself more conspicuous than I
was already, I remained on foot, and headed for the nearest clump of bush with Jack and the
two dogs following at my heels, my intention being to conceal myself and my following behind
that convenient screen and thence observe the movements and note the numbers of the approaching
elephants.  But I had scarcely advanced thirty paces when there arose a sudden commotion in
the long grass almost under my feet, a terrific uproar of angry grunts and squeals rent the
evening stillness, and a sounder of hog, consisting of a boar, three sows, and upwards of a
score of half-grown young, which had been lying in the grass, rose to their feet and dashed
noisily away, the sudden and violent disturbance startling Jack to such an extent and so completely
upsetting his equanimity that he flung up his head, swerved away before I could grasp his bridle,
and with a squeal of consternation took to his heels and dashed off full pelt in the direction
of the distant wagon, while the two dogs, wild with excitement, went off in chase of the pigs,
leaving me to my own devices.

To be left like that, alone and on foot, in strange country, a good five miles from the wagon,
with the darkness of a moonless and misty night already gathering about me, was just a trifle
awkward, perhaps, for I was both hungry and tired, and a five-mile walk through the long grass
would be something beyond a joke.  But with the river to guide me on the one hand, and the
hills on the other, I could not very well miss my way, while as for the pony, he would probably
return to the wagon, and the dogs would certainly find me as soon as they were tired of chasing
the pigs; so, shouldering my gun, I stepped out toward the clump of bush for which I was bound,
and presently took up a position within its heavy shadow where I should be pretty effectually
concealed, while I could at the same time observe the movements of the elephants.  Luckily,
they were still so far away when the disturbance caused by the pigs occurred that they had
taken no notice of it, but came steadily on, led by an enormous tusker; and presently they
made their way well into the deepest part of the pool, where, after drinking, they stood for
some time spraying their bodies with water spouted from their trunks.  I did my best to count
them, but before the entire herd had arrived upon the scene it had fallen quite dark, so that
what with the darkness, the fog, and the constant movements of the animals, I found the task
an utter impossibility.  But I came to the conclusion that, from what I could see and hear,
there must be nearly or quite a hundred of them.

Then, as I stood motionless and invisible in the deep shadows of the clump of bush, soft swishing
sounds in the long grass grew increasingly frequent all round me, and in the misty starlight
I caught frequent sudden glimpses of indeterminate forms gliding ghost-like toward the water,
which was evidently the recognised drinking place for most of the game in the neighbourhood.
And at length, when I had been standing there for about twenty minutes, two pairs of lambent
orbs loomed up through the long grass, and Thunder and Juno came wriggling apologetically to
my feet, having apparently made their way back to the spot where they had deserted me, and
tracked me thence by scent.

I had by this time seen all that I wanted to see, or rather all that it was possible to see;
therefore, with a low-murmured call to the two dogs, I set out to walk back through the misty
landscape to the wagon, taking the stars for my guide, since the fog had by this time become
so thick that it was difficult to distinguish anything beyond a hundred yards distant in any
direction.  Fortunately I had walked little more than a mile when shouts in Piet's high-pitched
voice reached my ears, and presently, guided by my shouts in reply, the Hottentot hove in sight,
mounted upon Tempest and leading the errant Jack by the bridle-- the latter having galloped
straight to the wagon, as I had fully expected he would; and half an hour later we rode into
camp without further adventure.

The first thing in order after our arrival was, of course, dinner, which I found quite ready
when I rode into camp, the piece de resistance consisting of the widgeon which I had shot,
and which Piet had found still hanging across the pony's withers when Master Jack arrived in
camp, and had had sense enough to hand over to Jan to prepare.  Then, after dinner, the elephant
gun and my rifle were brought forth from the wagon and thoroughly cleaned by the light of the
camp fire; and while this was being done Piet and I anxiously discussed a programme for the
doings of the morrow, finally settled upon a more or less definite plan, and made all the arrangements
necessary for carrying it into effect; after which the fire was made up, the oxen were driven
in and tethered to the trek tow, as a precaution against possible attack by lions, and all
hands turned in.

The night passed uneventfully and quietly, save for the constant barking of the jackals and
baboons and the occasional cry of a leopard or roar of a lion; but we had by this time grown
quite accustomed to such sounds as these, and were not in the least disturbed by them, even
the dogs disdaining to take the slightest notice of them, except when the authors approached
within certain fairly well-defined limits which Thunder and Juno seemed to have mutually agreed
were too near; then indeed our guardians would respond with low warning growls which, if the
offenders drew still nearer, rapidly merged into a deafening clamour of savage barks that effectually
aroused everybody.

But on the night in question the marauders gave the wagon a wide berth; probably there was
a sufficiency of game near the water-hole to supply all their wants without the necessity for
them to approach the hateful blaze of the camp fire, and our rest was undisturbed.  With the
appearance of the first gleam of dawn in the eastern sky, however, the three blacks crawled
out from underneath the wagon, made up the fire afresh, fetched water from the river, and proceeded
to prepare breakfast, for Piet and I had agreed upon the wisdom of getting upon the spoor of
the elephants as early as possible, in order that the greater part of the travelling might
be done before the heat became oppressive.

It was about a quarter to seven o'clock when, having breakfasted and completed our final preparations,
Piet and I swung ourselves into our saddles and started for the water-hole at an easy canter,
Jan's instructions being to follow with the wagon until he should reach a certain signal which
we would leave behind us, and which was to be the intimation that he had trekked far enough
and must outspan until he received further orders.  Piet was mounted on Punch, the chestnut,
a thoroughly steady and reliable animal, and carried the provisions for the expedition, half
the ammunition, and the elephant gun; while I rode Prince, and carried the other half of the
ammunition and my rifle, as well as a stout, double-edged hunting knife which I wore in a sheath
attached to my belt.  Thunder and Juno accompanied us as usual, and, like the sensible animals
that they were, trotted quietly along close to the horses' heels, saving their strength for
what was possibly to come later, instead of wasting it, as in their younger and less experienced
days, by dashing hither and thither, in the exuberance of their spirits, over an utterly unnecessary
extent of ground.

Going at an easy pace, we reached the farther extremity of the pool in about three-quarters
of an hour, and at once picked up the spoor of the elephants without the least trouble.  It
was very difficult to form a close estimate of the number of animals in the herd by examining
the spoor, but it was certain that the herd was a very large one, and an inspection of the
footprints left in the soft soil about the margin of the pool showed that there were several
animals of gigantic size in it. The spoor led away to the eastward, in the direction from which
I had seen the herd approaching on the previous evening, and the passage of so many heavy animals
had trampled the long, parched grass so flat that the trail was as plain as a road to follow,
and we proceeded along it at an easy canter.

We had been progressing in this fashion for about three hours, and had covered some twenty
miles of perfectly flat country, when we observed that the character of the scenery ahead was
changing, the scattered clumps of bush through which we had been riding giving place to forest
trees of various descriptions, imparting quite a park-like aspect to the scene.  And here we
came to a halt for the purpose of setting up the mark which was to give Jan, my Hottentot driver,
the signal to outspan, for Piet was strongly of opinion that the herd of elephant would be
found somewhere in the forest ahead, either browsing upon the small and tender shoots of the
trees or sheltering from the sun beneath their leafy shade.  This done, we looked to our weapons,
satisfying ourselves that they were in order for immediate use, and then again proceeded along
the trail, this time at a walking pace.

The trail continued to lead straight toward the forest; but when we had proceeded about a mile
farther the spoor showed that the herd had gradually scattered, some of the animals seeming
to have halted for a time to feed, while others had swerved off to right and left, as though
to enter the forest individually, instead of in a compact body.  We were thus enabled to pick
up the spoor of particular animals, and, coming at length upon that of an elephant of extraordinary
size, I determined to follow it, and did so right up to the outskirts of the forest.  Here
we dismounted, and, leaving our horses, with their bridles trailing on the ground, where we
could easily find them again, but where they were not likely to be sighted by the elephants,
continued to follow on foot the spoor of the big beast that we were after.  It led deviously,
with many twists and turnings, toward the deepest part of the forest, and when we had been
following it for about three-quarters of an hour we were suddenly halted by the sound of a
distant swishing and cracking of branches, which caused us to conceal ourselves hurriedly behind
the bole of a big yellow-wood.

Reconnoitring from this coign of vantage, we found that the animal, or animals, by which the
sounds were made were still invisible; we therefore continued with the utmost caution to follow
up the spoor of the elephant which we were tracking, dodging from one tree to another, pausing
behind each as we reached it to take another observation, and being careful to make no sound
as we threaded our way through the underscrub, until we finally reached a spot where, peering
out from behind the trunk of a big baobab, we were able to catch an occasional glimpse of an
enormous grey mass moving slowly among the trees, while the sound of swishing and snapping
branches, the crackling of the undergrowth as the creature moved from time to time, and an
occasional low grunt of satisfaction told us how near we were to our quarry. Luckily, too,
for us, the wind was in exactly the right direction--that is to say, it was blowing from the
elephant toward us, so that instead of him scenting us we caught an occasional whiff of the
peculiar odour which emanated from him.  The extreme deliberation with which the animal moved
proved conclusively that thus far he had not the slightest suspicion of our presence, but unfortunately
the foliage was so dense that it was only occasionally that we could get even a partial glimpse
of him, and then it was of such a character that I could not tell with certainty what part
of his body I was looking at; therefore, after a very brief and low-whispered consultation
with Piet, I decided to make a rather wide circuit toward the part of the forest for which
the creature was heading, and, having chosen a favourable spot, patiently to await his approach.

This we accordingly did, the fallen trunk of a tree half-buried in dense undergrowth affording
us a perfectly ideal ambush; and we had scarcely settled ourselves comfortably therein when
a violent swaying of the underbrush warned us that our quarry was approaching.  The next instant
the scrub parted right and left, the points of two enormous tusks protruded from the swaying
tangle of leaves and creepers, and in the drawing of a breath the head and fore quarters of
the biggest bull elephant I had ever seen came into view.  For a moment the huge beast stood
looking about him, and then his immense trunk swung upward, the point twined itself tightly
about an unusually leafy twig, there came a slight snapping and swishing sound as the twig
was torn from its parent branch, and the next instant both stem and leaves vanished down a
cavernous throat.  Then, as the ponderous trunk swung downward again, and the beast uttered
a grunt of enjoyment, I pressed the trigger of my elephant gun, the barrel of which I had levelled
over the bole of the fallen tree a minute or two earlier: there was a flash, a blinding puff
of white smoke, and as the forest resounded with the crashing report, an answering crash close
at hand proclaimed the fall of the great beast. Then, as the smoke gradually drifted away,
we saw that the animal had flung himself convulsively forward at the impact of the bullet,
and now lay stone-dead just on the other side of the prostrate tree behind which we were crouching.

For several seconds after the echoes of the report died away there was perfect silence in the
forest: not a leaf seemed to stir or a bird to twitter; even the very insects ceased their
chirring, as though they were wondering what had happened.  Then, almost as though at a given
signal, the forest resounded with loud trumpetings of alarm and the crashing of heavy bodies
through the undergrowth, as the rest of the unseen herd began to move restlessly and angrily
hither and thither, seeking the source of the sudden disturbance.

We remained where we were, crouching in our ambush, for a quarter of an hour or more, listening
to the gradually subsiding disturbance and waiting for the possible appearance of one of the
great pachyderms in the tiny clearing where the dead giant lay; but although several passed
us at no great distance we saw none of them, and at length, when silence again reigned, we
cautiously emerged from our hiding place and pushed our way up-wind still deeper into the recesses
of the forest.

Breathless and perspiring profusely with the exertion of worming our way through the undergrowth,
we had progressed about half a mile when, away on our left, and apparently only a few yards
distant, we suddenly heard a loud blowing sound, followed by several grunts, and the next instant
a big cow elephant, with a calf at her heels, burst through the intervening growth and came
charging toward us with blazing eyes and uplifted trunk thrust straight out in front of her.
Fortunately we had just stepped out from behind the cover of a big mahogany, and as I doubted
whether the beast had actually sighted us, I thrust Piet back behind the tree and instantly
followed, working round the bole as the elephant advanced, so as to keep it between her and
ourselves.  Whether or not she had winded us I cannot say, but I am of opinion that she must
have done so; be that as it may, she continued her furious charge, actually grazing the other
side of the tree behind which we were hiding as she passed, and in another instant had disappeared
again, leaving a broad trail of trampled undergrowth and broken saplings behind her.  For the
ensuing five minutes we remained where we were, fully expecting the irate beast to return in
search of us; but hearing nothing more of her we resumed our way.

About a quarter of a mile farther on we became aware that elephants were not far-distant, for
away ahead of us there was a sound of heavy movement, accompanied by a good deal of grunting.
Then suddenly an angry squeal pealed out upon the startled air, immediately followed by a violent
clashing of tusks, furious trumpetings, and a tremendous commotion generally.

"Olifants fighting, baas!" excitedly whispered Piet in my ear.  "Now's de time for us: come
on quick, baas, we get close up to 'em and they never see us; then you get 'em bofe."

"Right you are, boy," I returned; "come along; they cannot be very far ahead."

We pushed on, not troubling ourselves very much now as to whether or not we made any noise,
for the forest was fairly ringing with the squeals and trumpetings of the contending beasts;
and presently we caught an occasional fleeting glimpse, through the interlacing foliage, of
their twisting and rushing bodies as they moved hither and thither.  But we were not yet near
enough to see them distinctly; we therefore forced our way a few yards farther, until, peering
through the tangled undergrowth, we obtained a tolerably good view of a little clearing of
about an acre and a half in extent, in the midst of which two gigantic tuskers were circling
round each other, looking for an opening, and occasionally rushing in with lowered heads to
plunge their already ensanguined tusks into each other's bodies.

Kneeling down among the underwood in such a position that I could get a clear view of the amphitheatre
without running much risk of being myself seen, I found a gnarled stump of a creeper that afforded
a very convenient rest for my heavy double-barrelled elephant gun, and, roughly levelling the
weapon, awaited a favourable opportunity to fire.  A few minutes later it came, the two huge
beasts drawing apart, as by common consent, to recover their breath.  Like two immense statues
they stood, about twelve feet apart, motionless save for their heaving flanks and their great
twitching ears, the trunk of each upraised and thrown back over the head as though to be out
of harm's way; and I saw that both were bleeding freely from several ghastly-looking wounds.
The moment was as favourable as any that I should be at all likely to get, for both were standing
practically broadside-on to me; therefore, glancing quickly from one to the other, to determine
the precise position of the vital spot for which I intended to aim, I levelled and sighted
the weapon, pressed the trigger, and then, with a lightning movement of the barrel, shifted
my aim and again fired.  The second report followed the first at an interval of scarcely a
second, and I heard the loud clap clap of both bullets as they struck; then the thick veil
of powder smoke enveloped me, and for a few seconds I could see nothing.  While still waiting
for the smoke to disperse, I heard a heavy thud which told me that at least one of the animals
was down, and a moment or two later, as the smoke gradually thinned, I dimly saw the second
standing, with legs wide apart, swaying a little and trembling violently.  For a space of time
in which one might have slowly counted ten the great brute stood thus; then, as he uttered
a low moan, his mighty limbs suddenly collapsed and he too sank to the ground with a thud that
seemed to make the very earth tremble.  And at that precise moment there again broke forth
the same kind of uproar of alarmed trumpeting and swiftly moving heavy bodies that had followed
my first shot.

The sounds were this time of such a character as to indicate clearly that the herd had been
thoroughly alarmed and effectually stampeded; therefore, after waiting some five minutes or
so until the forest was again silent, and it had become quite clear that none of the animals
were coming in our direction, we left our hiding place, and, taking careful note of the spot
where the two great tuskers lay, proceeded to retrace our steps toward the place where we had
left our horses.  We found them placidly grazing, and, springing into our saddles, started
on the back trail to meet the wagon, which I intended to outspan for the night close to the
outskirts of the forest, that we might not have far to carry the ivory when we had cut it out
on the morrow.

We proceeded at a foot-pace, since there was no need for hurry, and had travelled a distance
of some three miles when, borne faintly to our ears by the gentle breeze that was blowing behind
us, we heard a peculiar yapping howl which told us that a pack of wild dogs was in full cry
somewhere in our rear.  Being curious to learn what kind of animal they were hunting, we looked
about us for a spot whence, ourselves unseen, we might witness the chase, which the increasing
loudness of the cries told us was coming our way.  Such a spot was found close at hand in the
shadow of a big clump of thorn bush, within a few yards of the margin of a small stream, evidently
a tributary of the river which flowed a mile or two farther to the westward.

We had scarcely established ourselves in our place of concealment when a beautiful zebra mare,
accompanied by her foal, appeared coming toward us at a trot, which circumstance, taken in
conjunction with the laboured action of the animals, clearly indicated that both were in the
very last stage of exhaustion; and indeed the fugitives had only gone a few yards past us when
the mare stumbled heavily, recovered herself with difficulty, and then, with a scream that
marked the extremity of her terror and despair, crashed heavily to the ground, where, after
an ineffectual effort to scramble to her feet again, she lay flat on her side, panting heavily
and with her tongue protruding.  And as the mare fell the foal pulled up short beside her and
stood, with lowered head and legs wide apart, trembling so violently that the action was visible
even to us nearly a hundred yards away.

By this time the yapping sounds had become so loud that we knew the pack must be close at hand,
and a moment later they swept into view, some thirty or so in number; and as they sighted the
prostrate zebra, with her foal standing beside her, their yapping changed to a howl of exultation,
which caused the mare again to make an ineffectual effort to scramble to her feet, while the
foal hobbled away a yard or two, but returned to his dam when he saw that she was unable to
rise.  It was a rather pathetic sight to see those two beautiful animals awaiting destruction
at the fangs of the dogs, and, moved suddenly by a sense of pity, I pressed my heels to Prince's
flanks, and, calling Piet to follow, rode forward into the open.

At the sight of two mounted figures advancing to bar their progress the pack suddenly pulled
up in a bunch and stood panting, with their tongues lolling out and the foam dripping from
their jaws, for the wild dog does not love to meet man, especially a white man, at least in
daylight.  As the pack bunched themselves together, uncertain whether to continue their advance
or to retire, but evidently very strongly impelled by the sight of the fallen zebra to do the
former, it offered a target so tempting that I was quite unable to resist it; and, leaping
lightly from the saddle, I ran forward a pace or two and, sinking upon one knee, levelled my
rifle and fired right into the thick of the bunch.  The range was only about four hundred yards,
and while the sharp, whip-like report of the piece was still echoing along the side of the
range of hills in front of me I heard the clap of the bullet, and, as the smoke drifted away,
saw that one dog was down, dead, while a second was struggling feebly on the ground, and a
third, with a broken leg, was making the welkin ring with his howls of anguish.

At the flash and report of the piece some eight or ten of the dogs in the rear of the pack
wheeled sharply round, and, with their tails tucked tightly between their legs, beat a hasty
retreat along the back trail, uttering sharp yelps of terror as they went; but the remainder
of the pack stood its ground, staring at us as though wondering what new kind of animals we
could be who had the power of slaying from a distance. There was one big gaunt brute, however,
apparently the leader of the pack, who kept his flaming eyes fixed upon the zebras, and as
the smoke of the discharge cleared away I saw him slink out from the rest of the pack in a
crouching attitude, with bared fangs, as though meditating a dash at the gasping mare.

"The gun--quick!"  I ejaculated to Piet, who retained his saddle and sat motionless as a statue,
watching intently; and at the word he held out to me the loaded elephant gun, and received
from me the empty rifle in its stead.  A moment later the heavy piece roared out its death
message, and the big brute who had separated himself from the rest of the pack sprang with
a convulsive twist into the air and fell stone-dead.

"Now," said I, as I sprang into the saddle, "unclip one of your stirrups, Piet, and we will
see if we cannot beat off the brutes with our stirrup irons!"  And as I spoke the words we
urged our horses to a gallop, unclipping our off-side stirrups as we went, and charged right
down between the pack and the zebras, wheeling upon the dogs as soon as we had cut them off
from the mare and foal.  Then, swinging the loose stirrups round our heads, we thundered down
upon the discomfited pack, uttering loud yells as we went.  The brutes stood irresolute for
a few seconds longer, but presently, when we wheeled directly toward them, they turned tail
and bolted by the way that they had come, yelping with fear as they went.  But I was determined
to inspire them with a wholesome feeling of terror now that I had begun; therefore as soon
as we had overtaken the rearmost members of the flying pack we checked our horses just sufficiently
to keep pace with them, and then proceeded to belabour the brutes soundly with our stirrup
irons, the howls of anguish to which the belaboured ones gave vent serving to add wings to
the feet of the rest.  We chased the howling mob a good two miles--by which time its members
were crazy with fear--and then drew rein, feeling convinced that they would give us no further
trouble.  Then we turned and cantered back along the way by which we had come.

As we approached the spot where the zebra mare had fallen we saw, somewhat to our astonishment,
that the poor beast still lay where we had left her, with the foal standing over her, smelling
at her and licking her face; and it then occurred to me that possibly we might be able to capture
the foal.  I therefore spoke a word to Piet, and we pulled our horses back to a walk.  As the
sound of our approaching hoofs reached her ears, the mare made a scrambling effort to rise,
and all but succeeded, only to sink again to the earth with a moan, while the foal threw up
his head, galloped stiffly away a few yards, and then returned, standing close to his prostrate
parent's head and gazing at us with enquiring eyes, his ears pointed forward, his nostrils
twitching, and his upper lip slightly raised, revealing his teeth in a somewhat threatening manner.

At a distance of about seven or eight yards we reined up and dismounted, moving slowly and
with deliberation, in order that we might frighten the animals as little as possible.  Then,
throwing our reins to the ground, we walked quietly up to the pair and stood looking down at
the mare, who still lay upon her left side, with her limbs stretched stiffly out, her sides
heaving with a slow, laboured movement, her tongue hanging from her mouth, her glassy eyes
rolling in their sockets, and her breath coming in heavy gasps.

"She's dyin', baas," remarked Piet, "dyin' of tiredness and thirst!  She mus' have run a long,
long way when she too tired to get up at sight of we."

Yes, there was no doubt about it, the poor beast was at her last gasp; and unless something
were quickly done to relieve her she would assuredly die.  Piet and I were both wearing soft,
wide-brimmed felt hats, of sufficient capacity to contain about three pints of water and to
retain it without very much leakage for several minutes, while there was a stream within twenty
yards of the spot where we stood.  It was possible that we might yet save the beautiful creature's
life if we bestirred ourselves.

"Quick, Piet!"  I exclaimed.  "Come to the river with me and fill your hat with water.  We
must do what we can for the poor brutes.  I should like to capture and tame them both if possible."

"No, baas, you never do that," answered Piet.  "Don' you know that a zebra can never be tame?"

"So I have heard; but I don't altogether believe it," said I.  "At all events I mean to try;
so hurry, you black rascal!"

In less than five minutes we were back with our dripping hats still nearly full of water, and
as I knelt down by the head of the mare, and held my hat close to her gaping nostrils, the
poor beast smelt the water and uttered a sound that might be best described as a sort of gasping
whinny; then, raising her head with an effort, she plunged her muzzle into the hat and sucked
up its contents with indescribable eagerness, allowing her head to sink back with something
that sounded like a sigh of contentment when both hats had been emptied.  Then Piet and I dashed
off to the river and procured a second supply, which the zebra also drank.  Meanwhile the colt
had been making desperate efforts to get a share of the water, but we had kept him off, with
some difficulty, the mare being obviously in the greater need.  But now that we had given her
as much as we deemed good for her, for the moment, we turned out attention to the colt, administering
to him two hatfuls of water, which he absorbed with an eagerness that quite equalled that of
his mother. Then, perceiving that the little chap's gratification at our ministrations seemed
to have quite conquered any fear of us which he might have originally entertained, I walked
over to where the horses were standing and detached from Piet's saddle a long rein of twisted
raw hide that we usually carried with us for use in case of an emergency, while the Hottentot
went off to fetch a further supply of water.

Then, having obtained the rein, I returned to the colt--who stood quite still as I approached
him--and, murmuring a caressing word or two to him, quietly lifted my hand and gently patted
his neck.  He flinched somewhat at my first touch, but did not attempt to run away, and presently,
when Piet returned with more water, I seized the opportunity to slip the end of the rein round
the little fellow's neck and knot it while he was drinking.  He did not much like the feel
of the rein round his neck at first, and tried to shake it off, but he no longer shrank from
my touch, and allowed me to pat his neck, and even pull his ears gently, an operation which
he appeared to enjoy greatly.  Then, while I continued to handle the colt, Piet again turned
his attention to the mare and gave her a further drink, when, after a few minutes, she made
another effort to rise, which was this time successful.  But for several minutes she could
only stand with difficulty, trembling violently and not attempting to move.  At this juncture
I chanced to slip my hand into my jacket pocket, when it came into contact with some half-dozen
small sweet biscuits for which I had rather a weakness.  These I had slipped into my pocket
the last thing before leaving the wagon and had then entirely forgotten; and the fancy seized
me to offer one of them to the colt.  He smelt at it for a moment or two, and then, somewhat
hesitatingly, closed his teeth upon it and began to masticate it. Evidently he liked it, for
having swallowed it he thrust forward his head, as though asking for more, whereupon I produced
a second, which he at once accepted.  I then offered a third, holding it far enough from him
to compel him to advance a step or two in order to secure it, which he did.  I next offered
him a fourth in the same way; but as he moved forward so did I, compelling him to follow me
a few steps before I let him have it, at the same time putting a gentle strain upon the rein
round his neck, and by this means I successfully coaxed the little creature into submitting
to be led.

When I had fairly got him going the mare followed, at first moving stiffly and with difficulty,
uttering small whinnying sounds, as though entreating the colt not to leave her; but with every
yard of progress her movements became less difficult, and by the time that we had traversed
a quarter of a mile both animals were walking with comparative ease and following me quite
contentedly, especially the colt, who continued to beg for biscuits until he had exhausted
my limited supply. Meanwhile Piet, who clearly understood what I was endeavouring to do, returned
to where we had left the horses and followed with them, and in this curious fashion we at length
met the wagon, and, joining forces, arrived at the spot where I planned to outspan for the
night.  I had a little trouble with my captives when we first met the wagon, both of them being
somewhat startled by the hideous yells and rifle-like whip-crackings wherewith Jan urged forward
the oxen; but a few more biscuits, hastily obtained from the wagon, restored the colt's equanimity.
And, not to dwell at undue length upon this incident, we had scarcely any further trouble with
either of our prizes, the colt very rapidly developing perfect amenability, while the mare,
although less tractable, never attempted to desert her offspring, and was becoming quite tame
when tragedy unhappily overtook them both.

CHAPTER NINE.

I ARRIVE IN MASHONALAND.

The whole of the next morning was devoted by us to the task of cutting out the ivory from the
three big tuskers killed in the forest, and the exceptional size of the elephants may be judged
from the fact that the weight of ivory taken from them amounted in the aggregate to four hundred
and forty-seven pounds.  Then, about two o'clock in the afternoon, we inspanned the oxen and
trekked in a north-easterly direction, with the range of hills cut through by the curious gorge
about a quarter of a mile on our left and the Drakensberg range of mountains towering aloft
on our right some fifty miles distant.  We trekked until within half an hour of sunset, by
which time we had rounded the north-eastern spur of the range of hills, passed the northern
extremity of the gorge, and "struck" another river, about one hundred and twenty yards in width,
flowing northward, on the right bank of which we outspanned for the night.  Two days later,
trekking northward along the course of the last-mentioned river, we arrived at its junction
with the Limpopo, on the farther side of which lay my goal, Mashonaland; and here we again
outspanned, while Piet and I went on a prospecting tour in search of a drift by means of which
the wagon might be safely taken across.

Leaving the wagon, our spare horses, and the zebras in charge of Jan, the Hottentot driver,
with strict injunctions that he was to take the utmost care of the captives, and treat them
with the greatest kindness, Piet and I set out at daybreak--the former mounted upon Punch,
while I rode Prince as usual--taking with us the elephant gun and my rifle, with a sufficiency
of ammunition for each, and provisions for four days.  The dogs Thunder and Juno accompanied
us as a matter of course.  We were on the right or southern bank of the mighty stream, and
this we followed closely, mile after mile, anxiously scrutinising every foot of the turbid
flood for signs indicative of a sand bar extensive enough to enable us to transport the wagon
to the opposite bank; but although we found no less than four shoals in the course of our first
day's search, three of them extended less than halfway across the river, while the fourth proved
to be a quicksand in which we narrowly escaped losing both our horses, saving them at last
only by the skin of our teeth and after nearly an hour's hard and strenuous labour.  This occurred
about three o'clock in the afternoon, and when at length we were all once more safe on solid
ground we were, horses as well as men, so utterly fagged out that there was nothing for it
but to off-saddle for the remainder of the day in order to recover.  A good night's rest, however,
completely restored us all, and enabled us to resume our search on the following morning.

Our experiences on the morning of this day were simply a repetition of those of the previous
day, except that, profiting by experience, we took care not to allow ourselves to be trapped
in any more quicksands; and I began to fear that our search was going to be a much more protracted
one than I had anticipated.  But shortly after midday we arrived at a spot where, on the opposite
side of the river, another river, about a hundred yards wide, discharged into the main stream.
At this point also the Limpopo widened out until it was fully a quarter of a mile in width,
the combined effect of these two circumstances being the formation of numerous eddies and so
much slack water that the soil held in suspension by the two streams was here afforded an opportunity
to settle and form a shoal extending right across the main river, with a maximum depth of water
over it of barely four feet.  This shoal we thoroughly tested both on foot and on horseback,
with the result that we found it to be an ideal crossing place.

Having satisfied myself as to this, my next business was to arrange for the dispatch of Piet
as my ambassador into the Mashona country.  I had been considering the matter very carefully
during the past two days, recalling to mind all that my friend, Major Henderson, had told me
with regard to his experiences among the Mashona, and the advice that he had given me; and
I finally determined that my most prudent course would be to send Piet into the country absolutely
empty-handed, with a message to the effect that I desired the permission of the king to cross
his borders, traverse the country, and visit him at his Place, hunting and trading with his
people on the way.  I was at first somewhat undecided as to whether or not I should entrust
Piet with a present for the king, but I finally decided that it would be better to wait until
I should obtain audience with His Majesty and then personally hand him the gift; otherwise,
for aught that I could tell to the contrary, the sable monarch might seize the gift and then
do away with poor Piet in some horrible manner, while if the Tottie went empty-handed there
would be no inducement for the king to destroy him, or rather there would be the prospect of
the gift to deter him from doing so.  Therefore, upon the following morning, after charging
the man with my message, and making him repeat it over and over again to me until there was
no possibility of his forgetting it, I sent him across the river on foot with all the provisions
that we had left, and then, riding Prince and leading Punch, to whose saddle I had securely
strapped the elephant gun and my stock of ammunition, I set out, accompanied by the dogs, on
my return to the spot where I had left the wagon.

Upon my arrival I found Jan, my Tottie driver, in great tribulation, it appearing that he had
been beset by lions during the second night of my absence, and that the brutes had killed no
less than three of the oxen and both zebras, despite the utmost efforts of himself and 'Ngulubi,
the Bantu voorlouper; while two other oxen had died through eating tulip, a poisonous plant
which he had too late discovered grew in profusion in the immediate neighbourhood of the outspan.
Furthermore, it appeared that four of the other oxen had suffered severely from the same poison,
but had been saved by the prompt administration of a decoction made from the roots of the plant.
This was serious news, because I had promised Piet that he should find us outspanned at the
spot where he and I had parted, and I knew not how soon he might return; therefore it was very
desirable that we should reach that spot without delay.  After considering the matter, therefore,
I finally decided to cache all the ivory which I had with me, abandon the pelts, and go forward
to the rendezvous with nothing in the wagon save the "truck" which I had brought up with me
as presents and for trading, the ammunition, and the remains of our stock of provisions, which
by this time was becoming pretty well depleted.  And this I did, arriving at the arranged meeting
place three days later, without suffering any further loss.

It was well on in the afternoon of the tenth day after Piet's departure when he turned up again,
dusty, leg-weary, and somewhat footsore, but otherwise not very much the worse for wear.  He
reported that the country was pretty densely populated, the kraals being very extensive, and
dotted over the country at intervals of, in some cases, not more than twenty miles apart, the
first kraal at which he arrived being within ten miles of the river bank.  He described the
Mashona as being a very fine race of people, almost if not quite equal in physique to the Zulus,
but of a much more suspicious and unreliable character than the latter, and apparently exceedingly
averse to the intrusion of strangers. Nevertheless, upon stating the nature of his mission,
he had been passed on from kraal to kraal until finally he had arrived at Gwanda, the Place
(or town) of King Lomalindela, which, it appeared, was situated among a rather curious group
of mountains, five days' march from the river.  Lomalindela, it seemed, had received my envoy
with a very considerable display of austerity, and had submitted him to a most rigorous cross-questioning;
but, luckily, the Tottie had nothing to conceal, and was therefore able to tell a perfectly
straightforward story, which, as Piet believed, had not only allayed the monarch's suspicions,
but had also aroused in him a very lively curiosity to see the white man and his wonderful
fire tubes which slew from afar.  The result of the mission was therefore, on the whole, quite
satisfactory, the king having not only accorded me permission to enter his country and kill
game in it, but also entrusted my messenger with an invitation to me to visit him at Gwanda,
and remain there as long as I pleased.  This being the case, and the river having fallen nearly
a foot since Piet and I had first arrived at the ford, I seized the favourable opportunity,
and safely transferred the wagon and all my other belongings to the Mashona side of the river
upon the afternoon of the day of Piet's return; and, following the course of the stream to
which I attributed the formation of the ford--and which, Piet informed me, led direct to Gwanda--outspanned
for the night some six miles to the northward of the Limpopo.

The next day we continued our trek, and shortly before noon arrived at the first Mashona village
on the route.  It was a place of some importance, containing about a thousand huts of the usual
beehive shape, but somewhat larger than those usually built by the Zulus, and with entrances
large enough to enable a man to pass through by merely bending his body instead of having to
go down upon his knees.  The village was circular in plan, and was protected by a solidly constructed
stockade, built of stout tree trunks driven deeply into the ground, with a slight outward slope;
the stockade being about sixteen feet high on the outside, with the tops of the piles sharpened
to render it unclimbable. There were four gateways in the stockade, giving access to the two
principal streets, which crossed each other at right angles, intersecting in the centre of
the village, at which point there was a spacious open square, where the public business of
the village was transacted and where the village sports were held.  We did not enter the village,
but outspanned at a distance of about half a mile from its eastern gate.

The cattle had scarcely been turned loose to graze, under the guardianship of 'Ngulubi, the
voorlouper, when the headman of the village, accompanied by some half a dozen minor dignitaries,
and followed by ten women bearing baskets containing preternaturally skinny fowls, eggs, green
mealie cobs, sugar cane, and calabashes of milk, emerged from the village and advanced upon
the wagon.  The men were unarmed, and the presence of the women with the baskets--the contents
of which were of course a present to us--showed that the visit was to be one of ceremony and
compliment; therefore with Piet's assistance I at once proceeded to unpack one of my bales
of "truck", and withdrew therefrom the articles which I proposed to present in turn.  I had
hardly completed my preparations when the little party arrived, and I had an opportunity to
study the first Mashonas I had ever seen.

Both men and women were finely built and well proportioned, but their best friends could not
conscientiously pronounce them handsome; and their unattractiveness was further increased by
the expression of their countenances which seemed to be compounded of suspicion, craftiness,
greed, and cruelty.  They saluted me respectfully enough, however, offered their presents,
and then sat down, at my invitation, squatting upon their heels in the usual native fashion,
while I sorted out the gifts which I intended to give them.  These consisted of a bandana handkerchief
or two, a few yards of gaudily printed calico, a few yards of copper wire, and a handful of
mixed beads to each of the women; and from the grins of appreciation of the recipients I concluded
that they were all well satisfied.  Then, with the inquisitiveness of the lower type of savage,
they began to question me, not in a straightforward fashion, but covertly and by roundabout
processes, with the view of discovering my motive for journeying so far from my own people;
whereupon I told them frankly that I was a hunter and trader, seeking for ivory and gold. 
They did not seem to understand what I meant by "gold" until I spoke of it as the yellow metal
that shines when polished, and showed them the ring that I wore; whereupon they nodded their
heads in comprehension, and shortly afterward rose and returned to the village.  But about
half an hour later the headman and three others came back to the wagon, bringing with them
a number of rough-shaped nuggets of a dull, ruddy-yellow gold, which looked as though they
might have been crudely smelted out of the quarried ore, and wanted to trade them with me for
beads and printed calico.  The quantity which they brought amounted to about twelve pounds
avoirdupois altogether, which I estimated to be worth between six and seven hundred pounds
sterling; but they fixed such an exorbitant value upon the metal that had I acceded to their
demands my stock of trade stuff would soon have been exhausted. Of course the gold was worth
far more than my entire stock of "truck", but when I purchased the latter I had quite reckoned
upon being able to obtain for it as much gold as I could possibly load upon the wagon, and
still have "notions" enough left to supply all the presents that I should probably find it
necessary to make; therefore as soon as my visitors pointed out to me what they required in
exchange for their gold I laughed at them, waved them away, and proceeded--not too hurriedly--to
repack my treasures.  The result was what I had anticipated and intended; they refused to leave
the wagon, and gradually reduced their demands until finally I obtained the whole of the gold
for about two yards of calico, a bandana handkerchief, four yards of copper wire, and a handful
of beads; and even these prices, I explained, were far higher than I could possibly afford
to give in future!

I fully anticipated that the result of this transaction would be to bring out the remainder
of the villagers with proposals to barter such gold as they might possess; but although so
many of them turned out that by sunset I estimated that every man, woman, and child in the
village must have visited the wagon, I saw no more gold that day.  And for a very good reason;
for it afterwards appeared that the headman had spent a busy afternoon going round the village,
buying up every particle of gold he could lay hands upon, doubtless with much profit to himself:
and on the following morning, while we were inspanning the oxen, he turned up, accompanied
by a couple of women bearing between them nearly sixty pounds of gold, and detained me more
than two hours while he haggled with me over the sale of it.  But I had by this time come fully
to understand that gold possessed absolutely no value for these people, except as a plaything
for the children; and the result was that when at length I bade the man goodbye, and gave the
order to trek, the fellow was glad to let me have the whole at my own price, and I secured
it upon very favourable terms.

I was now in high feather, for I had already secured, from one village alone, more than seventy
pounds of gold, which I estimated must be worth close upon four thousand pounds sterling; and
if I could do so well at only one village, what might not I achieve by the time that I had
traded away all my "truck"?  Already, in imagination, I saw myself back at Bella Vista, with
the house rebuilt and furnished in luxurious style, the land amply restocked, and plenty of
money in the bank as well! Alas, I little guessed what lay before me; and it was just as well,
perhaps, that I did not; otherwise--But I must not get ahead of my story.

With my head full of pleasant visions, and my imagination busily employed in the construction
of chateaux en Espagne, we proceeded upon our journey, travelling over undulating country which
ahead manifested a disposition to become hilly, and still closely following the course of the
stream, until, about noon, we arrived in the midst of what in the distance had appeared to
be a cluster of curiously shaped kopjes, but now proved, to my great surprise, to be ruins,
thickly overgrown with vegetation.  Here, my curiosity being powerfully aroused at so unexpected
a sight, and it being also time to outspan, I called a halt; and while Piet busied himself
in the preparation of my midday meal, I took my rifle and sauntered off to examine the ruins.

They proved to be very much more extensive than I had imagined, for when I came to inspect
them at close quarters I found that the structures which had at first attracted my attention
formed but a very small part of the whole, the greater portion of the buildings having been
razed to the level of the ground, large heaps of rubbish and the foundations being all that
now remained, with the exception of the ruins above-mentioned, of a town or village that had
originally covered more than a hundred acres of ground.

But it was to the ruins which had originally arrested my attention that I now chiefly devoted
myself, entirely forgetful of the fact that a meal was awaiting me at the wagon.  And these
remains I found to be extraordinarily interesting, for I had not been among them ten minutes
before I became convinced that they were the work of a people of far higher intelligence than
the Mashonas--that they must indeed have been built by a race having some pretensions to civilisation.
For, while the walls were for the most part built of dry rubble masonry, the lintels and doorposts
were of dressed stone, and--most remarkable circumstance of all--were in many cases adorned
with sculptures in low relief, of a character strongly resembling those which I had seen portrayed
in pictures of Egyptian ruins.  For example, there were figures of men ploughing with oxen,
driving laden asses, leading by the horns antelopes which were perfectly recognisable as the
oryx and springbok, others leading baboons, leopards, giraffes, dogs, lions, and elephants,
human figures with heads of birds, lions, and rams, and figures of sphynxes with human heads,
or the heads of rams.  And these figures were not by any means the rough efforts of uncultured
savages; on the contrary, they were distinguished by a precision of line, a delicacy yet firmness
of touch, and an artistic beauty that could only have resulted from a very high state of civilisation
and culture.

The buildings appeared to be mostly circular in plan, ranging from about thirty to fifty feet
in diameter, with walls averaging three feet in thickness, one or more of these being surrounded
by an outer wall, approximately elliptical in plan, of some five feet in thickness.  There
were five of these structures still standing in a sufficient state of preservation to render
them recognisable at a distance as buildings, and a great many more--the precise number I did
not trouble to ascertain--of which nothing but the foundations remained.  I prowled about among
these intensely interesting remains for several hours, until close upon sunset in fact, examining
them and striving to puzzle out their origin, and then made my way back to the wagon, where
I found Piet and Jan rapidly working themselves into a fever of anxiety about my prolonged
absence, and earnestly debating the propriety of instituting a search for me.

So profound were the interest and curiosity aroused within me by these remarkable and mysterious
relics of a lost and forgotten civilisation that when Piet awakened me on the following morning
with my early cup of coffee and the enquiry whether it was my pleasure that the oxen should
be inspanned, I determined to devote at least a few hours to their further examination, and
issued my instructions accordingly.  Then, as soon as we had all breakfasted, I ordered Piet
to take the sporting double-barrel while I carried my rifle, and, with the two dogs accompanying
us, set out to complete my inspection.  But, beyond the finding of an elaborately sculptured
stone sarcophagus, which we took the liberty of breaking open, and which contained a mummified
human body and several earthenware utensils decorated with exquisite paintings--one of which
I appropriated and carried away--we discovered nothing further that was worthy of particular
mention; and about two o'clock in the afternoon we inspanned and resumed our journey.

An hour later, however, at a distance of some three miles from the ruins, we arrived opposite
a hill of solid rock some four hundred feet in height and about a mile long, in the face of
which I observed what I at first took to be the mouth of a cave; but, looking at it more closely,
I presently perceived alongside it a great mass of debris.  My curiosity again got the better
of me, and, calling a halt, I walked over to it and proceeded to examine it at close quarters,
with the result that I soon convinced myself that the "cave" and its accompanying mound of
debris could be nothing else than an ancient working; while upon entering the opening, which
extended inward and downward for a distance of nearly half a mile, I discovered evidence enough
to prove that the working was that of an extraordinarily rich gold mine, visible gold showing
everywhere in the worked face of the rock!  And at once the idea seized me that if I could
but contrive to ingratiate myself sufficiently with Lomalindela, His Majesty might be induced
to grant me a concession to work the mine, and so place me in possession of wealth "beyond
the dreams of avarice".  I thought at first that possibly this might be the identical mine
from which the gold in my wagon had come, but a close examination of the working at length
convinced me that the rock had remained untouched for ages; and then it occurred to me that
perhaps the dead and forgotten inhabitants of the ruined village which I had so recently left
might have been the miners.

And now, with every mile of our progress, the country became more broken and hilly, and at
the same time more open and park-like, the great masses of bush and scrub with which we had
so long been familiar giving place to trees of handsome appearance and noble proportions, growing
for the most part singly, but occasionally in clumps of from three or four to a dozen or two,
while occasionally the clumps magnified themselves sufficiently to justify the term of a wood,
or even a small forest; moreover, the grass was in places profusely dotted with beautiful flowers,
while where the trees grew most thickly they were often enwreathed with parasitic growths which,
if they were not actually orchids, very strongly resembled them, the blooms they abundantly
bore being of the most remarkable and often most beautiful shapes and colours.  Thus the broken
character of the country, with its accompanying features of swelling hills, scarred here and
there with foaming rivulets, ravines, and gorges hemmed in and overhung by lofty trees garlanded
with flowering parasites, and intermingled in places with luxuriant shrubs--some of which bore
leaves of such curious shapes and brilliant colours that they might easily have been mistaken
for flowers--and with birds of strange forms and gaudy plumage flitting hither and thither,
was a most agreeable change from the characteristic scenery of South Africa.  It was a beautiful
and very fertile country, taken as a whole, and the nearer that we drew to Gwanda the more
forcibly was this fact borne in upon me, as also was the further fact that the Mashonas were
a very powerful nation, so far at least as numbers were concerned; for every kraal at which
we arrived was bigger and more important in every way than the one that preceded it.

The evening of the sixth day after we had crossed the Limpopo found us outspanned upon the
left bank of the stream which we had been closely following from the moment of our passage
of the river, with a lofty, flat-topped mountain range, some fifty miles long, on our left
hand, springing from the plain close to the opposite margin of the stream, and on our right
two enormous mountains, some twenty miles apart from peak to peak, and remarkable for their
exceptional height--which I estimated at fully fourteen thousand feet--as well as from the
fact that they were identical not only in shape, but also apparently in size and altitude.
In shape they were almost hemispherical, and to add to their similarity each bore on its very
summit a protuberance very much resembling in appearance a beehive-shaped Kafir hut, but much
larger, being probably quite two hundred feet in height.  The tops of these remarkable mountains
were covered with snow for a distance of about two thousand feet from the summit, and very
beautiful they looked, blushing a soft, delicate pink in the last rays of the setting sun.
The ground between the two mountains--which I took to be a pair of long-extinct volcanoes--
and the range on our left rose steadily, and therefore somewhat retarded our progress when
we continued our trek on the following day; but about two o'clock in the afternoon we reached
the summit of the slope and saw before us a valley or basin, roughly circular in shape and
some twenty miles in diameter, hemmed in on all sides by hills, some of which were lofty enough
to be snow-capped on their summits; and in the very centre of this valley lay Gwanda, the Kraal
or Place of Lomalindela, the king of the Mashona nation.

It was an immense place, far exceeding in dimensions the biggest native kraal that I had ever
yet seen.  It was circular in plan, like the other Mashona kraals that I had passed on my way,
and, also like them, it was intersected by two main roads or streets, crossing each other at
right angles in the centre of the kraal, one road running due north and south, while the other
ran east and west.  Each of these roads was about two and a half miles long, with a great gate
at either extremity, pierced in the high and strong circular palisade which completely surrounded
the kraal; and at the point where these two main roads intersected in the centre of the kraal
each was widened in such a manner as to form a great square about one hundred and sixty acres
in extent, this doubtless being the spot where all business of a ceremonial character was conducted.

That some such business was impending we shortly afterward became aware, for during the descent
of the wagon into the valley we were overtaken and passed by regiment after regiment of warriors,
all decorated in full war paraphernalia; and the induna of one of these informed me that a
general muster was proceeding, in preparation for the annual festival, which was to be held
on the day after the morrow.  During the remainder of that day we beheld an almost continuous
stream of armed men converging upon the town, not only by way of the road along which we were
travelling, but also from passes in the mountains all round the valley.

When the wagon had arrived within about a mile of the southern gate of the town I was met by
an official, who bore me a formal message of welcome from the king, with an intimation that
His Majesty would see me on the morrow.  The officer also indicated a certain spot, about half
a mile outside the south gate and near the bank of the stream, where he suggested I should
outspan the wagon, explaining that the king was of opinion that I would be more comfortable
out there, in comparative seclusion, than in the overcrowded town, an opinion with which my
own completely coincided.  And this opinion was strengthened to absolute conviction when, as
the sun sank behind the western mountains and the soft, tropical night settled down upon the
valley, our ears were assailed by a perfect babel of sound emanating from the town, which,
even at the distance of half a mile, rendered sleep almost impossible. What it would have been
like to be lodged in the midst of the storm focus I trembled to think.

The din above hinted at was kept up until such a preposterously late hour that it was not until
early in the morning of the following day that I finally fell asleep, with the result that
I rather overslept myself; and when Piet brought me my usual cup of coffee he at the same time
brought me an intimation that envoys had already arrived from Gwanda with a message from the
king, to the effect that His Majesty was now prepared to grant me an interview.  I did not
hurry, however, but rose and dressed with more deliberation than usual, for my experience is
that a savage--even although that savage happens to be a king--respects a white man in direct
proportion to the time that the latter keeps him waiting; therefore I directed Piet to inform
the messengers that I was not yet ready to receive them, but would do so as soon as I had partaken
of breakfast.  I kept the men--it required six of them, it appeared, to bring the king's message--about
an hour, and then condescended to interview them, sending them back with an intimation that
I was about to select from among my treasures certain articles which I intended to offer as
gifts to His Majesty, and that when I had done so I would so far honour him as to call and
make the presentation in person.

I delivered this message with all the aloofness and dignity of manner that I could muster,
and was gratified to observe that it was not without its effect upon the king's envoys, who
accorded me the salute of "'Nkos'!" upon their departure.  Then, as soon as they were gone,
I unpacked my bales and proceeded to sort out and set aside the gifts which I intended to offer
for His Majesty's acceptance.  By dint of a little artful questioning I had contrived to gain
the information that King Lomalindela was a man of about my own stature and build, and I kept
this information in mind when selecting my gifts.  I assumed that, as in the case of King Moshesh,
a military uniform would prove the most acceptable gift that I could possibly offer a savage
monarch; and upon examining my stock in trade I discovered that I possessed the complete uniform
of a sergeant of hussars--tunic, pelisse, trousers and boots combined, shako with red and white
horsehair plume complete, and a sabre--which, upon trial, seemed to fit me pretty well, if
perhaps just a shade tight.  I therefore decided upon this, together with a length of some
two and a half feet of brass chain, the ends of which I united by a split ring, to which I
attached one of my small circular shaving mirrors; and to this I added a dozen little brass
boxes full of mixed beads, these last being intended as gifts for the king's favourite wives.
Then, putting the whole in a parcel which I entrusted to Piet's care, I mounted Prince, and,
accompanied by my trusty Hottentot henchman on foot, set out to traverse the short distance
between the wagon and Gwanda.

The arrival of a white man in the Mashona country was evidently a quite unique event, exciting
the utmost curiosity in the minds of the inhabitants--indeed, I subsequently learned that such
a thing had never happened since the memorable visit of my friend Major Henderson and his partner,
Van Raalte, consequently it was only a very few of the older men who had ever beheld a white
man before; for as I rode along at a foot-pace, with Piet respectfully walking in my rear,
the whole way was lined on either side by thousands of men, women, and children, who had turned
out for the express purpose of beholding such an astonishing spectacle, this, it appeared,
being rendered all the more extraordinary by the fact that horses were unknown to the Mashonas,
and not one of them, save the half-dozen or so elders above-mentioned, had ever so much as
heard of a mounted man!  Therefore my slow progress was marked by a continuous volley of "Au's!"
uttered with the hand held over the mouth, indicative of the utmost astonishment and awe. 
The same sort of thing, only in a very much more marked degree, prevailed inside the town,
every one of the inhabitants of which appeared to have made a point of turning out to witness
my arrival.  I rode right up through the main street of the town as far as the great square
of which I have spoken as occupying its centre, and there, finding that the entire square was
lined with troops in full panoply of war--from which I surmised that my visit was intended
to be regarded as a state function--I dismounted, and, still carrying my trusty rifle, turned
my horse over to the care of a savage who seemed to be more than half-afraid of the animal.
Then, with Piet following close at my heels, I passed through a gap which had been hastily
made in the line of troops, and found myself in the great square--and in the presence of King
Lomalindela.

CHAPTER TEN.

I FIND MYSELF IN AN EXCEEDINGLY AWKWARD DILEMMA.

The king--as to whose identity there could be no possible mistake--was seated in the very centre
of the great square upon some sort of throne, the precise shape and material of which I could
not make out, for it was entirely hidden by an immense and magnificent kaross of lions' skins;
and formed up in a semicircle behind and around him were about a hundred warriors, the arms
and accoutrements of whom were of so elaborate and splendid a character that I at once judged
them--rightly, as it afterward turned out--to be chiefs.

But since the king was seated in the exact centre of the great square, there was still a space
of nearly four hundred and fifty yards separating us when I passed through the line of warriors;
therefore, for the moment, I could only take in the general effect of the group, and very imposing
it was.  For, with the exception of some half a dozen elders, every one of those chiefs was
in the very prime of life, ringed of course, standing fully six feet in height, each one of
them bearing the scars of many battles--as I perceived when I drew near--and evidently men
who knew not the meaning of the word fear.  And in every respect worthy of them was their king,
whom, as I approached, I saw to be a man apparently of about thirty-five to forty years of
age, splendidly proportioned, and probably quite as tall as the tallest of his chiefs, although
I could only judge his height approximately, since he was sitting down.  Unlike his warriors,
however, he was naked, save for the usual mucha or apron of monkeys' tails round his loins,
and a superb leopard-skin kaross over his shoulders; and he was also unarmed, save for a bangwan
or stabbing spear with an enormous blade, which he held carelessly across his knees as I approached.
But I did not like the expression of his countenance, or indeed that of any of the Mashona,
which seemed to me to be compounded of craftiness, treachery, and ferocious cruelty.  Moreover,
His Majesty seemed to be in anything but a good humour--perhaps I had kept him waiting rather
too long; for as I approached near enough to note the expression upon his features I observed
that his brows were contracted into a heavy frown, and there was a certain glitter in his eyes
that I by no means liked.  However, if he chanced to be striving to daunt me by his scowling
looks it was important that he should be made to understand that he had by no means succeeded;
therefore, walking slowly and with all the dignity I could assume, I marched straight up to
him, and, looking him fearlessly in the eyes, halted about ten feet from him, and, giving him
a military salute, remarked, in the Bantu tongue:

"Greeting, Lomalindela, King and Lord of the Mashona!  I, Edward Laurence, one of the mighty
English race, salute thee!"

"I see thee, white man of the unpronounceable name," answered the king somewhat ungraciously.
"Ye desired audience of me, and I have given it you; say now, therefore, why have ye come into
my country, and what want ye now that I have permitted you to enter it?"

"Nay, O King," I retorted, "beyond what you have already given me-- namely, permission to hunt
in your country--I want little or nothing, except permission to trade with your people.  There
is gold in Mashonaland, which is a metal that, so far as I have thus seen, ye have little use
for; but among my own people it possesses a certain value: therefore have I come hither, bringing
with me goods which I am prepared to barter for gold among your people, if they will.  But
if not, it matters not; I can buy ivory with those goods on my way back to mine own land. 
Also, I am seeking a young white 'ntombozaan who was stolen from among us some twenty-two moons
ago, and carried off into the interior, whither I know not.  I think she cannot have been brought
so far as this; yet, who knows?  Have you heard or seen aught of such an 'ntombozaan, O King?"

"I have not, white man, nor is she in Mashonaland, for otherwise I should have heard of it
and seen her," answered Lomalindela.  "The few strangers who enter my country are brought to
me, and I deal with them as I will.  No, she has not been here; therefore that part of your
errand is soon disposed of.  And as to the other part of it, I will consider the matter at
my leisure.  Have ye aught else to say to me?"

"Merely to ask Your Majesty's acceptance of certain gifts which I have brought with me.  Is
it the king's pleasure that I produce them?"  I blandly enquired.

An expression of covetousness flashed into the king's eyes as he nodded and replied briefly:

"Yes, you may produce them."

I beckoned to Piet, who, as my supposed body servant, had been permitted to enter the great
square with me, and he at once stepped forward with the bundle containing the presents, which
he laid at my feet.  Then deliberately, and with as much ceremony as I could infuse into so
commonplace an act, I unfastened the bundle, extracted the items of uniform one by one, unfolded
them, and held them up for inspection.  The king regarded each garment attentively and somewhat
wonderingly as I held it up, but did not appear to be very profoundly impressed; and I began
to fear that my great coup was about to miss fire.  When, however, I came to the sword, drew
it from its scabbard, flourished the glittering blade round my head, and made several cuts
and points at an imaginary enemy, His Majesty sat upright in his chair and began to manifest
a little more interest.

"Is that one of the white man's fighting weapons?" he demanded, stretching forth his hand for it.

"It is," answered I, as I handed it to him.  And forthwith I proceeded to explain to him how
it was used.  He examined the weapon with much curiosity, ran his thumb along the edge, remarked
that it was not very sharp, and then, to my unutterable dismay, handed it back to me, saying:

"Good!  Thou shalt show me how it is used.  One of my warriors, armed with spear and shield,
shall fight thee!"

For a second or two I was too dumbfounded to speak.  I knew that savages were subject to queer
and unexpected turns of thought, but this was a development that I had never foreseen even
in my most fantastic imaginings, and I was utterly at a loss as to how I was to deal with such
an extraordinary situation.  It was not that I was exactly afraid to meet a savage in mortal
combat, for I had often done so before; but that was on the field of battle, when my opponents
were the enemies of my race, thirsting for the white man's blood, and when my only choice lay
between killing and being killed.  But to deliberately engage in a cold-blooded duel with a
man against whom I had no grudge, and to incur the obligation of killing or being killed merely
to gratify the whim of a savage monarch, was quite another matter, and one that, to confess
the simple truth, I had no fancy for.  Yet how to escape the dilemma I knew not, though it
was forcibly borne in upon me that it would never do for me to betray the slightest hesitation,
for savage kings are kittle cattle to deal with, and to cross even their lightest mood may
often result in a ghastly tragedy.  Therefore, more in the hope of gaining time than for any
other reason, I said:

"Nay, O King, it were mere waste of good material to slay one of thy warriors in order to show
thee how this weapon is used, nor is it necessary; I can make the matter quite clear to thee
without killing a man, and will do so in due time.  Let me now proceed to display the remainder
of my gifts;" and hastily diving into the parcel I produced the length of brass chain with
the shaving mirror attached, held it up for an instant that all might see, and then placed
it round my own neck, to show how it was to be worn.  And at that moment what seemed to me
to be a brilliant inspiration seized me, and I began to talk somewhat hurriedly, in the hope
of diverting the king's mind from the idea of the suggested duel.

"This," said I, removing the chain and mirror from my neck and offering it to His Majesty,
"is great magic, for it enables a man to see himself. Behold!"  And I held it up so that Lomalindela
might see the reflection of his own visage in it.  He took it doubtingly and hesitatingly in
his hand--for there is nothing a South African savage dreads so much as magic or witchcraft--and
a low, awestricken ejaculation of "Au!" escaped him at what he beheld.

"And that is not all," I continued.  "This magic disk enables its owner to see what is happening
behind him.  As thus:" and I slightly turned the mirror in his hand as he held it, in such
a fashion that he could see the faces of the various chiefs who stood behind him.

"Finally," I proceeded, "it has the power of temporarily blinding an enemy, and so giving its
possessor power over him--thus:" and, as I spoke, I turned the mirror in such a fashion that
it flashed the rays of the sun right into the eyes of several of the soldiers lining the square,
who, despite the awful breach of discipline involved in the action, incontinently raised their
shields as the dazzling reflection struck their eyes.

"Au!" ejaculated Lomalindela in awestruck tones, as he handled the mirror doubtfully; "it is
great and good magic, for it enables a man to see the enemy who comes creeping up behind him,
and to blind the enemy who assails him in front.  I thank thee, white man.  Thou shalt show
me how to use it too."

"Certainly," I replied hastily.  "All in good time.  And now, lastly, behold! here are boxes
of beads for thy favourite wives, wherewith they may adorn themselves."

The king took the brass boxes, one by one, in his hands, turned them over and looked at them,
and then calmly drew from the lobe of his right ear an ivory snuffbox about the same size,
and substituted therefor one of the other boxes, amid low murmurs of admiration from the chiefs
in his rear.

"It is good; and again I thank thee, white man," he remarked, as he placed the remaining brass
boxes in the hands of one of the chiefs, with a low-murmured order, the purport of which I
could not catch.  "Yes, it is good," he repeated, turning to me.  "But what are these things
good for?" he enquired, pointing to the little pile of clothes which I had replaced in the bundle.

"Listen, O King, and I will tell thee," I replied.  "In the land where the white men live there
are kings even as there are in this land; and-- also as in this land--they are men undistinguishable
from other men, save by their clothing.  Also, as in Mashonaland, the king is a soldier, the
chief and general of all his troops; and he is distinguishable from all others by the magnificence
of his clothing.  Therefore, when I decided to visit Mashonaland, and the matter of suitable
presents arose in my mind, I decided that I could not possibly offer anything more suitable
and acceptable to the King of Mashona than the garb of a soldier such as a king wears.  And,
behold, there it is!"

"Au!" ejaculated Lomalindela, regarding the little heap with new interest.  "Is that, then,
the garb that the king of the white men wears?"

"Even so," I answered, straining the truth a little.  "It is the garb of a soldier, and that
is the kind of garb which a white king wears upon state occasions, such as a review of his
troops, or upon the occasion of some very great and important ceremonial."

"Good!" ejaculated the king.  "Thy gift comes most opportunely. To-morrow is the day of the
great annual festival in Mashonaland, when I review all my soldiers, and when the witch doctors
smell out those who are my secret enemies.  I will wear it then.  But thou, white man, must
show me how each thing is used, for I have never before seen anything like them."

"Assuredly I will," said I.  "Shall it be now?"  The king considered for a moment, and then
answered in the affirmative, at the same time beckoning to a certain chief, an elderly, grey-headed
man, and giving him an order; whereupon the chief--whom I assumed to be deep in his monarch's
confidence--left his place in the semicircular cordon behind the throne, and, advancing to
where the bundle lay at my feet, lifted it reverentially and bore it away to a large, rectangular
hut--which I took to be the itunkulu, or king's house--at the far corner of the square, whither
Lomalindela and I forthwith followed him.  This hut, which was about fifty feet long by about
forty feet broad, and some seven feet high to the eaves of the roof, was built of what is known
in Cape Colony as "wattle and daub"; that is to say, the walls had been constructed of interlaced
wattle-work plastered over with mud and allowed to dry in the heat of the sun, after which
they and the roof had been thickly thatched with palm leaves.  This effectually turned the
heavy tropical rain to which the country is subject at certain seasons of the year, and was
also a pretty effectual protection against the scorching rays of the sun; consequently the
interior temperature of such a structure, stifling though it frequently was, was not nearly
so great as that of the outer air.  In this particular case, too, the doorway, unlike that
of the usual Kafir hut, was high enough to permit a full-grown man to enter without stooping;
but, like other Kafir huts, this was entirely destitute of windows, the only light, during
the daytime at least, being what entered by the doorway.  A minute or two, however, sufficed
for the eye to become accustomed to the change of light, and when mine had done so I perceived
that the interior of this particular hut was divided by wattle partitions into apparently three
apartments, two in the front half and the other--which I surmised to be sacred to the king's
emposeni, or harem--occupying the rear half.  The apartment which we first entered was probably
the king's sitting-room, for it contained nothing but a low divan-like arrangement running
all round the walls and covered with rich karosses, while through the doorway leading to the
other apartment I caught an indistinct glimpse of what looked like a rough imitation of a couch
or bed, also heaped high with karosses.

The king lost no time in coming to the point.  He signed to the attendant chief to place the
bundle on the divan, then turned to me and said:

"Now, white man, teach me how to array myself in the garb of the white kings."

"Then," said I, taking up the booted trousers, "this is the first garment which Your Majesty
must don."  And I explained as best I could how he was to clothe himself.  The fact that the
boots were attached to the trousers made the assumption of the garment somewhat awkward, but
luckily the boots were ample in size, and the monarch managed to get his feet into them without
much difficulty.  Then I explained how he must tuck the mucha inside, and when this was done,
and the garment drawn up round his waist, I passed the braces over his shoulders and showed
him how to button them.  The trousers were scarlet--just a little off colour with wear, I am
afraid--with a broad stripe of yellow braid down the outer seam, and the effect was evidently
satisfactory to the king, who walked up and down the room several times admiring himself. 
Then I took up the tunic, and after I had explained how it was worn the induna and I assisted
His Majesty to get into it, and I buttoned it down the front. Next I attached the fur-trimmed
pelisse to one shoulder, adjusted the shoulder belt, threw the brass chain with mirror attached
round his neck, placed the plumed shako on his head, girded the sword about his waist, and
there he stood, a most grotesque yet withal not unkingly figure, fully attired in the uniform
of a hussar.

The effect upon the induna was tremendous; he stood for several seconds gazing open-mouthed
upon the awe-inspiring apparition of his king in the new and strange attire, and then, flinging
himself prone upon the ground with his hands over his eyes, exclaimed:

"It is too much; mine eyes are not strong enough to gaze upon so much splendour!  Bayete! 
Bayete!!  Bayete!!!"

As for the king, his gratification and pride were unbounded: never before, I suppose, had he
beheld any man so completely overpowered with admiration as this old induna; and if such was
the effect of his appearance upon a man with whom he was, comparatively speaking, familiar,
what might he not expect to be the result when he exhibited himself in his kingly attire to
his troops?  He swelled visibly with gratified vanity--for vanity and fear of witchcraft are
the two overmastering emotions of the savage--grinned from ear to ear as he took the mirror
in his hand and gazed admiringly at the reflected image of himself crowned with the smart shako
and its nodding horsehair plume, and finally turned to me with the question:

"Say now, white man, what think ye?  Do I look like a white king?"

"In every respect, Your Majesty," answered I, with several mental reservations.

"Au! it is good; it is very good indeed!" he exclaimed.  "Now am I a white king, and when my
enemies behold me they shall tremble, and their hearts shall melt within them as the snow upon
the mountain tops melts when the glory of the sun shines upon it.  Their courage shall fail
and their spirit shall wither at the sight of me, even as the grass withers and shrivels at
the breath of fire.  I am the king!"

A silence of a few minutes followed this rhapsody, then he turned to the still prostrate induna,
and, kicking him gently in the ribs with his booted foot, exclaimed:

"Rise, Mapela, and behold me!  You must grow accustomed to the sight of me in my kingly garb,
for now that I have it I shall often delight the eyes of my people by wearing it.  Say, now,
shall I go forth this instant and make glad the hearts of the soldiers who are gathered in
the great square by showing myself to them?"

Mapela revolved this very important question in his mind for nearly a minute; then he raised
his head and answered:

"If, O Great, Great One, the words of the humblest of thy servants carry weight with thee I
would say, show not thyself in thy glorious garb until to-morrow.  There are but a few warriors
in the square to-day, so few that they are altogether unworthy of so great an honour as that
which thou dost suggest; moreover, they would go away and babble to others of what they had
seen, and much of the glory and splendour of thy first appearance in those magnificent garments
would be wasted.  Wait until to-morrow, O Elephant whose tread causes the earth to tremble
with fear, and then--when the whole army is gathered together, and all can see thee at the
same moment--thou shalt reveal thyself in all thy magnificent splendour, and--and--words fail
me to predict the result."

"Perhaps thou art right, Mapela the Wise One," answered the king, kindly overlooking--or perhaps
not noticing--the rather lame and impotent conclusion of the induna's high-flown speech.  "Yes;
perhaps thou art right," (this rather regretfully).  "But there is no reason why I should not
at once show myself to my wives; and, by the bones of my royal father, I will!  There be those
among them who of late have shown a tendency to make light of my words and hold me of small
account.  I will see what they will say and how they will act when they behold me as I now am!"

And therewith, Lomalindela, autocrat of the Mashona nation, lord of life and death over nearly
a million people, stalked across the room with his sword clanking at his heels, drew aside
a curtain, and disappeared behind it.  There followed a breathless silence for the space of
perhaps half a minute, a silence deep, pregnant, and almost awe-inspiring; and then there floated
out from the other side of the kaross curtain a little shriek in an unmistakable feminine tone
of voice, a shriek expressive of mingled astonishment, awestruck wonder, and delight, immediately
followed by a perfectly deafening clamour of exclamations and laughter from at least fifty
women--if their number might be gauged by the volume of sound that they created--amid which
might be imperfectly caught, at intervals, the deep tones of Lomalindela's voice, raised apparently
in remonstrance, entreaty, and indignation.

Mapela, the Wise One, and I glanced enquiringly at each other, and methought that even in the
semi-obscurity of that darkened interior I could detect the ghost of a twinkle of amusement
in the old induna's eyes; for my own part, I remember that I was grinning from ear to ear as
my imagination conjured up a picture of the scene which was enacting behind that curtain. 
The shouts, exclamations, laughter, and remonstrances increased rather than diminished as the
moments sped, and presently Mapela came to me, took me by the arm, and gently led me from the
itunkulu, saying as he did so:

"Come, 'mlungu; let us go.  A king is but a man, after all, among his women folk, and it is
not seemly that you and I should linger and hear more of what is passing yonder."

Once safely away from the itunkulu, and beyond reach of the unseemly sounds which issued therefrom,
Mapela conducted me to the group of chiefs still gathered round the royal chair and introduced
me to them severally and individually; then, discreetly and with a certain air of mystery,
he hinted to his fellow indunas that the investiture of the Great, Great One had been successfully
accomplished, with such amazing and magnificently splendid results that it would be well for
them all to spend the night in preparing to be astonished, for on the morrow they should find
themselves overwhelmed with wonder and admiration.  And finally, he threw out a cautious feeler
with the object of ascertaining whether perchance it had occurred to me that it might be politic
on my part to confirm the excellent impression which I had already made by bestowing upon him
and his fellow indunas a small--a very small--modicum of the inestimable treasures which they
all knew my wagon must still contain.  To this I replied that the idea was at that moment the
one uppermost in my mind, and that I gladly availed myself of the opportunity afforded by the
king's temporary absence to invite them to call upon me in a body as soon as possible, to receive
my largesse.

Then I, in turn, took up my parable, and, in humble emulation of Mapela's engaging frankness,
hinted that if by any chance the king--or anybody else--should feel moved to display a feeling
of friendliness to the extent of bestowing upon me a return present, I wanted nothing of actual
value--such as spears, shields, and the like--but would gladly accept as much of that useless
stuff, gold, as people might desire to force upon me, the accumulation of gold being one of
my chief hobbies; eccentric, amusing, perhaps even ridiculous, but--well, there it was. And
I accompanied my final statement with a shrug of the shoulders which I intended should express
deprecation of my own folly.  I intercepted a glance and nod of intelligence and amusement
which passed round the circle at this naive confession of folly on my part, and at that moment
the king, shorn of his temporary glories, and with a distinct frown of annoyance upon his royal
brow, emerged from the itunkulu and stalked towards us. He has the everlasting gospel to preach
to the people. The burden of his ministry is, “Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour
of his judgment is come.” The evening or time of the end is reached, the hour of God’s judgment,
the time of the bride’s especial preparation for the coming of the bridegroom. This God’s pure
ministry has been preaching for the last two decades. Sectism is in a fallen condition. It is
fallen into the depths of worldliness. She has opened her bosom and invited the world in to revel
with her.

She has prepared a potion of charming delusive spirits, by which she has intoxicated and inflamed the
blood of nations. In the last few years the concerts, fairs and socials are frequented by
both the professed Christians and non-professors, and in their dress, conversation, and general
manner, they are undistinguishable. Sectism to-day in not enticing people to enter her fold
by preaching the everlasting gospel, but she allures them by her seducing love decoction of
lewdness, worldliness and licentiousness. Babylon is fallen.

Some of the Old Testament texts contain a spiritual import. 51:6. This language is especially forcible
at this present day. We have reached the time of the Lord’s vengeance.

The woman (mystery Babylon and her daughters) sitting upon the scarlet-colored beast had a
golden cup in her hand. Rev. 17:4. The day was, as we have before spoken, when God did save some
souls in sectism and gave them the Holy Spirit’s power. But Satan has succeeded in emptying
the golden cup of that which was divine and filled it with intoxicating potions that have
allured nations to commit fornication with her. 51:8, 9. Babylon can never be healed. She
will not be healed. She is irredeemable. Destruction is her doom.

“Forsake her and let us go every one into his own country.”

Hear the lamentation of the children of God in their captivity in Babylon: “By the rivers of
Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon
the willows, in the midst thereof. For there they that carried us away captive required of us
a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of
Zion. How shall we sing the Lord’s song in a strange land?” Psa. 137:1-4.

Perishing souls in sectism would love to serve God better, but in their captivity they can
not sing the songs of praise and glory.

Babylon.

By thy dark deceptive waters, Sighing, moaning, troubled sea, Captives sing their songs of sorrow, Hoping,
longing to be free.

Who shall sing the songs of Zion On thy banks, O raging sea? The voice of bridegroom and the
bride Is heard no more at all in thee.

Golden days are gone forever, Days now dark and dreary be; Harps untuned
and silent ever, Silent by the moaning sea.

Sadly weeping stands the willow On thy shore, O surging sea; ’Neath its shade my steps shall
never, Never, never more shall be.

“Zion” is a metaphor, signifying “Jerusalem, which is from above,”
or the church of God.

It is the home of the saints, where they are cared for by the Lord. As the ancient literal city
of Babylon typifies the great spiritual Babylon, so the literal city of Jerusalem typifies
the spiritual Jerusalem or Zion or church of God.

God does not want his people joined unto a sect and under the laws and creeds and authority
of man. He wants the full care of them. However, many of God’s children, through ignorance, have
been induced to seek a home in Babylon. Here they have been taken captive. In this evening
time God is leading them back to Zion. 35:10. The songs of Zion are not to be sung in the barren
land of Babylon. Babylon has gone into Zion and captured God’s devoted children, but God will be avenged.
51:24.

Here is a prophecy relating to this evening time. 50:4, 5. See them coming home to Zion with
the glory of God risen upon them. Halleluiah!

Zion.

In thy clear, transparent water, Peaceful, cleansing, crystal sea, In thy sparkling beauty flowing,
Let me ever sail on thee.

There is music in the ripple Of thy wave, O purest sea; Here we sing the songs of Zion, In a
soft sweet melody.

Peaceful are thy streams forever, Gentle, calmest, tranquil sea; Harps
are tuned to heavenly music; Hear the pleasant melody.

Tree of life is blooming ever On thy shore, O crystal sea; ’Neath
its shade my walk shall ever, Ever and forever be.

Revelation 18:1-5, 16, 17, 23. All that is pure, holy and divine has been driven out of sect
Babylon and leaves its subjects to be ravished by unclean, worldly spirits, devouring their
souls, and leaving the whole an unclean cage.

God has gone out of sectism. He works with them no more; his voice is heard no more in her,
and his call to his people is to “come out of her.” “Flee out of Babylon, and deliver every
man his soul.” God dwells in Zion, and there shines the beautiful light of the gospel. 60:1.

Return
and come to Zion, O captive daughter; unloose the bands of sectism from off thy neck; cast
aside the creeds and tyranny of man; cease the cold forms and frozen
conventionalities, and seek the green pasture fields of Zion, where
there are songs and everlasting joy, and sighs and sorrow come no
more.

Matthew 13th chapter. The field is the world. The Son of man sowing the good seed is the glorious
gospel work of the morning. The enemy that sowed the tares is the
apostasy, which destroyed much of the good seed and sowed discord,
contention, strife and superstition.

The harvest-time is the evening time. The angels are God’s holy messengers.

In the evening of time the Son of man shall send forth his angels or messengers, and they shall
gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity. God is calling
his people out of all confusion and darkness, separating them from sin and the works of man. Such
is the work to be done in the end of the world.

Jeremiah 23d chapter.

In the fifth and sixth verses of this chapter is a beautiful prophecy
of Christ.

From verse nine to verse eighteen he speaks of the wicked doings of apostates.

In verse nineteen he describes the present holiness reformation that is sweeping over the land.
“Behold, a whirlwind of the Lord is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall
grievously upon the head of the wicked.”

Matthew 24th chapter.

In the third verse of the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew we read
of the disciples questioning the Savior concerning the end of the
world.

They say, “Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be
the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?” In answering,
the Savior in the sixth and the following few verses speaks of political
upheavals.

In the eleventh and twelfth verses he predicts the apostasy of the
noonday.

Iniquity abounds, and being yoked up with such evil companions he can not stem the tide of influence.

In
the fourteenth verse the Savior says: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in
all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” This preaching of
the gospel of the kingdom is to be after the apostasy, and just prior to the end of the world.
This is the same as the preaching of the gospel in the end of the world to which the Savior
refers. He has now taken the disciples once down through the whole of the Christian dispensation
to the end of the world.

In the fifteenth verse he begins with them again at the desolation spoken of by Daniel, which
is the destruction of Jerusalem in the year 70 A.D. From the sixteenth to the twenty-second
verse inclusive, he instructs them concerning this abomination. From the twenty-third to the twenty-sixth
inclusive he again speaks of the apostasy. False Christs and false prophets shall arise. In the
twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth verses he speaks of the end of the world. He has now taken them
through the Christian era again down to the time of the end.

In the twenty-ninth verse he leads them back again to the destruction of Jerusalem. This is the work
of God in the time of the end. “Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of
Babylon.” Zech. 2:7. “Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall
fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain,
and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.” Jer.

16:16.

“Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the Lord. 23:1-3.

In
the evening of time God will gather the scattered remnant of his people, but woe be to the
pastors that scattered them. Let the proud lords of sectism repent of their evil doings ere God
visits his woe upon them.

God is gathering out his own into the beautiful light of Zion. We have now reached the time when the above
promise is being fulfilled by the delivering hand of God. Amid the ruins of Babel confusion
the Lord has a remnant which he is gathering home to their goodly fold, in the top of the mountains
of Israel. “Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth.” Ezek.
14:22.

"Have you heard the voice from heaven, Calling in a solemn tone, ’Come,
my people, from confusion, This is not your native home?’

"Do you
know, O ransomed brother, That we stand upon the verge, Where old
time fills up his ages, And the lost will mourn his dirge?

"Yes, I heard, and to my vision Zion’s glory brightly shone; Then I rose and fled the ruin,
Taking not a Babel stone.

"Yes, my soul has come to Zion, On the high and holy way, And I’ve seen all darkness flying, Driven
by the light of day.

[Now the evening light is flashing, God is gathering to their home All the pure and holy remnant
Waiting for the Lord to come.]

"Oh, what myriad souls are sleeping, Soon to wake in judgment-fires; Help, O God, thy remnant
gleaning, Until time indeed expires."

-------------------------------------

I have cast each sectish idol To the mole and to the bat; (Isa.

2:20.) I am feeding on the mountain, And my soul is growing fat. (Ezek. 34:14.)

The Second Coming Of Christ. Jesus went up in a cloud and he is to come again in like manner as he
went up. 24:36. We can know, however, when his coming is near. “So likewise ye, when ye shall see
all these things, know that it is near, even at the door.” Mat. 24:33. The things spoken of
here by which we may know that the coming of the Lord is near, is the gathering together of
God’s elect from out the ruins of Babylon and the world. The work of gathering is now in rapid
progress. The messengers are flying with the everlasting gospel. Soon it will reach all nations.
They are calling, “Come out of her, my people, for the hour of her judgment is come.” Thus we
now see the Savior’s coming is near, even at the door. Even so, come, O Lord Jesus!

He sounds a warning to all to be ready.

“Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not
the Son of man cometh.” Mat.

24:44. What will be the condition of this world when Jesus comes? 24:37-39. Who is not able
to fully understand this?

In the end of the world wickedness and revelry shall be as it was in the days of Noah. 3:13.
The very deepest deceptions shall be upon the people in the time
of the end.

They shall be saying, “Peace and safety,” then sudden destruction cometh upon them.

Just before the second coming of the Savior, and while God is gathering together the scattered
fold of Israel, Satan “shall go out to deceive the nations which
are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog [both forms of
the apostasy], to gather them together to battle: the number of whom
is as the sand of the sea.

And they went upon the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and
the beloved city [Zion].” Rev. 20:8, 9.

We are now living in the time when the sixth angel is pouring his
vial upon the great river Euphrates, and the waters are being dried
up.

Even at this day the state power is favorably inclined toward the
beast power.

The candidate for office is upheld and defends the corrupt city for advantage. The kings of
the earth are committing fornication with her. The state officials are so infatuated with her
delicacies and intoxicated upon her wines that a true child of God can scarcely get a hearing
of justice to-day in the courts. The prophet (ministry), church (so-called), and state, are
the powers engaged in battle against God.

We are living in the time when the sixth angel is sounding. Rev. 9:13. Soon the seventh angel
will stand upon the land and sea and with hand uplifted to heaven
swear by him that liveth forever and ever, that time shall be no longer.

Rev. 10:5-7. That day shall not come unawares upon the children of light. They will be watching
for their Lord to come, when they shall be caught up to meet him in the air and forever be with
him. Amen. 1 Thes. 4:17.

What shall be the doom of the wicked when that great and notable day of the Lord shall come?
1:7-9.

This flaming fire in which the Lord shall be revealed from heaven is the fire that shall come
down from God out of heaven and devour Gog and Magog as they are compassing the camp of the saints
and the beloved city. Rev. 20:9.

Dear saint, our God is able to deliver thee. “Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such
things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless.” 2 Pet.
3:14. The Holy Spirit is in the world searching out and bringing to the light every one that can be
persuaded to accept salvation. Soon he will have gone over the world and gleaned out every one that
is disposed to serve God. The world at large will reject him. His mission will be ended. He will ascend
to the Father. Then as Christ went into heaven he will come again,
taking vengeance on them that know not God, and receiving his own
unto himself.

Then the Savior’s mission will be ended. He will turn all over to the Father, and the three shall
be but one.

“Be ye therefore also ready; for in such an hour as ye think not the
Son of man cometh.” “Prepare to meet thy God.”

The Last Day.

This gospel day is the last day. There never will be another age of time. An age-to-come teacher
is branded by the Word of God and the Holy Spirit, as a false teacher. We need no other age in
which to prepare for eternity.

This is the day of salvation.

“Now is the accepted time.” Now is the day and this is the time for us to accept Christ, and
to be accepted of him. The Word of God holds no promise to you of another day of salvation.
How can man, unless he be wholly subverted, teach another age to come when so many immutable and infallible
texts declare this is the last day and last time? We will quote a few texts on this subject, and
that alone will convince every one that is candid. Are we not to
understand that with this dispensation time is full?

Then it will be the end, and as the seventh angel declares, “Time shall be no more.”

“This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.”
2 Tim.

3:1. These are declared to be the last days, hence there is no other day to come. Only eternity
lies before us when this present time is ended. 1:1, 2. Here again it is declared that the
day of Christ, this Christian dispensation, is the last day, and that “there should be mockers
in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.” Jude 18. How can you expect
another time when this is declared to be the last time?

“Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these
last times for you.” 1 Pet. 1:20. “Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days
scoffers.” 2 Pet. 3:3. “Little children, it is the last time.” 1 John 2:18.

How does John know it is the last time? Because the antichrists that Paul says should come in
the last days have come, therefore John says in the same verse, “We know that it is the last time.”

Many
more texts from both Testaments could be quoted, but surely the reader will not ask for any
more to help him believe it is the last time.

"While false prophets are confiding In a foolish, erring dream, Of
millennial enjoyments, They neglect the cleansing stream.

"O poor sinner, don’t believe them, There will be no age to come; If in life you find not Jesus,
Death will seal your awful doom."

Conclusion Of Part Third.

We have placed before the reader in the best manner we could, considering our limited time, the
beautiful light and wonderful accomplishments of redeeming grace in the morning of this gospel
day. In the apostolic period, we again repeat, the church was the
light of the world.

The Christians believed the whole Word of God. They taught the whole truth and no more. They
lived a pure, holy life just as Jesus lived and just as the Bible declares that Christians must
live. They were fully consecrated to God.

They counted not their lives dear unto themselves. They forsook all to follow Jesus and lived
wholly unto him. They had faith in God and power with him.

They were of one heart and of one soul. They all spake the same thing. They were humble and equal.
They healed the sick, cast out devils, and raised the dead in Jesus’
name.

Thus they were the light of the world.

Now the evening shall be as light as the morning. Man, as a Christian, shall live as pure and holy
and as deeply consecrated in this evening of time as did the Christian in the morning time.
At this present time God is raising up a people who believe, experience
and teach the whole Word of truth.

They have fled the ruins of Babylon and are proclaiming the everlasting gospel in the fear of
God and the clear light of heaven. God is working with his pure and
consecrated ministry, confirming the Word with signs and deeds and
wonders, the same as he did with the early ministry.

There are thousands
to-day who gladly bear testimony to the wonderful healing power of
God. The blind have been made to see, the lame to walk; broken bones
have been united, cancers removed, consumption cured. The deaf have
been made to hear, the dumb to speak, and devils have been cast out.
All these wonders, and many more, have been wrought in the name of
the holy child Jesus in God’s pure church within the last few years.
God is increasing his church in faith, purity, power, and glory, and
in the immediate coming years much greater things than these shall
ye hear and see. Amen.

A Personal Experience.

It is recorded in
the Bible that God will not hear sinners. While this is true it has
its modifications. Those who are in wilful and stubborn rebellion
against God he will not hear, even though in a day of trouble and
fear they should call upon him. But when in the more sober moments
of life man’s heart feels the influence of the Holy Spirit inclining
his desires toward a better life, arousing the nobler aspirations
of his soul, enkindling to a brighter flame the spark of humanity;
when, though he be not in possession of God’s saving grace, under
such an influence he, in sincerity of heart, calls upon God, he will
hear and answer his call as far as consistent with the divine mind,
and thus encourage his soul on to the Christian goal.

Our boyhood
days and the early days of our manhood were spent amid the gay scenes
and pleasures of life. When in the whirl of society-life we had no
serious thoughts. There would, however, in our more secluded hours,
when naught stood between us and the whisperings of our soul, arise
thoughts of futurity. The Holy Spirit would speak to our heart of
God, of heaven, of Christ and the blood; he would hold before us in
a beautiful picture the life of a Christian journeying onward to a
glory world. He would also disclose to our view the hideousness and
awfulness of sin, and the uneasiness, discontentments, trouble and
fear attending the wicked as they journey onward to the eternal region
of woe.

In these more sober hours we would seek God for his protection
with sincere, heartfelt pledges that some day we would serve him.
God heard these prayers and gave his protection. We now in reviewing
the scenes of those early days see the many snares and dangers Satan
had arranged for our destruction, but out of them all the Lord delivered
us. Bless his name! There was one instance of God hearing our prayer,
though in what may be considered a trivial matter, yet made a deep
impression upon us and went far to enforce upon us the reality of
God and his Word.

One night we had a journey of several miles to
make on horseback. It was nine o’clock when we started. After traveling
about two miles our horse became very lame. In our pity for him we
dismounted and throwing the reins over the saddle started the horse
on before us. After some two or three miles of traveling thus, our
horse seemed much improved. For the purpose of faster travel, we concluded
to again ride. Our attempts to catch the horse seemed in vain. Repeatedly
we tried to come up with him, but when we had come near he would trot
on before. After many unsuccessful trials it occurred to our mind
that we should ask God to aid us. Accordingly the Father was implored
to cause the horse to stand that we might come up with him. Although
not a Christian we believed there was help in God, and trusting in
him we approached the animal, speaking to him as we had before, when
he stopped and we mounting continued our lonely journey in deep and
solemn thought of the verity of God.

In the winter of 1886-87 we
became very much concerned about our soul. A revival meeting was in
progress in the little village in which we lived. They did not teach
salvation by grace through faith as was taught by the apostles, but
we, knowing no better, and wanting to escape the damnation of hell,
and hoping for an avenue of escape, concluded to take this. Accordingly
we gave the minister our hand one night, and answered in the affirmative
his few questions concerning our belief in God. On our way home we
were baptized, for we were taught that the water washed away sins.
During the days following we kept a close watch upon our heart and
life to learn if there was any change. We were disappointed. We found
that sin held the same power over us. There remained the same uncertainty
of our eternal state. The thoughts of death had lost none of their
fear, and the grave none of its terror. We were troubled. Here we
had entered, as we hoped, a path that led to heaven, but yet all was
dark and uncertain. O God, is this all of thy kingdom upon the earth?

I
would question the older members of our congregation about their experience.
Should you be called for to-night to depart this life are you fully
assured that your home will be in heaven? Have you no fear to meet
God? They would answer me thus: “We can never know in this life just
what the decision of the Great Judge will be until we come before
his awful tribunal. In this world we can only go on the best we can,
and hope for the most in the judgment.”

This was sad news to my soul.  And as he went there gradually arose from the assembled
troops a sound like the pattering of rain upon a roof, caused by the drumming of spear-haft
upon shield, beginning so gently that at first it was scarcely audible, but rapidly swelling
in volume until it became almost deafening, when it as rapidly subsided into silence.  I did
not understand the meaning of it at the moment; but, later on, when I questioned Mapela, he
informed me that it was the method adopted by the Mashona warriors to express admiration, approval,
and appreciation of any act of an exceptionally generous and noble character, and had been
evoked by my treatment in general of the 'Mfuni incident, and especially by my successful intervention
to save the man from the most horrible form of death known among them.

From the fact that the scowl had vanished from the king's brow I surmised that he, too, was
well pleased at the final outcome of the matter; and when presently the sound of the peculiar
salute to which I have referred had died away, he pointed to the rifle in my hand and said:

"Is that the magic fire tube which kills from afar, of which thy servant spoke when he came
hither to crave my permission that thou shouldst enter my country and visit me here?"

"Even so," I answered, offering it for examination, for I had not reloaded it, and knew that,
however carelessly he might handle it, he could do no mischief.  But he declined to touch it,
saying:

"Nay, it is great and terrible magic, and I will have naught to do with it.  And thou, white
man with the unpronounceable name, art also a great and wonderful magician, for at thy will
the lightning flashes from thy fire tube and the very birds of the air fall dead at thy feet.
Also, when thou didst fight 'Mfuni, thou didst cause the sword in thy hand to flash lightnings
about thee by the swiftness with which thou didst wield it.  Therefore I give thee a new name;
and henceforth thou shalt be known as Chia'gnosi (The Smiter with Lightning).  Go now, in peace,
Chia'gnosi.  I thank thee for the splendid gifts which thou hast bestowed upon me, and especially
for the lightning-flashing sword, as also for saving the life of one of my warriors.  And to-morrow
thou shalt sit beside me, here in this great square, and witness the annual festival of the
Mashona nation.  Sala guhli!"

Accepting this as my dismissal, I saluted, and, wheeling round, beckoned Piet to follow me
to the place where I had left my horse, at the entrance to the square.  But I had not gone
six steps upon my way when-- whether spontaneously or in response to some signal I know not--up
went the spear of every warrior present, in salute, and a great shout of "Chia'gnosi--Chia'gnosi--'Nkos'!"
rent the air, to which I, as in duty bound, responded by halting for a moment and raising my
hand to my hat-brim in a military salute.

About twenty minutes after my return to the wagon, 'Mfuni, my late antagonist, put in an appearance,
in obedience to my instructions.  He was still in full panoply of war, as he had appeared on
parade, and had provided himself with a new bangwan, or stabbing spear, which, with his shield,
war club, and a sheaf of hunting assagais, he respectfully laid at my feet as he halted before me.

"Why do you do that, 'Mfuni?"  I asked, regarding the man with some surprise.

"Because henceforth I am thy man, O Chia'gnosi," he answered.  Then, in reply, I suppose, to
my look of continued astonishment, he added: "The 'Nkosi spared my life, and the king gave
me to him; therefore henceforth I am his man."

"Do you mean that you intend to attach yourself to me, to become one of my servants?"  I demanded.

"Even so, 'Nkos'," he answered simply.

"But," I said, "the king will never permit that, 'Mfuni; he would be very angry indeed with
me should he discover that I had carried off one of his warriors.  Probably he would send an
impi after us to eat us up."

"Nay, O Chia'gnosi, he would not; for it was the Great One himself who ordered me to come to
thee," replied 'Mfuni.  "He gave me to thee; and the king does not go back from his word."

"Very well.  In that case thou mayst remain, and glad shall I be to have thee," said I.  "And
now, let me look at thy hand; I must see what can be done to heal the hurt that the sword inflicted
upon thee."

The gash seemed to be a rather severe one, practically incapacitating the member for the time
being, and it took me the best part of half an hour to extract the splinters of bone and bind
up the wound, during which time I must have inflicted a good deal of pain upon the poor fellow,
for the perspiration streamed down his face like rain.  Yet all the time he sat motionless
and impassive as a statue, never moving a muscle or shrinking in the least.

Before I had finished with my surgery, Mapela and the rest of the chiefs turned up, in response
to my invitation to call at the wagon to receive the gifts which I proposed to distribute among
them; and I soon gathered, from their conversation, that 'Mfuni's story was perfectly true,
and that the king had indeed given the man to me as a present.

To distribute gifts to nearly one hundred chiefs proved to be a somewhat lengthy business,
also it made a pretty severe inroad into my stock of "truck"; still, it had to be done, and
I could only hope that, in the long run, my generosity would not be without its reward.  I
treated them all alike, or practically so, giving each man a yard of thin copper wire, a gill
measure of mixed beads, and either a bandana handkerchief or a yard of printed calico.

And while the distribution was proceeding my visitors chatted volubly with me, and still more
volubly with each other, the principal topic of interest, I soon discovered, being the festival
which was to commence one hour after daybreak on the morrow, and to last all through the day
and well on into the hours of the succeeding night.  The chiefs conversed with the utmost freedom
in my presence and hearing, but at the outset I was too much engrossed in the business of distributing
gifts to pay very much attention to what was said, a stray word or two here and there being
all that I caught at first.  At length, however, it began to dawn upon me that the so-called
"festival" promised to be anything rather than festive, if I had not completely misunderstood
the trend of certain of the remarks which had attracted my attention, and accordingly I pricked
up my ears, and began to ask a few questions.  And then I learned, to my horror, that the first
feature of the festival, namely, the "smelling out" of the king's secret enemies by the witch
doctors, was more likely to resemble closely an orgy of wholesale murder than anything else
that I could imagine.

The ceremony, I gathered, was somewhat as follows.  The "witch doctors" or magicians of the
nation--numbering in all something over a hundred-- all of whom were then in Gwanda for the
purposes of the ceremony, would assemble at sunset that same evening in a sort of fetish house;
and there, under the leadership and direction of one Machenga, the head or chief witch doctor,
would perform certain mysterious rites, and submit themselves to a certain mysterious form
of treatment, lasting the entire night, which, it was generally understood, would enable them
infallibly to "smell out" or detect every individual who might harbour evil thoughts or designs
against the king.  And these unfortunates, it appeared, would, upon detection, be haled forth
and summarily executed there and then!  I learned, further, that while the king put the most
implicit faith in the infallibility of the witch doctors, and especially in that of Machenga,
the head or chief of them, a few of the indunas who were then talking to me held rather strongly
to the opinion that the selection of victims was not so much the result of supernatural guidance
and wisdom vouchsafed to the witch doctors, as it was--at least in the case of the more important
and distinguished victims--governed rather by Machenga's personal hatred, or his cupidity;
a few of the shrewder observers having noticed, each year, that the chosen victims invariably
included certain men toward whom the head witch doctor was well known to cherish a feeling
of strong enmity, while other victims comprised those chiefs who were numbered among the richest
men in the community--the law being that, while the property of the alleged traitors was forfeited
to the king, half of it was surrendered to the head witch doctor, as his fee for the detection
of the criminals.  Mapela, "the Wise One", was one of the strongest upholders of the above
theory, and in support of the soundness of it he whispered to me:

"You see that tall induna yonder, talking with two others?  Yes, the man with the necklace
of lions' teeth.  He is Logwane, reputed to be the most wealthy induna.  For a number of years
he has paid heavy tribute to Machenga, thus purchasing immunity from being `smelled out'; but
during this last year he has become a favourite of the Great, Great One, and presuming upon
this, I understand that now he has refused to pay further tribute to Machenga, and has defied
him.  Mark my words: he will be among those smelled out to-morrow!"

"You think so?"  I whispered back.  "And, if so, what will be his fate?"

"Chiele (slain)!" answered Mapela tersely, accompanying the word with an expressive movement
of his right hand, imitative of a man stabbing another.

"What! notwithstanding the fact that he is a favourite of the king?"  I demanded incredulously.

"Neither that nor the fact that he is highly esteemed by us all and is well known to be absolutely
loyal to the king will save him.  You will see," replied Mapela.

"But," I exclaimed hotly, "that would be monstrous--nothing short of deliberate, cold-blooded
murder!  Do you really think that the king will permit it?  And if he should, will none of
you intervene?"

"The king will permit it, because he has absolute faith in Machenga," answered Mapela.  "And,
as for us, who are we that we should intervene to prevent that which the Great, Great One permits?"

"And are the victims killed there and then, on the spot?" demanded I. "Have they no chance
given them to appeal against Machenga's judgment, no opportunity to produce proof of their
innocence?"

"None," answered Mapela.  "They are dragged forth; the executioners take them; and--they die!
You will see; for the king has bidden you to be present to-morrow."

"I shall not see," I retorted, "for I shall decline to be present. Nothing shall induce me
to countenance by my presence such a scene of cold-blooded atrocity!"

"Nay, my friend," answered Mapela, laying his hand impressively upon my arm, "you must not
dream of attempting to evade the king's command.  To do so would be fatal to you and your followers,
for it would be interpreted to mean that in your heart you cherish evil thoughts against the
king, and fear to face the ordeal.  And an impi would instantly be dispatched with orders to
`eat up' you and yours!  No; however disagreeable to you may be the sights which you will witness
to-morrow, you must on no account seek to evade them.  I tell you this as your friend, because
I wish you well, and because my snake tells me that in some way--how I know not--your presence
at the `smelling out' to-morrow will be the means whereby many valuable lives will be saved.
And now it is time that we should depart; we have been with you long enough.  Sala guhli, Chia'gnosi,
until to-morrow.  And bear well in mind my caution to you," he concluded in a whisper.  Then,
rising, he made a sign to the rest of the chiefs, who sprang to their feet, saluted, and retired
in a body, after reiterating their thanks for the "splendid" gifts I had bestowed upon them.

CHAPTER TWELVE.

MACHENGA, THE CHIEF WITCH DOCTOR OF THE MASHONA.

It was about mid-afternoon of that same day when, as I sat in the shadow of the wagon tent,
pondering upon the possibility of my being able successfully to approach the king upon the
question of a concession to mine gold in Mashonaland, Piet informed me that certain men, whom
'Mfuni recognised as messengers from the king, were coming toward the wagon from Gwanda; and
some five minutes later they arrived.

There were six of them, and they were laden with goods which I needed not their explanation
to assure me were presents from the king.  One bore a complete Mashona warrior's panoply, consisting
of plumed headdress, leopard-skin mantle, mucha of leopards' tails, armlets, anklets, and garters
of cows' tails, a necklace consisting of about forty gold nuggets, bored and strung upon a
strip of rimpi, shield, war club, and an immense bangwan, or stabbing spear.  This gift was
of course to be regarded as a logical sequence and appropriate return for the uniform which
I had presented to His Majesty that morning.  But there were other gifts as well, and exceedingly
valuable ones, too, three of the other messengers being bearers each of a most magnificent
kaross, or skin rug, one being made of lions' skins, one of leopards' skins, and one--the finest
of all--of monkeys' skins of some species unknown to me, the black fur being extraordinarily
long, thick, and glossy.  The remaining two men carried, each of them, a leather bag weighing
about sixty pounds, one bag containing coarse gold dust, while the other was full of small,
rough nuggets of gold.  These two men were also the bearers of a message of apology from the
king, to the effect that, since I seemed to have a liking for gold, he regretted that he had
no more to offer me, but that as gold was of no value in the country, and was not particularly
sought after, it was only occasionally that a stray nugget or a handful of dust was found;
and that the contents of the bags represented the casual findings of many years.

It was somewhat disappointing to learn that here, in Gwanda, where I had confidently anticipated
that gold in practically unlimited quantity might be had almost for the asking, there should
be so little; yet the situation was not without its compensations, for if the natives attached
so little value to the metal that they would not even take the trouble to hunt for it, there
ought to be all the more for me--if I could but coax the king into granting me a concession.
So I dissembled my disappointment, handed over the gifts to Piet, with instructions to pack
them away in the rear of the wagon, rewarded the messengers who had brought them, and dismissed
them, happy in the possession of a few mixed beads.

About half-past ten o'clock that night I was sitting in my wagon, reading by the light of the
all but full moon--for, this being the eve of the great annual festival, the town was in an
uproar, and the volume of sound emanating from it and from the temporary encampments outside
it rendered sleep impossible--when I became aware of a figure muffled in a great kaross in
such a manner as to render identification impossible. Apart from this circumstance, however,
there was a certain suggestion of furtiveness in the movements of the figure, a something indicative
of a desire to avoid observation, that attracted my attention from my book and aroused my curiosity.
It seemed to be wandering about aimlessly; but when I had been watching it for some ten minutes
I became convinced that, erratic as its movements seemed to be, they were not without method;
and that method, I soon saw, was causing the unknown one--a man--to gravitate slowly but surely
toward the wagon.  So I waited patiently, and a quarter of an hour later he accomplished a
masterly movement which brought him within the shadow of the wagon.

"S'a bona muntu," I remarked quietly.  "What is the business that brings you by such a crooked
path to my wagon to-night?"

"Au!" ejaculated the mysterious one in some confusion.  "Chia'gnosi has good eyes; nothing
escapes him; he sees even the little red ticks that hide themselves on the blades of the grass.
If his ears are as good as his eyes he will perchance have heard of one named Machenga."

"I have heard of such an one," I answered cautiously.

"What have you heard of him?" demanded the unknown.

"I have heard that Machenga is the name of the king's chief witch doctor," I replied, with
still greater caution.  "But who are you, and why have you come to my wagon at this time of
night?  Is it to talk to me of Machenga?"

"Machenga is a very great man," observed my visitor.  "Next to the king, he is the greatest
man in all Mashonaland.  Also, he is the king's friend: the friends of the king are his friends;
and the enemies of the king are his enemies."

"Come you to me with a message from Machenga?"  I demanded.  "If so, proceed; my ears are open."

"Au!" ejaculated the unknown one.  "Chia'gnosi is very wise; he understands.  He understands
that when Machenga speaks the king listens; and those who--like Chia'gnosi--are wise and desire
the king's favour, do well first to secure the favour of Machenga."

"Piet," I called, "come hither and open for me the bale containing the handkerchiefs and printed
calico; also find for me the pliers and the brass chain."

The articles named were duly produced, and I selected two of the most brilliant bandanas I
could find, added thereto a couple of yards of calico, printed with a tasteful design in crimson
and blue consisting of an alternation of horseshoes and running horses carrying their heads
and tails very high, cut off a yard of brass chain to which I attached a shaving mirror as
a pendant, filled a brass box with mixed beads, and arranged the whole in a tasteful little
heap on the top of the voorkissie.  Then I turned to my visitor and, pointing to the heap, said:

"Friend, your words are words of wisdom.  You see these gifts?  Take them and place them in
the hut of Machenga, saying that I, Chia'gnosi, send them in token of my goodwill.  Say also
that I have here many other gifts, equally precious, and that, if the king continues to regard
me with favour, and grants me a certain request which I think of preferring, a generous share
of these gifts shall find their way to the hut of Machenga."

For an instant my visitor leaned forward, his gleaming eyes fixed avariciously upon the little
pile of trumpery spread out temptingly upon the lid of the chest, and, as he did so, the upper
folds of his kaross slipped apart, and I caught a momentary glimpse of a most extraordinary
countenance.  It was that of an old man, so old that the head was quite bald and the wrinkled
face entirely devoid of hair; but the deeply sunken eyes glowed like those of a leopard in
the dark, the forehead was broad and high, the nose thin and crooked like the beak of an eagle,
the mouth a mere straight slit, and the thin lips were drawn back in a sort of incipient snarl.
But it was the expression of the face that particularly arrested my attention, for never before
had I beheld a human countenance on which unimaginable cruelty and boundless rapacity were
so clearly and strongly written.  This was no common, ordinary individual, I at once told myself:
there could be but one man in all Gwanda with such a countenance as that, and I instantly guessed
the truth, that my visitor was none other than Machenga himself.

For a moment or two the talon-like right hand of the man hovered greedily over the little display;
then it flashed back and was lost in the folds of the kaross, which were quickly drawn round
the head again, all but concealing it from view.  The man stepped back a pace and drew himself
up haughtily, and, with a gesture of contempt, pointed to the gifts.

"Au!" he exclaimed.  "Think ye that Machenga craves such baubles as those?  They are well enough
for children and fools, but Machenga accepts only gifts of real value."

"Such, for instance, as--" I suggested.

"One of the magic fire tubes with which you caused a flying pigeon to fall dead at the king's
feet to-day," answered my visitor.

"Nay," said I, "that may not be.  It would be no kindness on my part to give Machenga a fire
tube, for he would not know how to use it--"

"But you could teach him," hastily interposed the stranger.

"Nay," answered I, "not so, for it is a thing of magic; and the magic of the white man is unlike
that of the black man, nor can the black man learn it.  Were Machenga to take one of my fire
tubes in his hand, one of two things would happen.  Either the tube would refuse to slay at
all, or it would turn upon Machenga and kill him."

"Au! white man, that is not true, and when you speak lies you talk as a fool," exclaimed my
visitor, displaying much righteous indignation.  "I know, for I have seen the magic fire tubes
before.  Many moons ago--ay, before you were born, and before Lomalindela was king--two white
men came into Mashonaland, and only one of them went out again.  They, too, possessed fire
tubes, and one of them, an Amaboona (Boer)--the man who did not go out--once put his fire tube
into my hands and showed me how to use it.  The magic lies not in the tube itself, but in the
few grains of black powder that are poured into it and the round lump of metal that is thrust
down on the top of the powder.  Au!  I know.  Though so many moons have passed I remember quite
well.  Ay, and I remember many other things also, things that happened here long before the
Mashona arrived in the land, things that happened when the Monomotapa dwelt here and great
cities of stone and brick covered the face of the country, when men dug gold out of the rocks
and made it into ornaments for the arms, necks, and ankles of their women--"

"What foolishness is this that thou art talking?"  I interrupted angrily, for it was growing
late and I was beginning to feel tired, while there seemed to be no sign of an intention on
the part of my unwelcome visitor to leave.  "Return now to Machenga," I continued, "describe
to him the gifts which I have set aside for him, and say that if he will send thee for them
to-morrow at sunrise they shall be his. But if he wants them not, it is well: I have no others
for him."

"Then thou wilt not give him one of thy fire tubes, with a supply of the magic powder and enough
of the round lumps of metal to kill one hundred--pigeons?" demanded my visitor.

"I will not," I replied shortly, "and that is my last word."

"Au!" retorted the man.  "Very well, white man, I hear thee and I go. But it may be that to-morrow
thou wilt be sorry that thou didst refuse." And, so saying, he wrapped his kaross still more
closely about him and strode away into the moonlight with the light, springy step of a young man.

As for me, I was now quite ready for bed, therefore I undressed and turned in without further
delay, expecting to fall asleep on the instant.  Yet I did nothing of the kind, for when I
stretched myself out upon my cartel I found my thoughts dwelling upon my mysterious visitor,
who I felt sure could be none other than Machenga himself, stolen surreptitiously away from
the mysterious rites of the fetish house in the hope of cajoling a rifle out of me; and I began
to wonder whether the two white men to whom he had referred as having visited Mashonaland many
moons ago--one only of whom went out of the country again--could by any chance have been my
friend Henderson and his Boer partner, Van Raalte.  And I also greatly wondered what the fellow
could possibly have meant by his mysterious talk of a time before the Mashonas came to the
country, when it was inhabited by a people whom he named the Monomotapa, who built great cities
of brick and stone, worked the gold mines, and made gold ornaments for their women.  Pondering
thus, I became a little vexed with myself for my untactful treatment of the man, whom I had
permitted to leave me in a distinctly bad temper, instead of humouring and conciliating him,
as I felt persuaded I might easily have done.

However, I was not altogether without hope that, after a night's reflection, the fellow might
reopen negotiations, when I would do my best to establish friendly relations with him, if only
for the purpose of learning a little more about the mysterious Monomotapa, the ruins of one
of whose towns I had actually seen and examined.  And, so thinking, I gradually dropped off
to sleep; and, as was not very surprising, dreamed a wonderful dream, wherein I found myself
living and moving among the Monomotapa, who proved to be a very highly civilised race, possessing
a vast amount of knowledge of many things that we moderns only guessed at in the most vague
fashion.  And I was plunged deep in the midst of a most astounding adventure when Piet awoke
me with the intelligence that it was sunrise, and that the regiments in the outlying cantonments
were already astir and preparing to enter Gwanda, to assist in the celebration of the great
annual festival.  I enquired whether there was any sign of our visitor of the previous night,
and was told that there was not, at which information I was sorrier than ever for my hasty
behaviour; for it was now evident that Machenga definitely refused the gifts that I had set
out for his acceptance, and for a savage to refuse a gift is tantamount to a declaration of
enmity, and I could ill afford to make an enemy of anyone in Mashonaland, still less of so
powerful a personage as Machenga, the chief witch doctor and confidential adviser of the king.

It was by then too late, however, to mend matters, unless I were prepared to make an unconditional
surrender by sending Machenga the particular gifts that he coveted; and it is always unwise
in the extreme to surrender to the demands of a savage.  I therefore decided to let matters
take their course, but to be prepared as fully as possible for any untoward contingency.  Therefore,
as soon as I had bathed and breakfasted, I directed Piet first to feed and water the horses,
then have them brought back to the wagon, saddle and bridle them, leaving the girths loose
but ready to be drawn tight at any moment, and tie them up in the shadow of the wagon, so that,
if necessary, the entire party could mount and ride at a moment's notice.  Next I had five
parcels of ammunition prepared, each parcel weighing about thirty pounds, and placed in readiness
in the wagon, so that, if occasion should arise, we could each snatch a parcel and secure it
round our waists before abandoning all our other belongings.  Then I had each gun loaded and
placed with the parcels of ammunition, indicating the particular weapon which each man was
to take charge of should it perchance become necessary for us to make a hurried flight for
our lives.  And finally, I loaded my own pet rifle and a brace of pistols, thrust the latter
in my belt, and, carrying the rifle in my hand, mounted Prince and rode off unaccompanied to
be present at the festival, since, according to Mapela, failure to comply with the king's command
would inevitably result in myself and my following being "eaten up"--otherwise destroyed--by
an impi.

As I swung into the saddle the rear companies of the last regiments of warriors to enter Gwanda
were winding snake-like through the four entrance gates; therefore, to give them time to reach
their appointed positions in the great square before my arrival, I proceeded at a foot-pace,
with the result that I was the last person to enter the town: and immediately I had passed
in through the south gateway the massive gates were swung to and barred behind me, while a
company of some fifty warriors drew up across the face of the closed gates, barring all possibility
of exit--to my great inward discomposure.  I was careful, however, not to permit any smallest
outward indication of that inward discomposure to manifest itself, but proceeded onward up
the long street, still riding at a foot-pace, and wearing as complete an air of nonchalance
as I was able to assume under the somewhat disconcerting circumstances.  During my progress
through the town I glanced right and left about me from time to time, but saw not a solitary
man in any of the narrow lanes between the huts--they were evidently all congregated in the
great square in the centre of the town; but here and there I caught a passing glimpse of a
woman or two, or a little group of children, peering curiously at me from the interior of the
huts as I passed.  Finally, I reached the junction of the square with the street which I was
traversing, and, dismounting, turned over my horse to the care of a lad of about fourteen,
directing the umfaan to lead the animal into the shadow of a certain hut which I indicated,
and there carefully hold him by the bridle until I should return.  Then, on foot, I passed
through a narrow gap in a solid phalanx of warriors, and found myself in the square, with Mapela
waiting to conduct me to the place which had been assigned to me, and from which I was unwillingly
to witness the forthcoming spectacle.

Imposing as had been the scene in the great square on the preceding day, it was as nothing
compared to what I now beheld; for, with the exception of a small open space about one hundred
feet in diameter in the north-west corner of the square, the vast quadrangle was literally
packed with warriors, all in full war equipment, regiment after regiment being drawn up in
such close order that there was only a narrow space of less than a yard in width between the
ranks.  As Mapela conducted me through the serried ranks I idly wondered what these narrow
spaces were for.  I was to learn their purpose all too soon.

"I am glad that thou hast come, Chia'gnosi," murmured my companion in my ear, as we made our
way slowly toward the small open space. "Nevertheless, I say unto thee, be watchful, and do
nothing that may by any chance anger the Great, Great One, for he is in a black mood to-day--why,
I know not--and when the king frowns it means death!  This is thy place," indicating a stool
placed close to the king's empty throne.  "Stand here until the king is seated, for it is not
lawful for any man to sit until he is bidden to do so by the king.  Farewell!"

So saying, Mapela saluted and withdrew, making his way toward the regiment of which he was induna.

And now, left absolutely to myself in that vast space, I became acutely conscious of the terribly
oppressive silence that prevailed, notwithstanding the fact that, according to my estimate,
there must have been nearly fifty thousand men in the enclosure.  But every one of them stood
straight up, staring intently into space immediately in front of him, moving not so much as
a muscle, scarcely daring to breathe--as it seemed to me--and mute as a figure carved in stone.

For perhaps ten minutes--although it seemed more like half an hour to me--this dreadful, breathless
stillness remained unbroken; then a faint sound, like that of a sudden breeze sweeping over
grass, but which was in reality an involuntary sigh of relief from suspense emanating from
fifty thousand breasts, stirred the air as the curtain veiling the entrance to the itunkulu,
or king's house, was drawn aside, and the figure of Lomalindela, fully clad in his hussar uniform,
sword included, appeared.  For a brief space he stood there in the doorway, glowering; then,
doubtless in obedience to some signal that I failed to note, the spear which every warrior
held in his right hand was raised aloft, and the royal salute of "Bayete!  Bayete!  Bayete!"
pealed out like a thunderclap on the startled air, and all was silent again.

For a moment the king's brow cleared, and the ghost of a smile flitted across his countenance:
I would defy any man living, civilised or savage, to remain entirely indifferent to such a
tremendous outburst of homage--all the more intense because of the imposing figure which His
Majesty cut in his new rig-out.  Then the smile passed, the scowl returned, and, with a glare
that seemed to be concentrated especially on me, Lomalindela strode majestically forward, and,
scarcely deigning to acknowledge my salute, slowly seated himself in his chair, or throne.
And, as he did so, a company of a hundred picked warriors--His Majesty's own bodyguard--marched
out from behind the itunkulu, and, under an induna in an especially imposing war dress, ranged
themselves in a semicircle round and immediately behind the king's person.

Then, from somewhere in the rear of where I was sitting, there suddenly came leaping and bounding
into the small open space a most extraordinary and horrible figure.  It was that of a man--the
man who had visited me at my wagon on the previous night, I presently perceived, although I
did not immediately recognise him; for his dark body was painted, back and front, from head
to foot, in white, in such a manner as to represent, with considerable skill and fidelity,
a fleshless skeleton.  His head was decorated with a pair of bullock's horns, firmly secured
by means of straps; round his neck he wore a necklace composed entirely of skeleton human hands,
which had been severed at the wrists; about his waist was a girdle of animals' teeth and claws,
supporting a mucha, or rather a short petticoat made of dry grass, from beneath the rear portion
of which dangled a bullock's tail; and in his right hand he carried a formidable bangwan or
stabbing spear.

Notwithstanding his great age, this man--who, of course, was Machenga, the dreaded chief witch
doctor--capered and pirouetted with astounding agility in the centre of the arena for fully
five minutes; then he suddenly dashed forward, and, prostrating himself at Lomalindela's feet,
proceeded to do bonga, or homage, by shouting the various titles of the king, and exalting
His Majesty to the skies as the greatest, most potent, most wonderful, most glorious monarch
in the universe, the only king, in fact, worthy of serious mention.  This sort of thing, punctuated
at intervals by thunderous shouts of acclamation from the troops, continued until the king,
satiated with praise, put a stop to it, when the man, after a brief interval of silence, rose
to his feet and stood staring intently for a few minutes up into the rich blue splendour of
the cloudless sky.

Then, gliding meanwhile slowly hither and thither in a series of narrow circles and turns and
twists, in a kind of slow waltz step, Machenga began a song, the burden of which was the glory,
majesty, and power of the king, and the inexpressible wickedness of those who presumptuously
dared to entertain evil thoughts of him.  This continued for about twenty minutes, during which
the singer gradually worked himself up into a state of excitement and exaltation that finally
became a perfect frenzy, under the influence of which his voice rose to a piercing shriek,
while he dashed hither and thither with a display of strength, agility, and fury that seemed
to me incredible.  Finally, the man collapsed and sank to the ground exhausted, and foaming
at the mouth; and at the same instant out from the rear dashed the entire company of subordinate
witch doctors, in number fully one hundred, who, forming up about their prostrate chief, began
to dance madly round him, singing a weird song of which I could make nothing except an occasional
word, here and there, that conveyed no particular meaning to me.

These men were all decorated and garbed exactly like their chief, excepting that, instead of
a bangwan, each carried a slender white wand, about twelve feet in length, in his right hand.
For a period of about five minutes these terrible beings whirled and flashed hither and thither
in bewildering confusion; then, with the precision of highly trained soldiers, they suddenly
halted, and I became aware that Machenga, their chief, was again upon his feet, standing in
their midst. Then, while the cloud of dust raised by their mad gyrations still hovered in the
air, half obscuring the company, the tramp of feet was heard, and into the small arena marched
twenty stalwarts, ten of whom were armed with enormous bangwans, while the remainder carried
heavy, straight-bladed knives, about two feet long, and some six inches wide at the hilt, tapering
away from there to a sharp point.  These twenty--whom Lomalindela grimly condescended to inform
me were the Slayers--halted on the king's left, just clear of the left wing of His Majesty's
bodyguard, arranging themselves in pairs--a spearman and a knife-bearer alternately--as they
did so.  Then Machenga, at a nod from the king, raised his bangwan, and immediately his satellites
began to circle hither and thither, with a slow, waltz-like movement, similar to that with
which he had begun his own mad dance; and as they moved, gradually widening their circles until
they were strung out all along the face of the motionless regiments, they hummed a low, weird,
wordless song that was somehow inexpressibly suggestive of vague, nameless horror.  As for
Machenga, after watching his assistants for a minute or two, he stalked slowly toward the king
and seated himself at His Majesty's feet, where, after a time, he seemed to lose all consciousness
of outward things, and to sink into a state of profound and anxious thought.  Meanwhile the
general company of the witch doctors had separated into units who were slowly working their
way along the front ranks of the closely packed regiments, pausing occasionally as though in
doubt, and then passing on again, to the obvious relief of the individuals before whom the
ominous pause had been made.  For a little while, possibly five or six minutes, matters proceeded
thus, and nothing happened; then I observed that one of the witch doctors had halted, with
his head thrown up, and was sniffing the air, like a dog that has scented game.  He turned
his head eagerly here and there, as though trying the air, seemed to get the scent for which
he was seeking, and then looked square into the eyes of a man in the ranks, who visibly quailed
beneath his gaze.  Then, sniffing again, the witch doctor suddenly sprang forward, thrust his
face close to that of the man who seemed to have incurred his suspicion, and, after a momentary
pause, as though to make quite sure of what he suspected, stepped back a pace, and, stretching
forth the wand in his hand, lightly touched the unfortunate warrior on the breast with it.

Instantly the man's comrades to right and left of him seized the unhappy wight by the arms
and led him forward unresisting to within about ten paces of the king.  For a moment the king
regarded the supposed culprit with a cold, frowning stare: then he turned toward where the
Slayers were drawn up and nodded, upon which a pair of them stepped forward and stationed themselves,
the bangwan-bearer in front and the knife-bearer behind the doomed man, who stood with his
hands clenched by his sides, his comrades having, at the king's nod, taken from him his spear
and shield and laid them at His Majesty's feet.  Then, as I saw the right arms of the executioners
raised to strike, I shut my eyes.  A moment later I heard the dull sound of a blow, followed
by the thud of a falling body; and when I opened my eyes the first victim of the diabolical
rite of "smelling out" lay stretched out upon his face, dead, with skull cloven and a bangwan
wound that must have cut his heart in twain.  It was a sickening sight; but there was one redeeming
feature about it, the mode of death was at least merciful, for the Slayers had done their work
so well and so quickly that the unhappy man must have died instantly, with perhaps scarcely
a pang to mark his dissolution. He was a mere nobody, just a common soldier from the ranks,
who had probably never harboured in his simple heart a single thought disloyal to the king;
but Machenga was cunning enough to realise that a certain number of such unconsidered and inconspicuous
victims must be sacrificed if he would avoid attracting undue attention to the fact that the
holocaust included all those whose death advantaged him either pecuniarily or as the gratification
of his revenge.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN.

I KILL MACHENGA, AND AM EXPELLED FROM MASHONALAND.

After the fall of the first victim the dreadful work proceeded quite briskly, each witch doctor
seeming to feel it incumbent upon him to display his skill and zeal by providing at least as
many victims as the most active and zealous of his brother practitioners.  And as victim after
victim fell a sacrifice to as cruel, wicked, and debasing a superstition as it is possible
for the mind to conceive, so did my anger burn the more fiercely, until I felt an almost irresistible
impulse impelling me to spring to my feet, and, with my pistol levelled at the king's head,
insist upon an end being put to the slaughter.

Yet all the while I knew that I could do nothing in the way of interposition; I was as utterly
helpless as though I had been a thousand miles away, instead of sitting there within arm's
length of the man who was responsible for it all.  For supposing that I should be crazy enough
to obey that impulse, what would happen?  Why, the king's guards would be upon me in a second,
and I should be hacked to pieces by their terrible bangwans in the drawing of a single breath,
while probably an even worse fate would befall my hapless followers!  No, of course, the idea
was madness, the act an impossibility; yet when a few minutes later I saw the tall induna,
Logwane--Mapela's friend--led forth and mercilessly done to death, I could not refrain from
leaning toward the king and murmuring:

"O King, your witch doctors are not infallible; they made a dreadful mistake when they smelled
out that man!  Among all your subjects none was more loyal and faithful than Logwane.  Why
did you suffer him to be slain?"

The king glowered at me for a moment, his eyes smouldering with suppressed anger.  Then he
answered coldly:

"White man, I believed Logwane to be all that you say.  But I was mistaken, for my witch doctors
cannot err; no man can hide his guilt from them: and had Logwane not harboured treachery in
his heart they would not have smelled him out.  Therefore I suffered him to be slain. No man
may think evil of me and continue to live."

At this moment Machenga, who seemed to have gradually sunk into a kind of trance, rose slowly
to his feet, and, with fixed, glassy eyes staring straight before him, began to mutter to himself
in a voice pitched so low that at first I could distinguish nothing of what he said.  Then
he began to glide slowly round in a very small circle, and I perceived that presently, when
he faced me, he raised his head and sniffed the air strongly.  This occurred three times, and
upon the third occasion I detected that for an instant the fixed, glassy stare of his eyes
gave place to a lightning-like glance of triumphant malignity; and then I knew that his entire
pose was merely a piece of exceedingly clever acting, and that he was no more in a trance than
I was.  When he had completed the fourth half-circle he halted, at a distance of about ten
yards from where I was sitting, and, with his back turned toward me, proceeded to sniff the
air still more strongly.

"Yes," he presently exclaimed in a voice quite loud enough for the king and me to hear, "I
am not deceived, I smell him; though his skin is white his heart is black, and I smell the
evil thoughts against the Great, Great One that lurk deep down in it!"  And a smile of diabolical
malice overspread his evil face as he shook his great spear aloft and began to dance very slowly,
singing softly to himself.

So that was it--the villain was actually going to smell me out! But--"Not if I know it," thought
I; and starting to my feet as I drew a pistol from my belt and levelled it at him, I cried:

"Halt there, Machenga!  Halt, I say, or thou diest!  Deceiver and murderer, destroyer of the
king's most faithful friends, and giver of evil counsel to the Great, Great One, my magic tells
me that in that evil heart of thine thou hast conceived the design to slay me, because when
thou didst come secretly to my wagon last night I refused to give thee one of my magic fire
tubes.  Now I will prove thee, rascal; I will show the king that thou, his chief witch doctor
forsooth, art nothing but a base pretender, a player upon his credulity.  Thou dost claim to
be a great and powerful magician; well, so am I.  Kill me, if thou canst; and it shall be that
he of us two who kills the other shall be the more powerful magician, and shall also be the
one whose mouth speaks the truth."

Meanwhile, during this interlude, brief as it was, five new victims--two of them indunas--had
been smelled out and brought forward; but the king, intent only upon what was passing between
Machenga and myself, had forborne to give the fatal signal to the Slayers, and thus the little
group of victims and executioners stood motionless in the centre of the arena, while every
eye was turned upon the chief witch doctor and myself.

Machenga had obeyed my imperative command to halt, thus unconsciously demonstrating at once
that his state of trance was merely a pretence; and when I ceased to speak he further betrayed
himself by answering me.

"Au, Chia'gnosi!" he exclaimed, "so thou, too, art a magician?  And thou dost threaten to kill
me!  Fool! no man living, magician or otherwise, can kill me, else I should have died ages
before thou wert born.  But I can and will kill thee, in despite of thy magic, and thus I do it!"

And, as he spoke, up went his right hand, with the great bangwan in it, his intent being evidently
to transfix me by hurling the spear at me. But I guessed at his purpose, read it in his eyes;
and, quick though he was, I was the quicker, and before he had time to gather his strength
to cast the spear I had levelled my pistol and pulled the trigger.  The good little weapon
barked out as the hammer fell, and through the thin veil of powder smoke I saw Machenga spin
round on his heels, flinging up his arms at the same time, and the next instant down he crashed
upon his back, with a small blue hole in the very centre of his forehead, from which a thin
stream of blood began to trickle slowly.

With a lightning-like movement I thrust the empty pistol into my jacket pocket, and transferred
my rifle from my left hand to my right, at the same time wheeling sharply round upon the king
to see what action, if any, he intended to take.  I caught him in the act of springing to his
feet, and at once flung up my left hand warningly.

"Nay, O Great, Great One," I said very firmly, "rise not, I pray thee, lest evil befall.  My
magic is just now very strong, as thou hast seen-- so strong that I can scarcely control it--and
if anyone here cherishes evil designs against me he had better forget them now, this instant,
lest they rise up and destroy him.  So: that is well!"--as the king sank limply back into his
seat.  "Now," I continued, raising my voice so that it could be heard by at least the greater
part of the warriors gathered there in the great square, "the king and I are about to confer
together; therefore let no man move hand or foot, or utter a single word, for the air is full
of terrible magic that only I can control; and if we are disturbed it may break loose, when--!"
I concluded with an expressive gesture which was meant to convey all sorts of dreadful things;
and I had the satisfaction of seeing Lomalindela's black skin turn a kind of slate colour,
while his lips became a dirty blue-white.

For a few seconds the king stared stupidly at Machenga's dead body, as though he could not
believe the evidence of his own eyes; then he turned to me and said:

"Truly, Chia'gnosi, thou art well named, for thy lightning has slain him who was as we have
always known him, even when the oldest living man in Mashonaland was a boy running at his mother's
heels.  Why hast thou slain the chief of my witch doctors?"

"I slew him, O King," answered I, "because he was a liar, a cheat, a betrayer, and a murderer.
He lied to thee and cheated thee by pretending that he could smell out thine enemies, whereas
he possessed no such power; and he smelled out and caused to be destroyed Logwane, one of the
most loyal and faithful of your indunas, because, after heavily bribing Machenga for several
years, in order to obtain immunity, Logwane refused to submit to further robbery.  And what
he has done to Logwane he has, doubtless, done to many others of Your Majesty's loyal and faithful
subjects."

"How knowest thou all this, Chia'gnosi," demanded the king; "and how am I to know that thy
words are true?"

"Have I not proved it to thee by destroying Machenga?" retorted I. "Thinkest thou that if Machenga
had been what he claimed to be I could have slain him?  As to how I know it, my snake told
me, and he never lies.  And if thou dost still doubt me, question the indunas.  Doubtless there
are some among them whom thou canst trust, who will tell thee whether Logwane was true, or
whether he was false to thee."

The king frowningly considered my proposition for a little, and finally, looking up, called
Mapela to approach.

"Mapela," said Lomalindela, when the induna had drawn near and saluted, "I am perplexed, and
know not what to believe.  I can believe thy words, because I have proved thee, and know thee
to be faithful and true.  Thou didst know Logwane intimately; tell me, therefore, was he loyal
to me, or was he not?"

"There was no man in all Mashonaland more faithful to thee than Logwane," answered Mapela.

"Yet Machenga smelled him out and caused him to be slain as an enemy of mine," the king reminded
him.

"Do I not know it?" retorted the old man bitterly.  "And if Machenga had smelled me out, I
too should have been slain, although, as thou sayest, thou hast proved me and know me to be
faithful and true!  But thank thy snake, O Lomalindela, King of the Mashona, that Chia'gnosi
saw the evil and falsehood that lurked in that black heart,"--pointing to the dead body of
Machenga--"else would many another of thy friends--myself among the number, perchance--have
died before yon sun sank behind the hills."

The king placed his elbows on his knees and buried his face in his hands for several minutes,
evidently overwhelmed by a sense of profound perplexity.  At length, however, he looked up
again, and, still addressing Mapela, asked:

"And think ye, Mapela, that all those,"--pointing to the long array of slain--"suffered unjustly?"

"Nay," answered Mapela, "I am but a simple induna, knowing nothing save the art of warfare,
and the way in which warriors should be trained in order to make good fighters of them.  Who
am I that I should presume to answer such a question?  Ask Chia'gnosi; he is young, but he
is very wise.  Perhaps his wisdom may be able to answer thee.  Ask him."

The king turned to me.

"Thou hast heard my question, Chia'gnosi, and Mapela's answer," said he. "Canst thou tell me
what I want to know?"

"Listen to my words, O King," said I.  "Last night, when the moon was so high in the heavens,"--I
pointed to the approximate altitude of the planet--"Machenga came secretly and in disguise
to my wagon, asking for gifts.  I knew not then who he was, nor did he say; indeed, he pretended
to be a messenger from Machenga: but presently I knew him for Machenga himself, although I
had never before seen him, and I set forth certain gifts, which I offered him.  But he refused
them, demanding as a gift one of my magic fire tubes; and when I refused him he went away,
threatening me that to-day I should be sorry that I had refused him. Then I knew that it was
no messenger, but Machenga himself who had visited me; and I knew the man for a liar and cheat.
Thou dost ask whether all those slain suffered unjustly.  I answer thee that they did! I know
none of them save Logwane; but send thou and ascertain the names of the other indunas who have
died to-day by the hands of the Slayers, and thou shalt find that, like Logwane, they were
rich men, the half of whose riches would pass to Machenga; or they were men who had incurred
Machenga's hatred.  Let the smellers-out be brought before thee and questioned, and thou shalt
find that it was by Machenga's orders that they smelled out the indunas.  As for the others,
it was necessary that a certain number of the common people should also die, else would the
choice of the indunas have been too obvious."

"By the bones of my royal father, thy words, Chia'gnosi, are the words of wisdom, and I will
do as thou sayest!" exclaimed the king.  "Mapela, give orders that the smellers-out be brought
before me."

Some ten minutes later the subordinate witch doctors, or "smellers-out", were called together
and drawn up before the king, when, prompted by me, Mapela subjected the wretches to a searching
cross-examination, with the result that my surmise was completely confirmed.  It is not easy
to shock a savage, but there could be no doubt that when the investigation was finished Lomalindela
was shocked, not so much at the fact that a great deal of innocent blood had been shed, but
that so many of his most loyal and devoted indunas had been removed, and could therefore no
longer exercise their loyalty and fidelity on his behalf; and no one knows better than a savage
autocrat the value of true loyalty and fidelity.  He was distinctly perturbed at the disquieting
thoughts that came crowding into his mind; and it was characteristic of him that he seemed
more than half-inclined to blame me for what had happened--on the principle, I suppose, that
but for me he would have known nothing about it, and would consequently have escaped the perturbation
and disquiet which resulted from the revelation.  At all events, when the revelation was complete,
it was upon me that he turned, demanding sharply:

"And now, Chia'gnosi, having revealed the evil, reveal also the remedy."

"That, O Great, Great One, is easy," I replied.  "Let there be no more smelling out, and there
will be no more mistakes."

"No more smelling out?" he repeated.  "Then how shall those who meditate evil against me be found?"

"They will not need to be found," I replied; "for if such there be, rest assured that they
will betray themselves, even as Machenga betrayed himself to me.  I repeat, let there be no
more smelling out; but if any man be discovered meditating evil, let his accusers bring him
before thee and bear witness against him, and if he be found guilty, let him suffer."

The king meditated upon this proposition at considerable length, and asked a multitude of questions
before he appeared able to grasp the idea fully; but finally he seemed to apprehend my plan,
and graciously announced his willingness to consider it.  The "smelling out" function was thus
brought to a somewhat premature conclusion--to the obvious relief of everybody except perhaps
Lomalindela himself--and the troops were dismissed.  But when I, too hastily assuming that
everything was over, rose to take my leave and return to the wagon, I was imperiously ordered
to stop.  Upon resuming my seat I was thanked by the king in a somewhat perfunctory, half-hearted
way for what I had done; but he added that my revelations had so upset him that he found it
impossible to tolerate my presence in his country any longer, and he therefore begged me so
to arrange matters that I could resume my journey that same afternoon.  Naturally, I remonstrated
against such discourteous treatment, reminding His Majesty that although the revelation was
certainly mine, the evil-doing was Machenga's; and I wound up by saying that, so far from expecting
to be expelled from the country, I had confidently reckoned upon being granted a concession
to mine gold in Mashonaland.  But it was all of no avail; it was through me that the upset
had occurred, therefore out I must go--escorted by an impi, the induna of which would receive
instructions to see that I did not unduly loiter on the way.  And, as to gold, if I wanted
that, the king strongly advised me to go to the Bandokolo country, far away to the north, where
I would doubtless be able to obtain as much of the metal as I needed. After generously giving
me this piece of valuable advice His Majesty curtly dismissed me, with the intimation that
I must be prepared to start in the equivalent of two hours' time--or take the consequences
of my disobedience.  Upon which I, in turn, got angry, and, having told the king one or two
plain truths in distinctly undiplomatic language, bade him an abrupt farewell and hastened
back to the wagon.

We were quite ready to make a start, even to the extent of having the oxen inspanned, by the
time that the escorting impi put in an appearance; and when it did I was thankful to discover
that it was commanded by my friend Mapela.

"Au, Chia'gnosi!" the old chap exclaimed, as the impi halted and saluted, with great heartiness;
"so thou art ready.  It is well; for the Great, Great One is in an evil temper, and his face
is black toward thee because thou hast spoiled the festival: therefore it will be good for
thee to withdraw thyself from before his eyes as soon as possible. Which way go ye--forward
or backward?"

"I go forward, Mapela," I replied.  "I came to this country in the hope of obtaining gold,
and gold I must have; therefore I am going forward to the country of the Bandokolo, where,
so your king tells me, gold is to be obtained in great abundance."

"Wao! ma me! the Bandokolo!" exclaimed the old fellow in great astonishment.  "Know ye aught
of the Bandokolo, or where they are to be found?" he demanded.

"Nay," answered I; "I know nothing of them, save that their country lies far to the north,
and that they have much gold."

"That is true," returned Mapela.  "Then, let us start, for delay is dangerous; and if we linger,
the Great, Great One may change his mind and not suffer thee to go at all.  Yonder is the way,
up that valley. Give the word, Chia'gnosi.  And, as we go, we can talk together; and if what
I can tell thee should cause thee to change thy mind, we can take the road back on the other
side of the mountains when we have passed through the valley."

He paused and left me for a moment while the wagon was getting into motion and the impi was
forming up round it; then, when we were fairly under way, he came to my side again, and remarked:

"Au, Chia'gnosi! thine arrival at Gwanda was well timed; for many are still alive who, but
for thee, would have lain dead in the great square before the setting of yonder sun.  Did not
I say that my snake told me thou wouldst save many lives?  And thou hast done so; and mark
thou this, Chia'gnosi, though to-day the king's face be black against thee, the people know
what thou hast done; and henceforth thy name will be hlonipa among the Mashona."  [Hlonipa
means "unmentionable".  To make a man's name hlonipa is the highest honour that the Kafirs
can render the bearer; for it indicates that the name is regarded as too sacred, too highly
venerated, to be spoken.  Thus I subsequently learned that after my departure from the country
the Mashona never mentioned Chia'gnosi (Smiter with Lightning), but, when they referred to
me, spoke of "Him who slew with thunderbolts", or in some other more or less roundabout fashion
evaded any direct use of the word lightning.]

"Well," I replied, "to be quite candid with you, Mapela, I believe it is a very good thing
for the Mashona that Machenga is dead; and I am not sorry that he compelled me to kill him.
Also I am glad that the king has promised to abolish the system of `smelling out', for in the
first place I do not in the least believe in it, and, in the next, it is perfectly evident
that an unscrupulous scoundrel like Machenga would only be too likely to use it for his own
vile purposes.  And now let us talk about something else.  Tell me, for instance, what you
know about the Bandokolo, and whereabout their country is situated."

"Their country lies yonder," answered Mapela, pointing a little to the west of north; "and
it is a long way off.  Thou wilt have to cross the Great River (Zambezi), and then travel through
the wilderness for the space of a moon and a half, or, maybe, two moons, before thou wilt reach
it.  For myself, I have never been beyond the Great River; but many moons ago there came into
Mashonaland a stranger who said that he had been one of a band accompanying a white man from
afar, who, after much weary wandering, had arrived in the Bandokolo country, and had there
died--how I know not.  And when the white man died the Bandokolo took his followers and made
slaves of them, treating them so cruelly that at last the man who told me these things resolved
to escape.  And after waiting many moons for an opportunity it came, and he succeeded.  But
when he arrived in Mashonaland he was so weak and ill with fever and starvation that, after
lingering for a short time, he died.

"But before he died he told me many wonderful things about the Bandokolo.  He said that they
were little people, about so tall (indicating with his hand a stature of about four feet eight
or nine inches).  Also, that instead of being black, as I am, they are almost white; that they
live in great houses dug out of the rocks of the hillside; that the men wear clothes made of
small plates of gold, and carry spears, shields, and great knives made of gold; that they adorn
themselves with shining stones which they dig out of the ground; and that they are all 'mkulu
'mtagati (great wizards)."

"That is a very extraordinary story, Mapela," said I.  "Did you believe it; or do you think
that the man who told you had a sick brain and imagined things that were not?"

"Nay, who can say?" returned Mapela.  "As I have told you, the man was very sick when he reached
Mashonaland; but I think his sickness was of the body, not of the mind: and he told me these
things many times before he died, therefore I believed him."

I spent the best part of the afternoon in cross-questioning Mapela upon the exceedingly interesting
and remarkable story which he had told me; but the old fellow stuck to his text so perfectly
that at length I was forced to the conclusion that what he had told me was substantially what
he had himself been told, and that if there was any falsehood or exaggeration in the yarn it
was not he who was responsible for it.  We outspanned that night at a distance of twelve good
miles north-east of Gwanda, in a most beautiful valley full of lush grass, and beside the stream,
now much diminished in volume, which we had been following ever since our passage of the Limpopo;
and, I having shot an elephant about an hour before our arrival at the outspan, we all feasted
royally that night, the impi building an enormous watch fire and squatting round it, stuffing
themselves with elephant meat until they could eat no more.

Early in the forenoon of the eleventh day after our departure from Gwanda we reached the Zambezi,
at a point where, by a stroke of good luck, the river chanced to be fordable; and, having got
the wagon and all my other belongings safely across to the left bank, I immediately outspanned,
and then proceeded to distribute liberal largesse among the subordinate officers of the impi,
gave Mapela a specially handsome present, and so parted upon excellent terms from my Mashona
friends, not without a qualm of regret and of wistful surmise as to my chances of ever again
seeing them.  Later on, after a meal and a rest, we again inspanned, and, trekking a few miles
upstream, rounded the shoulder of a range of low hills and plunged into a valley stretching
northward, with a small southward-flowing stream running through its centre and discharging
into the Zambezi, upon which splendid river we now turned our backs.  'Mfuni, the man who had
fought me by command of Lomalindela, and had afterwards attached himself to my train, exhibited
some slight symptoms of regret at parting from his friends in the returning impi; but he quickly
recovered from his fit of the blues, and, evidently being very fond of animals, devoted himself
with zest to the task of making friends with the horses and dogs.  Also the poor fellow speedily
developed a most devoted attachment to myself, so arousing in Piet a feeling of profound jealousy
and disgust which I only succeeded in dissipating with difficulty after the occurrence of several
more or less serious quarrels between the pair.

During the three weeks that immediately followed our passage of the Zambezi, our route lay
through a wilderness in which for days together we never saw a solitary human being.  But this
did not very greatly matter, for the country, consisting for the most part of low, rolling
hills, was well watered by streams which, flowing generally in a direction more or less north
and south, we were able to follow day after day, while the grass was plentiful and of very
good quality.  Moreover, there was not much bush, which would have been to some extent a disadvantage
but for the fact that, as we advanced, the game became so tame that we had very little difficulty
in stalking it through the long grass.  During this particular period of our journey we encountered
very few elephants or big game of any kind, but antelope of various descriptions were abundant,
so that we always had plenty of buck meat in the larder.  Then, one day, scouting far ahead
of the wagon, accompanied by Piet, 'Mfuni, and the dogs, I discovered that we were approaching
a vast open plain, where the grass was not nearly so good.  I therefore rode back a few miles,
and, upon meeting the wagon, gave orders for a prolonged outspan at a suitable spot, so that
the oxen, which were becoming thin from constant work, might have a few days' rest, and recover
flesh in preparation for the journey across the plain.

We remained at that outspan five days, and when we resumed our journey I had every reason to
regard the time as well spent; for as we pushed forward across the open plain the grass became
so poor that, but for the period of rest and recuperation which I had allowed them, I am convinced
that the oxen would never have accomplished the journey at all.  Luckily for us, when we had
lost three oxen, and the remainder had become little better than walking skeletons, we reached
the other side of the plain, and once more came to good grass and water; and here we rested
again for a week.

On the second day after the resumption of our trek, two mountains of almost perfect pyramidal
form were sighted right ahead and apparently about fifty miles apart; and on the following
day the flat, open plain gave place to undulating country, which gradually grew more rugged
and park-like as we advanced, with good grass, small, detached patches of bush, and a few trees,
singly or in clumps, scattered thinly here and there.  But we soon noticed that, apart from
the grass, the vegetation generally was new and strange, of a kind that none of us had ever
before seen; the trees in particular being very curious and grotesque in shape, both as to
their trunks and branches, and their foliage being of almost any other colour than green. 
In some cases the trees, notwithstanding their strange and abnormal configuration, were very
beautiful, the large, heart-shaped leaves being of almost every conceivable tint of red, ranging
from palest pink to a very deep, rich crimson, with great bunches of snow-white blossom; while
at the opposite end of the scale, as it were, there occurred examples in which the trunks and
branches were swollen, knotted, and twisted into the most extraordinary and uncouth shapes,
while the foliage consisted of long, flat, ribbon-like streamers of a dirty brownish-grey hue,
coated with an exudation the odour of which was offensive beyond the power of words to express.
Fortunately for us, these last were comparatively rare, and we soon learned to give them plenty
of room and to pass them to windward, where possible.

And here, too, we saw the first of several new and strange forms of animal life.  As Piet and
I were, as usual, riding forward some distance ahead of the wagon, we suddenly came upon a
small herd of seven curious-looking animals, which we at first mistook for young giraffes;
but as they stood gazing at us curiously, thus permitting us to approach within less than a
hundred yards of them, we observed that while the creatures bore a certain general resemblance
to giraffes, there were differences, the most important of which was that of size.  For these
creatures stood, at the shoulders, only about as high as an eland; the neck, although abnormally
long, was not proportionately as long as that of a giraffe; the head was hornless, and of quite
different shape from a giraffe's head; and, lastly, their colour was a deep, rich, ruddy brown
on the head, shading gradually away along the body and legs until, about the fetlock, it became
quite a pale buff.  I shot one of them, and have the skin to this day, which has been a source
of great interest and also a bit of a puzzle to several naturalists who have seen it, and who
all declare it to have belonged to an animal of which they had no knowledge whatever.  The
flesh of the creature proved to be very tender and juicy, and my "boys" ate of it freely; but
after trying a mouthful I decided that I did not care for it, the meat having a very strong
and peculiar musky flavour which I found much the reverse of appetising.

And then, as an appropriate wind-up to a day that had been rich in surprises, while we were
looking about for a suitable spot at which to outspan for the night, we came upon the first
of the Bandokolo people, or rather, she--for it was a woman--came upon us.  We were, at the
moment, riding through a shallow depression, about half a mile wide, bordered on either side
by rising, bush-clad ground that was scarcely high enough to be worthy of the name of hills,
with a narrow, shallow rivulet on our right; and we had about decided that the spot where we
had reined up would answer our purpose quite well, when the two dogs, Thunder and Juno, who
had been following quietly enough at our horses' heels, suddenly ran forward a few paces and
then stood pointing, uttering low, half-yelping, half-whining noises the while, as was their
wont when they were puzzled.  For a few moments I could see nothing to account for their excitement,
and I was about to speak to them, when, looking forward, I suddenly saw something raise itself
in the grass, remain visible for perhaps half a dozen seconds, and then sink down again.  It
was about a hundred yards from the spot where we had pulled up, and from the brief glimpse
which I had obtained I almost thought that, strange as it might be, I had seen a child!  To
satisfy myself, therefore, I called to Piet, and, accompanied by the dogs, cantered forward
toward the place where the strange apparition had appeared.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN.

SOME MARVELS OF THE BANDOKOLO COUNTRY.

Our horses had not advanced more than half a dozen strides when the strange-looking object
again appeared and came stumbling toward us, and then we saw that it was indeed a human being,
apparently a girl of about twelve years of age, from her stature.  The first thing that I particularly
observed was that her skin was a kind of brownish white, the next that she had a mop of black
hair streaming loosely down over her shoulders; then I saw that she was half-naked, for the
single garment in which she was clad was in such a tattered condition that all that remained
of it was a few fluttering rags.  It was evident that the poor creature was in the very last
stages of exhaustion, for she reeled and staggered as she came toward us with outstretched,
appealing arms; and presently, when we were still a few yards apart, with a low, wailing cry
she fell prone and lay huddled up in a pathetic little heap in the long grass, while the dogs
dashed forward and stood alternately nuzzling her and looking up to us with plaintive whines.
The next instant I swung out of my saddle, and, bending down, raised the unfortunate creature
in my arms, when I saw, to my amazement, that she was evidently a full-grown woman, but of
very diminutive stature, being only about four feet six inches in height.  Moreover she was
in a most shockingly emaciated condition, and on her back was a close network of scarcely healed
scars, which looked as though they might have resulted from a most merciless scourging; and
she was in a deep swoon, having apparently exhausted her last particle of strength in the endeavour
to reach us.

Taking off my hat, I handed it to Piet, with instructions that he should fill it and his own
at the brook, and return to me with all speed; and while he was gone I pulled off my jacket
and wrapped the frail, senseless form in it.  For I saw at once that this creature had not
been accustomed, like the native women with whom I had thus far come in contact, to go about
in such a state; the rags which still clung to her attenuated form showed that she habitually
wore clothing, and there was a certain suggestion of refinement in the mould of her features
that led me to the conclusion that she belonged to a race of people having some claim to be
regarded as civilised, in their own peculiar fashion.  In short, she answered in every respect
to Mapela's description of the Bandokolo; and I had gathered, from what he said, that they
were in some sort a civilised race.

It was a long time before we succeeded in restoring the poor creature to her senses, so long,
indeed, that when at length she opened her eyes and began to look wonderingly about her, the
wagon was close at hand.  As soon, therefore, as it was within easy hailing distance I ordered
Jan to outspan, instructed Piet to prepare my cartel, and, when the latter was ready, carried
my patient to it and laid her upon it.  Then, having shot a buck earlier in the day, we started
a fire and set to work to prepare some good strong broth, which, when it was ready, I administered,
with seemingly good effect, for when the woman had partaken of it she spoke a word or two which
sounded like an enquiry.  But I could make nothing of it, nor could Piet, whereupon 'Mfuni
came forward, and presently he contrived to hit upon a kind of Bantu dialect which the woman
understood.  And then, when we had satisfied her curiosity as to who we were, where we came
from, and whither we were going, and had assured her that we were friends and that she might
regard herself as perfectly safe with us, she informed us, in turn, that she was of the Bandokolo,
and that she had been driven out of the country--the border of which was then one day's march
distant--for some offence.  This she was endeavouring to explain, when she sank back exhausted
upon the cartel, and again fell into a swoon.

It soon became evident that the unfortunate little creature was in a most critical condition,
from the combined effects, as I supposed, of fiendish ill treatment, violent exertion, and
insufficient nourishment; and we were kept busy all that night reviving her from swoon after
swoon, and in the preparation and administration of strong broth, with which to combat the
terrible prostration that was her most alarming symptom.  Toward morning, however, she seemed
to revive a little, and after absorbing another liberal dose of broth, slightly dashed with
brandy, she complained of weariness, and soon afterward sank into a deep sleep, from the restorative
effects of which I hoped much.  But of course the idea of continuing our trek that day was
quite out of the question; we therefore remained where we were, and I set Jan and 'Ngulubi
to look after the oxen and see that they came to no harm, while Piet, 'Mfuni, and I devoted
ourselves to the task of looking after the invalid, though, goodness knows, our ignorance of
everything connected with the leech's art was so complete that we could do nothing more than
pour into her all the nourishment that she could be persuaded to absorb.

And I am afraid that it was this lamentable ignorance of ours that was responsible for her
condition when she awoke about ten o'clock in the morning.  For after tossing restlessly upon
the cartel for about half an hour, she suddenly sat up, and stared about her with glassy, terrorstricken
eyes, and began to mutter rapidly to herself; and upon feeling her pulse I found that it was
throbbing furiously; also her skin was dry, and scorching hot: in short, it was evident that
she was in a state of high fever closely bordering on delirium.  We improved matters a little
by withdrawing the cartel from beneath the close, suffocatingly hot tent of the wagon, and
placing it on the grass, in the shadow of the wagon, where the soft breeze could play freely
upon the patient, also by swathing her head in towels which were kept continually dripping
wet; and after about an hour of this treatment the fever so far abated as to permit her to
talk coherently, when she told us her story, to the following effect.

"My name," said she, "is Siluce, and I am of the Bandokolo.  I am two hundred and twenty-five
moons (a little more than seventeen years) old; and my father, Mindula, is one of the most
powerful chiefs of the nation.  A little more than fifteen moons ago he used his influence
to secure me what is greatly coveted and regarded as a very high honour in Bandokolo, namely
a position in the household of Bimbane, the queen. And for a time all went well, and I was
happy, although Bimbane--who is so old that no man living knows how old she is--is very severe,
tyrannical, and cruel to all those who are brought into contact with her.  Then, six moons
ago, I met Anuti, one of the captains of the queen's guard, and we learned to love each other.
Four moons passed, and then, in accordance with the custom of our country, Anuti presented
himself before the queen, and besought her permission to make me his wife.

"Now, Anuti is one of the most splendid men of the Bandokolo: he is three hundred and seventeen
moons (nearly twenty-four and a half years) old; in stature he stands a full head taller than
myself; he is a valiant warrior, a clever hunter; and he has royal blood in his veins, for
his father's father's father was the son of a prince of the royal house, and was said to be
a tenth cousin of Bimbane, the queen."

"But," I interrupted, at this point, "how could that be?  The prince from whom Anuti descended
must have lived--let me see--yes, more than one thousand six hundred moons ago.  Surely your
queen is not so old as that!"

"Ah, but she is, and infinitely older!" answered Siluce.  "No man knows how old she is; there
is no record of her birth and parentage; she has been queen of the Bandokolo for unnumbered ages."

"Oh, but that is nonsense, you know!"  I retorted; "unless of course your records have been
very badly kept.  Why, in my country, if a man lives to be thirteen hundred moons old we regard
him as a marvel. Surely your queen cannot be older than that?"

"Yes," answered Siluce; "indeed she is.  You do not understand.  Bimbane is a great magician,
who keeps herself alive by certain secret arts unknown to the rest of us.  And she does so,
not only because she fears to die, but also because she is persuaded that somewhere in the
world there is--or will be--a man who, if she can find him and induce him to become her spouse,
will restore to her her long-lost youth and all the joy of life that she once knew.  It is
the great desire of her life to find this man, and no sooner did she see Anuti than the thought
arose that he might be the one through whom she would attain the fulfilment of her desires;
and by the exercise of her magic she stole his heart from me, and induced him to wed her. 
And because I protested she first caused me to be publicly whipped, and then ordered me to
leave the country, saying that at sunrise of the following day she would send forth hunters
to seek for and destroy me if they found me.  And, knowing that Bimbane would keep her word,
I fled forthwith, all smarting from my whipping as I was, and made southward, avoiding all
villages on my way, and following the most lonely bypaths that I could find.  For just half
a moon have I maintained a continuous flight, living on such fruit and other food as I chanced
to come upon while pursuing my way, hiding whenever I saw man or woman, and scarce daring to
rest or sleep lest savage beasts or the still more savage hunters should come upon and slay
me.  And now all my strength has gone; the hardships of my flight have sapped my life; and
naught remains for me but to die, glad that I am permitted to pass painlessly in your hands
rather than by those of the cruel hunters, who would drain the last remnant of my miserable
life from me by slow torture!"  And as the unhappy creature uttered the last words she threw
up her hands with a gesture of despair and burst into a passion of hysterical weeping which
I made no effort to check, hoping that thus she might gain relief to her overwrought feelings.

But instead of that happening, the thoughts and memories which had been awakened during the
recital of her terrible experiences only increased her excitement, until in the course of half
an hour the unhappy girl was fighting us and screaming in high delirium.  Yet through it all
there was one idea that seemed to haunt her, for later on, during a comparatively quiet period,
she looked up into my face, and, seizing me by the hand, said:

"O wonderful white man, great and strong, you are going to Masakisale,"--the capital of Bandokolo--"and
will see Bimbane.  Take notice, and you will see that on the thumb of her right hand she wears
a ring in which is set a wonderful stone that shines like the sun at eventide.  That stone
is a magic stone, a potent amulet, by virtue of which she is able to do many marvellous things,
and, among others, to win the hearts of men.  Some think that it is the possession of that
stone which enables her to prolong her life indefinitely.  If it were taken from her, and she
were to die, all Bandokolo would rejoice; for Bimbane is a cruel tyrant, grinding down the
people, and making the lives of many an intolerable burden to them.  There have been those
who have sought to take the stone from her, but by the power of her magic she has discovered
their purpose and has destroyed them.  But it may be that her magic will have no power over
you, O white man; therefore, if you can, take from her that stone, and so deliver Bandokolo
from her merciless tyranny.  You will do it?  Promise me."

"I promise you, Siluce, that, if I can, I will take the stone from her," I answered, more to
soothe the unhappy little creature's consuming anxiety, I must confess, than with any serious
intention at that moment of fulfilling my promise.  I meant well, and I was glad to see that
my promise had produced a beneficial effect, for her agitation gradually subsided, and a little
later, after partaking of more broth, she sank into a slumber that, uneasy at first, gradually
became quiet and profound.

But the improvement was only of brief duration, for in little more than an hour she was again
awake and raving in high delirium, fighting with us more fiercely than ever, under the impression,
apparently, that we were the hunters who had been sent out to destroy her.  Fortunately, I
possessed a very fair knowledge of the Bantu dialect that she seemed to understand, and, using
this, I did my utmost to soothe her and calm her fears.  But all my efforts were worse than
unavailing, for they only seemed to increase her terror; moreover, she appeared now to have
become raving mad: therefore, in despair, and because I saw that in her struggles with us she
was rapidly wearing out what little strength remained to her, I suddenly released my hold upon
her, and bade Piet and 'Mfuni do the same; whereupon she sprang from the cartel and dashed
off down the valley with the speed of a hunted deer.  There was nothing for it, of course,
but to follow, and this I did on horseback, with Piet and the dogs accompanying me.  We proceeded
at an easy canter, taking care to maintain a good distance, so that she might not be conscious
of being followed, but just keeping her in sight; and in this fashion the poor, demented creature
ran quite two miles before she fell exhausted.

When we came up to where she lay, we found her doubled up in the long grass, apparently senseless,
but moaning pitifully; and again, as on the previous day, I sent Piet off to the river for
water with which to restore her.  But all our efforts were vain, for in less than half an hour
after we had come to her the unhappy girl died, without recovering consciousness.  As soon
as I was quite sure that she was dead I mounted my horse, and, bidding Piet place the poor
scarred, emaciated corpse in my arms, rode back to the wagon; and, procuring the necessary
tools, I dug a grave in which we laid the poor inanimate body to rest, covering it well with
big boulders from the river to protect it from the ravages of the jackals and hyenas.  Then,
notwithstanding that it was by this time late in the afternoon, we inspanned and trekked a
good ten miles up the valley; for there is nothing that a South African savage fears much more
than a grave, and I knew that nothing would have induced my "boys" to pass the night within
half a dozen miles of poor Siluce's last resting place.

Two days later, about mid-afternoon, we outspanned close to the headwaters of the small stream,
the course of which we had been following for so many days.  It had its source in the slopes
of the more eastern of the two mountains toward which we had been travelling, and we outspanned
at the very base of the mountain and close to the margin of the rivulet, which at this point
had dwindled to a width that I could easily leap across.  And now, having arrived at a point
where this particular stream would be of no further service to us, our first business, before
continuing our journey, must be to find another stream, flowing northward in a direction corresponding
generally with that which we desired to pursue.  Accordingly, as there still remained to us
some three hours of daylight, Piet and I, accompanied by 'Mfuni, who had by this time learned
to sit a horse, set out upon a short exploring expedition northward.

The spot upon which the wagon was outspanned was at the extremity of the south-western slope
of the mountain, almost on the northernmost extremity of a wide, flat plain; and from this
position, looking northward, we saw that the country again presented a somewhat broken appearance,
with high ground to the right and left, and something in the nature of a valley directly ahead.
And, a valley being obviously the place where one would most naturally expect to find water,
it was toward the entrance to this one that we wended our way, with the steep slope of the
mountain, shaggy with thickly growing timber, of strange forms and still stranger colours,
on our right.

As it happened, we were exceptionally fortunate in our exploration on this occasion, for we
had not ridden more than six miles when, issuing from the northern slope of the mountain, the
base of which we had been skirting, we discovered another rivulet, very similar in character
to that near which we had left the wagon outspanned, and upon tasting the water we found it
to be deliciously sweet and cool; moreover, the stream was flowing northward, or precisely
in the direction toward which we wished to travel.  We followed the course of the stream for
a distance of some four miles down the valley, and then, finding that it continued to flow
northward, and showed a tendency to increase in volume, being fed by other small brooks flowing
into it here and there, we turned our horses' heads and cantered back to the wagon, very well
satisfied with the result of our ride.

Inspanning at dawn the next morning, we easily accomplished the trek from the headwaters of
the stream we were leaving behind us to those of the stream which we intended to follow before
the heat of the day had fairly set in, outspanning at length, about eleven o'clock in the morning,
in a nicely wooded, shady valley, which gradually widened as we progressed, with the stream
on our left and rising ground on both sides of us.  Here we allowed the oxen to rest and graze
for nearly three hours, resuming our journey about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon.

As usual, Piet and I, on horseback and accompanied by the two dogs, preceded the wagon, the
pace of the horses, even at a walk, being so much faster than that of the slower-moving oxen
that we generally managed to find ourselves at least two or three miles ahead by the time that
a suitable spot for the next outspan was reached.  But upon this occasion I was desirous of
exploring our route for some little distance ahead; therefore, upon mounting, we put our horses
into an easy canter, and soon left the wagon out of sight and hearing behind us.  Proceeding
in this fashion, with an occasional rein-up to breathe our horses, we found ourselves, in the
course of an hour and a half, about ten miles from our starting-point, in the midst of a beautifully
wooded, park-like plain about five miles in width, with the stream, now considerably augmented
in volume, purling musically over a shingly bed on the eastern margin of the plain, and the
high land, rising by this time almost to the dignity of hills, still shutting us in on either hand.

The spot which we had reached seemed well enough adapted for our nightly outspan, therefore
Piet proceeded to mark the spot by setting up our usual signal, which was a small branch of
a tree, with its leaves attached, broken from the parent stem and stuck upright in the soil.
This would at once arrest the attention of Jan, the Hottentot driver, upon his arrival at the
spot; and seeing it, he would outspan, even if we chanced to be elsewhere when he arrived.
Then, mounting again, we resumed our journey down the valley, in search of something wherewith
to replenish our empty larder.

At a distance of some five miles farther down the valley we secured what we wanted, having
come quite unexpectedly, while our horses were walking, upon a herd of black antelope, among
them a number of half-grown fawns, one of which I managed to bowl over before they had sufficiently
recovered from their surprise to get away; and having secured our prize upon the back of Piet's
horse, behind his saddle, we proceeded to retrace our steps leisurely.  But we had scarcely
covered a mile upon our backward way when we became aware of certain strange roaring and grunting
sounds, of a kind quite new to us, apparently proceeding from the far side of a big clump of
bush which lay at a distance of a short quarter of a mile on our right front.  Curious to learn
what could be the origin of those strange sounds, we turned our horses' heads in that direction,
and a few minutes later, upon rounding the extremity of the clump, we came upon a most extraordinary
sight.

The scene was an open glade of about four acres in extent, bordered by trees, among which were
a few specimens of the kind described in the preceding chapter, with weirdly shaped, swollen,
knotted, and twisted trunks and branches, and long, flat, ribbon-like streamers of leaves,
coated with a vile-smelling exudation.  But it was not so much the glade itself--strange as
was its appearance, with its weird-looking vegetation--that attracted our attention, as what
was being enacted in it.  For away toward one edge of it was a big boulder, on the top of which
crouched the figure of--was it a woman, or a monkey?  The creature seemed to partake about
equally of the characteristics of both; she was entirely unclothed, her whole body was covered
with short, thick, golden-brown hair, that on her head being much longer than that on the rest
of her body, while her features might be described as very human-looking for a monkey, or very
monkeyfied for a human being.  But I noticed that her arms were disproportionately long, as
compared with those of a woman; and a further glance revealed that her feet had a distinct
resemblance to hands, her great toes looking very much more like thumbs.

It was not from her, however, that the roaring and grunting sounds emanated--for she sat quite
silent--but from two males of her own species, who, in the middle of the arena, were engaged
in deadly combat, using their hands, feet, and teeth as weapons, which they employed with most
ferocious energy.  Gripping each other by the throat with the left hand, apparently with the
twofold purpose of strangling and preventing the opponent from biting, while with the right
fist they battered each other savagely, occasionally using the right foot in an endeavour to
throw each other, the combatants--both of whom stood well over six feet high--whirled hither
and thither with astounding agility, so completely occupied with each other--and the female
so absorbed in watching them-- as to be utterly oblivious of our presence there on the edge
of the arena, partially concealed beneath the shadow of the trees.

For several minutes they fought thus, locked together in a deadly grip; then, as though by
mutual consent, they drew apart a few paces, evidently for the purpose of recovering their
breath, glaring ferociously at each other meanwhile, and uttering low, deep, rumbling, snarling
growls: and the tremendous energy which they must have expended during the struggle was abundantly
evidenced by the convulsive heaving of their great, hairy chests.  Then suddenly they rushed
at each other again, and became locked in a deadly embrace, each fixing his strong, fang-like
teeth deeply in the shoulder of the other, and each apparently striving to crush the body of
the other in the grip of his great, hairy arms, the enormously powerful muscles of which could
be plainly seen working beneath the skin.  To and fro they swayed, still tightly locked together,
growling and snapping at each other with such deadly ferocity that in a few moments the blood
was streaming copiously from their lacerated shoulders and arms; and then one, apparently the
younger of the two, succeeded in throwing his opponent violently to the ground. The shock seemed
partially to stun the thrown one for a few seconds, and of this his opponent took instant advantage
by flinging himself astride upon his antagonist's body, pinning his arms down by kneeling upon
them, and gripping his throat with both hands in a throttling grasp that soon reduced his enemy
to a condition of utter helplessness.  Then, rising heavily and somewhat unsteadily to his
feet, the conqueror glared about him for a moment, and, seeming to see what he was looking
for, stooped over his insensible foe, seized him by an arm and a leg, and, lifting him above
his head, went staggering across the open space toward one of the weird-looking trees already
mentioned, into the foliage of which he flung the body.  And forthwith, to our unspeakable
horror, the long, sticky, ribbon-like leaves, sensitive as those of a mimosa, seized and wrapped
themselves about the body, until, in less time than it takes to tell, it was so completely
enveloped that nothing of it was to be seen, while the leaves of the tree--which was only about
fourteen feet high-- had formed themselves into a great, horrible, tightly compressed mass,
in which I seemed to detect, for the space of a minute or two, signs of an internal struggle.
Meanwhile, the conqueror, having thus effectually and terribly disposed of his foe, went reeling
and staggering over to where the female sat impassively upon the boulder, seized her roughly
by the arm, and dragged her, unresisting, into the depths of the wood, where we soon lost sight
of them.

Speechless with horror for the moment, even more at the demoniacal ferocity displayed by the
combatants than at the weird ghastliness of the manner in which the fight had ended, I signed
to Piet, and, wheeling our horses, we galloped away from the scene of the tragedy, nor drew
rein again until we reached the wagon, which was in the act of being outspanned.  Then, dismounting,
I beckoned to 'Mfuni, related what we had seen, and asked him whether he had ever heard of
such creatures as those men, or monkeys, that Piet and I had beheld fighting.  But 'Mfuni shook
his head and replied in the negative; he had never before been anything like so far north,
and his knowledge of the Bandokolo country, it appeared, was even less than that which I had
gained from Mapela.

In the course of the next day's trek we passed close to the scene of the combat, and, for the
satisfaction of my curiosity, I made a point of carefully examining the tree into which the
body of the vanquished had been thrown.  The leaves were still bunched tightly together; but
I observed that the mass thus formed was distinctly smaller than it had been when I last looked
upon it, and I believed I could guess pretty accurately at the process which was going on within
it.  I felt very strongly disposed to have the tree cut down and subjected to examination;
but there were two strong arguments against this, one being the overpowering carrion-like effluvium
which the tree exhaled, while the other was Piet's point-blank refusal to have anything to
do with such an attempt.

On this day we saw two new species of animals, one being a hyena nearly twice as big as any
that I had hitherto seen, and of quite different marking, the ground colour of its skin being
very similar to that of the lion, while it had a black head, a distinct black mane, a broad
black line running along its spine from the base of the skull to the tail, and an alternation
of black stripes and irregular blotches upon the whole of its body except the under part, which
was white.  We came rather suddenly upon a pack of eleven of these creatures disputing possession
of the carcass of a buffalo with a flock of vultures, and were therefore afforded an excellent
opportunity to note carefully their peculiarities before they made off, which they did slowly
and unwillingly, uttering the most dreadful maniacal laughs as they went.  The other creature
was a kind of jackal, as big as a full-grown leopard, with a splendid coat of long, fine, glossy
black fur.  This beast broke cover about fifty yards away from us, and, unlike the rest of
his species, instead of beating a hasty retreat upon seeing us, turned promptly and attacked
us with indescribable fury.  Luckily, I had my rifle ready, and shot the brute dead as he was
in the very act of leaping at Prince's throat; and it was well that I did so, for upon examining
him we found that he was possessed of a set of terrible fangs, capable of inflicting dreadful
injuries had he been afforded the chance.  We stripped off his hide, and left the carcass to
the vultures to dispose of, which they did with commendable promptitude, as Jan subsequently
informed us when we rejoined him at the next outspan.  We also saw in the distance, on that
same day, a herd of about thirty elephants; but I did not attempt to interfere with them, as
I hoped that before long I should have something even more valuable than ivory with which to
load the wagon.

As we proceeded, the country steadily became more broken and irregular, the hills higher and
more precipitous, with frequent outcrops of enormous granite boulders and towering cliffs of
felspar, from the interstices of which sprang strange and beautiful ferns, interspersed with
bushes bearing flowers of remarkable shapes and the most splendid colours.  The trees, too,
grew more closely together: the streams increased in number, many of them pouring down the
face of the cliffs in the form of waterfalls, which dissolved into spray and mist long before
they reached the bottom, veiling the dark and rugged rocks in soft clouds of delicate vapour
reflecting every hue of the rainbow.  In short, with every mile of our advance the scenery
grew more wildly and romantically beautiful, yet withal there were spots, deep narrow glens
and ravines shut in by towering cliffs and overshadowing trees, where the effect was as weird
as a scene copied from Dante's Inferno, and in the midst of which one felt that the strangest
happenings would have excited no surprise.

It was in the midst of such a scene that we again encountered the gigantic man-like monkeys,
which, I subsequently learned, formed part of the fauna peculiar to this remarkable country.
There were two of them this time, a male and a female, and they were coming toward us when
we sighted them.  The instant that they caught sight of us, the female turned and ran for the
face of the nearest cliff, which she scaled with incredible agility; but the male halted and
stood his ground, evidently prepared to dispute our passage, if necessary, and to cover his
companion's retreat.  But I had no fancy for engaging in a fight with a creature which was
such a strange and unnatural compound of man and beast.  I therefore spoke a word to Piet,
and we reined up; whereupon the creature, after much snarling, growling, and baring of teeth,
slowly retreated, following his mate, but keeping a wary eye upon us meanwhile, until he too
reached the foot of the cliff, when, with a parting snarl of defiance, he climbed the vertical
face of the rock with an agility no less extraordinary than that displayed by his mate.

CHAPTER FIFTEEN.

I LEARN SOME INTERESTING PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE QUEEN.

It was a little after ten o'clock on the following morning when Piet and I, mounted as usual,
and riding about a mile ahead of the wagon, emerged from a narrow, winding gorge, hemmed in
on either hand by stupendous, almost vertical, cliffs, drawn so closely together that, riding
though we were beside the margin of the river, there was little more than bare room for us
to travel abreast.  It was not until we rounded a bend in the gorge that we knew how near we
were to the end of it; and the sight which then greeted our eyes caused me to utter a shout
of delight: for before us, at a distance of a short quarter of a mile, was the extremity of
the gorge, a mere narrow slit between two mighty walls of overhanging sandstone, through which
we caught a glimpse of an open, grassy, sun-bathed plain, the long rich grass billowing to
the sweep of a fresh breeze, and its wide stretches of level surface darkened here and there
with the rich purple shadows of slow-moving clouds, promising a welcome change from the close,
suffocating, enervating, insect-haunted atmosphere of the gorge.  And as a background to this
breezy, sunlit scene, there towered high into the air, at a distance of some ten miles, a magnificent
sweep of lofty mountains, rugged and broken of outline, tree-clad to their summits, and gleaming
like emeralds in the strong blaze of the morning sun.

With another shout of delight I pressed my heels to Prince's ribs, and three minutes later
Piet and I trotted gaily out through the mouth of the gorge into the sunlit plain--to find
ourselves confronted by a troop of some fifty of the most extraordinary-looking warriors I
had ever seen, who had evidently been lying perdu in waiting for us behind the screen of towering
rocks that formed the gateway, as it were, of the gorge.

They were little fellows, about the height of a well-grown English boy of ten years of age,
but that they were full-grown men was evidenced by the luxuriant beards and moustaches which
they all wore; indeed, one of them, their leader, appeared to be well advanced in years, for
his hair and beard were dashed here and there with grey.  It was a little difficult to judge
what their natural complexion might be, for they were all deeply tanned by the sun, but I imagined
it could be very little darker than my own, for I was as deeply bronzed as any of them, as
I could see by a glance at my own sunburnt hands.  They were clad in a uniform consisting of
a sleeveless shirt that looked as though made of white thick silk, over which was worn a kind
of tunic of fine scale armour, which gleamed and flashed in the sun as though made of gold--as
indeed it afterwards proved to be.  On their heads they wore plumed helmets of the same precious
metal; their legs were bare, save for a kind of buskin made of leather, coloured white, reaching
to just below the knee; they were armed with a short, broad-bladed sword, and a round target
or shield, finely embossed, also made of gold; and they were mounted on zebras, the trappings
of which were thickly studded with small gold bosses, the saddles consisting of thickly rolled
blankets of some soft material strapped over big saddle cloths of crimson silk, edged with
stout gold cord and adorned at the corners with tassels of gold bullion.  There was a standard-bearer
with them whose trappings were even richer and more ornate than those of the rank and file,
and who bore aloft upon a slender lance a small standard of crimson silk, deeply edged with
gold fringe, and beautifully emblazoned in gold thread with a device which seemed to be a hieroglyphic
of some sort, of which I could make nothing.

Upon finding ourselves thus suddenly confronted with this extraordinary array, we promptly
reined our horses back upon their haunches, while I with equal promptitude unslung my rifle
and brought it to the "present", more by instinct than anything else, for of course the idea
of successfully resisting fifty of even such little fellows as these, if they were evilly disposed
toward us and were possessed of only ordinary courage, was absurd.  But their chief, or leader,
quickly set our minds at rest, for without moving from his place in the front of his troop
he threw up his right hand and exclaimed, in a rather high-pitched voice, and in the Bantu
dialect with which I happened to be acquainted:

"Nay, mighty and noble lord, slay us not with thy lightnings, I pray thee, for we mean naught
but good to thee and thine!  I, Pousa, captain of the queen's bodyguard, have been dispatched
by Bimbane, the Deathless One, the Possessor of all Knowledge, the Reader of all Secrets, the
High and Mighty Queen of the Bandokolo, to bid thee welcome to her country and to conduct thee
in all honour to her gracious presence."

"It is well, O Pousa, and I thank you," answered I, as I lowered my rifle.  "But tell me, I
pray you, how came Bimbane to know that it is my purpose to visit her, and how came you to
know where you would find me?"

"The queen knows all things; there is no secret hidden from her," answered Pousa simply.  "She
has long known of thy coming and the reason for it, and at first she was minded to destroy
thee and thy following and seize all thy belongings.  Then she changed her mind and determined
to forbid thine entrance into her country.  And now, quite recently, she has again changed
her mind, and has decided to receive thee in peace, with all honour.  She it was who directed
me how and when to come and where to lie in wait for thee.  Ay, she even knows that Siluce,
the outlawed rebel, went out upon the Dark Path from thine arms."

"The dickens she does!" exclaimed I in English, in the height of my astonishment.  "Nay, but
how can that be, seeing that no one has passed from me to her to tell her so?"  I continued
in Bantu.

"It matters not, she knows," answered Pousa; adding, with just a touch of impatience: "Do I
not tell thee that she knows all things?"

"Yes," I answered, "you certainly tell me so, but--"

I checked myself abruptly, realising that I was on the point of saying something that might
easily be construed as offensive.  "It will give me great pleasure to make the acquaintance
of your queen," I continued; "for a woman who possesses such an extraordinary gift of knowledge
must be very well worth knowing.  There are one or two matters upon which I am badly in need
of reliable information.  Perhaps she may be induced to give me that information?"

"She will, without doubt--if it so pleases her," answered Pousa.  "But," he continued, "where
is thy house that travels, being drawn of oxen, and where are the rest of thy followers?  The
queen told me that there were with thee four black ones, and that--"

"My wagon--which you call a house that travels--and the remaining three of my followers are
behind," I answered.  "They will doubtless be with us in the course of a few minutes.  I shall
outspan here, so that my oxen may rest in the shade of the gorge.  Will you not direct your
men to dismount and rest their zebras?  We shall not resume our march for about three hours."

Pousa regarded me for a moment, a little doubtfully I thought; then as I calmly dismounted
and turned Prince over to Piet to be off-saddled, the little soldier gave a few crisp orders,
in a tongue of which I was ignorant, and his troopers at once dismounted, stripped their zebras
of their trappings, hobbled them, and turned them loose to graze; then the men, arranging themselves
in small parties, proceeded to open their ration sacks and refresh themselves with a meal consisting,
as I noticed, of sun-dried meat and small cakes.  Pousa very politely invited me to share his
ration with him; but as I just then caught the sounds of Jan's shrieks to his oxen, and the
cracking of his long whip, I as politely declined, inviting him in return to defer his meal
for a time and join me at luncheon, which invitation he eagerly accepted, somewhat to my surprise,
I confess, seeing that the little chap could not possibly guess what kind of food he would
be offered, or whether he would like it when it was placed before him.

A few minutes later the wagon arrived and was outspanned, its appearance exciting the utmost
curiosity and admiration of the Bandokolo, who, I now learned, had never before seen a wheeled
vehicle, and were profoundly interested when I endeavoured to explain the principle of the
wheel to them.  But they were infinitely more interested and amazed when 'Mfuni, having collected
a quantity of dry leaves and sticks with which to build a fire, came to me, and, receiving
from me the burning-glass which I habitually carried in my pocket, calmly proceeded to kindle
the fire with its aid as usual, it being our regular practice to economise our flint and steel
as much as possible by never using it when a burning-glass could be made to serve the same
purpose.  The Bandokolo, it appeared, used fire for a number of purposes, but possessed no
knowledge of how to produce it, and were therefore obliged to conserve it by keeping lamps
perpetually burning; and I could readily understand that, as Pousa explained, there were occasions
when, as in times of violent storm and heavy rain, they were put to the gravest inconvenience
through their inability to convey a lighted lamp from one place to another.

While we were partaking of luncheon--for which, by the way, Pousa displayed great relish, after
regarding the roast deer flesh for a moment or two rather dubiously--I endeavoured to pump
my guest with regard to the character and disposition of Her Majesty Queen Bimbane; but I found
the old fellow rather inclined to be reticent upon the subject, and uneasy when I began to
question him, the reason being--as he presently informed me furtively in a whisper--that, as
likely as not, the queen would be with us in spirit, listening to our conversation, and that
he had no wish to offend the lady by affording information that she would perhaps prefer should
be withheld.  Despite his disinclination to talk, however, I contrived to extract a little
information from him, learning, among other things, that I was not the first white man who
had been permitted to enter the Bandokolo country, one other having arrived when Pousa was
quite a young man, and died somewhat mysteriously soon afterward.  I was also given to understand
that the Bandokolo generally strongly objected to strangers visiting them, and were indeed
in the habit of resorting to the most drastic measures for preventing such visits, or, at all
events, for preventing the departure of unwelcome visitors from their country alive.  As for
Bimbane, what little I could induce him to say about her only went to confirm the astounding
account of her that Siluce had given; and I confess that once or twice during the progress
of that conversation I very seriously asked myself whether, after all, it would not be wiser
on my part to turn back there and then, instead of pushing on any farther into so extraordinary
a country, and placing myself in the power of so extraordinary a woman.  But I do not like
to be beaten, and could not bring myself to abandon my purpose ignominiously after having come
so far; therefore about two o'clock in the afternoon I gave the order to inspan, and we resumed
our journey.

Still closely following the course of the river across the open plain, Pousa and I rode side
by side at the head of the cavalcade, with the wagon bringing up the rear; and I soon found
that, apart from anything relating to Queen Bimbane, my companion was quite willing to be communicative,
telling me many things of an exceedingly interesting nature with regard to his extraordinary
country.  I was naturally anxious to know whether gold and "shining stones" were as plentiful
as I had been led to believe, and I was gratified to learn that they were, gold indeed being
so abundant that it was used for every purpose where metal was needed, the Bandokolo having
learned to harden and temper it in such a manner that it afforded a very fair substitute for
steel, in proof of which he showed me his sword.  I took the weapon in my hands, examined it,
and found that it was made entirely of hardened gold, and that it had been treated in such
a manner as not only to possess a certain elasticity but also to be capable of receiving a
fairly sharp edge.  The scales of their armour, I was told, were also treated in the same way,
and were so hard that it was impossible to pierce them either with sword or spear.  Then I
exhibited my hunting knife, which excited Pousa's highest admiration, and also a certain amount
of apprehension when, of set purpose, I casually mentioned my conviction that I could drive
the blade through the best scale armour that the Bandokolo could produce.  "Shining stones",
also, it seemed, were fairly abundant, but they had no particular use for these excepting as
adornments, the stones being admired because of the extreme brilliancy with which they reflected
light and colour.

We had been trekking a little more than an hour when, suddenly, without the least warning,
an enormous two-horned rhinoceros hove himself up out of the long grass about a hundred and
fifty yards in front of us, and stood regarding us doubtfully, with his little eyes gleaming
and his tail switching angrily.  At this unexpected apparition we all drew bridle, as with
one accord, to await developments, while I quickly unslung my rifle and prepared for action.
I could not help noticing that Pousa viewed the creature with considerable trepidation, while
as for the troopers in our rear, with one accord they wheeled their zebras, with the evident
intention of making a bolt if necessary.  And that it would be necessary soon became evident,
for rhino, instead of being alarmed at our imposing display of force, and making himself scarce,
was clearly annoyed at our presumption in daring to disturb him; and presently he lowered his
head and, with loud squeals of rage, came charging straight down upon us, whereupon our escort
incontinently dug their heels into the ribs of their frightened zebras and dashed off, scattering
in all directions, to my intense amusement.  But the wagon was not very far in our rear, and
if rhino were allowed to get past us, and should choose to attack it, he might easily play
havoc with my diminished team of oxen; therefore, hastily dismounting, lest Prince, despite
his training, should flinch and swerve at the critical moment and so spoil my aim, I raised
my rifle to my shoulder, and, waiting until the now thoroughly exasperated beast was within
ten yards of me, fired and sent a bullet through his right eye into the brain, bowling him
over like a rabbit.  Then, quickly reloading my rifle, I quietly waited for Pousa to rejoin
me, which he presently did, after re-forming his scattered command, without seeming to be in
the slightest degree abashed at his desertion of me.

Approaching me with considerable circumspection, as I stood over the fallen brute, with Prince
beside me, he raised his right hand and saluted, as he exclaimed:

"Truly, white lord, thou art well named Smiter with Lightning, for I beheld the flash wherewith
thou didst slay this fierce and terrible beast, before whose anger not even the bravest warrior
of the Bandokolo may stand!  Thou art as mighty a wizard as the Deathless One, for thou canst
slay without fighting, even as she can."

"It is true, Pousa, I can," answered I, willing to avail myself to the utmost of the opportunity
that had been afforded me to display my power. "But," I continued, "who told thee that I was
named Smiter with Lightning?"

"Who but the Wise One, even Bimbane, the queen?" retorted Pousa, in tones which seemed to suggest:
"Who else do you suppose it can possibly have been?"

"Not only did she tell me how thou wert called, but she described thee to me, told me of thy
huge stature and immense strength, how thou wert clothed, the wonderful weapon from which thou
dost discharge thy lightnings, and even the great black beast which thou dost bestride!"

I fell into a rather uneasy reverie.  Could this man be by any possibility telling the truth?
The story was so astounding, so utterly incredible--and yet it was told so simply, and with
such an utter lack of all straining after effect: the man made no attempt to impress me with
the marvel of it all; his tone and manner were those of one who told of the most matter-of-fact,
everyday occurrences.  Besides, if he were not telling the truth, how could he possibly have
come to know the name which had been given me by Lomalindela, the King of the Mashona?-- for
I was perfectly certain that he had had no opportunity to learn it from either of my own "boys."

But if this and the other things that he had told me concerning Bimbane were indeed true, she
must be a most extraordinary woman, endowed with strange and wonderful powers, and it might
be that I should find her rather more than I could manage before I had done with her.  To admit
the possibility that she might indeed possess such uncanny powers led inevitably toward several
very unpleasantly suggestive reflections; but with an effort I threw them off, for I had already
determined to go through with the adventure, and would not allow myself to be diverted from
my purpose by the thought of any possibilities, however unpleasant. Therefore I roused myself
and continued my conversation with Pousa by describing the fight between the men-monkeys and
its awful conclusion, and asked him to tell me what he could about both the beasts and the
trees.  He could not tell me much about either, but what he did tell was grim enough; for,
with regard to the monkeys, he informed me that they were well known as the most ferocious
beasts to be found in Bandokolo, and that a certain number were captured by means of pitfalls,
in which they were permitted to remain until they were all but dead from starvation, when they
were removed to Masakisale (the capital city), and carefully tended until they were restored
to a condition of normal health and strength.  Then they were used to test the guilt or otherwise
of persons charged with offences of exceptional enormity; the test being made by setting the
accused to fight with one or more of the brutes, when, if he conquered, it was presumed that
he was innocent.

I naturally enquired whether anyone had ever thus succeeded in demonstrating his innocence,
and was not surprised to be answered in the negative.  Then I asked why, if Bimbane really
knew all things, it was necessary to subject a suspect to such a test in order to determine
his guilt or innocence, to which Pousa replied that, of course, the test was quite unnecessary,
for the queen could always tell whether or not a man was guilty, and to sentence a prisoner
to such an ordeal was equivalent to pronouncing him guilty and ordering his execution; but
the form of trial was retained since it was one of the institutions of the country which had
existed from time immemorial.

As to the tree, into the foliage of which the victorious monkey had flung his antagonist, I
was told that it, like the monkeys, was indigenous to Bandokolo, and that one of its most gruesome
peculiarities was the ghoulish avidity with which it enveloped any unfortunate individual or
animal in its tentacle-like leaves and forthwith proceeded to absorb its victim into itself.
These trees, Pousa added, were sometimes employed instead of the monkeys as a means for the
disposal of criminals.  "A truly charming country and people," thought I, "apparently abounding
in the most delightful characteristics!"

About half an hour before sunset we reached the foot of the mountains toward which we had been
trekking all through the afternoon, and outspanned on the veld at the entrance to a pass which
had revealed itself about an hour earlier.

The scenery in this pass, when we entered it on the following morning, proved to be very similar
in character to that of the gorge through which we had passed on the previous day, before encountering
Pousa and his troopers, but, if anything, even more wild, gloomy, and sombre; and I was not
sorry when, about eleven o'clock, we emerged from it into a kind of basin, hemmed in on all
sides by hills. Mr. Trelawny bent over, and with hands that trembled slightly, raised this linen
cloth which was of the same fineness as the robe. As he stood back and the whole glorious beauty of
the Queen was revealed, I felt a rush of shame sweep over me. It was not right that we should
be there, gazing with irreverent eyes on such unclad beauty: it was indecent; it was almost
sacrilegious! And yet the white wonder of that beautiful form was something to dream of. It
was not like death at all; it was like a statue carven in ivory by the hand of a Praxiteles.
There was nothing of that horrible shrinkage which death seems to effect in a moment. There
was none of the wrinkled toughness which seems to be a leading characteristic of most mummies.
There was not the shrunken attenuation of a body dried in the sand, as I had seen before in museums.
All the pores of the body seemed to have been preserved in some wonderful way. The flesh was full
and round, as in a living person; and the skin was as smooth as satin. The colour seemed extraordinary.
It was like ivory, new ivory; except where the right arm, with shattered, bloodstained wrist
and missing hand had lain bare to exposure in the sarcophagus for so many tens of centuries.

With a womanly impulse; with a mouth that drooped with pity, with eyes that flashed with anger,
and cheeks that flamed, Margaret threw over the body the beautiful robe which lay across her
arm. Only the face was then to be seen.

This was more startling even than the body, for it seemed not dead, but alive. The eyelids
were closed; but the long, black, curling lashes lay over on the cheeks. The nostrils, set in
grave pride, seemed to have the repose which, when it is seen in life, is greater than the repose
of death.

On the following day we passed another of the extraordinary Bandokolo villages, and, on the
day following that, two more, each being considerably larger than the preceding one, while
the distance between them steadily decreased, so that on the tenth day after Pousa found us
we passed through no less than five villages, the last two being within three miles of each
other, and of such extent that I estimated each of them to contain at least four thousand inhabitants,
if not more.  And now, as every mile brought us appreciably nearer to Masakisale, the capital
and the abode of the mysterious and redoubtable Queen Bimbane, it was no longer possible to
keep the people at a distance, and I had abundant opportunity to study their appearance, manners,
dress, and customs generally.

I feel bound to say that, taking into consideration all that I had heard about them, my first
impression was distinctly favourable.  For, pygmies though they were, they were as a rule perfectly
formed; their colour was so light that it soon became scarcely noticeable; their expression
was intelligent, and by no means unamiable, at least in the case of the women, while as for
the latter, though real beauty might be rare it was certainly not entirely absent, and many
of the younger ones were quite good-looking, if not actually pretty.  In the matter of attire,
the dress generally worn was admirably adapted to the tropical climate in which the wearers
lived, that of the men consisting simply of a pair of tight-fitting drawers reaching to just
above the knee, over which was worn a sleeveless shirt of thick silk, confined at the waist
by a belt; while that of the women appeared to be a single garment of thick silk, generally
white, but occasionally dyed, the favourite colours being a rich crimson, a sea green, and
a very pale blue.  But, apart from the soldiers, neither sex wore any head covering, their
thick hair seeming to afford them all the protection needed from the fierce rays of the vertical
sun; but both sexes wore a kind of buskin of soft leather reaching to just below the knee,
the sole consisting of a shaped piece of thick hide stitched on to the under part of the buskin.

The abundance of gold in the country was amply testified by the fact that all adorned themselves
more or less with ornaments, such as belts, bracelets, armlets, or necklaces, made of the metal,
many of the women wearing, in addition, small plaques or bosses of hammered gold stitched to
the hems of their dresses, while others wore a kind of coronet, formed of hammered or chiselled
gold, in their hair.  A rather sinister feature which quickly attracted my attention was that,
with scarcely a solitary exception, the men went armed, each with a heavy, murderous-looking
knife of hardened gold thrust into his belt.  Diamonds also now came in evidence, a few of
the women wearing the rough, uncut stones set in gold, as necklaces, in their belts, or as
adjuncts to their coronets.  And now, too, for the first time, I had an opportunity to see
the kind of vehicle in general use among the Bandokolo, this consisting of a rough kind of
sleigh, usually drawn by a single elephant, although I encountered, here and there, sleighs
big enough to need, when fully loaded, two elephants to draw them.  The horse was a hitherto
unknown beast among them, and it was amusing to note the wonder and admiration which my animals
excited among the people as we passed. But they had contrived completely to domesticate the
zebra, which seemed to be quite common among them, although it was used exclusively as a saddle
animal.

Up to the present I had been afforded no opportunity to view the interior of the rock dwellings
of this extraordinary people; but as we drew ever nearer to the capital I could not help feeling
impressed by the increasing elaboration of the decoration of the entrances, and the high degree
of artistic taste displayed.  Some of the dwellings, indeed, seemed to be wholly artificial,
that is to say, the owner appeared to have chosen a particular spot on the face of the living
rock, and, attacking it, had begun work by hewing out first the entrance--which was usually
rectangular in shape, ornamented with columns supporting a sculptured pediment--and thence
proceeding to excavate inward as many apartments as were needed for the accommodation of his
family.  Such a structure would, if executed by the members of the family alone, require many
years of continuous labour to complete; but Pousa informed me that the usual practice was for
a young man to start his house as soon as he attained the age of two hundred and thirty-four
moons (eighteen years), leaving the exterior ornamentation quite rough, to be completed at
his leisure, and, hewing out a central passage, to employ others to help him in excavating
the interior apartments, adding to their number from time to time as the need for them arose.

About mid-afternoon on the eleventh day after Pousa and his detachment had taken charge of
us, we reached the city of Masakisale, the capital of Bandokolo; and after what has already
been said with regard to this remarkable people, the reader will not be surprised to learn
that it was far and away the most extraordinary city that I had ever seen or heard of.  It
was situated in a kind of basin about eight miles wide by about twenty-two miles long, hemmed
in on every side by precipitous mountains, and approached through one of the weirdest, wildest,
and most forbiddingly picturesque gorges that it is possible for the mind of man to imagine.
A mountain torrent foamed and raged over a rocky bed through this gorge into the basin, and
finally discharged itself into a gloomy tarn, about two miles wide by three and a half miles
long, which occupied the whole of the lower or northern end of the valley.  A wide, straight
road ran lengthwise through the valley from end to end, and was intersected, at intervals of
about a mile, by cross roads, between which the whole of the valley was under cultivation,
except for a patch of about five miles long adjoining the tarn, one-third of which was pasture
land, while the remainder was devoted to the raising of hay, four crops of which were cut every
year.  A road, with which the intersecting roads communicated, ran right round the valley,
at the base of the precipitous mountain slopes which formed the sides of the basin, and from
it other roads zigzagged up the slopes to the very summit.

These zigzag roads gave access to the rock dwellings honeycombing the mountains, the sculptured
entrances to which were clearly discernible through the variegated colours that splashed the
slopes, these variegated colours being due to the fact that the mountain slopes had been terraced
from base to summit, filled with earth where required, and converted into gardens and fruit
orchards.

The industrial portion of the city was situated at the northern end of the valley, the prevailing
wind here being from the south; thus the smoke of the factory furnaces was carried away out
of the valley at its northern end, which obviated all nuisance.  The population of Masakisale
numbered fully twenty thousand, according to Pousa; and I afterward had reason to believe that
he was very far within the mark, for I roughly estimated that there must be nearly that number
of dwellings in the valley, and they would accommodate, on an average, at least four persons
each.  There appeared to be nearly or quite five thousand people at work in the fields when
we entered the valley, assisted by some forty or fifty elephants, which seemed to be employed
here and there in ploughing up the land and preparing it for a new crop.  There was also a
considerable amount of traffic, pedestrian and vehicular, on the various roads; and when the
news of our arrival spread through the valley--which it appeared to do with marvellous celerity--this
traffic increased a hundredfold at least, so that within an hour of our arrival it seemed as
though every man, woman, and child in the valley had turned out to stare at us.  And I confess
that I was by no means favourably impressed with the manner in which the men at least of Masakisale
regarded my appearance among them, for if I correctly interpreted the expression of their countenances
it was made up, in about equal proportions, of hatred and fear; while that of the women, on
the other hand, seemed chiefly to indicate wonder, probably at my stature, for, compared with
their fifty-four inches, my seventy-four must have appeared gigantic.

There was no difficulty at all in identifying the royal palace; for whereas most of the other
dwellings in the valley were indicated merely by a more or less elaborately sculptured doorway
hewn out of the living rock, the abode of Queen Bimbane measured--judging by the eye alone--at
least five hundred feet long by sixty feet high, the whole surface of which was sculptured
into the form of a house front, consisting of a doorway with window openings on either side
of it, and, above that, two other tiers of window openings giving upon wide projecting balconies,
the whole very elaborately decorated with mouldings, balusters, architraves, pediments, columns,
entablatures, and other architectural features, in a style quite strange to me, yet very handsome
and impressive, and representing, I should say, the life's work of several hundred masons.
Moreover, there was a banner flying over the centre of the building, consisting of a replica,
upon a very much larger scale, of that borne by the standard-bearer who accompanied my escort.

This remarkable building--if indeed it may so be called--was situated about three miles down
the valley, on its western side and consequently facing east, so that for the greater part
of the day it was in shadow, while every one of its window openings was shaded from the morning
sun by awnings of some material (which I afterward found was silk) arranged in alternate stripes
of green and white.  I sighted and identified it at a distance of more than a mile away; and
when we arrived opposite it I found that, as of course might be expected, one of the intersecting
roads crossing the main road led up to it.  But there was this difference between that particular
road and all the others, that whereas the others had cultivated fields on either side of them,
this road was bordered on either hand by beautiful smooth grassy lawns, kept cut quite close,
interspersed at frequent intervals with great, fancifully shaped beds of flowers, while here
and there enormous shade trees had been left, beneath which quite a large number of handsomely
attired men and women were lounging.  These were, of course, the palace gardens; and when I
enquired, Pousa informed me that the loungers belonged to the queen's retinue, the general
public being rigorously excluded from them. Upon our arrival at the point where the road leading
to the palace branched off from the main road, Pousa informed me that I must now bid a temporary
adieu to the wagon and my followers, these being destined to the lower end of the valley, where
the pasture was situated, while, by command of the queen, I was to be lodged in the palace;
therefore if I would indicate such of my personal belongings as I wished to have taken to my
new quarters, he would see that they were duly conveyed thither. I rather demurred at this,
not caring to be separated from Piet and 'Mfuni; but upon learning that the arrangement had
been ordered by the queen, and could not now be altered, I yielded, with the best grace I could
muster, and gave instructions that all my spare guns and a plentiful supply of ammunition should
be conveyed to my destined quarters with the utmost circumspection, and there deposited.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN.

THE PLOT THICKENS.

Separated from the wagon, and thus under no further obligation to regulate our pace by that
of the slow-moving oxen, we now, at Pousa's command, advanced at a trot along the road leading
directly to the palace; and as we rapidly approached that structure I became increasingly impressed
by the remarkable grace and beauty of its architectural decorations, the exquisite details
of which forced themselves more insistently upon my attention with every foot of our progress.
For instance, I saw now that certain irregularities in the surface of the walls and the shafts
of the columns, which in the distance I had taken as due to the effect of weather, were really
a vast number of small pictures, sculptured in very low relief, representing scenes in the
history of Bandokolo, many of those scenes being, naturally, battles.  And although the figures
were conventionally drawn, the vigour of action and the truth to nature of the attitudes portrayed
evidenced the work of an artist of no mean power.

But I had no opportunity just then to study the sculptures at leisure, for Pousa was evidently
very anxious to complete his responsible task of delivering me safely within the precincts
of the palace.  I was therefore obliged to content myself with a hasty glance at the facade
as a whole, while dismounting and resigning my horse to the care of a groom who awaited my
arrival at the foot of the broad flight of steps leading up to the main entrance.  Then, accompanied
by Pousa, who also had dismounted, I ascended the steps, fifty in number, and was ushered through
a wide and lofty doorway provided with a pair of heavy swing doors of massive gold, the panels
of which were decorated with figures in high relief, into a cool and lofty hall, where I was
received by and formally turned over to an official whom I afterward learned was the major-domo,
or master of the queen's household.  This individual very cordially welcomed me to Masakisale,
in the name of the queen, and, bidding me and the attendants bearing my belongings to follow
him, led the way to the rear of the hall, which, as soon as my eyes grew accustomed to the
somewhat subdued light, I saw was about fifty feet long by fifty feet high by twenty-five feet
wide, with a broad balcony, supported by columns, running all round it at a height of some
thirty feet from the pavement.

At the far end of the hall was a massive flight of steps, hewn out of the solid rock wall,
leading up to the interior balcony, to which we climbed; and, arrived there, I was conducted
to a suite of two rooms, which I was given to understand had been assigned for my use by the
queen.  The larger room of the two was a front room looking out upon the palace gardens, and
was evidently intended for day use; while the one behind, which had no window and derived its
light from the front room and from a handsome gold lamp suspended from the ceiling, was a combined
bathroom and sleeping chamber.  This latter room, the stone floor of which was covered with
fine matting, contained a very beautiful and spacious ivory couch, most luxuriously furnished,
a number of elegant and equally luxurious divans, and an immense bath, almost big enough to
swim in, sunk into the floor.  The official who had me in charge pointed out these various
matters to me, as well as a very handsome suit of clothing, evidently made expressly for me,
which, he intimated, it was the queen's wish I should wear during my stay in the country; told
me that by clapping my hands I could summon a servant who had been detailed to attend upon
me; and then bowed himself out.

Left at length to myself, I instructed the people who had brought my belongings where to put
them, satisfied myself that nothing was missing, and then, dismissing the men, proceeded to
take stock of my surroundings.  The apartments assigned to me were very spacious, lofty, cool,
and airy, and were furnished with a degree of elegance and luxury that was simply astounding,
especially in view of the fact that I was in a part of Africa which, so far as I knew, but
one white man had ever visited before, and from which no white man had ever emerged; and I
felt that I was fully justified in regarding myself as very highly honoured. Then, when I had
completed my inspection, I clapped my hands, and, upon the appearance of the attendant, intimated
that I should like a bath; whereupon the man withdrew a wooden plug from a hole in the wall,
and in a few minutes the immense bath was full to the brim of bright, cold, sparkling spring
water, into which I at once plunged, completely submerging myself for about half a minute,
to the amazement and consternation of my attendant, who afterward confessed that he feared
I was bent upon drowning myself, none of the Bandokolo, it appeared, possessing the slightest
knowledge of natation.  My use of soap, too, and the facility with which by its aid I was enabled
to remove the dust and grime accumulated during the day's travel, was another revelation to
him; as was also the comb wherewith I arranged my now much too luxuriant locks.  My bath towels
likewise came in for a share of his admiration; but the thing which, next to my stature, most
excited the fellow's astonishment was the whiteness of my skin, where it had been protected
by my clothing, compared with the deep bronze of my face and hands. Having bathed to my satisfaction
I proceeded to clothe myself in the new garments which had been so thoughtfully provided for
me--and for which I was indeed grateful, for the best of my own clothes were by this time little
better than rags.  These new garments consisted of a pair of bathing drawers--at least that
is what they were like, for they only reached down to just above the knees--a tunic-like, sleeveless
shirt, and a pair of buskins made of soft white leather, soled with ox-hide. The drawers were
made quite plain, of thick white silk, and fitted fairly tight to the body; the shirt also
was made of the same material, but about the armholes and the hem of it there was stitched
a broad band of crimson silk, sewn in a beautiful pattern with gold thread and thickly studded
with small gold bosses about the size of ordinary coat buttons, each boss being beautifully
chiselled with a flower-like pattern in high relief.  There was also a waist belt, made of
solid gold links fastened together with a sort of hinge, and clasped in front with a pair of
massive gold sculptured plaques, forming a very handsome adornment to one's person, and very
convenient, too, for it happened to be of just the right width to take my pistol holsters.
These garments all fitted me as though made to measure, to my great astonishment; and when
I asked Langila--that being the name of my new servant--how he accounted for such an extraordinary
fact, he further amazed me by saying, as calmly as though it were the most natural thing imaginable,
that the articles had all been made according to measurements supplied by the queen!  And when
I pushed my curiosity farther by asking how Her Majesty could possibly guess so accurately
at the proportions of a man whom she had never seen, he simply shrugged his shoulders and repeated
Pousa's astounding statement that "the queen knows all things!"  After which I requested that
I might be left to myself; for I wished to give this statement my most careful consideration,
and to endeavour to fathom all that it might possibly mean to me.

Was it possible that this extraordinary woman, reputed to be old far beyond the limits of the
age usually ascribed to humanity--this queen of a wonderful people hidden away in the mysterious
depths of Africa, the continent of strange and mystic happenings, was really the possessor
of the gift of unlimited knowledge?  To me, a plain, simple, matter-of-fact Briton, such a
thing seemed impossible; yet Pousa had already supplied me with proof that surely ought to
have been convincing to any reasonable man.  He had been told that on a certain date and at
a certain spot he would encounter me, and he had done so; my appearance had been described
to him, and the description had proved accurate in every particular, down to the most minute
detail; and he had even learned the facts connected with the death of the unhappy Siluce! 
How had the queen, his informant, become acquainted with all these matters, seeing that even
the fact of my impending visit to Bandokolo could not possibly have been made known through
any of the ordinary recognised channels of communication?  It was an exceedingly disquieting
circumstance; for if Bimbane actually possessed this astounding, supernatural gift of knowledge
it practically rendered her all-powerful, and how could any ordinary individual--myself, for
instance-- successfully contend with such a being--if contention should ever become necessary?
I decided that contention, strife, between her and myself must not be permitted to become necessary:
I must cultivate her goodwill and gain her friendship if I could, then all might be well; whereas
if I should be so unfortunate as to incur her displeasure--well, there was no use in blinking
the fact that she was powerful enough to destroy me.

I had just about arrived at the above conclusion when Langila appeared and respectfully enquired
when it would be my pleasure to eat, which reminded me that several hours had elapsed since
I had last partaken of a meal, and that, despite the disquieting nature of my recent reflections,
I was hungry.  I therefore intimated that I was quite ready for a meal at any moment, whereupon
he disappeared, to return a few minutes later accompanied by half a dozen servants, who quickly
and deftly prepared a table by covering it with a very handsome cloth of spotless white linen,
upon which they placed a number of elegantly wrought dishes of polished agate, heaped high
with fruits of various kinds arranged with their respective leaves, a most beautiful vase of
some wonderfully marked and highly polished stone, full of wine, and several elaborately chased
plates and dishes of massive gold, one of which contained a little pile of thin, flat cakes
of a kind of bread, smoking hot.  Then another man entered, bearing a gold dish containing
what looked like a roast fowl, but what I presently discovered was a parrot; and Langila intimated
that my dinner was served.  And a very excellent dinner it proved to be; for the parrot was
tender, juicy, of very appetising flavour, and perfectly cooked, while the little cakes of
hot bread were particularly good.  Then the wine!  It was of a rich ruby colour and exquisite
aroma, but light and innocuous as water.  As for the fruits, I had never before--and have never
since--tasted such luscious peaches and grapes.  And all this elegance and luxury, I kept reminding
myself, existed in a part of Africa utterly unknown to the white man!

Whether it was the novelty of my surroundings, the somewhat perturbing character of my reflections,
or the contrast between the luxuriousness of my couch and the hard cartel upon which I had
reposed for so many months under a stifling wagon tent, I know not, but sleep was slow to come
to me on that first night of my sojourn in the palace of Queen Bimbane; and when at length
it visited me it seemed that I had scarcely closed my eyes before I opened them again to find
that it was day, and that Langila was standing beside my couch, respectfully enquiring whether
it would please me to bathe before dressing for breakfast.  I replied that it certainly would,
whereupon the fellow filled my bath for me, and a few minutes later I was luxuriously wallowing
in the cold, crystal-clear water.  To towel myself dry and dress was the work of but a minute
or two, and then I sat down to a meal which in point of elegance and luxury was the equal of
that partaken of on the previous evening.

When I had finished, Langila, who was really a most admirable servant, respectfully enquired
what I next proposed to do; and when I informed him that I intended to ride to the lower end
of the valley, to see how my servants were faring, and that the wagon and oxen were being properly
looked after, he assured me that I might rest perfectly easy as to that, but that if I were
determined upon doing as I proposed it was the wish of the queen that I should appear in public
suitably arrayed.  Thereupon he vanished, and presently returned bearing a superb doublet of
gold scale armour upon a foundation of doeskin as soft as a kid glove, a broad belt of massive
gold links heavily studded with uncut diamonds, supporting a gold-bladed sword in a richly
chased golden sheath, and a gold helmet, wadded and lined with silk and surmounted by a splendid
plume of ostrich feathers dyed a deep, rich crimson! Let me again say we are now entering these
times, and this world is swiftly passing under awful and blinding delusions. So great are the
delusions that if possible the very elect should be deceived.

The religious teachers of to-day on the whole are in ignorance concerning the binding of Satan.
We will give you a sample of the ignorance of these teachers. In the Gospel Messenger of March
25, 1899, the Querist Department in answer to a question asked concerning the binding of Satan,
said: “Satan will then be bound, cast into the bottomless pit, and there will be a chance to convert
the unrighteous and lead them to accept Christ as the Savior.”

A subscriber in search of knowledge asked the Querist Department to give a scripture to prove
the last clause. He received this answer: “It seems to us that it is one of those self-evident
views that needs no proof. If the Bible teaches otherwise let us have the chapter and verse. The Querist
Department does not pretend to know everything.”

There are many other chapters and verses that teach otherwise. “Now is the day of salvation.” “How
shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?” The wicked shall
be resurrected to damnation.

John 5:29.

Conclusion Of Part Second.

We have now passed the noonday. The reader, no doubt, fully comprehends why it was dark. The morning
was light because the whole Word of truth was taught and experienced by the church. All were
under the immediate control of the infallible Holy Spirit.

The noonday was dark because the leadings and teachings of fallible man were substituted for
the Holy Spirit and Word. A thousand errors were brought in, the Word of God rejected. The faith
once delivered to the saints was lost, sin and iniquity abounded and their love waxed cold. The
preachers divined for money, and sought places of affluence, and thus the day was dark over
them. Sectism to-day is a mass of worldliness. Infidelity abounds and every abominable work. If you
desire a perfect description of sectism as it appears upon the scene to-day, read that given by the
angel in Rev. 18:2.

PART III. THE EVENING.

Or, Christianity In The Closing Days Of This Gospel Era.

We have now come to consider the evening time of this gospel day.

The morning was light because of the truth being experienced and
taught. The noonday was dark because traditions and theories and vain
philosophies of man became substitutes for the Word of God. This evening
time was seen by prophetic eye. The sun of time hangs low in the western
horizon. The gospel light is now shining in peaceful splendor like
the clear setting of the sun after a dark and cloudy noonday.

“Misty
fogs so long concealing All the hills of mingled night Vanish, all
their sin revealing, For the “evening shall be light”

“Lo, the ransomed
are returning, Robed in shining crystal white, Leaping, shouting,
home to Zion, Happy in the ev’ning light.”—Sel.

Chapter I. The Apostasy
In Two Days.

In our introduction we gave a number of texts which
spoke of the whole of the gospel dispensation as one day; but any
period of time distinguished by some extraordinary historic event
may be and is also termed a day. The apostasy or dark noonday being
under two forms is marked in Bible history as two days. The first
form of the apostasy, namely, Catholicism, is called by the Scriptures
a “dark day.”

A Cloudy Day.  I have been anticipating this moment with much curiosity,
and also with a little trepidation, for my prescience tells me that you are destined to exercise
a great, indeed a vital, influence upon my future; and I have wondered whether that influence
will be for good, or for evil."

"For good, I trust, Your Majesty," I replied, as, sinking on one knee, I placed my right hand
beneath hers and raised it respectfully to my lips. As I have said, that hand was swathed in
silken wrappings, so that I could not see it, but my sense of touch told me that it was small
and, as it seemed to me, painfully thin.  But although I did not see the hand I saw something
else, and that was the orange and ruddy flashes of a jewel on the thumb, the brilliance of
which was so great that it made itself manifest even through the silken veil in which it was
enveloped; and I immediately remembered the "potent amulet", containing a stone "which shines
like the sun at eventide", mentioned by Siluce, which she had besought me to take from its owner.

"I, too, trust that it will be for good, Chia'gnosi, otherwise you would never have been allowed
to come here," answered the queen.  "My prescience--which has never yet deceived me--tells
me that in you I shall find a man who can be either a true, loyal, steadfast friend, or an
implacable enemy; and as I am determined to make you my friend, I am not afraid.  Yet I see
that, in the depths of your heart, you are already prejudiced against me; and since that prejudice
must be removed before friendship can be born, tell me, I pray you, how did that prejudice
originate?  But first, rise, and sit beside me, here."

I rose and obeyed, in some confusion; for how, I asked myself, could this woman possibly read
my inmost thoughts, as she appeared able to do? Nevertheless, it seemed to me that honesty
was the best policy, therefore I answered her, after seating myself at as respectful a distance
from her as the divan would allow:

"If I am indeed prejudiced at all against Your Majesty, it is because of the story that Siluce
told me."

"Ah, yes, Siluce!" retorted the queen rather bitterly.  "She died in your arms.  And, before
dying, she no doubt told you that the Bandokolo are a cruel, wicked people; and that I, their
queen, am the most cruel and wicked of them all.  Did she not?"

"I am told that you know all things," I returned.  "If that be true, you must be fully aware
of every word which that unhappy young woman said."

"Ye-e-es," answered Bimbane slowly, "I ought to know, certainly; but it happens that I do not.
For at the moment when you encountered Siluce, it chanced that my attention was distracted
from you for a time; and when at length I was again free to visualise you, the woman was lying
dead in your arms, and so I missed hearing what she told you.  But I can guess; and I have
guessed aright, have I not?"

"Pretty nearly," I replied.  And then I repeated what Siluce had said as to the treatment which
she had received, and the causes for that treatment; and I ventured to hint that, according
to the views of civilised people, the unhappy girl had been atrociously misused.

"So that was the story Siluce told you?" remarked the queen, when I had finished.  "Now listen
to mine, and judge between us.

"I am not a young woman; I am indeed old, as you have already guessed: yet when the time of
mourning for my late consort was past, many chiefs and nobles urged me to wed again, and offered
themselves as suitable candidates for the position of spouse to the queen.  I knew that these
proposals were made only because of the power, influence, and wealth which belong to the position;
yet, because I am a woman, with all a woman's weaknesses, and the Bandokolo are a fickle, turbulent
people, impatient of restraint and difficult to govern, it seemed desirable that I should choose
another consort from among the many suitors for the honour.  And after careful consideration
I chose Anuti, one of the captains of my guard, because he seemed the most suitable for the
position, and the man most likely to be helpful to me in my difficult task of government.

"But Siluce, who was one of the women of my household, had already seen Anuti, and desired
him as her husband, although the man would have naught to do with her.  And when the forthcoming
espousals of Anuti and myself were announced, Siluce forced her way into my presence, upbraided
me for robbing her of her lover, and sought to slay me!  Therefore I dismissed her from my
household, and forbade her ever to appear again in my presence; but it was Anuti who caused
her to be whipped, and afterwards ordered her banishment.  And because, after our espousals,
I learned this, and rebuked Anuti for his cruelty, he has quarrelled with me and become my enemy."

"U-um!"  I returned.  "That, of course, is a very different story from the one told me by Siluce."

"And it is the truth," asserted the queen; "although doubtless there are those who will declare
to the contrary.  I possess much knowledge, Chia'gnosi, yet I know not how I am to convince
you of the truth; for he, my husband, who could verify my words, resents my rebuke and has
become my most bitter and implacable enemy, and doubtless he will seek to win you over to his
side by bearing false witness against me.  I would that I could make you my friend, Chia'gnosi,
for never have I so sorely needed a friend as now, when Anuti has turned against me and seeks
to oust me from my place and become supreme in the land.  And you are wise with the wisdom
of the white man; you are a warrior, and come of the race of those who always conquer: therefore
if I could win you to my side I should certainly triumph in the struggle that I foresee is
at hand.  Tell me, Chia'gnosi, how may I win you to become my champion?"

"Nay, O Queen," answered I, "ask me not, I pray you; for I came here not to take part in any
quarrel, but merely to--"

"Yes, I know," interrupted the queen.  "You came hither hoping to obtain much gold and many
shining stones.  Well, whether or not you will become my friend, I can at least help you to
realise your wish.  You shall have as much gold and as many shining stones as you can carry
away.  I have many stones already, and I will give orders that more shall be obtained, so that
you may have as many as you desire; while as for gold, all that I possess is yours for the asking."

What could I say by way of reply to such lavish generosity as this?  I could but thank the
queen with all my heart, and did so, yet with a lurking dread that she might attach to the
acceptance of her gift some condition which I certainly could not assent to without a great
deal more knowledge than I then possessed.  But she did not: on the contrary, she led me to
understand that her gift was quite unconditional; and we then proceeded to talk of other matters,
with the result that when at length I was dismissed, I left the royal presence strongly impressed
with the conviction that my hostess was a very much misunderstood and maligned woman, earnestly
desirous of governing an unruly people wisely and well, in the face of strenuous opposition
on the part of a clique of ambitious and unscrupulous nobles, of whom the most ambitious and
unscrupulous was Anuti, her husband, who, it seemed pretty evident, aimed at nothing short
of her dethronement and death, and the usurpation of supreme power.  I confess I felt very
sorry for the poor old creature; and although I was particularly careful to pledge myself to
nothing, I was conscious of a very strong inclination to espouse her cause and do what I might
to defeat the machinations of her powerful enemies.  She readily assented to my petition that
'Mfuni, my Mashona, might be permitted to come to the palace, to act as groom to Prince, that
animal having manifested a distinct distaste for the attentions of the Bandokolo stableman;
and the man presented himself that same afternoon, in response to a message which I sent, commanding
his immediate appearance.

For nearly a week after this nothing of any particular import happened. Upon one pretext or
another the queen sent for me every day, sometimes more than once, to converse with her; and
by the end of the fifth day after my arrival I had practically forgotten Siluce's charges against
her, forgotten that she was an old woman--although on the occasion of our third interview she
had permitted me to see her small, withered, wrinkled old face--forgotten everything, in fact,
except that I had come to the conclusion that she was the most charming, delightful, and interesting,
as well as the most friendless and vilely betrayed woman I had ever heard of.  She had kept
her word right royally in the matter of the diamonds, having sent me a goatskin sack full of
the most magnificent stones, while I was led to understand that more were being diligently
sought for; and as for gold, there was already enough of it in my apartment to tax the strength
of my diminished team of oxen to the utmost to draw it when it should be loaded into the wagon.

On the sixth day after my arrival in Masakisale I encountered Anuti, the queen's husband, while
riding from the palace to the wagon, as was my daily wont.  He joined me when I was about halfway
down the valley, riding out from one of the side roads, which, it appeared, led to the house
that he was then inhabiting, he having deserted the palace immediately after his quarrel with
the queen.  He approached and accosted me, introducing himself quite frankly; and upon learning
that I was on my way to the lower end of the valley, asked permission to accompany me, which
I accorded rather ungraciously, I am afraid, for I was by that time very bitterly prejudiced
against him.  Yet, as we rode, conversing together, I found it hard to maintain that prejudice,
for he was as unlike the man I had pictured him as it was possible for a man to be; indeed,
I was amazed at the frankness, geniality, and courteousness of his manner.  He professed to
be rejoiced at the opportunity that I was affording him to make my acquaintance, for which
he thanked me; very delicately hinted his admiration of my prowess in killing the rhinoceros
which had attacked the escort; and expressed an earnest desire that, despite the suspicion
and dislike with which I at that moment regarded him, the time was not far-distant when we
should be stanch friends.  He added that there were several of Bandokolo's most influential
nobles and chiefs who were anxious to be made known to me; and when I received this intimation
with a return to my original frigidity of manner he turned to me and exclaimed, with an almost
startling earnestness of manner:

"Ah, Chia'gnosi, I would that you could be persuaded to lay aside your prejudices, and treat
me and my friends fairly!  Our conception of you has been that of a man who loves justice and
fairness above all things, else would you never have been permitted to come hither.  I know
that you have been a sojourner in the palace for the last five days, and that you have been
daily--ay, almost hourly--brought under the influence of the queen, consequently I fully understand
your antagonism to me.  She has told you her story, and has cunningly played upon your sympathy
and the chivalry of your character, leading you to believe that she is the most unfortunate,
most maligned and persecuted woman in the whole world. But that is only her version of the
story; and I swear to you that it is false!  I know the story which the lips of the dying Siluce
whispered into your ears, for my spirit was with you both then, and I say that every word of
it is true, although I know that Bimbane has asserted the contrary.  Think of this, therefore,
Chia'gnosi, and ask yourself whether you may not have been led by a cunning, unscrupulous,
and lying old witch to give your sympathy to the wrong person.  If you are capable of being
convinced by the truth--as I believe you are--I can convince you.  But you must give me the
opportunity; and if you will but do this, I tell you that you will thank me for asking you
to hear what I have to say."

To say that I was amazed and shocked beyond all power of expression at the possibility that
I had been hoodwinked and played with by a preternaturally plausible old woman is to put the
matter very mildly; yet slowly the conviction dawned upon me that it might be so. There does not
seem to have been any opening cut for the withdrawing of the viscera and organs, which apparently
remain intact within the body. Then, again, there is no moisture in the flesh; but its place
is supplied with something else, as though wax or stearine had been conveyed into the veins
by some subtle process. I wonder could it be possible that at that time they could have used
paraffin. It might have been, by some process that we know not, pumped into the veins, where it hardened!"

Margaret,
having thrown a white sheet over the Queen's body, asked us to bring it to her own room, where
we laid it on her bed. Then she sent us away, saying:

"Leave her alone with me. There are still many hours to pass, and I do not like to leave her lying
there, all stark in the glare of light. This may be the Bridal she prepared for--the Bridal of Death;
and at least she shall wear her pretty robes."

When presently she brought me back to her room, the dead Queen was dressed in the robe of fine
linen with the embroidery of gold; and all her beautiful jewels were in place. Candles were
lit around her, and white flowers lay upon her breast.

Hand in hand we stood looking at her for a while. Then with a sigh, Margaret covered her with
one of her own snowy sheets.

She turned away; and after softly closing the door of the room, went back with me to the others
who had now come into the dining room. Here we all began to talk over the things that had
been, and that were to be.

Now and again I could feel that one or
other of us was forcing conversation, as if we were not sure of ourselves.
The long wait was beginning to tell on our nerves. It was apparent
to me that Mr. Trelawny had suffered in that strange trance more than
we suspected, or than he cared to show. True, his will and his determination
were as strong as ever; but the purely physical side of him had been
weakened somewhat. It was indeed only natural that it should be.  Therefore,
make such arrangements as you may deem necessary; and when you are ready I shall be prepared
to listen to you.  But, understand this: your proofs will have to be very full and complete
to be wholly convincing, for, rightly or wrongly, I have been very strongly impressed with
the conviction that the queen is the victim of a powerful band of thoroughly ruthless, unscrupulous
conspirators."

Anuti laughed heartily as he grasped my extended hand.  "There was no need for you to tell
me that, Chia'gnosi," he said, "for I know Bimbane, and am fully aware of her extraordinary
powers of persuasion.  Her magic is potent and wonderful, ay, even to the extent of enabling
her to persuade you that this blaze of sunlight is the darkness of the great cavern whence
we obtain our shining stones, that yonder sun is the day-old moon, or that she herself is young
and beautiful.  Therefore I am in nowise astonished that you insist upon my proofs being complete.
I am fully aware that they will have to be so in order to convince you; and I promise you that
they shall be.  And now, a word of warning.  It may be that Bimbane is cognisant of what has
passed between us, for I doubt not that she watches your every movement; and, if so, she will
be fully aware, not only that we have met, but of every word that we have spoken.  In that
case, Chia'gnosi, you will be in some danger; and if I thought that you feared danger I would
express my regret for having brought you within touch of it.  But I know that you do not; therefore
I will merely say to you, be on the watch, for when the peril comes it will come swiftly, without
warning, and you will need all your courage and all your great strength to meet it.  Farewell,
Chia'gnosi, and thanks for the courtesy and fairness with which you have hearkened to me. 
I will collect my facts and my witnesses; and when all is ready you shall hear from me.  Again,
farewell!"

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.

AT LAST I LEARN THE TRUTH.

Profoundly perplexed, and quite unable to decide which of these two, Bimbane or Anuti, was
telling me the truth, I rode slowly and thoughtfully back to the palace, and, surrendering
Prince to the care of 'Mfuni, sought the privacy of my own apartments, anxious to think over
quietly and free from all distraction what I had heard, in the hope of being able to arrive
at some definite conclusion with regard to the matter.  Also, I was anxious to learn whether
there was any foundation for Anuti's suggestion that Bimbane was probably aware of his meeting
with me, and of what had passed between us, believing that if such were indeed the case the
queen would assuredly betray her knowledge either by her speech or in her manner.  But although
I had scarcely been back long enough to bathe and change into the garments which I usually
wore indoors when I was invited to join the queen in her apartments, I could detect nothing
in either her manner of greeting me or in her subsequent speech to indicate that she had the
least suspicion that I had spent nearly two hours in her husband's company.  There was not
the slightest shade of difference in her cordiality of manner toward me, not the faintest suggestion
of uneasiness or anxiety; and as for her conversation, after informing me that she had received
information from the mine to the effect that a large consignment of the shining stones might
be expected shortly, she proceeded to question me with regard to the details of my past life--of
which she appeared to possess a quite extraordinary general knowledge--and finally referred,
in a perfectly natural manner, to little Nell Lestrange, asking whether I still adhered to
my original intention of endeavouring to find the child.  And upon my assuring her that I certainly
did, she asserted that she possessed the power to help me very materially in my search, and
was perfectly willing to afford me that help, if I cared to avail myself of it; to which I
replied that I would gladly do so, and would feel infinitely obliged and grateful for it. 
Whereupon she offered to show me, there and then, the road which I must follow, upon leaving
Masakisale, in order to reach the place where the lost child might be found.

To one who thought somewhat slowly, as I generally do, this seemed to be rather rushing matters,
and, with Anuti's warning fresh in my mind, I hesitated for just the fraction of a second,
wondering whether perchance this might not be some subtle scheme on Bimbane's part to get me
into her power; but the friendly, ingenuous look in her eyes, as I glanced into them, disarmed
my momentary suspicion, and a few seconds later, animated by the intensity of my desire to
learn what I might regarding poor Nell's whereabouts, I found myself stretched at full length
upon the divan, with the little, shrivelled, decrepit figure of the queen bending over me as,
in obedience to her command, I stared intently at the jewel on her right thumb, which she held
within a few inches of my eyes.

For perhaps a minute I gazed at the wonderful flashing and changing colours of the stone, which
seemed to be something between a diamond and an opal; and then, suddenly, I seemed to be mounted
on Prince and journeying back along the road by which we had reached Masakisale, with Piet
and 'Mfuni beside me and the wagon in the rear.  We seemed to be passing the spot where I had
buried the remains of the unhappy Siluce, and in my dream we turned aside to examine the grave,
and assured ourselves that it had not been disturbed.  Back, mile after mile, we travelled
until we reached a certain mountain that I remembered perfectly well, and here we abandoned
the route by which we had formerly travelled, striking eastward round the southern side of
the mountain, and following for several days a stream that led south-eastward.  Then, abandoning
that stream, and still journeying south-eastward, we "struck" another stream that finally led
us to a broad river which I somehow knew to be the Zambezi.  Along the left bank of this great
river we seemed to journey for several days, carefully noting the natural features of the country
as we went, and especially some very fine falls--which were not, however, the famous Victoria
Falls, discovered by Livingstone--and shortly afterward we reached a drift which enabled us
to cross the river; and here we turned our backs upon it and followed upstream a smaller river
discharging into it.  And thus we seemed to go, day after day and week after week, until two
months were past, when suddenly, toward the close of a certain day, I seemed to find myself
in the midst of surroundings that I dimly remembered having seen before; and presently it dawned
upon me that I was looking upon the plain which Mafuta, the Basuto nyanga, had shown me in
the vision wherein I had been permitted a brief glimpse of Nell Lestrange.  Yes, that was the
place, without a doubt; and as I stood gazing in wonder at it a Kafir at my side, who had come
from I know not where, informed me, in reply to a question, that the place was named Umgungundhlovu,
and that it was the Great Place of Dingaan, the king of the Zulu nation.  And therewith, as
the man's words fixed themselves in my memory, the vision faded; and, opening my eyes, I found
myself staring into those of Bimbane, who was still bending over me.

"Well, Chia'gnosi," said she, with a smile that, even on her withered features, I somehow thought
very sweet and engaging, "you have slept long.  Have you seen aught?"

"Yes," said I, rising to my feet.  "I have seen the way from this place to the spot where my
friend's little daughter may be found; and I thank you most heartily for granting me the vision.
It is very wonderful, and I wish that I possessed the power to gain such information by means
of self-induced dreams.  I suppose the power lies in that ring, does it not?"

"Nay," answered Bimbane, quickly placing her right hand behind her, "the power is in myself;
the ring is but a means, and any bright thing would do as well."  (And then I suddenly remembered
the bright disk by means of which Mafuta, the Basuto nyanga, had produced the vision that I
had witnessed in his hut.)

"And wish not for any such power, my friend," continued the queen, seating herself upon the
divan from which I had risen; "for while the information so gained is sometimes useful, it
is more often of a distressing nature, and many times have I thus learned that those whom I
deemed my stanch friends were really secret enemies, industriously plotting evil against me.
One is far happier without such knowledge, therefore I make use of my gift as seldom as possible.
And now, go, Chia'gnosi, for the exercise of my power has rendered me very weary, and I must
rest.  But come to me again to-morrow; for although my magic has enabled me to learn much of
what happens in the world outside Bandokolo, there are many things which I have never been
able to understand until now, when you have explained them to me, and I wish to learn all I
can while you are here to teach me."

I retreated to my own apartments more puzzled than ever as to the true character of the queen;
for while I could not help feeling that Anuti was perfectly sincere in his denunciation of
her, the more I saw of her the more convinced did I become that there was some frightful misunderstanding
somewhere, and that she was in reality a true, tender-hearted, generously disposed woman. 
Finally, I called for Prince, and took a long ride up the valley, seeking for light; but none
came, and when about sunset I returned to the palace, I was as much befogged as ever.

When on the following day I was again summoned to the queen's apartments, I found her full
of schemes for the better government of the Bandokolo and the improvement in general of the
condition of the people; and upon these schemes she expressed herself anxious to have my opinion,
as well as any suggestions which I might see fit to offer.  Now, I felt that I was altogether
top young to set myself up as an authority upon so abstruse a subject as statesmanship; yet
I was not quite destitute of ideas, or the inclination to express them when they happened to
be strong and well-defined, consequently it was not long before we were so deeply engrossed
in conversation as to be practically oblivious of everything else.  Hence I was greatly astonished,
not to say chagrined, when after about an hour's animated and exceedingly interesting conversation
I suddenly became conscious that I had been asleep--for a second or two only, it seemed to
me, for when wakefulness returned the queen was still speaking, and I gathered from her speech
that I could not have missed more than, at the most, half a dozen unimportant words. I was
profoundly annoyed with myself, for if there is one thing upon which I especially pride myself
it is my courtesy to women, let them be young or old, rich or poor, and I felt that in permitting
myself to lose consciousness, even though it were but for a second, I had been guilty of a
piece of gross discourtesy to a woman whom I was daily growing to respect and esteem more profoundly.
Respect and esteem!  Nay, those were cold words in which to express the feeling with which
I was rapidly coming to regard this much vilified, much misunderstood woman; admiration was
a word much nearer the truth: and I sincerely hoped that my momentary involuntary lapse of
attention had escaped her notice.  I presently believed that it had, for when I ventured to
look at her I perceived that she was staring into vacancy, as people are apt to do sometimes
when they are expressing their views on a subject upon which they feel very deeply.

We conversed together for nearly three hours that morning, and when at length the queen dismissed
me the last shred of suspicion raised in my mind against her by Anuti had vanished, and in
its stead I was conscious of a feeling of exalted, romantic devotion, such as the knights errant
of old must have felt when they went forth to perform some deed of desperate gallantry in honour
of the women who had won their admiration.

When I rode out from the palace that afternoon, I was animated by a fervent hope that I might
encounter Anuti; for I longed for the opportunity to convince him that the ideas which he had
somehow formed with regard to his royal wife were as far from the truth as darkness is from
light, or as the east is from the west.  And, as sometimes happens, my desire was gratified;
for as I rode down the valley to pay my daily visit to the wagon, I found the man obviously
waiting for me at the spot where we had previously met.

Upon seeing me he pressed his heels to his zebra's sides, and galloped forward to meet me,
greeting me with the same frank friendliness as before.

"Well met, Anuti," said I.  "I have been hoping that I might see you, for I have several matters
of moment that I wish to discuss with you. Will you ride with me to the end of the valley,
or shall I accompany you to your house?"

"Let us ride to the end of the valley first, Chia'gnosi," said he; "then, afterwards, if you
will accompany me to my house, I shall feel myself very deeply honoured."

"Right!"  I said.  "Forward, then!  Now, Anuti, I wonder whether you can guess why I am so
anxious to have an opportunity to converse with you?"

"I think I can," he answered, with that frank, genial smile of his which had so favourably
impressed me at our former meeting.  "You want to prove to me that my ideas concerning Bimbane
are all wrong, and that I, and those who regard her as I do, are doing her the utmost injustice.
Is not that it?"

"Heavens, man, you must be a thought-reader!"  I ejaculated in astonishment.  "How did you
come to guess that?"

"Oh," he replied laughingly, "it was quite easy!  I knew that by the time you next met me Bimbane
would have fully convinced you that she is a wronged and grossly maligned woman; and, having
thoroughly read your character at our last meeting, I was sure that no sooner would she have
done that than your chivalry of feeling would urge you to espouse her cause and undertake the
task of proving to me and the rest of her enemies that, in regarding her as we do, we are doing
her a hideous injustice.  Well, now is your opportunity to convince me--if you can. She has
convinced you.  Tell me, how did she do it?"

By way of reply I related in detail everything that had happened since I had last met him,
repeated our conversations word for word, so far as I could recall them, and dwelt at length
upon the many exalted sentiments and lofty aspirations to which the queen had given expression;
asking him finally how he could possibly associate those sentiments and aspirations with a
woman of such a character as he believed that of Bimbane to be.

"Quite impossible, Chia'gnosi," he answered, "if she were sincere in their expression."

"And how do you know that she is not?"  I demanded hotly.

"How do you know that she is?" he retorted.  "You have only her word for it; she has not furnished
you with a shadow of proof.  It is easy for a woman--or a man--to express exalted sentiments
and lofty aspirations, even though she--or he--may not feel them.  As a matter of fact, I entertain
the precise sentiments and have the same aspirations with which you credit Bimbane; but I suppose
you will require something more than my bare assertion before you will believe me.  Yet why
should you doubt me, and believe her?  I will tell you.  It is because she has thrown the spell
of her magic over you!  You tell me that yesterday she cast you into a trance wherein you saw
the way which you must follow in order to find the captive child of your friend.  By allowing
her to do that, you afforded her an opportunity to get you under her influence and into her
power; and to-day, when you fell asleep while she was conversing with you, she was simply testing
and strengthening her power over you.  You believed that your sleep lasted but a second or
two; I believe that it may have lasted half an hour or longer, during which she was getting
more complete control over you: and when at length she aroused you from your trance she simply
resumed her conversation at the point where it had broken off at the moment when you lost consciousness;
hence you imagined--as she intended you should--that you had been asleep but for a moment."

"I will not believe it," I exclaimed hotly.  "Nothing shall convince me that any woman could
be so base as to take such dastardly advantage of a man as you suggest."

"Has the mischief indeed gone so far as that?" demanded Anuti, soberly enough now.  "Then I
am very sorry for you, Chia'gnosi; very sorry for us all.  For in that case you will never
be permitted to leave Bandokolo, never have the opportunity to rescue the captive daughter
of your friend; while as for the rest of us, we shall inevitably be plunged into a disastrous
civil war, in which many of Bandokolo's highest and best will be slain.  Probably Bimbane,
aided by you, will triumph; but, believe me, when it is too late and the evil has been wrought,
you will discover that you have made a disastrous mistake--or, rather, have been hideously
deceived.  Ah, do not shake your head in unbelief, my friend, for remember that I am speaking
from experience.  I know that what I say is true, because it was through the influence which
Bimbane gained over me that she constrained me to become her spouse, although I loved Siluce.
You look incredulous; you doubtless think that I might have resisted, had I chosen: but I swear
to you that so complete was her power over me that I was absolutely helpless, and although
I fully understood the enormity of the crime which she was committing, and which she was compelling
me to commit, I was powerless to resist, because I could not escape from her.  But afterward,
when the foul wrong was done, when I was irrevocably bound to her, and my poor Siluce had been
driven forth to perish miserably, Bimbane foolishly relaxed her hold upon me, thinking, I suppose,
that, the knot being tied, I should not attempt to escape, but should accept the ignoble fate
which she had designed for me.  Also I think she was indifferent, because the event proved
that I was not the man through whom she believes she is to recover her long-lost youth and
beauty.  And I took advantage of this relaxation of vigilance on her part to escape from the
palace and from her influence, and, despite her entreaties and commands, have steadfastly refused
to return: hence I have been able gradually to shake off her influence until now I am quite
free from it; and I tell you that never again shall she have an opportunity to recover her
power over me, if I can help it. Now, if you are not so completely bewitched as to be incapable
of distinguishing between truth and falsehood, come with me, for I am prepared to submit to
you ample and convincing proof of the truth of all my charges against Bimbane."

"Very well," said I, "I will go with you, for although the matter is really no concern of mine
I am anxious to get at the truth, if only in order that I may be of some assistance in adjusting
this most unhappy misunderstanding between the queen and the nobles.  For I am convinced that
it is nothing more serious than a misunderstanding, and that a little explanation on either
side will suffice to clear it up completely.  But I warn you, Anuti, not to indulge in any
false hopes of your ability to persuade me of the queen's guilt, for I shall need something
far more convincing than unsupported assertions to satisfy me."

"Yet Bimbane's unsupported assertions have thus far completely satisfied you; do not forget
that, Chia'gnosi," retorted Anuti.  "However," he continued, "if you can persuade yourself
to regard the question of the queen's guilt or innocence as an open one for a little while,
I have no doubt of my ability to make you recognise the truth."

Much more was said by Anuti to the same effect, but as it was in the main but a reiteration
and amplification of his previous statements, it need not be repeated here; suffice it to say
that by the time we reached his house he had brought me to a state of mind which enabled me
to recognise that, after all, it was just possible that I might be mistaken, that Bimbane might
not be the sort of person I had allowed her to persuade me she was, and that Anuti and his
friends were at least entitled to a dispassionate hearing.

And then, when at length we reached Anuti's dwelling, that individual introduced me to some
thirty of the most important and influential nobles and chiefs of Bandokolo, among whom was
Mindula, the father of the unhappy Siluce; and, one after the other, these men arose and related
the wrongs, the cruelties, and the injustices which they and theirs had suffered at the hands
of Bimbane, accompanying their statements with proofs of so convincing a character that I no
longer found it possible to disbelieve.  And when at length the session was over I arose, stunned,
astounded, horrified, and furious at the thought of the danger which I had so narrowly escaped,
of falling into the hands of a vile, unscrupulous woman, and becoming her willing, deluded tool.

"And now," I demanded, as the nobles rose to depart, "what am I to do? It is impossible that
I can continue to reside in the palace and remain the guest of the queen; yet, having come
so far, I do not like the idea of quitting the country without at least enough of the gold
and shining stones to repay me for the toil and peril of my adventure.  And I suppose that
when I announce my intention of quitting the palace the queen will at once conjecture that
I have been in communication with you, and have learned the truth concerning her.  Will she
attempt to detain me by force, think you?"

"It is impossible to surmise what she may do," answered Anuti.  "It is, however, not force
so much as persuasion that you have to fear, for I do not believe that there is a man in Bandokolo
who would be willing to face your fire weapons, even at Bimbane's command: but if you venture
to return to the palace and see her again, rest assured that she will bring the whole power
of her influence to bear upon you in the effort to persuade you that we have deceived you,
and that your original opinion of her was the correct one.  And you best know whether you have
now the strength of will to resist her beguilements.  It would be safer, perhaps, not to risk
it, but to take up your abode here with me.  I will send a messenger to your servant, if you
like, telling him--"

"No," said I decisively, as the thought that 'Mfuni was still in the queen's power came to
me for the first time, "I must return to the palace, face the queen, inform her that I now
know the truth concerning her and refuse any longer to remain her guest, and see what comes
of it. As to her seeking to influence me, I have no doubt that she will do that, but I must
take the risk; and now that I am fully convinced of the truth of all your assertions, I do
not greatly dread the result.  I will go at once, and get the interview over; after which I
can either return here or ride to the wagon and make it my abode, as I have already done for
so many months."

"Nay," said Anuti, "you shall certainly not do that.  There is ample room in this house for
you, and so long as you remain in Masakisale you must consent to be my most welcome and honoured
guest."

So it was arranged; and then, after a little further conversation, and reiterated warnings
to be on my guard against every possible description of machination on the part of the queen,
I mounted and rode back to the palace at a hand gallop, determined to get through what was
certain to be a very unpleasant business forthwith.  As 'Mfuni came out, at my approach, to
receive my horse, I bade him walk the animal to and fro, instead of unsaddling him, and hold
himself ready to accompany me to new quarters upon my reappearance.  Then, entering the palace,
I made my way straight to the queen's apartments, and sent in a message craving an immediate
interview.

I was admitted at once, and found Her Majesty occupying her usual seat upon the divan.  At
my entrance she dismissed her attendants; and, as soon as we were alone, invited me by a gesture
to seat myself at her side.  But I declined, saying that, as my interview would be but brief,
I preferred to stand.

"Nay, Chia'gnosi," she returned, "it will not be so brief as you appear to think; therefore
sit, I pray you, if not by my side, then opposite me, for it wearies me to see you standing.
That is well!"--as I drew up an ottoman and seated myself upon it.

Bimbane kept silence for a short time, resting her chin upon her clasped hands and regarding
me with an inexpressibly mournful expression; and as I returned her gaze I felt my anger against
her dying away, and a great pity for her taking its place in my heart.  She looked so small,
so frail, so utterly helpless and lonely and miserable that all the innate chivalry of my nature
arose and clamoured that it was impossible she could be guilty of the crimes imputed to her;
that I had judged her hastily and unfairly; that I had wronged her by lending a too ready ear
to her declared enemies; and that in deciding to forsake her I had been guilty of a base and
cowardly thing.  Then a faint smile of dawning triumph, which lighted up her eyes and irradiated
her face, warned me of my danger, warned me that again she was exercising her evil influence
upon me, and that I was fast succumbing to it; it reminded me of the dreadful state of helplessness
to which Anuti had been reduced by that influence; and I pulled myself together and braced
my mental powers to meet and resist it.  And as I did so the smile of triumph vanished from
her eyes, and was replaced by a gleam of malice and hatred so deadly that although it was but
momentary I recoiled in something that, if it was not fear, was very closely akin to it.  Yet
I was glad that I had caught that fleeting expression, for it reassured me; it afforded me
a transitory glimpse of the woman's true character, and taught me more thoroughly, perhaps,
than anything else could that Anuti and his friends were right and justified in their denunciation
of her character.  And I think she must have realised in that moment that she had betrayed
herself and lost her hold upon me, for when she spoke her voice was harsh and bitter, and full
of scornful anger. 

The buckle was a great yellow stone, round of outline, deep and curved, as if a yielding globe
had been pressed down. It shone and glowed, as though a veritable sun lay within; the rays
of its light seemed to strike out and illumine all round. Flanking it were two great moonstones
of lesser size, whose glowing, beside the glory of the sunstone, was like the silvery sheen
of moonlight.

And then on either side, linked by golden clasps of exquisite shape, was a line of flaming jewels,
of which the colours seemed to glow. Each of these stones seemed
to hold a living star, which twinkled in every phase of changing light.

Margaret

raised her hands in ecstasy. She bent over to examine more closely; but suddenly drew back and
stood fully erect at her grand height. She seemed to speak with the conviction of absolute
knowledge as she said:

"That is no cerement! It was no meant for the clothing of death! It is a marriage robe!"

Mr. Trelawny leaned over and touched the linen robe. He lifted a fold at the neck, and I knew from
the quick intake of his breath that something had surprised him.
He lifted yet a little more; and then he, too, stood back and pointed,
saying:

"Margaret is right! That dress is not intended to be worn
by the dead! See! her figure is not robed in it. It is but laid upon
her." He lifted the zone of jewels and handed it to Margaret. Then
with both hands he raised the ample robe, and laid it across the arms
which she extended in a natural impulse.  I shall leave them all in my rooms when I
presently quit them; and my regret at abandoning them will be much less than that which I shall
always feel since it has been my misfortune to have been brought into contact with yourself,
and thus to have learned beyond question that such women sometimes actually exist."

"Oh, Chia'gnosi, you are cruel, bitterly cruel and unjust to say such things to me!" she cried;
and then, to my utter consternation, she burst into a perfect passion of weeping, and again
I felt my heart insidiously softening and warming toward her, she looked so utterly woebegone,
so terribly helpless and friendless.  But the moment that I became conscious of the feeling
I brought my will power to bear and determinedly repressed it; although I confess that I never
in my life had a more difficult task than that which I battled with while Bimbane proceeded
to explain tearfully that although she had undoubtedly done those deeds with which Anuti and
his friends charged; her, she had been compelled to do them in the interests of good government
and for reasons of state, and that if I would only listen to her explanation I would see that
they were capable of a very different interpretation from that put upon them by her enemies.

And I listened--I will do myself the justice to say that I listened patiently to the woman's
attempt to exculpate herself by proving that her crimes were really not crimes at all, but
grim necessities of the peculiar position which she occupied as ruler of a turbulent and restive
people.  But, having steeled myself against the effect of her tears and her pathetic assumption
of helplessness, I was able instantly to detect and draw her attention to the weak points of
her defence; with the result that at last, realising, I suppose, that she had lost her power
over me and that I was no longer to be cajoled, she suddenly abandoned her efforts and flew
into a furious passion, abusing me most abominably, and heaping upon my head every opprobrious
epithet that she could think of--and she was able to think of a good many.

"And you are fool enough to think that after such treatment as I have received at your hands
I will let you go?" she shrieked in a perfect frenzy of fury.  "No, Chia'gnosi; you have humiliated
me as I believe no woman was ever before humiliated by a man, and since you have scorned my
friendship you shall learn what it means to incur my hate.  See!" and she flashed the ring
on her thumb before my eyes.  "By the power which the possession of this stone confers upon
me I slay all your cattle. So! they are dead!" and she dashed her clenched right fist toward
me. "Now it is impossible for you to leave the country, unless you choose to adventure into
the wilderness without your wagon.  But even that you shall not do.  You shall leave this palace,
as you have determined, at once, but it shall be to lodge in the cage next that occupied by
the captive man-monkeys; and as soon as I have disposed of Anuti and his friends I will proclaim
a festival, at which you and those of my enemies who survive shall do battle with an equal
number of the monkeys, for the delectation and amusement of the people!  Aha, Chia'gnosi, it
will be a rare sight to watch you, unarmed, fighting for your life against the biggest and
most savage man-monkey that my hunters can capture!  Ha, release me, brute!  What would you
do to me?  Help--!"

Although I had not the smallest belief in the woman's power to destroy my cattle by any alleged
occult virtue pertaining to her wonderful ring, the sight of it flashed before my eyes in so
provocative a manner reminded me of my almost forgotten promise to Siluce to take the jewel
from Bimbane, if I could; and, exasperated at last beyond endurance by her abuse and threats,
I sprang to my feet, seized her right hand in mine, and, while I stifled her cries for help
with my left, drew the ring from her thumb and thrust it upon my own little finger, animated
by some sudden impulse for which I could not in the least account.

And as the ring passed from her possession into mine, the change that occurred in us both was
startling in the extreme, particularly so as regarded Bimbane.  For a few seconds after I released
her she remained absolutely silent and motionless, as though scarcely able to realise what
had happened; then, instead of summoning her guards and handing me over to their custody, she
instantly became abjectly apologetic and pleading, entreating me to restore her ring in exchange
for anything and everything that I might choose to demand.  She offered me gold and diamonds
without limit, perfect liberty to remain in the country as its honoured guest as long as I
pleased, and all the help I might need in the transport of my spoils when it should please
me to start upon my return journey; in short, she gave me clearly to understand that I need
set no limits upon my demands if I would but restore the ring to her. But as for me, the moment
that I slipped the jewel upon my finger I became conscious of a strange, new, exhilarating
sense of power, of ability to do things, of being generally complete master of the situation;
and I determined that I would keep the ring, if for no other reason than that Bimbane seemed
to attach such an extraordinary value to it, and to require its restoration so badly.  I therefore
left her at last, quite exhausted with her fruitless entreaties, and doubled up in a little,
shapeless, miserably sobbing heap on the divan; and as I went forth from the apartment I summoned
her waiting women and directed them to go in and attend to the queen, as I feared that Her
Majesty was unwell.

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.

THE CLIMAX OF THE ADVENTURE.

Hastening across to the suite of apartments I had thus far occupied, I discarded the splendid
garments which had been presented to me by the queen, and in which I had been wont to appear
in public, and resumed the somewhat worn and faded suit in which I had arrived at Masakisale;
after which I turned my back upon the rooms, as I thought for ever, and descended to where
'Mfuni awaited me, walking my horse to and fro before the main entrance to the palace.  The
Mashona seemed somewhat startled to behold me once more clad in my shabby travelling garments;
but without wasting any time in explaining matters I simply bade him hasten to the wagon, ascertain
how things were in that quarter, and report to me at Anuti's house, which I pointed out to
him.  Then, urging Prince into a gallop, I made the best of my way to Anuti's abode, anxious
to communicate to him what had passed at my final interview with Bimbane, and to take counsel
with him as to what was best to be done under the circumstances.

He was at home when I arrived, and might indeed have been watching for me, for he came forth
to me as I dismounted.

"Aha, Chia'gnosi," he exclaimed, "welcome to my house, for I perceive that something of import
has happened at the palace, and that you have indeed left it, as you resolved to do!"

"Yes," said I.  "I have left the palace, never to return to it; for I have quarrelled with
Bimbane beyond all possibility of reconciliation. And now, if you are not afraid to give me
lodgment for a short time, I will very gladly avail myself of your offered hospitality; for
I want to tell you exactly what has happened, and to obtain your advice."

"Pray, enter, and again welcome," he replied.  "No, I am not at all afraid to receive you as
my guest; for you will be perfectly safe here, and--But what is that I see on your finger?--surely
not the magic ring of Bimbane!"

He seized my right hand, stared incredulously at the ring on my little finger, and then, murmuring:
"It is, it is!" sank upon one knee before me, pressed the ring to his forehead, and exclaimed:

"Salutations and homage, O high and mighty King!  I know not how it has come to pass, but this
is a great and happy day for Bandokolo; for at last the dominion has passed out of the hands
of that cruel and wicked woman, under whose galling yoke the country has groaned for unnumbered
generations, and has passed into yours, who will rule us mercifully, wisely, and justly.  Great
is my pride and joy, O Chia'gnosi, that mine is the privilege to be the first to hail you king.
Deign to honour my poor house with your gracious presence for a few hours, Your Majesty, while
I go forth and proclaim the glad tidings to the nobles and chiefs here in Masakisale, and make
arrangements for the news to be transmitted to the uttermost parts of the kingdom--"

"Stop, stop, for mercy's sake stop your wild talk, and tell me what is the matter, and what
you mean by all this rubbish about my being king!" I exclaimed, as soon as I had sufficiently
recovered from my amazement to speak, at the same time dragging Anuti to his feet.

"Ah, yes, I had forgotten!" replied Anuti.  "Naturally Your Majesty does not understand.  How
should you, since no one has explained?  In a few words, then, the matter stands thus.  The
possession of that ring carries with it the sovereignty of Bandokolo, and since you now possess
it, you are, in virtue thereof, the monarch of the country; and right glad will all be that
such is the case.  But, if I may be permitted to ask, how passed the ring into your possession?
For the tradition runs that it may only pass as a free gift from the reigning monarch to his--
or her--chosen successor when the former is at the point of death; to attempt to steal it,
or to take it by force, brings upon the would-be robber the doom of a mysterious, terrible
death, otherwise Bimbane the Cruel would not have been permitted to reign so long.  Yet I find
it difficult to imagine that--that--"

"She surrendered it to me of her own free will?"  I interrupted.  "You are right, Anuti, she
did not.  We quarrelled; she threatened to set you and me, among others, to fight the man-monkeys,
and declared that by virtue of this ring she would destroy--has indeed destroyed--the remainder
of my team of oxen.  This made me angry; and in my anger I flung myself upon her, snatched
the ring from her thumb, and placed it upon my own finger.  And--and--there it is, as you see,"
I finished lamely.

"Yes.  And you still live!" said Anuti thoughtfully.  "It is wonderful; and it is proof conclusive
that you are destined to be our king."

"Nonsense, man," I retorted; "it is proof of nothing of the kind.  I have no desire to be your
king.  All that I want is to find the daughter of my friend, rescue her from captivity, and
return to my own country, taking with me, by your goodwill, as many of the shining stones as
will enable me to retrieve my ruined fortunes.  Therefore, permit me--" and before Anuti knew
what I was about I withdrew the fateful ring from my own finger and slipped it on his.

"There!"  I continued, "now you are the king, which is as it should be. The Bandokolo will
rejoice to have you as their sovereign, while, as for me, if you require any help or advice
that I can give, it shall be freely yours; and when once you are firmly established upon the
throne I will bid you farewell and go my way.  But what about Bimbane; what will you do with her?"

"There will be neither trouble nor difficulty in disposing of her, for she has not a friend
in all Bandokolo," answered Anuti.  "It will but be necessary for me to display this ring and
even her bodyguards will gladly transfer their allegiance to me.  And perhaps you are right,
Chia'gnosi, in the matter of the kingship; it is better that the Bandokolo should be governed
by one of themselves than by a stranger. But you have this day done a service to the Bandokolo
which we shall not forget, for by your action in wresting this ring from the queen, and, with
it, all her power and authority, you have saved the country from civil war, with all its attendant
horrors and slaughter.  And now it will be well that the nobles and chiefs should be instantly
informed of what has happened; therefore, if you will excuse me for a short time, I will dispatch
the necessary messengers."

Anuti had been absent about three-quarters of an hour when a servant announced that two of
my natives desired speech with me; and when they were introduced they proved to be 'Mfuni and
Piet, who had encountered each other on the main road and now returned together, bringing with
them the astounding news that the whole of my oxen had suddenly dropped dead while feeding,
at the precise moment--so far as I was able to fix it--when Bimbane had pronounced their death
warrant!  It was a very extraordinary thing, much too extraordinary, I thought, to be a mere
coincidence; yet I was not so much astonished as I might otherwise have been, for I had by
this time been long enough in Bandokolo to have realised that many surprising and startling
things happened there which would have been regarded as impossible in more civilised countries.

But this was not the only, or even the most startling, occurrence of that eventful day; for
Anuti had scarcely returned to the house, accompanied by half a dozen of the most powerful
nobles, whom he had been lucky enough to encounter, when a wild-eyed messenger arrived from
the palace with the astounding news that the queen was dead, having taken poison!  This news,
if true, would of course simplify matters immensely, since, the queen being childless, her
husband would, according to the laws of Bandokolo, succeed her; and accordingly we all hastened
to the palace to investigate the statement.

Arrived at the royal residence, we found the place in a state of wild commotion--although the
excitement was not so intense as to make the squadron of bodyguards then on duty forget to
accord the royal salute to Anuti upon his entrance.  We were informed that the body of the
queen was in her sleeping chamber, and thither we hastened, to find the apartment in possession
of about a dozen physicians, who had hurried to the palace upon the summons of the chief lady-in-waiting,
and who had just completed their examination of the body.  They all agreed that death was the
result of poison, self-administered; and indeed there seemed to be no room for any other conclusion,
for when the corpse was discovered a tiny flask was found tightly grasped in the right hand,
the odour clinging to which, and to the lips of the dead woman, proclaimed beyond all question
that it had contained bicari, a decoction prepared from the root of the combuti plant, and
one of the most deadly toxics known to the Africans of the interior.

The fact of the queen's death being fully established, Anuti gave orders that the body should
be prepared in the usual way for public cremation on the following day, after which the chamber
was to be closed and sealed, and a guard of honour mounted before it.  In the meantime, while
these orders were being carried out, we all adjourned to the council chamber, where we were
soon afterward joined by several other nobles and chiefs, who had been hastily summoned; and
a council was held at which it was decided that, for expediency's sake, Anuti should at once
take up his abode at the palace, and that he should be proclaimed king that same evening. 
Mounted messengers were accordingly sent forth into the city, summoning the people to assemble
before the palace at an hour corresponding to ten o'clock; and at that hour the ceremony of
proclamation was duly performed.

The scene was one of considerable barbaric splendour, chiefly by reason of the magnificent
dresses worn by the various personages who took part in it.  It happened that all the nobles
and chiefs who were really of paramount importance were dwellers in the city.  It was consequently
possible for every one of them to be present; and as they all held high rank either in the
army or what may be called the civil service, and wore the full-dress uniform of their rank
upon this occasion, the display of golden armour and weapons, richly embroidered robes and
banners, and jewelled and feathered head-dresses glittering in the somewhat smoky light of
thousands of blazing torches presented a spectacle which I shall never forget.

The act of proclamation was performed from the steps leading up to the main entrance to the
palace, upon the top landing of which stood Anuti, clad in the resplendent uniform of a general,
supported by the nobles and chiefs--and also by myself, in my uniform, which I had resumed
at the urgent request of the king and his supporters; while the herald and trumpeters also
stood upon the steps, but halfway down.  The actual ceremony was of very brief duration, and
simply consisted of seven blasts upon the golden trumpets, followed by the formal statement
by the herald that, it having pleased the spirits who presided over the destinies of the Bandokolo
nation to summon Bimbane to her long-deferred rest, her husband, the noble and illustrious
Anuti, would take up the reins of government and henceforth rule the people.  Might the king
live for ever!  Upon which the trumpets again sounded seven blasts, the assembled multitude
expressed their approval by loud and prolonged applause, the nobles and chiefs present came
forward in the order of their rank and did homage to the new king, the royal bodyguard, paraded
in full strength for the occasion, deployed in front of the steps and gave the royal salute,
and the ceremony was at an end.  At Anuti's urgent request I resumed occupation of the apartments
which I had lived in during my stay in Masakisale; and as I did not wish to be further mixed
up in the political situation, and was moreover somewhat fatigued, I at once retired to them
and was soon sound asleep.

The following day was scarcely less strenuous than that which had preceded it, though in a
different way; for it had been arranged that the obsequies of the dead queen should take place
at sunset, and all day long the several Court officials concerned were busily engaged in making
the necessary preparations.

The funeral pyre was erected in the centre of a spacious basin among the hills at the head
of the valley, some six miles from the palace, and early in the afternoon the inhabitants began
to gather in front of the palace, to witness and take part in the spectacle.  Then, about four
o'clock, the royal bodyguard, with their regimental banners twisted into a knot and bound to
the staves with broad white ribbons in token of mourning, paraded before the palace, and the
trumpeters sounded seven blasts; whereupon the funeral cortege made its appearance, issuing
from the main entrance to the palace.  First stalked the royal standard-bearer, carrying the
royal standard, knotted and bound to its staff with white ribbon; then came the royal bier,
which consisted of a platform borne by twelve men attired wholly in white--the mourning colour--and
draped with white silk, heavily fringed with gold bullion, which swept the ground.  Upon this
platform was placed the royal throne of ivory heavily mounted in gold; and upon the throne,
and securely fastened to it, was seated the body of Bimbane, fully attired in her robes of
state, and crowned with a gold coronet set with uncut diamonds and ornamented with the crimson
wings of the orilu, which only a monarch might wear.  Then came Anuti, alone, in his full uniform,
closely followed by the nobles and chiefs of the nation--among whom the new king had insisted
that I should take my place.  Slowly and with solemn step we descended the broad flight of
stone steps until we reached the spacious quadrangle at their foot, and here our attendants
led forward our steeds and we mounted, Prince, with his glossy black coat, being conspicuous
among the array of zebras which constituted the mounts of the rest.

As the bier reached the quadrangle, a trumpet blast rang out, and the royal bodyguard arranged
itself into three sides of a hollow square, into which the bier passed, when, with the royal
standard-bearer riding in front, the banners of the guard immediately following him, and the
trumpeters between them and the mounted troops blowing long, wailing blasts at regular intervals,
the cortege proceeded slowly and solemnly along the road, the bier, surrounded by the bodyguard,
being followed by Anuti and the rest of us, while the inhabitants in general brought up the rear.

In this fashion the funeral cortege passed along the main road through the city to the scene
of the cremation, the march occupying just two hours.  We reached the funeral pyre as the last
rays of the sun were gilding the tops of the trees which hemmed in the valley, when the bodyguard
formed a hollow square round the pyre, with Anuti and the nobles inside it, while the inhabitants
ranged themselves upon the adjacent hillside to witness, for the first time in their lives,
the spectacle of a royal cremation.  About a hundred priests, arrayed in long white robes,
were gathered about the pyre when we reached it; and as soon as the bier, with its dead occupant,
had been deposited upon the summit of the pyre, the arch-priest began the funeral service,
which lasted about a quarter of an hour.  By the time that this was over it was quite dark,
the surrounding tree tops standing out black against the star-studded sky; and only an occasional
faint, evanescent gleam here and there of starlight upon golden armour told of the presence
of all that multitude.

Then, the religious service being at an end, a lighted torch was mysteriously produced from
somewhere and handed to Anuti, who, approaching the pyre, thrust the burning brand into the
heart of it and retired again to his former place.  For a second or two the darkness continued;
then here and there about the pyre small wreaths of smoke floated out, quickly followed by
little tongues of flame, rapidly increasing in intensity until within a few minutes the whole
of the upper part of the pyre was ablaze, and the basin, with its crowds of splendidly attired
and mounted officials, was brilliantly illuminated by the ruddy glare.  I think the bier, and
possibly the body also, must have been treated with some highly combustible preparation, for
I noticed that the moment the flames reached them they seized upon them with avidity, so that
within ten minutes of the first kindling the bier and the body were both enwrapped in a roaring
volume of vivid flame, in which the corpse seemed to shrink and shrivel so rapidly that when
at length the top of the pyre collapsed and fell in, scarcely a vestige of bier or body was
to be seen.  The fire blazed so furiously--throwing out an almost unendurable heat--that within
half an hour the pyre had become reduced to a heap of ruddy, dull-glowing ashes; whereupon
Anuti gave a signal, the trumpeters blew seven blasts by way of final salute to the dead, the
white ribbons were torn from the banners and cast upon the flickering flames, the banners were
unknotted, and, forming up in military array, the mounted contingent wheeled and departed,
making their way back to the palace, and leaving the pedestrians to return home at their leisure. 

The outer wrappings, torn and loosened by rude touch, and with the colour either darkened by
dust or worn light by friction, seemed creased as by rough treatment; the jagged edges of the
wrapping-cloths looked fringed; the painting was patchy, and the
varnish chipped.

The coverings were evidently many, for the bulk was great. But through all, showed that unhidable
human figure, which seems to look more horrible when partially concealed than at any other time.
What was before us was Death, and nothing else. All the romance and sentiment of fancy had disappeared.
The two elder men, enthusiasts who had often done such work, were not disconcerted; and Doctor Winchester
seemed to hold himself in a business-like attitude, as if before the operating-table. But I felt
low-spirited, and miserable, and ashamed; and besides I was pained and alarmed by Margaret's ghastly
pallor.

Then the work began. The unrolling of the mummy cat had prepared me somewhat for it; but this
was so much larger, and so infinitely more elaborate, that it seemed a different thing. Moreover,
in addition to the ever present sense of death and humanity, there was a feeling of something
finer in all this. The cat had been embalmed with coarser materials; here, all, when once the outer
coverings were removed, was more delicately done. It seemed as if only the finest gums and spices
had been used in this embalming. But there were the same surroundings, the same attendant red
dust and pungent presence of bitumen; there was the same sound of rending which marked the
tearing away of the bandages. There were an enormous number of these, and their bulk when opened
was great. As the men unrolled them, I grew more and more excited. I did not take a part in it myself;
Margaret had looked at me gratefully as I drew back. We clasped hands, and held each other hard.
As the unrolling went on, the wrappings became finer, and the smell less laden with bitumen,
but more pungent.

We all, I think, began to feel it as though it caught or touched us in some special way. This,
however, did not interfere with the work; it went on uninterruptedly. Some of the inner wrappings
bore symbols or pictures. These were done sometimes wholly in pale green colour, sometimes in
many colours; but always with a prevalence of green. Now and again Mr. Trelawny or Mr. Corbeck
would point out some special drawing before laying the bandage on the pile behind them, which
kept growing to a monstrous height.

At last we knew that the wrappings were coming to an end. Already the proportions were reduced
to those of a normal figure of the manifest height of the Queen, who was more than average height.
And as the end drew nearer, so Margaret's pallor grew; and her heart beat more and more wildly,
till her breast heaved in a way that frightened me.

Just as her father was taking away the last of the bandages, he happened
to look up and caught the pained and anxious look of her pale face.
He paused, and taking her concern to be as to the outrage on modesty,
said in a comforting way:

"Do not be uneasy, dear! See! there is
nothing to harm you. The Queen has on a robe.--Ay, and a royal robe,
too!"

The wrapping was a wide piece the whole length of the body.  I suppose everybody by this time knows, either from
pictures or from having seen the thing itself, what a South African wagon is like; and also
knows that it is drawn by a team of from twelve to eighteen oxen yoked together in pairs, the
cleverest pair being yoked next the wagon to the disselboom--which answers to the ordinary
carriage pole where a pair of horses are driven abreast--while the remainder of the team are
yoked, also in pairs, to the trek chain, which is attached to the extremity of the disselboom.
Now, oxen pull upon a yoke which rests upon their necks and is attached thereto by a strip
of rein passing under their throats, and this constitutes the whole of their very primitive
harness.  But it was obvious that such an arrangement would be quite unsuited to my new team
of zebras: consequently harness had to be especially made for them, consisting of a breast
and shoulder strap, the former being made long enough to form a pair of traces attachable to
a splinter bar; there was also added a headstall with a single rein, which was fastened to
the trek chain.  This arrangement served for all but the leading pair of zebras, the off animal
of which was fitted with a saddle upon which the driver sat postilion fashion, guiding the
leaders and regulating the pace of the whole team.

During the first two days a Bandokolo drove the team, while 'Ngulubi, my Bantu voorlouper,
rode beside him on one of my horses, watching the process and receiving instruction; but after
that 'Ngulubi himself undertook the driving, while the Bandokolo rode alongside and continued
his instruction.  Thus, by the time that we reached the frontier, 'Ngulubi was quite qualified
to act as driver, while he, Jan, and Piet had also learned to look after the zebras when they
were outspanned.

With such a spanking team to draw the wagon, we took only eight and a half days to cover the
distance between Masakisale and the frontier, instead of seventeen days, as on the outward
journey; and here Pousa and his squadron regretfully bade me farewell, the captain's regrets
at parting from me being mitigated to a great extent by the gift of a shaving mirror and a
burning-glass, the latter being esteemed by him at about the value that I attached to my two
sacks of diamonds.

Our farewells were spoken at the precise spot where we had met on my outward journey, but I
did not pause there, pushing some twenty miles into the defile where we had seen the man-monkeys
before we outspanned for the night.  Two days later we passed the grave of the unhappy Siluce,
and I had the melancholy satisfaction of seeing that, thus far, it had not been disturbed by
wild animals.  And on the following day we arrived at the spot where, according to the vision
in which Bimbane had revealed to me the route I must follow in order to find Nell Lestrange,
it became necessary for us to forsake our former trail and enter upon the new one.  I took
up this new trail without hesitation, the conviction being strong upon me that I should be
right in so doing; and the event justified me, for on the evening of the sixty-second day after
my departure from Masakisale I arrived upon the north bank of the Pongola River, and was informed
by an astonished Kafir whom I encountered that Zululand, the country of the redoubtable Dingaan,
lay upon the opposite shore of the stream.  Of course I did not accomplish this journey of
two months' duration through a savage country without meeting with a few adventures, yet they
were surprisingly few, all things considered, for I hunted now only for food for myself and
my followers; moreover, they were of a very similar character to those of my outward journey,
with a few unimportant variations in details.  They may, therefore, be passed over with merely
this brief reference to them, since to record them in detail would only render my story of
altogether too unwieldy dimensions, without adding very greatly to its interest.

Arrived upon the Zululand border, I lost no time in dispatching a message to the formidable
and somewhat unscrupulous king of the country, requesting his permission to pass through his
territory on my way to Cape Colony from the north; and four days later 'Mfuni, who was my messenger
for the occasion, returned with a reply to the effect that Dingaan granted my request, with
the proviso that I did not linger unduly upon my journey, and that I should call upon him at
his Place, Umgungundhlovu, on my way, to pay my respects--and also, as I fully understood,
tribute, in the shape of a handsome present, for the privilege.  This, of course, suited me
admirably, as I intended to call upon the king in any case; and on the morning following the
return of 'Mfuni we forded the river and entered upon the somewhat risky journey across Zululand,
taking things fairly easy, as I wished to keep my team of zebras in good condition, in case
it should be necessary to hurry, later on, after my interview with the king.

Two days later, about mid-afternoon, we arrived at Umgungundhlovu (or the Multitude of Houses),
and before we reached it the leading features of the landscape began to assume an appearance
of familiarity, until finally I beheld with my bodily eyes the entire scene, complete down
to the smallest detail, which Mafuta, the Basuto nyanga, had revealed to me in a vision some
six months before.  There was the great "town"-- containing, I suppose, quite two thousand
huts--built upon the crest of a gently rising hill, and completely surrounded by a stout, high
palisade with an open gateway in it through which passed a number of people going about their
business, and merely pausing for a minute or two to gaze in wonder at my handsome team of zebras;
and there, too, close at hand, was the singular-looking hog-backed kopje, with its straggling
bushes and its tumbled masses of dark rock, upon which were perched some fifty or sixty vultures
that seemed to be quite at home there.  Little did I dream of the ghastly tragedy of which
that weird kopje had been the scene a few months earlier, when, on the preceding sixth of February,
the treacherous and ruthless king had caused the massacre upon it of the ill-fated Boer general,
Pieter Retief, and some sixty of his followers; otherwise I should have been a good deal more
uneasy in my mind than I actually was when I gave the order to outspan.

Yet, although I had no knowledge of it, the memory of that tragedy, and the fear lest the whites
should eventually determine to avenge it, proved of the utmost service to me in my negotiations
with the savage monarch; for when, adopting my usual tactics of "bluffing" boldly in my dealings
with savages, I informed Dingaan bluntly that my object in visiting him was to demand the surrender
of the white 'ntombozaan whom he held in captivity, I saw at once that, for some reason which
I could not then guess, he was very greatly perturbed.  But, like the savage he was, he also
attempted to "bluff", so that the matter soon resolved itself into a "bluffing match" between
us, in which, although I did not know it, I held the advantage.  First the king indignantly
denied all knowledge of the girl for whom I was then seeking; then, when I not only insisted
that she was in his power, but also minutely described her and her two girl companions, just
as I had seen them in my vision, he retorted by declaring that it was in his mind to kill me
and my followers, destroy my wagon, and turn my zebras loose, so that no trace should be left
of any of us.  Upon this I countered by asking him whether he really believed me such a fool
as to venture into his country without sending a messenger to my countrymen by another way,
informing them where I had gone, and asking them to investigate my fate if I did not arrive
at home in due course.  This retort proved to be my winning card, for he gave in at once, acknowledging
Nell's presence in the place; but insinuating that, since he had kept her alive and treated
her well ever since the Tembu had sent her to him as a present, I ought to buy her of him.
Of course, after this, the remainder of our negotiation was merely a matter of bargaining,
and as I was not at all disposed to prolong the agony by being over particular in the matter
of price, another half-hour saw the dear child sobbing happily in my arms, in exchange for
practically the whole of the "truck" that still remained to me.

Nell sat up quite late that night talking with me and telling her adventures, beginning with
that awful time when she awoke to find her room full of armed Tembu warriors, who forced her
to rise from her bed, dress, and go with them; but although her tale was interesting enough
to me, I have no space in which to record it here.

One incident, however, struck me as being sufficiently peculiar to be worthy of mention, and
it was this.  She told me how, when she had been at Dingaan's Place nearly a year, she left
the town one morning, accompanied by two young Zulu girls, to go down to a favourite haunt
of hers near the river; "and," said she, "when we were passing just about here, where this
wagon is outspanned, a very strange thing happened. For, although I was not thinking of you
at all just then, I suddenly believed for an instant that I saw you standing two or three yards
away, with your hands outstretched and your lips moving as though you wanted to speak to me.
I seemed to see you so distinctly that for a moment I was quite startled--indeed I believe
I actually stopped under the impression that you were really there; but, as I did so, you vanished,
and although I remember looking back I did not see you again."  Now, the most remarkable thing
about this occurrence is that, by carefully questioning the child, I was at length forced to
the conclusion that it had happened at the precise moment when I was beholding the vision conjured
up for me by Mafuta, the Basuto nyanga.

We inspanned with the arrival of the dawn on the following morning, and, pushing the zebras
to their utmost capacity, swept down through Zululand into Natal, and thence more leisurely
through Kaffraria to Cape Colony, arriving in Somerset East on the seventeenth day after our
departure from Umgungundhlovu, to the amazement and delight of Henderson and a host of other
friends who had long given me up as "wiped out".  I told them as much of my story as I deemed
fit, though not all of it by any means; neither did I ask anybody's advice, for my wanderings
in the wilds had given me so much self-reliance that I felt quite able to depend upon my own
judgment.  In the first place I negotiated with the manager of the local bank for the exchange
of five hundred pounds' worth of gold for coin, and then, learning that there were ships loading
for England at Algoa Bay, I installed 'Mfuni, Piet, Jan, and 'Ngulubi on my estate, leaving
the horses and zebras with them to be looked after during my absence, packed up my belongings,
and transferred Nell and myself to Port Elizabeth, where I engaged passages for us both on
a ship which was on the point of sailing for home, leaving us just time to procure our outfit
prior to our departure.

A pleasant voyage of a little under three months ended in our finding ourselves in London in
the early part of February, 1839, and although we found the climate of England exceedingly
cold and unpleasant after the brilliant sunshine and warmth of South Africa, we managed to
enjoy ourselves thoroughly during the ensuing two months.  Then, with Nell's cordial approval,
I put her to a first-rate school at Bath, where she remained until her eighteenth birthday,
emerging therefrom a very beautiful, accomplished, and lovable young woman.

Meanwhile, having disposed of Nell for the time being, I next turned my attention to the disposal
of my treasure. The other men seemed to get unconsciously a little drowsy. I wondered if in the case
of Mr. Trelawny and Mr. Corbeck, who had already been under the hypnotic influence of the Queen,
the same dormance was manifesting itself.

The reader may gather some idea of the number of those diamonds when I say that now, at the
time of writing, this process is still going on, yet I have nearly half of the original number
left.  The arrangement, although no doubt exceedingly profitable to the firm of jewellers in
question, has provided me with a princely annual income, much of which has been spent in restoring
and extending Bella Vista, which is now one of the finest and best-stocked estates in the whole
of South Africa.

Need I add that she who was once known as Nell Lestrange has been for many years the beloved
and cherished mistress of the beautiful house that replaced the one in which the tragedy of
more than fifty years ago occurred?
