In the other article on the subject of post-war debt contributed to the last number of this
Journal, an "Ex-M.P." plumped for a somewhat novel variety of the Levy on Capital, in the shape
of a Compulsory Loan, bearing no interest and repayable in 100 years. Each individual citizen
to be made to subscribe to the extent of 20 per cent. of his possessions. Ten per cent. of
the amount due to be paid on application, 10 per cent. six months after allotment, and 80 per
cent. on January 1st of the following year. When desired, the Government to advance at 5 per
cent. the money necessary for the payment subsequent to allotment, full repayment of such advances
to be made within eight years. A Sinking Fund to be established to redeem the loan at maturity.
But is there any real advantage in this scheme over the Levy on Capital, from which it only
differs by the receipt by the payer of a promise to repay in 100 years' time? The approximate
value of £1000 nominal of the Compulsory Loan stock would be, according to "Ex-M.P.'s" calculation,
in the year of issue £7 12s., money being worth 5 per cent. and assuming that rate to be current
during the remainder of the term. The claim that there is no confiscation, because "a perfectly
good security is given for the money received," would seem rather futile to those who paid
£1000 and received a security, the present value of which might be below £10. They might very
likely think that outright confiscation (since confiscation originally means nothing but "putting
into the Treasury") is really a simpler way of dealing with the problem. "Ex-M.P.," however,
estimates that the immediate redemption of £2800 millions of debt (which he, rather modestly,
expects to be the result of his 20 per cent. levy) would enable the balance of the War Debt
to be converted into 3-1/2 per cent. stock. This may be true, but if so it is equally true
if a similar or larger amount of debt is cancelled by means of an outright Levy on Capital.

The merits and demerits of a Levy on Capital have already been dealt with in the pages of this
Journal "Ex-M.P.," however, brought forward a slightly novel form of argument in its favour.
He pointed out that the money constituting the great increase in debt that has taken place
during the war will have been, in the main, contributed by people who have worked at home under
the protection of the Army and Navy, while the soldiers and sailors have been prevented by
the duty which sent them out to risk their lives from subscribing a proportionate share to
the National Debt. Hence "a class that deserves most of the State will find itself indebted
to a class which--if it does not deserve least of the State--has, at any rate, turned a national
emergency to personal profit." This is a strong argument, which, has been used frequently in
the course of the war in the pages of the Economist, against borrowing for war purposes to
the large extent to which our timid rulers have adopted the policy. "To be really just," the
writer continued, "the process of taxation ... must be applied with greatest force to those
who have accumulated their money since the outbreak of war, and only to a less degree to those
whose fortunes have not been built upon their country's necessity. 

The first is that the public now refers to the region of the Magdalena River, in the United States
of Colombia (formerly "New Granada"), my starting point - to cross the Atlantic, a part of
England, many departments of France and especially Spain.

The second, which is going to go to press, understand the description
of Switzerland, Germany Rhine, Belgium and several departments of
France.

The third will embrace the narratives relating to another part of
France (the Northeast), and to Württemberg, Bavaria, Austria, Hungary,
Bohemia, Saxony, Prussia, Hamburg, Hanover, Hese-Gasela and the Netherlands.

A COLOMBIAN TRIP IN EUROPE.

       TWO WORDS TO THE READER.

* * * * *

I do not know the degree of esteem that may merit from many readers
reflections a traveler who, unknown outside his homeland, sets out
on his pilgrimage from the heart of the Colombian jungle to the center
of these old European societies, full of memories, great monuments
and bitter disappointments.

Contrasts loving and always seeking the truth, I left my sweet homeland of freedom and hope,
- the land of colossal mountains, splendid valleys, cataracts, forests, sparkling rivers, high snow-capped
peaks, perfumes, echoes mysterious solitude, the treasures of light and unfailing harmony and
pageantry of this nature which summarizes in her womb all the poetry and all the wonders of creation!
All that is left back: this is Colombia, hidden under the cloak of
shells and coral, light and mystery that will extend the Atlantic
and Pacific ....

Why leave this world so far all that is worshiped?

 The advocates of the Levy, and "Ex-M.P." in his advocacy of a Compulsory
Loan for repayment of debt; assume that it can be done once and for all and never again. "Take
one-fifth of a man's savings away as an emergency measure not to be repeated, and he will at
once endeavour to save it back again." But how will you persuade him that it is an emergency
measure not to be repeated? How can you be sure that it is so? I have heard a very distinguished
Socialist, discussing in private the beauties of the Levy on Capital, point out that it is
the sort of thing which, when once the ice has been broken, can be done again so easily. From
the Socialist point of view the Levy on Capital is, of course, a simple means of getting, by
repetitions of it at regular intervals, all the means of production into the hands of the State;
but would the State make a good use of them?

Another assumption about the Levy on Capital that seems to me to be the merest will o' the
wisp is the delusion that the whole saving that it would entail by reducing the debt charge
would necessarily and certainly go to the relief of income tax. On this assumption Mr Pethick
Lawrence bases his most persuasive appeal to the smaller income-tax payer, by showing that
he would be better off after a Levy on Capital than before it, thanks to the reduction in income
tax, which is assumed as axiomatically arising in its train. But is this certain or even likely?
Is it not much more probable that our Government, finding its post-war Budget greatly lightened
by a Levy on Capital or a Compulsory Loan to redeem debt, will think itself free to indulge
in extravagance, maintaining a considerable part of the war income tax and wasting it on rash
experiments? All these weaknesses, which appear to be inherent alike in the Levy on Capital
or in the scheme which gilds the pill by calling it a Compulsory Loan, seem to be ignored or
neglected (perhaps because they are unanswerable) by their advocates. On the other hand, there
are certain psychological arguments on the other side. If the well-to-do, who would have to
pay the Levy or subscribe to the Compulsory Loan, would prefer that system to a high income
tax, there is no more to be said. A tax that is popular with the payer, as compared with other
modes of shearing his fleece, needs no further recommendation. But, in view of the probability
of the experiment, once tried, being shortly and frequently repeated, I Very much doubt whether
this is so; as far as I have been able by personal inquiry to test opinion on the point I have
found it almost unanimously adverse among those whom the Levy would most seriously affect.
If, as is much more likely, the imposition of a Levy created better feeling among the working
classes and the returning soldiers and tended to more harmonious co-operation in after-war
tasks of reconstruction, it might be worth while to face its evils and its dangers. But here
again it is quite probable that if the burden of war debt were clearly and palpably put on
the shoulders best able to bear it, that is, on those who are lifted by the gifts of fortune--either
in inherited money or unusual brainpower or faculties--by an equitably graded income tax, the
effect might be just as good on the minds of those who suspect that the rich have battened
throughout the war on exploitation of the poor.

This much at least seems to be agreed by most reasonable people about the debt charge--that
it will have to be raised, either by a Levy on Capital or by income tax or some other form
of direct taxation, from those who are blessed with a margin. We are not likely to repeat our
ancestors' mistake, after the Napoleonic War, of throwing the whole burden on to the general
consumer by indirect taxation of necessaries and of articles of general consumption. Even Tariff
"Reformers" say little about the revenue that their fiscal schemes would bring in. And with
good reason. For in so far as they secured Protection they would bring in no revenue; we cannot
at once keep out foreign goods and tax them; and any revenue that they brought in would be
most expensively raised, because a large part of the extra price paid by the consumer would
go not to the State but into the pockets of the home producer. Nor is it likely that any of
the many schemes--of which Mr Stilwell's "Great Plan, How to Pay for the War," is a particularly
bold example--for paying off debt by a huge issue of inconvertible currency, will achieve any
practical result. Not only would they defraud the debt-holder by paying him off in currency
enormously depreciated by the multiplication of it that would be involved; but they would also,
by that depreciation, throw the burden of the debt on the shoulders of the general consumer
through a further disastrous rise in prices, and so would accentuate the bitterness and discontent
already rife owing to the war-time dearness and all the suspicions of profiteering and exploitation
that it has engendered.

After all, this problem of the war debt, in so far as it is held at home, is not one that ought
to terrify us if we look at it steadily. People talk and write as if when the war is over the
business of paying for it will begin. That is not really so. The war has been paid for as it
went on, and, except in so far as it has been financed by borrowing abroad, it has been paid
for by us as a nation. Whatever we have used for the war we have paid for as it went on, partly
with the help of loans from America and from other countries--Argentina, Holland, Switzerland,
etc.--that have lent us money. 

The contrast is great and deserves careful study. In Colombia, simple scenes of democracy, a solemn
mystery, solitude and the sublime spectacle of nature in all the pomp and splendor of his greatness.
In Europe, the intrigues of the aristocracy, the light of science, exuberant people, and art to the
most prodigious proportions. If Colombia is the country of the future, hope and the idea of ââEurope
is the world's past, memories and facts. Compare these two worlds, examining the body and face
of each civilization is the task of traveling.

Play as bad as doing my job, I do not expect, therefore, that some readers of the New World associated
with research that one of his brothers is doing on the ground where it started, with the horrors
of conquest, civilization Semi- I infiltrated feudal? Happy traveler, inspired the deepest feelings
of love for his family preferred regions of Colombia, could find his real treasures to offer pilgrimage
to his brothers!

Courses every day, hour by hour, at low tide and flow of institutions and customs, science and industry
literature, which reveals the breathtaking monuments, magnificent museums and libraries rich in
railroad and telegraph, in large factories or production ingenious, academies and universities,
international conferences and exhibitions in the art of printing and cabinets in public schools,
charitable institutions in the administration of justice and punishment in various forms, ports, dams
and canals in the theaters of all kinds in public places to service science and good taste, banks, stock
exchanges and partnerships, and all that could be a step forward, a tradition, a social organization
or a characteristic fact, to participate in this movement, I repeat, is to look at the work package
civilization, is to feed the senses and soul simultaneously.
 At the same time both justice
and economic expediency seem to demand that his wider interpretation of Rente, to make it include
the earnings of those whose special qualifications (or, we may add, special luck) put them
in a position to earn more easily than the struggling majority, should be applied to taxation
involved by the debt charge.

How, then, shall we deal with the debt? In the first place we want a good Sinking Fund--1 per
cent. at least--and all realisations of assets in the shape of loans repaid, ships, etc., sold,
should be used for reduction of our foreign debt. For the home charge we want a special form
of income tax that will fall as lightly and indirectly as possible on industry; that is, that
it should be imposed on the individual taxpayer direct. So that what we want is an extended,
reformed and better graduated form of the super-tax brought down so low that every one who
is not merely rich but comfortable should pay his share, For example, any single man or woman
with any excess over £500 a year of unearned income, or over £800 a year of earned income might
well pay super-tax on that excess. The exemption limit might well be raised by 50 per cent.
for married couples (if their joint incomes are still to be counted as one), and by £100 a
year for each child between the age of five and twenty-five. But all these figures are mere
suggestions, and the details of the scheme would have to be worked out by Inland Revenue officials,
whose experience and knowledge of the practical working of such matters qualifies them for
the task. The broad principle is a special tax for the debt charge to be raised direct from
individual incomes with skilful differentiation, according to the circumstances of the taxpayer,
in the matter of the number of his dependants, and also according to the source of the income,
whether it is being earned by exertions which illness might terminate or received from invested
funds, and therefore beyond the reach of the "slings and arrows of outrageous fortune." That
portion of the tax that is required for Sinking Fund might be made payable, at the option of
the taxpayer, in Government securities at prices giving some advantage to the holder. This
form of special debt-charge super-tax would enable the ordinary income tax to be reduced considerably
at once. Mr Edward Lees, secretary to the Manchester and County Bank, has put forward a scheme
by which taxpayers can buy in advance immunity for so many years from so much annual income
tax. If this suggestion could be worked it might provide a means of quickening the debt's repayment,
though it looks rather like exchanging one form of debt for another. But, in any case, it is
urgent that the long promised reform of income tax should be set in hand at once, so that it
may be purged of its present inequities and anomalies and set to work in peace to redeem debt
on a new and more scientific basis.

Among the many features of the late war (how comfortable it is to talk about the "late war"!)
that seem likely to astonish the historian of the future, perhaps the thing that will surprise
him most is the behaviour of the warring Governments in currency matters. It is surely, a most
extraordinary thing after all that has been thought, said and written about monetary policy
since money was invented that as soon as a great economic effort was necessary on the part
of the leading civilised Powers, they should all have fallen back on the old mediaeval dodge
of depreciating the currency, varied to suit modern needs, in order to pay part of their war
bill, and should have continued this policy throughout the course of the war, in spite of the
obvious results that it was producing in the shape of unrest, suspicion and bitterness on the
part of the working classes, who very naturally thought that the consequent rise in prices
was due to the machinations of unscrupulous capitalists who were exploiting them. It is even
possible that the historian of a century hence may ascribe to this cause the beginning of the
end of our present economic system, based on the private ownership of capital, for it is very
evident that we have not yet seen the end of the harvest that this bitterness and discontent
are producing.

A less important but still very objectionable consequence of the flood of currency and credit
that the Government has poured out to fill a gap in its war finance is the encouragement that
it has given to a host of monetary quacks who believe that all the financial ills of the world
can be saved if only you give it enough money to handle, oblivious of the effect on prices
of mere multiplication of claims to goods without a corresponding increase in the volume of
goods. These enthusiasts have seen that during war a Government can produce money as fast as
it likes, and since they think that producing money makes every one happy they propose to adopt
this simple method for paying off war debt, restarting trade and generally creating a monetary
millennium. How far their nostrums are likely to be adopted, no one can yet say, but some of
the utterances of our rulers make one shudder.
