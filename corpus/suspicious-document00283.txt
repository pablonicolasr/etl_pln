QUEEN.
  Nay, for God's love be away;
  You will be slain and I get shame.  God's mercy!
  You were stark mad to come here; kiss me, sweet.
  Oh, I do love you more than all men! yea,
  Take my lips to you, close mine eyes up fast,
  So you leave hold a little; there, for pity,
  Abide now, and to-morrow come to me.
  Nay, lest one see red kisses in my throat--
  Dear God! what shall I give you to be gone?

CHASTELARD.
  I will not go.  Look, here's full night grown up;
  Why should I seek to sleep away from here?
  The place is soft and the lights burn for sleep;
  Be not you moved; I shall lie well enough.

QUEEN.
  You are utterly undone.  Sweet, by my life,
  You shall be saved with taking ship at once.
  For if you stay this foolish love's hour out
  There is not ten days' likely life in you.
  This is no choice.

CHASTELARD.
  Nay, for I will not go.

QUEEN.
  O me! this is that Bayard's blood of yours
  That makes you mad; yea, and you shall not stay.
  I do not understand.  Mind, you must die.
  Alas, poor lord, you have no sense of me;
  I shall be deadly to you.

CHASTELARD.
  Yea, I saw that;
  But I saw not that when my death's day came
  You could be quite so sweet to me.

QUEEN.
  My love!
  If I could kiss my heart's root out on you
  You would taste love hid at the core of me.

CHASTELARD.
  Kiss me twice more.  This beautiful bowed head
  That has such hair with kissing ripples in
  And shivering soft eyelashes and brows
  With fluttered blood! but laugh a little, sweetly,
  That I may see your sad mouth's laughing look
  I have used sweet hours in seeing.  O, will you weep?
  I pray you do not weep.

CHASTELARD.
  Yea, love.
  Comfort your heart.  What way am I do die?

QUEEN.
  Ah, will you go yet, sweet?

CHASTELARD.
  No, by God's body.
  You will not see? how shall I make you see?
  Look, it may be love was a sort of curse
  Made for my plague and mixed up with my days
  Somewise in their beginning; or indeed
  A bitter birth begotten of sad stars
  At mine own body's birth, that heaven might make
  My life taste sharp where other men drank sweet;
  But whether in heavy body or broken soul,
  I know it must go on to be my death.
  There was the matter of my fate in me
  When I was fashioned first, and given such life
  As goes with a sad end; no fault but God's.
  Yea, and for all this I am not penitent:
  You see I am perfect in these sins of mine,
  I have my sins writ in a book to read;
  Now I shall die and be well done with this.
  But I am sure you cannot see such things,
  God knows I blame you not.

QUEEN.
  What shall be said?
  You know most well that I am sorrowful.
  But you should chide me.  Sweet, you have seen fair wars,
  Have seen men slain and ridden red in them;
  Why will you die a chamberer's death like this?
  What, shall no praise be written of my knight,
  For my fame's sake?

CHASTELARD.
  Nay, no great praise, I think;
  I will no more; what should I do with death,
  Though I died goodly out of sight of you?
  I have gone once:  here am I set now, sweet,
  Till the end come.  That is your husband, hark,
  He knocks at the outer door.  Kiss me just once.
  You know now all you have to say.  Nay, love,
  Let him come quickly.

[Enter DARNLEY, and afterwards the MARIES.]

DARNLEY.
  Yea, what thing is here?
  Ay, this was what the doors shut fast upon--
  Ay, trust you to be fast at prayer, my sweet?
  By God I have a mind--

CHASTELARD.
  What mind then, sir?
  A liar's lewd mind, to coin sins for jest,
  Because you take me in such wise as this?
  Look you, I have to die soon, and I swear,
  That am no liar but a free knight and lord,
  I shall die clear of any sin to you,
  Save that I came for no good will of mine;
  I am no carle, I play fair games with faith,
  And by mine honor for my sake I swear
  I say but truth; for no man's sake save mine,
  Lest I die shamed.  Madam, I pray you say
  I am no liar; you know me what I am,
  A sinful man and shortly to be slain,
  That in a simple insolence of love
  Have stained with a fool's eyes your holy hours
  And with a fool's words put your pity out;
  Nathless you know if I be liar or no,
  Wherefore for God's sake give me grace to swear
  (Yea, for mine too) how past all praise you are
  And stainless of all shame; and how all men
  Lie, saying you are not most good and innocent,
  Yea, the one thing good as God.

DARNLEY.
  O sir, we know
  You can swear well, being taken; you fair French
  Dare swallow God's name for a lewd love-sake
  As it were water.  Nay, we know, we know;
  Save your sweet breath now lest you lack it soon:
  We are simple, we; we have not heard of you.
  Madam, by God you are well shamed in him:
  Ay, trust you to be fingering in one's face,
  Play with one's neck-chain? ah, your maiden's man,
  A relic of your people's!

CHASTELARD.
  Hold your peace,
  Or I will set an edge on your own lie
  Shall scar yourself.  Madam, have out your guard;
  'T is time I were got hence.

QUEEN.
  Sweet Hamilton,
  Hold you my hand and help me to sit down.
  O Henry, I am beaten from my wits--
  Let me have time and live; call out my people--
  Bring forth some armed guard to lay hold on him:
  But see no man be slain.
  Sirs, hide your swords;
  I will not have men slain.

DARNLEY.
  What, is this true?
  Call the queen's people--help the queen there, you--
  Ho, sirs, come in.

[Enter some with the Guard.]

QUEEN.
  Lay hold upon that man;
  Bear him away, but see he have no hurt.

CHASTELARD.
  Into your hands I render up myself
  With a free heart; deal with me how you list,
  But courteously, I pray you.  Take my sword.
  Farewell, great queen; the sweetness in your look
  Makes life look bitter on me.  Farewell, sirs.

[He is taken out.]

DARNLEY.
  Yea, pluck him forth, and have him hanged by dawn;
  He shall find bed enow to sleep.  God's love!
  That such a knave should be a knight like this!

QUEEN.
  Sir, peace awhile; this shall be as I please;
  Take patience to you.  Lords, I pray you see
  All be done goodly; look they wrong him not.
  Carmichael, you shall sleep with me to-night;
  I am sorely shaken, even to the heart.  Fair lords,
  I thank you for your care.  Sweet, stay by me.

END OF THE THIRD ACT.

ACT IV.

MURRAY.

SCENE I.-The Queen's Lodging at St. Andrew's.

The QUEEN and the four MARIES.

QUEEN.
  Why will you break my heart with praying to me?
  You Seyton, you Carmichael, you have wits,
  You are not all run to tears; you do not think
  It is my wrath or will that whets this axe
  Against his neck?

MARY SEYTON.
  Nay, these three weeks agone
  I said the queen's wrath was not sharp enough
  To shear a neck.

QUEEN.
  Sweet, and you did me right,
  And look you, what my mercy bears to fruit,
  Danger and deadly speech and a fresh fault
  Before the first was cool in people's lips;
  A goodly mercy: and I wash hands of it.--
  Speak you, there; have you ever found me sharp?
  You weep and whisper with sloped necks and heads
  Like two sick birds; do you think shame of me?
  Nay, I thank God none can think shame of me;
  But am I bitter, think you, to men's faults?
  I think I am too merciful, too meek:
  Why if I could I would yet save this man;
  'T is just boy's madness; a soft stripe or two
  Would do to scourge the fault in his French blood.
  I would fain let him go.  You, Hamilton,
  You have a heart thewed harder than my heart;
  When mine would threat it sighs, and wrath in it
  Has a bird's flight and station, starves before
  It can well feed or fly; my pulse of wrath
  Sounds tender as the running down of tears.
  You are the hardest woman I have known,
  Your blood has frost and cruel gall in it,
  You hold men off with bitter lips and eyes--
  Such maidens should serve England; now, perfay,
  I doubt you would have got him slain at once.
  Come, would you not? come, would you let him live?

MARY HAMILTON.
  Yes-I think yes; I cannot tell; maybe
  I would have seen him punished.

QUEEN.
  Look you now,
  There's maiden mercy; I would have him live--
  For all my wifehood maybe I weep too;
  Here's a mere maiden falls to slaying at once,
  Small shrift for her; God keep us from such hearts!
  I am a queen too that would have him live,
  But one that has no wrong and is no queen,
  She would-What are you saying there, you twain?

MARY CARMICHAEL.
  I said a queen's face and so fair an one's
  Would lose no grace for giving grace away;
  That gift comes back upon the mouth it left
  And makes it sweeter, and set fresh red on it.

QUEEN.
  This comes of sonnets when the dance draws breath;
  These talking times will make a dearth of grace.
  But you-what ails you that your lips are shut?
  Weep, if you will; here are four friends of yours
  To weep as fast for pity of your tears.
  Do you desire him dead? nay, but men say
  He was your friend, he fought them on your side,
  He made you songs-God knows what songs he made!
  Speak you for him a little:  will you not?

MARY BEATON.
  Madam, I have no words.

QUEEN.
  No words? no pity--
  Have you no mercies for such men?  God help!
  It seems I am the meekest heart on earth--
  Yea, the one tender woman left alive,
  And knew it not.  I will not let him live,
  For all my pity of him.

MARY BEATON.
  Nay, but, madam,
  For God's love look a little to this thing.
  If you do slay him you are but shamed to death;
  All men will cry upon you, women weep,
  Turning your sweet name bitter with their tears;
  Red shame grow up out of your memory
  And burn his face that would speak well of you:
  You shall have no good word nor pity, none,
  Till some such end be fallen upon you:  nay,
  I am but cold, I knew I had no words,
  I will keep silence.

QUEEN.
  Yea now, as I live,
  I wist not of it:  troth, he shall not die.
  See you, I am pitiful, compassionate,
  I would not have men slain for my love's sake,
  But if he live to do me three times wrong,
  Why then my shame would grow up green and red
  Like any flower.  I am not whole at heart;
  In faith, I wot not what such things should be;
  I doubt it is but dangerous; he must die.

MARY BEATON.
  Yea, but you will not slay him.

QUEEN.
  Swear me that,
  I'll say he shall not die for your oath's sake.
  What will you do for grief when he is dead?

MARY BEATON.
  Nothing for grief, but hold my peace and die.

QUEEN.
  Why, for your sweet sake one might let him live;
  But the first fault was a green seed of shame,
  And now the flower, and deadly fruit will come
  With apple-time in autumn.  By my life,
  I would they had slain him there in Edinburgh;
  But I reprieve him; lo the thank I get,
  To set the base folk muttering like smoked bees
  Of shame and love, and how love comes to shame,
  And the queen loves shame that comes of love;
  Yet I say nought and go about my ways,
  And this mad fellow that I respited
  Being forth and free, lo now the second time
  Ye take him by my bed in wait.  Now see
  If I can get good-will to pardon him;
  With what a face may I crave leave of men
  To respite him, being young and a good knight
  And mad for perfect love? shall I go say,
  Dear lords, because ye took him shamefully,
  Let him not die; because his fault is foul,
  Let him not die; because if he do live
  I shall be held a harlot of all men,
  I pray you, sweet sirs, that he may not die?

MARY BEATON.
  Madam, for me I would not have him live;
  Mine own heart's life was ended with my fame,
  And my life's breath will shortly follow them;
  So that I care not much; for you wot well
  I have lost love and shame and fame and all
  To no good end; nor while he had his life
  Have I got good of him that was my love,
  Save that for courtesy (which may God quit)
  He kissed me once as one might kiss for love
  Out of great pity for me; saving this,
  He never did me grace in all his life.
  And when you have slain him, madam, it may be
  I shall get grace of him in some new way
  In a new place, if God have care of us.

QUEEN.
  Bid you my brother to me presently.

[Exeunt MARIES.]

  And yet the thing is pitiful; I would
  There were some way.  To send him overseas,
  Out past the long firths to the cold keen sea
  Where the sharp sound is that one hears up here--
  Or hold him in strong prison till he died--
  He would die shortly--or to set him free
  And use him softly till his brains were healed--
  There is no way.  Now never while I live
  Shall we twain love together any more
  Nor sit at rhyme as we were used to do,
  Nor each kiss other only with the eyes
  A great way off ere hand or lip could reach;
  There is no way.

[Enter MURRAY.]

  O, you are welcome, sir;
  You know what need I have; but I praise heaven,
  Having such need, I have such help of you.
  I do believe no queen God ever made
  Was better holpen than I look to be.
  What, if two brethren love not heartily,
  Who shall be good to either one of them?

MURRAY.
  Madam, I have great joy of your good will.

QUEEN.
  I pray you, brother, use no courtesies:
  I have some fear you will not suffer me
  When I shall speak.  Fear is a fool, I think,
  Yet hath he wit enow to fool my wits,
  Being but a woman's.  Do not answer me
  Till you shall know; yet if you have a word
  I shall be fain to heart it; but I think
  There is no word to help me; no man's word:
  There be two things yet that should do me good,
  A speeding arm and a great heart.  My lord,
  I am soft-spirited as women are,
  And ye wot well I have no harder heart:
  Yea, with all my will I would not slay a thing,
  But all should live right sweetly if I might;
  So that man's blood-spilling lies hard on me.
  I have a work yet for mine honor's sake,
  A thing to do, God wot I know not how,
  Nor how to crave it of you:  nay, by heaven,
  I will not shame myself to show it you:
  I have not heart.

MURRAY.
  Why, if it may be done
  With any honor, or with good men's excuse,
  I shall well do it.

QUEEN.
  I would I wist that well.
  Sir, do you love me?

MURRAY.
  Yea, you know I do.

QUEEN.
  In faith, you should well love me, for I love
  The least man in your following for your sake
  With a whole sister's heart.

MURRAY.
  Speak simply, madam;
  I must obey you, being your bounden man.

QUEEN.
  Sir, so it is you know what things have been,
  Even to the endangering of mine innocent name,
  And by no fault, but by men's evil will;
  If Chastelard have trial openly,
  I am but shamed.

MURRAY.
  This were a wound indeed,
  If your good name should lie upon his lip.

QUEEN.
  I will the judges put him not to plead,
  For my fame's sake; he shall not answer them.

MURRAY.
  What, think you he will speak against your fame?

QUEEN.
  I know not; men might feign belief of him
  For hate of me; it may be he will speak;
  In brief, I will not have him held to proof.

MURRAY.
  Well, if this be, what good is to be done?

QUEEN.
  Is there no way but he must speak to them,
  Being had to trial plainly?

MURRAY.
  I think, none.

QUEEN.
  Now mark, my lord; I swear he will not speak.

MURRAY.
  It were the best if you could make that sure.

QUEEN.
  There is one way.  Look, sir, he shall not do it:
  Shall not, or will not, either is one way;
  I speak as I would have you understand.

MURRAY.
  Let me not guess at you; speak certainly.

QUEEN.
  You will not mind me:  let him be removed;
  Take means to get me surety; there be means.

MURRAY.
  So, in your mind, I have to slay the man?

QUEEN.
  Is there a mean for me to save the man?

MURRAY.
  Truly I see no mean except your love.

QUEEN.
  What love is that, my lord? what think you of,
  Talking of love and of love's mean in me
  And of your guesses and of slaying him?
  Why, I say nought, have nought to say:  God help me!
  I bid you but take surety of the man,
  Get him removed.

MURRAY.
  Come, come, be clear with me;
  You bid me to despatch him privily.

QUEEN.
  God send me sufferance!  I bid you, sir?
  Nay, do not go; what matter if I did?
  Nathless I never bade you; no, by God.
  Be not so wroth; you are my brother born;
  Why do you dwell upon me with such eyes?
  For love of God you should not bear me hard.

MURRAY.
  What, are you made of flesh?

QUEEN.
  O, now I see
  You had rather lose your wits to do me harm
  Than keep sound wits to help me.

MURRAY.
  It is right strange;
  The worst man living hath some fear, some love,
  Holds somewhat dear a little for life's sake,
  Keeps fast to some compassion; you have none;
  You know of nothing that remembrance knows
  To make you tender.  I must slay the man?
  Nay, I will do it.

QUEEN.
  Do, if you be not mad.
  I am sorry for him; and he must needs die.
  I would I were assured you hate me not:
  I have no heart to slay him by my will.
  I pray you think not bitterly of me.

MURRAY.
  Is it your pleasure such a thing were done?

QUEEN.
  Yea, by God's body is it, certainly.

MURRAY.
  Nay, for your love then, and for honor's sake,
  This thing must be.

QUEEN.
  Yea, should I set you on?
  Even for my love then, I beseech you, sir,
  To seek him out, and lest he prate of me
  To put your knife into him ere he come forth:
  Meseems this were not such wild work to do.

MURRAY.
  I'll have him in the prison taken off.

QUEEN.
  I am bounden to you, even for my name's sake,
  When that is done.

MURRAY.
  I pray you fear me not.
  Farewell.  I would such things were not to do,
  Or not for me; yea, not for any man.

[Exit.]

QUEEN.
  Alas, what honor have I to give thanks?
  I would he had denied me:  I had held my peace
  Thenceforth forever; but he wrung out the word,
  Caught it before my lip, was fain of it--
  It was his fault to put it in my mind,
  Yea, and to feign a loathing of his fault.
  Now is he about devising my love's death,
  And nothing loth.  Nay, since he must needs die,
  Would he were dead and come alive again
  And I might keep him safe.  He doth live now
  And I may do what love I will to him;
  But by to-morrow he will be stark dead,
  Stark slain and dead; and for no sort of love
  Will he so much as kiss me half a kiss.
  Were this to do I would not do it again.

[Reenter MURRAY.]

  What, have you taken order? is it done?
  It were impossible to do so soon.
  Nay, answer me.

MURRAY.
  Madam, I will not do it.

QUEEN.
  How did you say?  I pray, sir, speak again:
  I know not what you said.

MURRAY.
  I say I will not;
  I have thought thereof, and have made up my heart
  To have no part in this:  look you to it.

QUEEN.
  O, for God's sake! you will not have me shamed?

MURRAY.
  I will not dip my hand into your sin.

QUEEN.
  It were a good deed to deliver me;
  I am but a woman, of one blood with you,
  A feeble woman; put me not to shame;
  I pray you of your pity do me right.
  Yea, and no fleck of blood shall cleave to you
  For a just deed.

MURRAY.
  I know not; I will none.

QUEEN.
  O, you will never let him speak to them
  To put me in such shame? why, I should die
  Out of pure shame and mine own burning blood;
  Yea, my face feels the shame lay hold on it,
  I am half burnt already in my thought;
  Take pity of me.  Think how shame slays a man;
  How shall I live then? would you have me dead?
  I pray you for our dead dear father's sake,
  Let not men mock at me.  Nay, if he speak,
  I shall be sung in mine own towns.  Have pity.
  What, will you let men stone me in the ways?

MURRAY.
  Madam, I shall take pains the best I may
  To save your honor, and what thing lieth in me
  That will I do, but no close manslayings.
  I will not have God's judgment gripe my throat
  When I am dead, to hale me into hell
  For a man's sake slain on this wise.  Take heed.
  See you to that.

[Exit.]

QUEEN.
  One of you maidens there
  Bid my lord hither.  Now by Mary's soul,
  He shall not die and bring me into shame.
  There's treason in you like a fever, hot,
  My holy-natured brother, cheek and eye;
  You look red through with it: sick, honor-sick,
  Specked with the blain of treason, leper-like--
  A scrupulous fair traitor with clean lips--
  If one should sue to hell to do him good
  He were as brotherly holpen as I am.
  This man must live and say no harm of me;
  I may reprieve and cast him forth; yea, so--
  This were the best; or if he die midway--
  Yea, anything, so that he die not here.

[To the MARIES within.]

  Fetch hither Darnley.  Nay, ye gape on me--
  What, doth he sleep, or feeds, or plays at games?
  Why, I would see him; I am weary for his sake;
  Bid my lord in.-Nathless he will but chide;
  Nay, fleer and laugh:  what should one say to him?
  There were some word if one could hit on it;
  Some way to close with him:  I wot not.-Sir,

[Enter DARNLEY.]

  Please it your love I have a suit to you.

DARNLEY.
  What sort of suit?

QUEEN.
  Nay, if you be not friends--
  I have no suit towards mine enemies.

DARNLEY.
  Eh, do I look now like your enemy?

QUEEN.
  You have a way of peering under brow
  I do not like.  If you see anything
  In me that irks you I will painfully
  Labor to lose it:  do but show me favor,
  And as I am your faithful humble wife
  This foolishness shall be removed in me.

DARNLEY.
  Why do you laugh and mock me with stretched hands?
  Faith, I see no such thing.

QUEEN.
  That is well seen.
  Come, I will take my heart between my lips,
  Use it not hardly.  Sir, my suit begins;
  That you would please to make me that I am,
  (In sooth I think I am) mistress and queen
  Of mine own people.

DARNLEY.
  Why, this is no suit;
  This is a simple matter, and your own.

QUEEN.
  It was, before God made you king of me.

DARNLEY.
  No king, by God's grace; were I such a king
  I'd sell my kingdom for six roods of rye.

QUEEN.
  You are too sharp upon my words; I would
  Have leave of you to free a man condemned.

DARNLEY.
  What man is that, sweet?

QUEEN.
  Such a mad poor man
  As God desires us use not cruelly.

DARNLEY.
  Is there no name a man may call him by?

QUEEN.
  Nay, my fair master, what fair game is this?
  Why, you do know him, it is Chastelard.

DARNLEY.
  Ay, is it soothly?

QUEEN.
  By my life, it is;
  Sweet, as you tender me, so pardon him.

DARNLEY.
  As he doth tender you, so pardon me;
  For if it were the mean to save my life
  He should not live a day.

QUEEN.
  Nay, shall not he?

DARNLEY.
  Look what an evil wit old Fortune hath:
  Why, I came here to get his time cut off.
  This second fault is meat for lewd men's mouths;
  You were best have him slain at once:  'tis hot.

QUEEN.
  Give me the warrant, and sit down, my lord.
  Why, I will sign it; what, I understand
  How this must be.  Should not my name stand here?

DARNLEY.
  Yea, there, and here the seal.

QUEEN.
  Ay, so you say.
  Shall I say too what I am thinking of?

DARNLEY.
  Do, if you will.

QUEEN.
  I do not like your suit.

DARNLEY.
  'Tis of no Frenchman fashion.

QUEEN.
  No, God wot;
  'Tis nowise great men's fashion in French land
  To clap a headsman's taberd on their backs.

DARNLEY.
  No, madam?

QUEEN.
  No; I never wist of that.
  Is it a month gone I did call you lord?
  I chose you by no straying stroke of sight,
  But with my heart to love you heartily.
  Did I wrong then? did mine eye draw my heart?
  I know not; sir, it may be I did wrong:
  And yet to love you; and would choose again,
  Against to choose you.

DARNLEY.
  There, I love you too;
  Take that for sooth, and let me take this hence.

QUEEN.
  O, do you think I hold you off with words?
  Why, take it then; there is my handwriting,
  And here the hand that you shall slay him with.
  'Tis a fair hand, a maiden-colored one:
  I doubt yet it has never slain a man.
  You never fought yet save for game, I wis.
  Nay, thank me not, but have it from my sight;
  Go and make haste for fear he be got forth:
  It may be such a man is dangerous;
  Who knows what friends he hath? and by my faith
  I doubt he hath seen some fighting, I do fear
  He hath fought and shed men's blood; ye are wise men
  That will not leave such dangerous things alive;
  'T were well he died the sooner for your sakes.
  Pray you make haste; it is not fit he live.

DARNLEY.
  What, will you let him die so easily?

QUEEN.
  Why, God have mercy! what way should one take
  To please such people? there's some cunning way,
  Something I miss, out of my simple soul.
  What, must one say "Beseech you do no harm,"
  Or "for my love, sweet cousins, be not hard,"
  Or "let him live but till the vane come round"--
  Will such things please you? well then, have your way;
  Sir, I desire you, kneeling down with tears,
  With sighs and tears, fair sir, require of you,
  Considering of my love I bear this man,
  Just for my love's sake let him not be hanged
  Before the sundown; do thus much for me,
  To have a queen's prayers follow after you.

DARNLEY.
  I know no need for you to gibe at me.

QUEEN.
  Alack, what heart then shall I have to jest?
  There is no woman jests in such a wise--
  For the shame's sake I pray you hang him not,
  Seeing how I love him, save indeed in silk,
  Sweet twisted silk of my sad handiwork.
  Nay, and you will not do so much for me;
  You vex your lip, biting the blood and all:
  Were this so hard, and you compassionate?
  I am in sore case then, and will weep indeed.

DARNLEY.
  What do you mean to cast such gibes at me?

QUEEN.
  Woe's me, and will you turn my tears to thorns?
  Nay, set your eyes a little in my face;
  See, do I weep? what will you make of me?
  Will you not swear I love this prisoner?
  Ye are wise, and ye will have it; yet for me
  I wist not of it.  We are but feeble fools,
  And love may catch us when we lie asleep
  And yet God knows we know not this a whit.
  Come, look on me, swear you believe it not:
  It may be I will take your word for that.

DARNLEY.
  Do you not love him? nay, but verily?

QUEEN.
  Now then, make answer to me verily,
  Which of us twain is wiser? for my part
  I will not swear I love not, if you will;
  Ye be wise men and many men, my lords,
  And ye will have me love him, ye will swear
  That I do love him; who shall say ye lie?
  Look on your paper; maybe I have wept:
  Doubtless I love your hanged man in my heart.
  What, is the writing smutched or gone awry?
  Or blurred-ay, surely so much-with one tear,
  One little sharp tear strayed on it by chance?
  Come, come, the man is deadly dangerous;
  Let him die presently.

DARNLEY.
  You do not love him;
  Well, yet he need not die; it were right hard
  To hang the fool because you love him not.

QUEEN.
  You have keen wits and thereto courtesy
  To catch me with.  No, let this man not die;
  It were no such perpetual praise to you
  To be his doomsman and in doglike wise
  Bite his brief life in twain.

DARNLEY.
  Truly it were not.

QUEEN.
  Then for your honor and my love of you
  (Oh, I do love you! but you know not, sweet,
  You shall see how much), think you for their sake
  He may go free?

DARNLEY.
  How, freely forth of us?
  But yet he loves you, and being mad with love
  Makes matter for base mouths to chew upon:
  'T were best he live not yet.

QUEEN.
  Will you say that?

DARNLEY.
  Why should he live to breed you bad reports?
  Let him die first.

QUEEN.
  Sweet, for your sake, not so.

DARNLEY.
  Fret not yourself to pity; let him die.

QUEEN.
  Come, let him live a little; it shall be
  A grace to us.

DARNLEY.
  By God he dies at once.

QUEEN.
  Now, by God's mother, if I respite him,
  Though you were all the race of you in one
  And had more tongues than hairs to cry on me
  He should not lose a hair.

DARNLEY.
  This is mere mercy--
  But you thank God you love him not a whit?

QUEEN.
  It shall be what it please; and if I please
  It shall be anything.  Give me the warrant.

DARNLEY.
  Nay, for your sake and love of you, not I,
  To make it dangerous.

QUEEN.
  O, God' pity, sir!
  You are tender of me; will you serve me so,
  Against mine own will, show me so much love,
  Do me good service that I loath being done,
  Out of pure pity?

DARNLEY.
  Nay, your word shall stand.

QUEEN.
  What makes you gape so beastlike after blood?
  Were you not bred up on some hangman's hire
  And dicted with fleshmeats at his hand
  And fed into a fool?  Give me that paper.

DARNLEY.
  Now for that word I will not.

QUEEN.
  Nay, sweet love,
  For your own sake be just a little wise;
  Come, I beseech you.

DARNLEY.
  Pluck not at my hands.

QUEEN.
  No, that I will not:  I am brain-broken, mad;
  Pity my madness for sweet marriage-sake
  And my great love's; I love you to say this;
  I would not have you cross me, out of love.
  But for true love should I not chafe indeed?
  And now I do not.

DARNLEY.
  Yea, and late you chid,
  You chafed and jested and blew soft and hard--
  No, for that "fool" you shall not fool me so.

QUEEN.
  You are no churl, sweet, will you see me weep?
  Look, I weep now; be friends with my poor tears,
  Think each of them beseeches you of love
  And hath some tongue to cry on you for love
  And speak soft things; for that which loves not you
  Is none of mine, not though they grow of grief
  And grief of you; be not too hard with them.
  You would not of your own heart slay a man;
  Nay, if you will, in God's name make me weep,
  I will not hate you; but at heart, sweet lord,
  Be not at heart my sweet heart's enemy.
  If I had many mighty men to friend
  I would not plead too lovingly with you
  To have your love.

DARNLEY.
  Why, yet you have my love.

QUEEN.
  Alas, what shall mine enemies do to me
  If he be used so hardly of my friends?
  Come, sir, you hate me; yet for all your hate
  You cannot have such heart.

DARNLEY.
  What sort of heart?
  I have no heart to be used shamefully
  If you mean that.

QUEEN.
  Would God I loved you not;
  You are too hard to be used lovingly.

DARNLEY.
  You are moved too much for such a little love
  As you bear me.

QUEEN.
  God knows you do me wrong;
  God knows the heart, sweet, that I love you with.
  Hark you, fair sir, I'd have all well with you;
  Do you not fear at sick men's time of night
  What end may come? are you so sure of heart?
  Is not your spirit surprisable in sleep?
  Have you no evil dreams?  Nay, look you, love,
  I will not be flung off you heart and hand,
  I am no snake:  but tell me for your love
  Have you no fancies how these things will end
  In the pit's mouth? how all life-deeds will look
  At the grave's edge that lets men into hell?
  For my part, who am weak and woman-eyed,
  It turns my soul tears:  I doubt this blood
  Fallen on our faces when we twain are dead
  Will scar and burn them:  yea, for heaven is sweet,
  And loves sweet deeds that smell not of split blood.
  Let us not kill:  God that made mercy first
  Pities the pitiful for their deed's sake.

DARNLEY.
  Get you some painting; with a cheek like this
  You'll find no faith in listeners.

QUEEN.
  How, fair lord?
