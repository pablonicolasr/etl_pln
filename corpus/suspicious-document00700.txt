Under the Chilian Flag A Tale of War between Chili and Peru

By Harry Collingwood

There was a state of war between Chili and Peru in the 1870s.  It was all to do with a desert
area that lay between Chili, Peru and Bolivia. At first this desert was not particularly claimed
by any of these countries, but when it was discovered that it held rich reserves of nitrates,
the three of them fell out.

Two young Englishmen, with sea-going experience, were aboard a British vessel trading in nitrates
and other ores.  The captain was a very disagreeable character, and they determined to leave
him, and sign up with the Chilian authorities for employment in the Chilian Navy, which was
short of officers.  They were taken on, and the rest of the book details some of the adventures
they had, and the trials and tribulations they endured.

This is a very exciting and enjoyable book.  There are a few Spanish words, and of course the
ships have Spanish names, but you soon get used to that.  I fully recommend it, especially
if you can make it into an audiobook.

WHAT HAPPENED ON THE PERICLES.

"You, Thompson, go down and send the second mate up to me.  Tell him to leave whatever he is
doing and to come up here at once.  I want to speak to him," growled Captain Fisher of the
steamer Pericles, turning, with a menacing expression, to the grizzled old quartermaster who
stood beside him on the bridge.

Thompson, as though only too glad of an excuse to leave the neighbourhood of his skipper, grunted
out an assent, and, swinging round on his heel, shambled away down the ladder leading from
the bridge to the spar-deck, and departed on his errand.

The Pericles was an iron single-screw steamer of two thousand tons or thereabout.  She was
employed in the carriage of nitrates, silver ore, hides, etcetera, between Chilian ports and
Liverpool.  She was owned by a company, which also possessed two similar vessels employed in
the same trade.  Captain Fisher, her skipper, had a considerable number of shares in this company,
a circumstance which accounted in no small measure for the fact of his being the skipper of
the Pericles; for a man less fit to have the control of other men it would have been exceedingly
difficult to find.

Fisher was a man of enormous stature and splendid physique, but his features, which would otherwise
have been considered handsome, were marred by a ferocious expression, due to his chronic condition
of ill- humour.  He was constantly "hazing" his men, and was never at a loss for an excuse
for irritating them in every possible way.  In this pleasing occupation he was ably seconded
by his first mate, an American, named Silas Hoover.  Between the pair of them they had contrived,
during the course of the several voyages which they had performed together, to render their
men thoroughly dissatisfied almost to the verge of mutiny; and there is little doubt that long
before this the crew would have given open and forcible expression to their feelings had it
not been for the efforts of the second mate, a young fellow of eighteen years of age, named
James Douglas.  This was the individual for whom Fisher had just sent.  He had conceived a
most virulent hatred for him, in consequence, probably, of the fact that Douglas was the only
officer in the ship for whom the men would work willingly and for whom they showed any real
respect.  The lad had been left an orphan at an early age, and as he showed even from he first
a predilection for a seafaring life, he had been sent by his uncle at the age of fourteen as
an apprentice on board a sailing ship, and during the four following years he had gradually
worked his way upward until now he was second mate of the Pericles.

Up to the time when he joined that ship he had had no cause to regret his choice of a profession;
but the six or seven months which he had spent under Fisher had proved so thoroughly unpleasant
that he had made up his mind he would leave the ship at the first port at which she called.
This resolve was echoed by his own particular chum, Terence O'Meara, third engineer of the
same ship, who had likewise found life on board the Pericles anything but to his liking.  The
steamer was, at the time when this story opens, on her way to Valparaiso, the principal seaport
of Chili; and, as she was now in the very centre of the South Atlantic, Douglas hoped to escape
from his tormentor in about a month's time.  As a matter of fact, Douglas and his friend were
just talking the matter over when the grizzled old quartermaster popped his head into Douglas's
cabin with the remark, "Skipper wants to see you, sir, on the bridge.  He told me particularly
to say that he wanted you to come immediately; and he do seem to be in a rare bad mood this
morning, so I shouldn't keep him waiting, sir, if I were you."

"All right, Thompson, all right," answered Douglas.  "I'll be there in a moment."  Then, turning
to Terry O'Meara, he remarked: "I wonder what fault he will have to find this morning.  I'll
wager that he only wants to see me in order to blow me up about something, confound him!  Well,
Terry, old boy, I'll see you again when you come off duty in the evening.  Trot along to my
cabin at about ten o'clock, as usual.  Good- bye for the time being."

With a wave of his hand, Douglas slipped out of the cabin and hurried along the alleyway, anxious
to avoid keeping Fisher waiting any longer than was absolutely necessary.  In a few seconds
he reached the foot of the bridge ladder, and, running quickly up it, found the captain impatiently
pacing up and down, evidently in the very worst of bad tempers.

"You wish to see me, sir," said Douglas respectfully.

The skipper glared at him for a moment and then burst out with, "Yes, you lazy young scoundrel,
I do; and a precious long time you've been coming, too.  I suppose you thought that, being
off duty, you could skulk in your cabin and do nothing.  I expect you were hatching some mischief
with that other bright spark, your friend O'Meara.  But let me tell you, sir, I will have no
idlers on board my ship.  Just remember that; and don't let me see you talking quite so much
to that young scamp O'Meara.  But that's not what I wanted to see you about.  Why have you
not carried out my instructions as to that paint-work which I told you to see about?  I gave
you my orders three days ago, and there is no sign as yet of the work being commenced.  What
do you mean by such conduct, sir?  What possible excuse can you have for not--"

"Pardon me, sir," interrupted Douglas.  "I fear you are making a mistake, or that you have
been misinformed.  I did put the paint-work in hand directly you told me; and the work was
nearly completed when we ran into that heavy sea yesterday.  You know that we shipped it solid
over our bows, and the paint being still wet was, of course, nearly all washed off.  I set
the men to work, however, to clean things up again, and they have restarted the job this morning.
You can see them at work now."

"Yes, of course I can," roared Fisher; "and I wanted to know why you had not seen fit to start
the job until just now.  However, you have given me an excuse, and I suppose I must accept
it; but if you had carried out my orders with a little more promptitude the paint would have
been dry before we ran into that breeze.  You can go now, sir, and take care that I do not
have cause to reprimand you again.  I am getting sick of your laziness, incapacity, and insubordination."

Douglas turned on his heel and left the skipper without any more ado, but his cheeks burned
with indignation at the injustice of it all.  He had carried out his orders to the letter directly
they had been given him, and it was certainly not his fault that the work had to be done over
again.  Neither was he lazy nor insubordinate; while, far from being incapable, he had earned
the good-will of every skipper with whom he had sailed, with the solitary exception of this
one.  He returned to his cabin and lay down to think things over, with the result that he went
on duty a few hours later more than ever resolved to make this his last voyage under Captain
Fisher.  True, he would be compelled to desert and would consequently lose his certificate,
and probably have some difficulty in getting another ship; but even that would be better than
the life he was living at present, which, he felt, was not fit for a dog.

The days slipped slowly away, however, in spite of all the discomfort and annoyance; and Douglas
at length began to look upon his quarrels with the skipper as unavoidable, and to treat them
as a matter of course.  The Pericles rounded Cape Horn, steamed up the Chilian coast, and on
January 7, 1879, dropped her anchor in Valparaiso harbour.  The long and dreary voyage was
at an end at last!  Douglas and Terry O'Meara had long before this completed all their plans
for an early escape; and the two lads were now standing just by the break of the poop, looking
across the blue water towards the fair city, aptly named the "Valley of Paradise."

This was not the first time that the boys had been there, and both knew the place fairly well;
but this morning they seemed to notice some indefinable change in the appearance of the city,
and tried to discover in what it consisted.

Presently Douglas started up with the remark: "I know what it is, Terry, old boy; there's some
tremendous excitement or other ashore there.  If you will take a squint through this glass
you will see that the shops are all shut, and that a good many of the streets are barricaded.
Up there at the back of the town there is a body of Chilian soldiers busily throwing up earthworks
or constructing a fort of some kind.  Take my word for it, lad, there's a revolution in progress
there, or something akin to it.  What luck, Terry!  We shall be able to get right into the
thick of it; and I shall be much mistaken if we don't find plenty of employment ready for us
when we get ashore.  But what on earth's all this?  This looks as though something more serious
than a mere revolution were in progress!"

Douglas's exclamation of astonishment had been drawn from him by the sight of a squadron of
warships which had just put in their appearance round the point, and which were slowly steaming
in column of line ahead, and were evidently making their way toward the warship anchorage in
the roads.  There were five of them altogether, two large and three small ships, all flying
the Chilian ensign.  By means of the glass the lads made out that the first two craft were
the Almirante Cochrane and the Blanco Encalada, both battleships.  Then came the corvettes
O'Higgins and Chacabuco; and, lastly, the sloop Esmeralda. Presently they all slowed up and
anchored; and as they did so there came the sound of tumultuous cheering from the city, to
which the ships replied by dipping their ensigns.

"As you say, Jim, this is no revolution," answered Terry.  "War has probably broken out between
Chili and some other country--I wonder which.  Peru, I expect.  And it seems to me, my lad,
that we have just arrived in the very nick of time.  Here is the chance of our lives, and we
shall be foolish if we don't make the most of it."

"What do you mean?" replied Jim; "I don't quite follow--"

"Why, simply this," answered Terry.  "We want to get away from this steamer, don't we?  And
in the usual course of events we might have some difficulty in finding another; but here is
our opportunity ready made for us.  Chili is apparently at war with some other country; and
the thing for us to do is to get ashore and enlist in the Chilian navy. They are sure to want
all the men they can lay hands on.  We have had plenty of experience; and you may be certain
that no awkward questions will be asked.  They will accept us, and be more than glad to get
us; thus, you see, we shall have employment immediately, instead of having to wait, perhaps,
several months for it.  We are indeed in luck's way! The only question is, How are we to get
ashore? for I don't suppose the `old man' will grant any leave, under the circumstances.  We
will try him first, however, and if he refuses we shall have to think of some other means of
getting away from the ship.  Let us go to your cabin and talk the matter over; this is a business
which we had better decide as soon as possible."

He slipped his arm through Douglas's and the pair went off to the latter's cabin, where they
spent the whole afternoon in making plans, with the result that, by the evening, they had perfected
all their arrangements.  They applied to the captain for leave in the usual way, but, as they
had anticipated, it was refused, so they had to look about for some means of getting away from
the ship without being observed, and they managed it very simply, thus.

The next morning a boat laden with fruit came out to the Pericles, in the hope that her crew
would purchase some, as the ship had been ordered by the authorities to remain at her moorings
until further notice, in consequence of the wharfage being required for military purposes.
Jim and Terry thereupon got into conversation with the man in charge of the boat, and made
arrangements with him to come off that same night in a small skiff and take them ashore.

It required both time and money to induce the fellow to fall in with the scheme, but he at
last consented; and he proved as good as his word, for at nine o'clock that evening he quietly
dropped alongside, gave the pre- arranged signal, and a few minutes later both the young men,
with all their belongings, were being pulled ashore to seek their fortune in a new land and
under another flag.  They little knew, when they stepped ashore at the Custom House quay, what
adventures were in store for them, what trials they would be called upon to undergo, what perils
they would pass through; but even if they could have foreseen them all it is very doubtful
whether they would have hesitated.  They paid the man, and, chartering a conveyance, drove
away to the nearest hotel, where they put up for the remainder of the night, fully determined
that the following morning should see their project put into execution, and that the evening
should find them duly enrolled as officers in the Chilian navy.

CHAPTER TWO.

JIM ENTERS THE CHILIAN NAVY.

Although the two lads went to bed early, intending to get a good night's rest so that they
might be up and doing betimes the next morning, they soon found that sleep was well-nigh out
of the question, by reason of the uproar that never ceased the whole night through.  The mercurial
Chilians were wrought up to a pitch of the highest excitement and enthusiasm, and bands of
them persisted in marching through the streets, shouting vivas at the top of their voices and
singing war-songs.  It appeared that the inhabitants of Valparaiso had been dreading an attack
on that city by the Peruvian fleet, although war had not as yet been actually declared; and
the activity which Terry and Jim had observed on the heights behind the city was due to the
fact that the soldiers and citizens had been busily engaged in throwing up earthworks and other
defences in order to repel the expected attack.  But the timely arrival of part of the Chilian
fleet, under Admiral Rebolledo Williams, had put an end to their anxiety, and they were now
testifying to the relief they felt in the manner usually adopted by Southern nations.

After lying in bed for some two or three hours, endeavouring unsuccessfully to get to sleep,
the two lads rose and looked out of their window at the scenes that were being enacted in the
streets below them, and when they had been thus employed for a quarter of an hour they no longer
felt any desire for sleep.  Huge bonfires had been lighted wherever there was room to place
them, and processions of men and women marched to and fro, carrying torches, and singing their
national songs with astonishing verve and enthusiasm.  Groups of people collected round the
bonfires, and danced until the early hours of the morning, when they gradually broke up and
dispersed to their homes.  It was broad daylight before the last of the revellers had disappeared;
and the two lads, recognising the futility of now attempting to secure any repose, dressed
themselves and went out on a tour through the city which should occupy them until the time
arrived for the public offices to open, when they would be able to set about their business.

The two lads had not proceeded very far on their way when they perceived, some distance ahead
of them, a small crowd of people clustering round a building, and they crossed the road to
see what the disturbance was about.  They soon perceived that the building was a gunsmith's
shop, and that the excitement was due to the fact that the people outside were bent on securing
arms and ammunition for themselves, as a protection against the marauders who were wont to
infest the town upon the slightest excuse, and who were now, under cover of the excitement
caused by the impending war, committing all sorts of atrocities, which the authorities were
very much too busy with other matters to put a stop to.

"Look here, Douglas," exclaimed Terry, clutching his companion's sleeve, "it seems to me that
we ought to follow the example of these people. Everybody in this place appears to go about
armed, and we had better do the same, in case we should happen to get into some sort of trouble.
It shows what a state the city must be in, when the only place open the whole night through
happens to be a gun-shop!  How much money did you bring out with you, Jim?  Enough to purchase
a couple of revolvers and some ammunition?"

Douglas hurriedly searched his pockets, and the two lads found that their joint possessions
amounted to about fifty pesos (they had exchanged their English money at the hotel for Chilian
currency). Acting upon Terry's advice, Jim now stepped into the shop and purchased two revolvers
and a packet of ammunition for them, paying about forty pesos of their money for the weapons.
Once outside the shop, the two lads slipped round a corner, loaded the pistols, and slipped
them into their hip-pockets.  Having done this, they started out once more on their tour of
exploration, feeling much more secure than they had previously done.

It was by this time about seven o'clock in the morning; and as the Government Offices would
not be open until nine or ten o'clock they had still fully two hours to fill up before they
could present themselves for enlistment in the Chilian service.  Therefore, feeling somewhat
hungry, they strolled up and down the streets, on the look-out for some cafe or eating-house
where they might refresh the inner man; and, after about a quarter of an hour's search, they
found a place in a side-street which promised to afford what they required.  As they were about
to enter, Douglas seized his friend's arm and remarked--

"I say, Terry, I don't know how it strikes you, but this looks to me to be a very curious sort
of place, and the surroundings do not appear precisely what you might call select.  Don't you
think we had better go on a little farther and see whether we cannot find a more respectable-
looking place?"

Terry cast his eyes over the cafe, and up and down the street in which it was situated.  Unlike
the rest of the town, everything in this district seemed to be comparatively quiet, and there
were very few people about, so he shook off his companion's restraining hand and exclaimed--

"Oh, I don't know, Jim; I think this place looks right enough, and it is quiet, and that is
more than you can say for the other parts of the town.  I think we shall be quite safe in risking
it; let us go inside and see what the proprietor can give us to eat, for, to tell you the truth,
I am most ravenously hungry."

"All right," replied Douglas; "if you don't mind, I am sure I don't; we ought to be able to
take care of ourselves, with the little toys which we have in our pockets.  Come on, then;
let's go inside."

The two lads thereupon walked in through the door, and immediately found themselves in a large
room which was filled with little marble-topped tables, each made to accommodate four persons,
while a high counter, on which were coffee-urns, trays of cakes, flasks of spirits, etcetera,
ran down the whole length of the apartment.  Early as was the hour, the place was very far
from being empty; indeed, the lads found, upon looking round, that nearly every table was occupied,
with the exception of one nearly in the middle of the room, and a second standing in a somewhat
dark corner, close to a door which apparently communicated with the back premises.

"The place seems pretty full, doesn't it, Terry?" queried Jim, taking a comprehensive look
round.  "I should scarcely have expected that there would have been so many folk about at such
an early hour.  These people must have been up all night.  Shall we take that table over in
the corner, there?  It is out of the way, and I don't feel very much inclined to take the one
in the middle of the room, to be stared at by everybody in the place.  What do you propose
to have for breakfast? There doesn't seem to be a very wide selection, but perhaps they may
be able to supply us with something eatable."

"Well," answered O'Meara, "for myself, I should like some fried eggs, if we could get them.
I see they have coffee on tap in these big urns yonder.  What say you?"

Douglas agreed that he too could relish a few eggs; and the two lads stepped up to the counter
and inquired in their best Spanish, which they had picked up during the course of frequent
visits to South American ports, whether they could be supplied with the required comestibles.

To their astonishment, the proprietor did not at once reply, but, after staring hard at them
for a few seconds, slipped quickly off into the back part of the shop, where they heard him
speaking volubly in Spanish to some unseen person or persons.  The lads could not, at that
distance, understand all that he said, but Jim fancied that he caught the words espias and
atacar.  He naturally did not connect them in any way with his friend or himself, however;
and when the proprietor returned in a minute or two, Jim renewed his request.  This time the
fellow was all smiles and bows, and he assured the senores that their order would be most promptly
attended to.  The boys therefore seated themselves at the table which they had selected, and
waited for the food to be brought to them, examining meanwhile the motley collection of people
in the building.  There seemed to be men present of every shade of colour under the sun, from
the pink-skinned representative of some northern country, down to the blackest negro; and their
costumes were as varied as they were picturesque.  But what gave the lads a momentary qualm
of uneasiness was the fact that every person in the place had suddenly become very quiet, whereas,
when the boys entered, the cafe fairly hummed with conversation; and they also noticed that
nearly every pair of eyes was directed toward themselves, while the expressions on the men's
faces were, to put it very mildly, decidedly hostile.

Presently Douglas remarked to his chum: "I say, Terry, old boy, it appears almost as though
these fellows did not quite approve of our presence here; I wonder what's wrong?  The Chilians
have always been very friendly disposed toward us British, so I suppose it is this anticipated
war which has upset their equilibrium a bit.  All the same, I wish the landlord would bring
along our meal, so that we might finish it and get out; I don't like the look of things here
at all."

"Neither do I," replied Terry; "but if there should be a row, remember that we must not get
separated, whatever we do; and don't use your pistol until you are absolutely compelled to
do so.  Should you, however, be obliged to shoot, you must shoot to kill; for when once we
open fire we shall have all our work cut out to get away alive.  Ah, here comes our breakfast
at last; so let us get on with it as quickly as possible, and take no notice of the menacing
looks of this crowd.  If they see that we don't appear to notice anything wrong they may quiet
down a bit."

"Right you are," replied Douglas; and he began his meal with a very excellent appetite despite
the uncongenial surroundings.  The two boys carried out their programme of not appearing to
notice the forbidding glances which everywhere met them whenever they raised their eyes from
their plates; but presently their ears caught the sound of angry whispers, then low mutterings,
until in a few minutes furious voices plainly directed against themselves were heard from every
corner of the room.  One man jumped upon a chair and began to harangue the crowd, speaking
in some South American patois which the boys did not understand, and pointing toward them with
angry gestures, while several other rough-looking characters had risen to their feet and were
gradually edging down toward the corner where Jim and Terry were seated.

"Jim," exclaimed Terry, suddenly glancing up, "there is no doubt that these unwashed scoundrels
very strongly object to our presence here, for some reason or other; I don't much like the
idea of running away, but since we are outnumbered by about ten to one I really think that
discretion will prove the better part of valour in the present case. Let us pay our score at
once, and get out--if we can," he added under his breath.

The lads rose to their feet and walked, as unconcernedly as they could, toward the counter,
upon which Terry rapped with a coin, to attract the landlord's attention.  But that gentleman
had, for some reason or other, vanished, and, rap as they might, no one put in an appearance;
while all the time the crowd continued steadily to close in on them, with angry looks and threatening
gestures.

"Come away, Terry," whispered Douglas; "we must not stand on ceremony any longer.  We shall
have to make a bolt for it, or we shall not get out at all; put your pistol in a side-pocket,
so that you can get at it easily, and then come along."

Under cover of one of the tables the lads shifted their revolvers from one pocket to the other,
and then began to walk toward the door; but no sooner had they started than, with a hoarse
growl of rage, a score of men, drawing daggers and knives from various portions of their clothing,
dashed at the boys, upsetting chairs and tables as they came, and evidently bent upon taking
their lives, if possible.

As a matter of fact it was only the obstructive presence of the numerous tables and chairs
that saved the two lads from that first wild rush. With all the agility of youth they sprang
back to the corner where they had taken their meal, put their backs against the wall for safety's
sake, and drawing their pistols, presented them at the crowd of furious men, Terry inquiring,
at the same time, in the best Spanish he could muster, the meaning of this murderous assault.

Seeing the muzzles of the deadly revolvers pointed at them, their assailants paused for a few
seconds, while one of the men--a gigantic Chilian with a blanket poncho over his shoulders--took
it upon himself to answer the lad's inquiry.

"Why are we going to kill you, you dogs?" he roared.  "Why?--because you are a brace of Peruvian
spies.  Caramba! we know very well why you have come here; but neither of you shall leave this
place alive.  We have a quick way with people of your stamp in this country."

"But," exclaimed Douglas, at the top of his voice, "you are all making a mistake; we are no
Peruvian spies, but a couple of British sailors, who have left our ship, the Pericles, in order
to enlist in the Chilian navy, and fight against the Peruvians, not for them.  We are merely
waiting for the offices to open, in order to proceed there and give in our names as candidates
for service."

The only reply to this statement was a volley of oaths and mocking laughter, interspersed with
the words "liar," "traitors," and "Kill the Inca dogs"; while, recovering from their momentary
alarm at the sight of the pistols, the crowd again began to surge forward toward the two lads.
The situation was becoming exceedingly critical; therefore, again raising his revolver, Douglas
pointed it straight at the foremost man and shouted, "One step farther and I fire!"

The fellow hesitated for the fraction of a second, then his hand shot forward swiftly as a
flash of lightning, and the knife which it had held, missing Jim's ear by a hair's-breadth,
stuck quivering in the panelling behind him.

With a growl of rage Douglas pulled the trigger of his pistol, firing twice in quick succession,
while, close beside him, Terry's revolver also spoke out, and so close were their foremost
assailants that every bullet took effect, four men plunging heavily forward to the ground,
almost within arm's length of the two boys.  This circumstance, so far from intimidating the
Chilians, seemed but to stimulate their rage, and knives began to flash through the air like
so many silver flying-fish, thrown, too, with such force that had one of them but hit its mark
it would have closed the recipient's earthly career on the spot.

"By the Lord Harry!" ejaculated Terry, firing rapidly into the thick of the crowd, "this is
getting rather too warm to be pleasant; we shall have fired away all the cartridges in our
pistols presently, and they will certainly give us no time to reload.  What is to be our next
move, Jim?"

Douglas, however, had already been glancing hastily about him, in the endeavour to discover
some pathway of escape, and, even as Terry spoke, his eyes lighted upon the door close to which
they had been sitting while they were taking their breakfast.

"Edge along toward the right a little, Terry," he exclaimed; "our only hope of escape is through
that door.  God grant that it may not be locked!"

Meanwhile O'Meara, availing himself of a momentary pause on the part of their assailants, had
contrived to insert a few fresh cartridges in his pistol, and, firing several more shots right
into the "brown," began to edge his way along to the door, in which manoeuvre he was quickly
followed by Douglas.  Then, shooting out his left hand behind him, he felt for the knob, and
turned it, knowing that their lives depended upon whether it was fastened or otherwise.  To
his inexpressible relief, the handle turned, and the door opened under his touch, while, luckily
for the two lads, it opened away from instead of toward them.

Emptying the remaining barrels of their revolvers, the boys at once slipped through, and pushed
the door close behind them, just as a further volley of knives came hurtling through the air,
to stick quivering in the panelling, while, with a hoarse roar of rage, the Chilians surged
forward bent on preventing the escape of the supposed spies.  But by the greatest good luck
there happened to be a lock and a couple of bolts on the farther side of the door, and these
the two lads slipped home in a trice, interposing between themselves and their bloodthirsty
foes a barrier which they hoped would gain them a few minutes' grace.

Once on the right side of the door, they hurriedly reloaded their pistols, and looked round
for an exit from the apartment, while the air resounded with the sound of the blows which thundered
upon the frail woodwork behind them.  Clearly the door would not stand more than a minute or
so, and it was necessary to hasten if they were to escape after all.  But, look as they might,
there seemed to be no means of egress, until Terry suddenly shouted, "That door will be down
in a second, Jim.  We must get behind this tier of casks; they will afford us a certain amount
of shelter, at any rate."

In a moment the boys had slipped behind the stack of barrels, and there, right in front of
them, was the door for which they had been searching.

"Come along, Terry," exclaimed Douglas; "this way for your life!"  And like a flash they darted
through the door, finding themselves in a dimly lighted passage, which looked as though it
led into the back premises of the cafe.  Just as they entered the passage they heard a crashing
and splintering of wood, followed by shouts of rage, and they knew that the frail barrier between
themselves and their pursuers was destroyed.

Down the passage they ran at top speed, round a sharp corner at the bottom, and then emerged
into a large patio or courtyard.  A rapid glance round revealed no exit from the place; and
already they could hear their enemies rushing down the passage behind them.

"Quick!  Quick!" whispered Jim, "we must hide somewhere or we are lost," And he cast his eyes
round for some place which would suit their purpose.

"This way!" he cried to his companion, dashing across the court towards a large corn-bin. 
"This is our only chance!"

Like a flash the two lads raised the lid, clambered inside, and let the covering down just
as the first Chilian emerged into the patio.  They heard their pursuers separate and search
the whole yard, calling to one another at intervals to inquire whether anything had been heard
or seen of the fugitives; but, for some reason or other, it seemed to occur to none of them
to glance inside the corn-bin; the reason probably being that it stood before them so prominently
that they never dreamed that any one could have thought of hiding there.

Suddenly there was a shout from the far corner of the patio, and a voice cried, "This way,
children!  I have found the door through which the spies have fled!"

There was a quick trampling of feet, more savage cries, and then silence.  The Chilians had
evidently gone off on a false scent; and now, if ever, was the moment for Jim and Terry to
effect their escape. Listening intently for a few seconds, Douglas raised the lid of their
hiding-place an inch or so and peered out through the opening thus formed.  There was no one
in sight, but they could hear the savage shouts of the Chilians in the distance as they searched
hither and thither for their prey.

"Now, Terry," whispered Jim, "now is our time.  Out you get quickly, my hearty; we must make
a rush for the passage, through it into the shop, and so out into the street; it is our only
hope.  Are you quite ready?  Yes?  Then here goes!"  And flinging back the cover, the two friends
clambered out, rushed across the patio, up the passage, through the wrecked door, and into
the shop.  To their great relief, the place was absolutely empty.  After a short halt, therefore,
to rearrange and brush their clothing, which had become somewhat disordered, they strolled
casually out of the cafe into the street.

By this time there were many more people about, and mingling with the throng the two boys soon
lost sight of the cafe, and with rapid steps made the best of their way down toward the harbour,
near which were situated the Government Offices.  These were now open, and entering one which
bore a plate with the words "Oficina por empleo en la marina" inscribed thereon, they found
themselves in the presence of Senor Don Guzman Cartador, the Director of the Navy, to whom
they made known their desire to enter the Chilian service.  This gentleman listened courteously
to them, examined them shortly upon their capabilities, and finally gave them a letter of introduction
to Admiral Rebolledo Williams, of the battleship Blanco Encalada, to whom he recommended them
to apply, saying at the same time that he had little doubt they would be successful in obtaining
commissions, as Admiral Williams was very short of efficient officers just then.

Armed with this official's introduction the two lads presented themselves aboard the warship
about mid-day, and were fortunate enough to find Admiral Williams not only disengaged, but
also in a particularly good humour.  He at once granted them an interview; asked them several
questions, as the Naval Director had done; and finally accepted their services, much to the
gratification of the two lads.  He gave Douglas a commission as second lieutenant on board
the flagship, and O'Meara a post as second engineer aboard the same vessel.  He then sent them
ashore to have their commissions signed by Captain Morales, and to procure the necessary uniforms
and outfit, and instructed them to report themselves on board the Blanco Encalada on the 7th
of February, since he, the Admiral, expected orders to sail on or about that date.

The boys left Senor Williams with many expressions of gratitude, and went ashore to provide
themselves with uniform and the necessary kit, an order for the supply of which had been given
them by Williams himself. The tailor promised to have everything ready by the 6th, and for
a wonder he was as good as his word.  On the morning of the 7th, therefore, the two lads in
full uniform, and with their belongings in the boat with them, were rowed off to the Blanco
Encalada, and by mid- day they found themselves duly installed as officers in the Chilian service.

CHAPTER THREE.

THE OCCUPATION OF ANTOFAGASTA.

The month of February in the latitude of Valparaiso corresponds approximately to the month
of August in the northern hemisphere, and it was a beautiful, sunny, and very hot morning when,
on the 7th of that month, the Chilian fleet, consisting of the Blanco Encalada flagship, the
Almirante Cochrane battleship, the corvettes O'Higgins and Chacabuco, with the sloop Esmeralda,
steamed out of harbour, on its way to Antofagasta, the principal seaport of Bolivia.

It may not be amiss to state here briefly the causes of the war that was then impending between
the allied republics of Bolivia and Peru and the republic of Chili.

The desert of Atacama, on the borders of Chili and Bolivia, had been for many years without
an acknowledged owner.  Chili claimed it, so also did Bolivia; but it was not considered by
either claimant to be of much importance, and it was certainly not regarded as worth fighting
for, until it was discovered that it was rich in nitrates and other mineral wealth.  In 1866
the two republics, being allied in war against Spain, fixed by treaty the 24th parallel of
south latitude as the future boundary between them; and Bolivia agreed that Chilian citizens
who were already landowners in the region between 23° and 24° south should be allowed to mine
and to export the produce without tax or other hindrance.  To facilitate this arrangement,
Chili was permitted to maintain a representative in the Custom House at Antofagasta.  The nitrate
business of those days was chiefly in the hands of a Company, the heads of which were the British
house of Gibbs, a Chilian named Edwards, and the Chilian Government.  On February 23, 1878,
Bolivia saw fit to impose a tax of 10 centavos (4½ pence) per quintal (152 pounds) on all nitrates.
Chili remonstrated; but Bolivia insisted, and declared, in addition, that the tax was meant
to be retrospective, and that unless all dues were paid before February 14, 1879, the nitrates
in the hands of the exporters would be seized and sold by auction.  As the day which had been
fixed for the seizure drew near, a Chilian squadron, under Rear-Admiral Rebolledo Williams,
was got ready for the purpose of seizing Antofagasta itself.  It was this fleet which, on the
morning of February 7, 1879, steamed out from Valparaiso, with Jim and Terry, as Chilian officers,
on board the Blanco Encalada, the flagship of the squadron.

As the fleet weighed anchor and stood out to sea the bells pealed from every steeple in the
town, while the guns in the hastily improvised fortifications above the town thundered out
a farewell salute to the ships which were going to vindicate the honour of Chili, and the action
of which was tantamount to a declaration of war.  As each warship rounded the point she returned
the salute with all her starboard broadside guns, while the ensigns at the mizzen-gaff were
dipped thrice in jubilant farewell.

Although war had not as yet actually been declared against Peru, the Chilian Government had
very strong reason to suspect the existence of a secret treaty between that country and Bolivia;
and as Peru was the possessor of a navy of considerable strength it behoved Admiral Williams
to be exceedingly careful that he did not run into any ambush of Peruvian ships; a very sharp
look-out was therefore kept incessantly during the six days which the fleet took to steam from
Valparaiso to Antofagasta.  There was no Bolivian navy, if we except a few steam- launches
and old spar-torpedo-boats; there was nothing, therefore, to fear in that direction; but, as
the Chilians had not as yet had time to advance their forces overland up the coast, a contingent
of five hundred regulars was put on board the ships to effect the occupation of Antofagasta;
two hundred and fifty being put on board at Valparaiso, while Admiral Williams had been instructed
to call in at Caldera Bay, in order to embark the remainder.

Steaming at the rate of the slowest ship in his squadron--the sloop Esmeralda, which was incapable
of a speed of more than four or five knots--the Admiral arrived in Caldera Bay on the evening
of the 9th of February; and as it was too late to think of embarking the troops that night,
he anchored his ships, in column of line ahead, at a distance of about half a mile from the
shore, and on a course which stretched across the bay from the signal station to the little
village of Calderillo.

Nothing had thus far been seen of the Peruvian squadron, and as Bolivia had, as stated above,
no navy worthy of the name, and the fleet was, moreover, still in Chilian waters, Admiral Williams
did not consider it necessary to establish a patrol of picket-boats on watch round the ships,
as he certainly would have done had he been lying before a hostile port.  It was this oversight,
coupled with the fact that Williams regarded the Bolivian sea strength as beneath his notice,
that very nearly led to a frightful disaster for the Chilians at the very outset of the war.

On this particular night Douglas was, as it happened, the officer of the watch, and Terry,
who was off duty, was sharing the vigil with his friend, walking to and fro upon the Blanco
Encalada's quarter-deck and listening to the sounds which were wafted across the water both
from the town of Caldera and from the neighbouring ships, all of which were brilliantly lighted
up.  There was a sailor's "sing-song" in progress aboard the corvette Chacabuco, the second
ship away from the Blanco Encalada, and both lads listened with amusement to the rollicking
sounds which proceeded from that direction.  There was no moon, but the sky was spangled with
brilliant stars, which shed a faint, silvery lustre over the sea and the distant summits of
the Andes, enwrapping everything in a soft luminous haze which could scarcely be dignified
with the name of light.

The two lads paced to and fro, eagerly longing for the time when Douglas should be relieved
from duty, for both were very tired; but Terry did not feel inclined to leave his friend to
continue his watch by himself. As the time passed on, the lights of the squadron disappeared,
one by one, until at length the only lights which showed were the riding lights, two of which
were suspended on every ship, one at the bow and one at the stern.  The sounds on board the
ships had died away completely, and it was only occasionally that the shouts of a party of
revellers were heard from the shore.

It was shortly after one o'clock in the morning when Terry, who was still keeping his friend
company, walked to the ship's rail and stood there in a listening attitude; then he raised
his voice slightly and called Douglas to his side.

"Listen carefully for a moment, old fellow," he said; "cannot you hear something away out there
on our port bow?"

Jim listened, and presently his strained senses caught a faint sound like the throbbing of
a tiny engine somewhere away in the darkness.

"Yes," he whispered, "I certainly can hear something.  To me it sounds as though there is a
small steam-launch somewhere out there; but I certainly cannot see anything of her.  What can
a launch possibly be doing out there, at this time of the morning?"

"Well," replied his chum, "if this were not a Chilian port I should be inclined to suspect
something in the nature of a night-attack; but under the circumstances I don't quite see from
what quarter such an attack could come.  The Peruvian fleet can hardly have come upon us unawares,
for we should surely have seen some sign of them; they would hardly steam without showing any
lights at all.  Besides, this sound--which is certainly nearing us, by the way--seems to me
more like-- Hallo! did you see that, Douglas?  By Jove, it strikes me that there is something
more in this than meets the eye."

"Yes," answered Jim, "I distinctly caught sight of a flicker of flame. It appeared to me as
though somebody had struck a match for some purpose or other, and had hurriedly extinguished
it.  I wonder what is happening, away over there.  There is certainly something going on that
is not quite as it should be, I am convinced."

During this brief interchange of remarks the noise of the churning little propeller had been
drawing nearer; and, after listening intently for a few seconds longer, Douglas whispered hurriedly
to his chum, "Slip below quickly, Terry, and bring me up my night-glass; I believe there is
something radically wrong about this business."

In a moment O'Meara was back on deck, bearing the telescope, which Douglas hastily snatched
from him and brought to bear on the spot from whence the sound proceeded.  He had been glancing
through it for only about half a minute when he turned excitedly to Terry and gasped out, "Rouse
the ship, man--and quickly, too; there is a launch approaching, and she carries a spar-torpedo;
she is making straight for us, and evidently means to torpedo the flagship!"

Like a flash Terry disappeared to rouse the crew, while Douglas continued to watch the approach
of the launch, in a perfect agony of apprehension.  The little craft was very close indeed
now, and, steaming at the rate of some nine knots, she would be alongside the Blanco Encalada
in a couple of minutes; and once alongside the battleship, nothing could save the latter from
destruction.

But anxiety lent wings to Terry's feet, and in a few seconds the men made their appearance
on deck, in all stages of undress, for they fully appreciated the dangers of the situation
and had not waited to clothe themselves.  Their officers also had dashed up from below, and
hurried words of command flew from one quarter of the ship to another.  Admiral Williams himself
rushed up from below, upon the alarm being given, and he now instructed the ship's bugler to
sound the alarm, and to sound it with all his strength, while at the same time a blank charge
was fired as a warning to the other ships to be on the alert.  Immediately afterward a bugle
was heard shrilling from the Almirante Cochrane, and this was taken up by every ship in the
squadron, for the whole fleet was now thoroughly alarmed and on the alert.

For a few moments a state nearly approaching to panic reigned aboard the flagship; but the
men were quickly at their quarters, and every gun in the ship was promptly trained upon the
position indicated by Douglas. It was too dark to enable the gunners to aim with precision,
but the sound guided them to some extent, and suddenly a perfect volcano of machine-gun fire
broke out on board the Blanco Encalada, followed by a hoarse scream of agony from the torpedo-launch.
An iron bucket was partly filled with paraffin and this was lighted as a flare, throwing a
lurid glare over the sea and disclosing plainly to view a couple of rapidly approaching launches,
each of which carried a spar over her bows, from which a torpedo was suspended, the launches
heading directly for the Blanco Encalada.  But upon the nearest launch the effect of the flagship's
fire was terrible.  The helmsman had been cut nearly to pieces by the hail of bullets, and
he now hung dead over the tiller of the little steamer, which was consequently yawing wildly
about.  The remainder of her crew were in the well abaft the boiler, some lying huddled up
on the floor, while others hung loosely, like half-empty sacks, over the launch's bulwarks,
their arms trailing in the water. Indeed it appeared as though the Blanco Encalada, by a lucky
fluke, had concentrated her whole fire upon that one devoted craft.  For a moment it appeared
as though the little steamer, with her crew of dead, would still effect her purpose, for the
torpedo was still intact at the end of its spar, and the launch was heading straight for the
battleship; but just at the last moment the corpse of the helmsman was jerked from the tiller
by the motion of the sea, and the launch's head immediately fell off a point or two.  She rushed
past the Blanco Encalada's bows, missing them by no more than a few feet, and a few minutes
later a deafening report from the shore told those on board the flagship that the torpedo-launch
had rushed at full speed upon the rocks, thus exploding her torpedo and blowing herself to pieces.

The second launch, which had been steaming about a hundred yards astern of her consort, had
miraculously escaped that whirlwind of shot, and now, seeing the fate of her consort, she described
a wide circle, and headed away to the north-west, out of the bay, at full speed.  In a few
minutes she would be beyond the circle of light thrown by the flagship's brazier of fire, and
would be in safety; but she was not to escape so easily.  The Blanco Encalada's gunners carefully
laid their machine- guns on the craft, and opened a furious fire upon her.  The rattle of the
Nordenfeldts sounded like a continuous roar of thunder, and the stream of fire from their muzzles
itself illuminated the darkness of the night with a fitful glare.

The gunners got the range almost immediately, and those on board the flagship could see that
the water was lashed into foam round the launch by the pelting rain of missiles.  There was
no escape from that iron hail, not even for those desperate members of the crew who dived overboard,
for the men of the Blanco made a target of every face that appeared upon the surface of the water.

Then the end came, suddenly and dreadfully.  A bullet must have passed in advance of the launch
and struck the torpedo itself, for the onlookers saw a dazzling burst of whitish-blue flame,
which was followed by a deafening, stunning explosion, and the launch seemed to disappear,
as if by magic, in a tornado of flame, for not even a fragment of her appeared on the water
afterwards.  The roar of the machine-guns at once ceased, and every man on board the ship wiped
away the cold sweat of fear which had burst out on his forehead at the prospect of being torpedoed;
for there is no arm in the naval service so dreaded by the sailor.

Tranquillity was now gradually restored, and half an hour later peace once more reigned; but
not a single man in the whole squadron could bring himself to go below again until day dawned.
On every ship huge fires were lighted, and boats were sent to patrol the fleet in order to
prevent a repetition of the occurrence; but it was not until daylight revealed a sea empty
of craft save those of the Chilians that the fearful strain of suspense was relaxed.

Admiral Williams personally thanked Douglas and O'Meara for their quick action, which had undoubtedly
saved the flagship, and very probably some of the other vessels of the squadron.  He also questioned
the lads closely, in order to ascertain whether they had heard or seen anything which would
furnish a clue to the nationality of the occupants of the launches, but they could tell him
nothing; and the Admiral was at length driven to the conclusion that his assailants must have
come down the coast from Antofagasta, and must have consisted of a couple of the ancient torpedo-launches
which the Bolivians were known to possess, but which Williams had left out of his calculations
as being too unimportant to be taken into consideration.  How dearly this oversight might have
cost him has already been seen.

The following, or rather, the same morning, the ships' boats were lowered, and, assisted by
flat-bottomed craft from the shore, began the work of embarking the remainder of the troops.
It continued during the whole morning, and by mid-day the balance of the military contingent
was distributed among the ships, which then got up their anchors and turned their bows to the
northward once more, still under easy steam for the benefit of the old and rotten Esmeralda,
two of whose boilers were so eaten away by rust as to be useless.  A particularly keen look-out
for hostile ships was kept, in view of the alarming incident in Caldera Bay, but nothing of
a suspicious character was sighted, and on the evening of the 13th of February the fleet anchored
before the town of Antofagasta, the principal seaport of Bolivia, lying in a half-circle at
a distance of about a mile and a half from the shore.

The obnoxious tax was to come into force on the following day, if Bolivia adhered to her original
resolution; and Admiral Williams had orders that, should such prove to be the case, he was
to seize the Custom House, invest the town, and in the event of resistance being offered, to
bombard it.  Chili did not intend to submit tamely to the high-handed action of Bolivia, which
constituted a serious and intolerable infraction of treaty.

Immediately the squadron came to an anchor, therefore, every gun was trained upon the town,
in readiness for action, should such become necessary; and early on the following morning Admiral
Williams had his gig piped away, and, accompanied by his flag-captain, he was pulled ashore
to ascertain the intentions of the Bolivian authorities, and to warn all the Chilian inhabitants
of the place that it would be bombarded should the President of the Republic not prove amenable
to reason, so that they might leave the town, with their belongings, before his ships opened fire.

The Admiral was ashore until about three o'clock in the afternoon; and when he returned to
the Blanco Encalada it soon became known that the Bolivians had refused to relinquish their
demands, and that therefore Antofagasta was to be invested.  He believed, however, that it
would not be necessary to bombard the town, as he thought it was hardly likely that the inhabitants
would be so unwise as to offer armed resistance to the landing of the Chilian troops.  The
soldiers were therefore to be landed at once under cover of the guns of the squadron, while
a naval force, composed of men from the Blanco Encalada and the Almirante Cochrane, were at
the same time instructed to land at the northern part of the seaport and seize the Custom House.

The Chilian troops, under Colonel Sotomayor, were therefore put into boats belonging to the
warships, which were then taken in tow by the small steam craft and conveyed to the wharves
at the south end of the town, their landing being unopposed, except for a few stray shots which
were fired from the cover of some closed shops, and which a few volleys from the soldiers promptly
checked.  Then the ships' boats being once more available, the task of seizing the Custom House
was proceeded with; and it was anticipated that here, if anywhere, a determined resistance
would be made.  A council of captains was called on board the Blanco Encalada, and a plan of
campaign resolved upon.  It was decided that Captain Latorre, of the Almirante Cochrane, should
lead the naval detachment, which was to be drawn from all the ships of the squadron, in proportion
to the complement of their crews; and Douglas was the officer selected to take charge of the
party from the Blanco Encalada, much to his delight, the selection being probably due to a
desire on Admiral Williams's part to recompense the lad in some measure for the promptitude
and coolness which he had displayed in saving the flagship in Caldera Bay.

Jim joyously took leave of his friend Terry--who, as he belonged to the engine-room staff,
could not expect to be sent on shore expeditions-- adjusted the sword at his side, ran down
the side-ladder, and took his seat in the stern-sheets of the steam-launch which, with a whaleboat
which it was to tow, carried the detachment of men from the Blanco Encalada.  The boats of
the other vessels were by this time ready; and, headed by the launch of the Almirante Cochrane,
carrying Captain Latorre, the leader of the expedition, the little flotilla swept away from
the ships toward the north end of the town, vociferously cheered as they went by the remainder
of the squadron.

The distance to the Custom House was about two miles; and by the time that they had covered
half of it, it was seen that a considerable amount of activity was being manifested ashore;
in fact it looked as though here, at any rate, the Bolivians had fully determined to offer
resistance.

Jim remarked on the circumstance to Lieutenant Alcerrerez, who was sitting next to him; and
while he was speaking, Captain Latorre hailed the boats to slow up and come alongside, in order
to receive further instructions.  These were soon given, and were to the effect that the launches
of the flagship and of the Almirante Cochrane were to be the leading boats in a formation of
double column of line ahead, in which order they were to attack.  This matter having been arranged,
all went ahead again at full speed, while the men eased the cutlasses in their sheaths and
inspected the cartridges in their rifles, in readiness for the anticipated encounter.

Suddenly, when the boats were within a couple of hundred yards of the mole leading down from
the Custom House, a blaze of fire leapt from the loopholed walls of the buildings, and bullets
flew round the little flotilla in a perfect hailstorm.  The Chilian ensign in the stern of
Douglas's launch was literally ripped from its staff, proving that, had the Bolivians but depressed
their rifle muzzles a trifle more, every man in the steamer's well would have been hit by the
leaden shower. Lieutenant Alcerrerez, who was sitting next to Douglas, emitted a curious little
cough, turned half round, and fell forward over the lad's knees, while several men in the launch
sprang convulsively to their feet, only to drop down again in a limp, motionless heap, or to
fall over the low gunwales in the violence of their death-struggles.  Jim shuddered as he thought
of the fate of poor Lieutenant Alcerrerez, but he pulled himself together and laid the poor
shot-pierced body gently down on the boat's floor grating, thereby saving his own life; for
even as he stooped, another shower of rifle-bullets hurtled into the launch, killing several
more men, and piercing the boat herself in six places below the water-line, so that she began
to take in water at an alarming rate.

Some of the other craft had, however, come off still worse than the Blanco Encalada's launch;
for the casualties were even heavier in the Almirante Cochrane's boats, while a shot had pierced
the boiler of the launch belonging to the O'Higgins, which immediately blew up with disastrous
results, killing and wounding nearly the whole of her crew.

The flotilla was by this time, however, within the shelter of the mole; and a minute later
the boats rushed alongside at full speed, Jim leaping ashore at the same time as Captain Latorre,
who, sword in hand, formed his men quickly up, shouting, "Forward, my children; you have your
comrades to avenge!"  And away raced the boat's crew along the pier toward the Custom House,
receiving, as they did so, another terrible volley from the defenders.  The Chilians' blood
was up, however, and they did not even pause to succour their wounded, but dashed forward,
holding their fire in reserve, and with their bayonets fixed.

Before the Bolivians could fire again, the Chilians had reached the building, and were thus
protected from the fire of its occupants, as the loopholes were too small to allow of their
rifles being depressed to any great extent.

"Bring that bag of powder here!" roared Latorre at the top of his voice as two men came up
staggering under its weight.  The petard was promptly laid against the door; a train was led
close alongside the wall to the corner of the house, round which the seamen also sheltered
themselves; a match was put to it; there was a loud report and a stunning concussion, followed
by the sound of rending timber; and the landing party dashed forward again, round the angle
of the building, and in through the breach formed by the explosion.  As they entered the house
there was a shout of execration and defiance from the floor above, and the defenders began
to swarm down the stairs to repulse their enemies.

But, hampered as they were by lack of room to move freely, they could do nothing.  They had
foolishly left no force on the ground-floor, but had all gone to the first storey, in order
to be the better able to fire on their foes; and this oversight now cost them very dear.  The
Bolivians got jammed into an inextricable mass, in their efforts to descend the stairs at the
same time; and, while thus helpless, they were mercilessly cut down and bayoneted by the infuriated
Chilians.

In a few minutes the bloody work was over; the corpses on the stairs were pulled away, and
the assailants rushed upstairs to complete their work.  But the Bolivians had now no stomach
for further fight, and they threw down their arms, crying for mercy.  Captain Latorre therefore
had them all disarmed and bound securely, after which he went up on to the roof of the building
and hauled down the Bolivian flag, hoisting the Chilian ensign in its place.  He then signalled
to Admiral Williams: "Custom House taken, with loss of nineteen killed and twenty-three wounded."

Antofagasta was in the hands of the Chilians!

CHAPTER FOUR.

THE CHILIANS BOMBARD IQUIQUE.

Shortly after the occupation of Antofagasta, a Chilian force under Colonel Sotomayor--who was
in command of the troops landed from the squadron--advanced to Caracoles, to protect the mines
there; and on March 23, 1879, defeated at Calama a body of Bolivians under Dr Ladislas Cabrera,
who was compelled to retire, with a loss of twenty killed and wounded, and thirty prisoners.
The losses of the Chilians numbered only twelve.

Peru thereupon made certain precautionary preparations, and sent envoys to both Chili and Bolivia;
although, as a matter of fact, she had already mobilised her navy, and was quite prepared to
take the offensive at any moment.  Indeed it was perfectly well known in Chilian official circles
that the Peruvian fleet was actually at this time at sea, seeking, if possible, to deal her
opponent a crippling blow even before war had been formally declared.

Chili thereupon demanded the reasons for her preparations, as indeed she was fully entitled
to do, and required that they should cease.  Then, receiving no satisfactory reply, she announced
her knowledge of a secret treaty, dated the 6th of February 1873, between Bolivia and Peru,
and at once declared war against the latter as well as the former.

Immediately following this, Chili increased her navy by repurchasing the corvette Abtao--a
sister ship to the famous Alabama of American Civil War times--built in 1864, of 1050 tons
displacement, 300 horse- power, and with a nominal sea-speed of 6 knots.  This ship was armed
with three 150-pounder muzzle-loading guns and three 30-pounder muzzle- loaders; and she played
almost as important a part in the war between Chili and Peru as did the Alabama in the American
Civil War.

Chili also bought from the Pacific Steam Navigation Company the screw steamer Amazonas, for
use as a transport; and by chartering the Rimac, Itata, Lamar, Loa, and Limari from the Chilian
Steam Navigation Company, and the Mathias Cousino and other steamers from the Cousino estate,
she strengthened the effectiveness of her fleet to a very great extent.  All the upper spars
of these craft were sent ashore, and their lower yards, where they were retained to serve as
derricks, were cock-billed.  The head-booms were unrigged, and all but the standing bowsprits
of the wooden vessels were landed.

The senior Peruvian naval officer afloat was at this time Captain Don Miguel Grau, a native
of Piura, and a man of about forty-five years of age.  He is spoken of as "an officer of the
highest capacity and bravery, remarkably quiet and unassuming, and an excellent seaman.  His
people worshipped him, and all who knew him honoured him."  In 1868 he had been given command
of the Huascar, an ironclad monitor of 1130 tons displacement, 1200 horse-power, and with a
nominal sea-speed of 11 knots.  She was armed with two 10-inch 21-ton muzzle-loading guns (both
in the same turret), two 40-pounder muzzle-loaders, one 12-pounder muzzle-loader, and one Gatling
gun.  This ship distinguished herself more than any other of the Peruvian fleet; and in her
subsequent bloody battle with the Chilian warships, Blanco Encalada and Almirante Cochrane,
in which her gallant commander lost his life, she behaved herself with such gallantry that
her name will go down to history as one of the epoch-making ships of the world.

From 1873 to 1879 Admiral Grau was a member of the Peruvian Congress for Paita, but on the
outbreak of the war he successfully applied to be reinstated in his former command of the Huascar.
By him the Peruvian squadron was arranged as follows: The first division, under Admiral Grau
himself, consisted of the Huascar; Independencia, armoured frigate; and the Oroya, a paddle-transport
of 1597 tons.  The second division was placed under the orders of Captain Carillo, and consisted
of the monitors Manco Capac and Atahualpa, bought from the United States, each of 2100 tons;
and the Chalaco, a transport of 1000 tons displacement.  The third division, under Captain
Garcia y Garcia, comprised the Union, a wooden corvette of 1150 tons, and a very famous ship;
the Pilcomayo, gunboat; and the Limena, a paddle-transport.

Such was the Peruvian navy at the commencement of the war; and the whole fleet, in three divisions,
as above, was under the command of Admiral Grau.

The port of Antofagasta having been occupied by Chilian troops, the squadron under Admiral
Williams left the place and commenced a patrol of the coast, with a view to enforcing a blockade.
On the 5th of April the fleet appeared off Iquique, in Peru, and the admiral announced that
a blockade of that port would begin on the 15th of April following, thus allowing ten days
for the Chilian inhabitants of the place to leave and carry with them all their belongings.

Up to this time no naval action had been fought at sea; and it was, even yet, a moot point
whether Peru would not "climb down," and back out of her alliance with Bolivia.  But, all unknown
to the Chilians, the Peruvian warships Union and Pilcomayo were cruising up and down the coast
for the purpose of snapping up any small Chilian craft that they might happen to sight, and
to do as much damage to the Chilians as they possibly could.

Now, it happened that, shortly after the Chilian squadron had invested Antofagasta, the small
corvette Magellanes arrived at Valparaiso, having returned from police duty in Tierra del Fuego.
She was thereupon immediately ordered by the Chilian authorities to proceed northward and join
Admiral Williams's fleet.  But on her way, while off the mouth of the river Loa, she fell in
with the Peruvian ships Union and Pilcomayo, with which she fought a running action for over
two hours, when, owing to her superior speed, she effected her escape.  The carnage on both
sides was terrible, and the Union, although much the larger ship, was so seriously damaged
that she was obliged to return to Callao, the principal seaport of Peru, in order to be drydocked
and repaired. The Magellanes then fell in with the main Chilian squadron, off Iquique, and
made her report of the occurrence.

It was at first intended that Iquique should merely be bombarded; but to render the attendant
conditions as stringent as possible, Admiral Williams strictly forbade the condensation of
fresh water on shore, a prohibition that would naturally cause very great inconvenience to
the inhabitants, since fresh water, either from springs, wells, or streams, was almost unobtainable
in the town.  On several occasions, however, smoke was observed to be rising from the spot
where the condensing apparatus was located, indicating an apparent disposition on the part
of the inhabitants to disregard the prohibition; and this so incensed the Chilian admiral that
he determined to send Douglas on shore with a message to the effect that if the offence were
persisted in, he would be compelled to bombard.

The steam-launch was accordingly lowered away from the Blanco Encalada, and manned; and presently
Jim, in full uniform, took his seat in the stern-sheets of the craft, which immediately steamed
away to carry the admiral's protest and message to the Intendente of Iquique.

In about half an hour the launch ran alongside the quay at Iquique, and Jim sprang ashore,
declining the offer of the coxswain to accompany him and show him the way to the intendente's
quarters.

Jim, whose knowledge of Spanish was by this time nearly perfect, made inquiries at the pier
for the office of the intendente, and a man, in a uniform with which the lad was not acquainted,
immediately offered to conduct him thither.  Jim, suspecting no treachery, unhesitatingly accepted
this individual's services, and the pair, entering into an animated conversation, left the
pier and turned their steps townward.

For some distance their way led along a sandy road, paved here and there with cobblestones,
and fronted by buildings which seemed to be hotels or inns of the cheaper kind, probably intended
for the accommodation of seamen from foreign ships which used the port.  They followed this
road, which ran along the sea-front, for about a mile and a half; and Jim was just about to
pass some comment on the distance when his guide turned to the right and plunged into a narrow
and gloomy side-street, the appearance of which filled Douglas with aversion, although at that
time no suspicion of treachery entered his mind.  He soon noticed, however, that his guide,
whose name, it transpired, was Manuel Lopes, was taking him up one narrow street and down another
in a most extraordinary fashion, and that they seemed to be getting into a particularly low
quarter of the town.

Jim had just made up his mind to question Lopes as to whether he was quite sure of the way,
when the latter stopped before a large white- painted building with green shutters, and led
his companion in through a high and wide archway into a kind of courtyard, the like of which
is nearly always to be found in large houses in both Old and New Spain.

"This looks as though it might be the residence of some official or other," mused Jim; "but
what an extraordinary quarter of the town the governor seems to have selected for his dwelling!
However, I suppose he knows his own business best, and--"

"Will you be pleased to follow me, senor?" here broke in the guide Lopes, bowing in an obsequious
manner, and leading the way across the patio to where a heavy door gave entrance into a part
of the building which overlooked the courtyard.

Jim tucked his sword under his arm and followed the fellow into a room which seemed, to him
coming out of the brilliant sunlight, to be shrouded in darkness.

"Have the goodness to take a chair, senor," smiled Lopes, pushing one of those articles forward
for Jim, "while I go and ascertain whether His Excellency will see you."

Jim accepted the proffered chair but, somewhat nettled by a certain curious change in the man's
voice, remarked: "But, senor, I have come ashore expressly to see the intendente; and see him
I must; my orders are imperative!"

"Oh, I assure you there will be no difficulty whatever on that score," replied Lopes.  "Kindly
excuse me for a few minutes while I announce your arrival."

Jim bowed; and his guide walked quickly out of the room, slamming the heavy door somewhat sharply
behind him.  Douglas heard him pause for a few seconds, and then step sharply across the stone-flagged
patio, from the other side of which he fancied he heard the sound of a low laugh and some words
spoken in an undertone.  But he paid no particular attention to the matter and, in order to
pass the time, rose from his seat and began to move round the room.  The apartment was so extremely
dark, however, that he presently walked over to the window, in order to pull aside the curtains
which he supposed, were excluding the light.

Greatly to his surprise, however, he found that there were no curtains before the window, but
that the gloom was caused by the fact that a kind of iron shutter was securely fastened across
the outside.  This was indeed a curious sort of waiting room, and--

A sudden thought flashed across Jim's mind, and he darted quickly to the door and turned the
handle, pulling it toward him as he did so.

It was as he had surmised; the door had been locked or bolted on the outside; and he knew now
why Lopes had paused those few seconds before crossing the patio.  Jim was a prisoner, and
he had walked into the trap with his eyes open.  Oh! what a fool he had been!  He might have
known that a person of importance such as the intendente of Iquique would not have had his
residence among the slums of the city.  But what on earth, he wondered, had been their object
in making a prisoner of him?  How came it about that he had been expected, and that a man had
been posted at the pier, ready to receive him and lead him into this ambush?

Then he suddenly remembered the dispatches he carried from the Admiral; and he realised that
a person on shore with a telescope could have seen him put off from the flagship, and have
observed his progress the whole way from her to the quay.  What, too, more natural than that
the Peruvians should be anxious to get a Chilian officer into their hands, especially a flag-officer,
who would be almost certain to have a very considerable knowledge of the Chilian admiral's
plans?  There were many ways by which that information could be extracted by unscrupulous and
desperate men, and Jim shuddered as he realised the danger in which he stood.  The first thing
that he now did was to take the dispatches from his inner breast pocket, and secrete them,
as well as he could under the circumstances, next his skin, resolving at the same time that
he would give up his life rather than part with them, or disclose to the Peruvians any of the
admiral's plans.

The only weapon which Jim had brought ashore was, of course, his dress sword; but he resolved
that he would make some use of that before they should place him in any closer confinement,
or lay hands on his papers.

The next thing to be done was to examine the room, to see whether any means of escape presented
itself; and in the first place he scrutinised the window which was secured with the iron shutters
outside.  But a very few seconds sufficed to show him that there was no possibility of getting
out by that way, and he looked round for a second door to the apartment.  The walls were, however,
lined with massive bookshelves, and there was no trace of any door save that by which he had
entered. Strangely enough, there was not even so much as a fireplace to the room; and after
half an hour's careful search Douglas was reluctantly compelled to acknowledge that he was
helpless to do anything further at present, and that he would have to await developments before
taking any action.

He therefore made himself as comfortable as possible in an easy-chair, keeping his ears open
at the same time, so that he might have due warning of the approach of an enemy.  The house
was so silent that, so far as any sound was concerned, it might have been uninhabited.  Douglas
had been waiting for half an hour, when he discovered that he was becoming exceedingly drowsy,
and that the air of the room seemed not only to be unaccountably close but also to have a rather
queer new odour in it.  Jim yawned portentously several times, and at length moved over to
the window to try whether the air would be any fresher there, for he put down its oppressiveness
to the fact that there was no chimney in the room.  But, so far as he could ascertain, the
window seemed to be hermetically sealed; and upon inspection he found that the glass in it
was so abnormally thick that to break it would be practically an impossibility.

Douglas now began to find that his breathing was becoming distinctly difficult and, seized
with a vague sense of new danger, he ran to the door and hammered vigorously upon it, shouting
at the same time for some one to come and release him.  But his blows and shouts only echoed
emptily round the patio, and not a soul put in an appearance.  He felt as though all the strength
were going out of his limbs, and he presently staggered to a sofa, upon which he flung himself,
powerless to stand upon his feet any longer.  Strange visions began to float before him, and
curious fancies flitted through his brain, which felt as though some one had bound an iron
strap round it and was gradually increasing the pressure until it seemed as though his head
must split asunder.

How much longer would it be, he wondered dully, before the coxswain in charge of the Blanco
Encalada's steam-launch became anxious about his long absence, and instituted inquiries, or
returned to the flagship with the news?  Admiral Williams was certainly not the man to allow
to pass unchallenged such a gross violation of International Law as the seizure and imprisonment
of a properly accredited envoy; but then, the people who had been guilty of this outrage had
doubtless acted unofficially, and the intendente would consequently deny all knowledge of the
business.  Surely, though--

But by this time Jim's thoughts had become more and more confused, and his brain was refusing
to act coherently.  Flashes of lurid light passed before his eyes, and the horrible feeling
of suffocation became ever more and more acute.  Finally, with what he fancied was a shout
for assistance, but it was, in reality, only a weak whisper, Jim lost consciousness altogether,
and rolled from his couch on to the floor, where he lay like a log, breathing stertorously.

Almost at the same moment a section of the book-case surrounding the room moved inward, apparently
of its own volition, and two men, one of whom was the man Lopes, crept cautiously into the
apartment.  Hastily seizing Jim's inanimate body by the arms and legs, they dragged him out
of the room, carried him down a long narrow passage and, opening the door of another room,
took him inside and placed him on a bed which it contained.

"What a time the youngster took to go off, Manuel!" said the second fellow, addressing Lopes
while he industriously searched Jim's pockets. "I hope we have not given him an overdose, and
killed him; for I expect the information that we shall extract from him will be worth a great
deal more than that contained in the papers which he is sure to carry. By the way, I wonder
where they can be?  They are certainly not in his pockets.  You are certain you have not made
a mistake, amigo mio, and got hold of the wrong man?"

"Carrajo! no," exclaimed Lopes testily.  "This is the fellow, without doubt; I watched him
all the way from the ship.  Here, lend me your knife, and I will rip up his clothes; he is
certain to have suspected treachery after I locked him in, and will have secreted the documents
somewhere.  Ah! here they are.  Now, read them out to me, Carlos, while I try to bring the
hijo round."

There was silence for a few minutes, broken only by the rustle of paper; then, with an oath,
the man called Carlos dashed the packet down, saying, in a voice hoarse with excitement and
rage: "Carramba, Lopes you are a fool! you have made a mistake somewhere.  This is not the
man at all!  I suspected as much when I saw that it was only a boy that you had captured. 
These papers are simply a notification from the admiral of the Chilians that the condensation
of water is to cease!  While we have been wasting time here the other fellow will have come
ashore and returned again, with the papers still in his possession!  Oh!  Lopes, you are a
mule, cabeza de porco!  All our trouble has been in vain."

"Softly, softly, my friend," replied Manuel.  "Even if we have, as you say, secured the wrong
messenger, all our trouble will not have been useless.  You may have observed, caro mio, that
this is a flag- officer, and he will be certain to have knowledge of a great many of Rebolledo
Williams's plans.  Very well; when he recovers we will take measures to induce him--ha! ha!--to
tell us all he knows.  After the attention of an hour or so which we will give him, and with
the assistance of certain little instruments which we possess, we will get out of him all the
information he has.  It is wonderful," he went on musingly, "how communicative a man will become--under
certain circumstances."

The man Carlos looked at his fellow-scoundrel for a few moments, and then broke out into a
hoarse chuckle.

"All right, querido; I understand," he laughed.  "We will remove him, however, for the present,
to less comfortable quarters, as he seems to be on the point of recovery.  Lift up his feet,
mi amigo, while I take his arms as before."  Suiting the action to the word, the two men seized
Jim's body and carried it away down another passage, until they came to a flight of stone stairs,
down which they went into the very bowels of the earth, as it seemed.  Presently they encountered
a massive stone door which, on being opened, disclosed a damp and unspeakably filthy cell.
Into this they tossed the unfortunate officer, and, without caring, apparently, whether they
broke every bone in his body or not, kicked him unmercifully into the centre of the dungeon,
and then turned and left him.

Although the two scoundrels had been under the impression that Jim Douglas was on the point
of recovery from unconsciousness when they thus callously tossed him into the cell, they were
mistaken; for they found, upon revisiting him several hours later, that he was still in a state
of insensibility.  The two rascals then became not a little alarmed for the success of their
scheme, and they at once did all in their power to revive their victim, with the result that,
late that same evening, he recovered his senses, although he was much too dazed to answer the
questions which they tried to put to him.  The men therefore gave up their attempt for that
night, and left Jim in peace, handing him a little bread and water, and promising themselves
that they would return early the next morning.

Douglas recovered his faculties soon after Carlos and Lopes had left him, and while eating
his frugal meal tried to unravel the mystery of his capture, and to calculate how long it would
probably be before Admiral Williams should take any steps to find him.  He was, however, still
very dull and heavy, and presently dropped into a deep sleep, from which he was awakened, just
as dawn was breaking, by the entrance of his captors.  They immediately began to interrogate
him about the number of men in the fleet, the condition of the ships, the number of their guns,
and, above all, as to the plans which Admiral Williams had formed for the forthcoming attack
on Peruvian ports.

Jim, of course, firmly refused to give them any information whatever upon the matters in question,
but loudly denounced the way in which he had been treated, and demanded to be set at liberty
immediately.  Carlos and his accomplice merely laughed, and Lopes remarked: "So you refuse
to tell us anything, do you, my young cockerel?  Well, we shall see, we shall see.  I will
wager that you change your mind within the next half- hour; what say you, Carlos, eh?  Now,
once more will you tell me what--"

"No!" roared Douglas, in a fit of exasperation, "I will tell you nothing! and you may do what
you please, I will still keep silent.  My captain will know how to avenge me if you offer me
any injury."

"Hark how loudly it crows, Manuel," laughed Carlos, showing all his teeth.  "However, I think
we had better not waste any more time; bring in the playthings, Lopes, my brave."

The latter went out of the cell, and presently returned, carrying an iron brazier filled with
glowing charcoal, and bearing under his left arm a cloth which, when unrolled, disclosed to
Jim's horrified gaze a glittering array of instruments, the suggestiveness of the shapes of
which left little doubt as to what was their ghastly use.  The poor lad turned sick and faint,
and the sweat began to pour off him at the mere sight of those fearful appliances.  Still,
he did not falter, and he swore to himself that not all their tortures should make a traitor
of him.

"Now, Carlos!" exclaimed Lopes, throwing himself upon Jim, who struggled vainly to free himself
from the clutches of the two powerful men who held him.  In a few moments he was bound hand
and foot, and Carlos removed the naval sword which they had not, as yet, taken from the young
Chilian officer.  Douglas was then flung on his back, and both arms and legs were lashed securely
to iron rings cemented into the floor of the cell.  This done, with a sardonic laugh, the two
men stood upright and looked at the recumbent form of their prisoner.  Then Carlos stepped
across the dungeon and, chuckling all the while, thrust several of the steel instruments of
torture in among the glowing charcoal of the brazier.

Half-fainting, and with every nerve and sense strained to its utmost, Jim suddenly fancied
that he heard a faint sound, coming apparently from a great distance.  It sounded, to his fevered
imagination, almost like a bugle call, but it was so exceedingly faint that he thought his
ears must have deceived him.  He looked at the two rascals above him, but they were talking,
and had evidently heard nothing.  Carlos drew out from the brazier a long, curved piece of
steel, but it was not yet red- hot and he replaced it, with a malevolent glance at Douglas.

Then suddenly there rang out, high, clear, and quite unmistakable, the sound of a trumpet;
and it was blown at no very great distance away, either!  Jim recognised it immediately; it
was the alarm, and he felt that some crisis was at hand.

"Carrajo!" exclaimed the man Lopes, turning a pale face to his confederate, "what does that
mean?  Run up above, man, quickly, and find out.  Surely it cannot be that--" He broke off,
as a dull boom rumbled through the stagnant air and made the very stone cell quiver.  "Quick,
Carlos; quick, man, and see what is the matter."

Without further bidding Carlos opened the door and sprang up the stairs, just as an appalling
crash was heard, apparently quite close at hand, even if not in the very building itself. 
Then there was another rending explosion, and another, not quite so close at hand this time.
Lopes, quivering with fear, glanced at Douglas, and then at the open door, as though meditating
flight, and he had evidently just made up his mind to decamp when Carlos came plunging down
the stone steps.

"Amigo mio!" he gasped hoarsely, "something has gone terribly wrong somewhere, for the Chilian
squadron is bombarding Iquique; and what is more, all the shells are falling in this quarter.
The streets are full of dead, and a man I saw flying past just now says that a body of marines
is already on shore, and coming this way.  We must fly at once, or we shall be too late!  Can
it be that this is in return for our having seized this youngster?  Come along, my friend,
quickly; and it would be well to give the boy a tap on the head and thus spare his countrymen
the trouble of carrying him away, if they find him.  But, come quickly man, or we are both
lost.  Those cursed shells are beginning to fall in this direction again!"

And indeed he was right; the dungeon fairly rocked under the hideous concussion of the bursting
missiles, while the roar of falling masonry could plainly be heard above, mingled with shrieks
which came to their ears, strangely muffled by the distance.

"I don't like to leave that boy," muttered Lopes, who seemed much the cooler of the two men,
"but if I stay here we shall both be buried alive.  No, Mr Officer, I will not kill you," he
said, drawing back his lips from his teeth with an evil smile; "I will leave you here, so that
your friends may have the satisfaction of killing you themselves!"

Then, as another fearful crash sounded above, he kicked the brazier of coal over so that the
glowing embers scattered themselves over Jim's body, and, calling to his friend, exclaimed,
"Adios, senor!" as the two men ran up the stone stairs.  Jim suffered excruciating pain as
the embers burnt their way through his clothes and ate into his flesh; but at length he contrived
to roll and shake himself free of them. Meanwhile, his two enemies could hardly have gone a
dozen steps upward when there came a most deafening concussion close by, and a shower of dust
and flying fragments of masonry scattered itself round Douglas, nearly blinding him.  He felt
that he was lost; for, bound as he was, he could do nothing to help himself; but as he lay
there waiting for death he was astonished to find that one of the cords confining his wrists
was slackening, and the next moment it had parted; a fragment of glowing charcoal had providentially
fallen upon it and burnt it through.  With one hand free, he found himself able, with some
difficulty, to release the other; after which a few seconds were sufficient to enable him to
cast loose the lashings from his feet.  He then stumbled and groped his way up the steps, passing,
as he did so, the mangled bodies of Lopes and of Carlos, who had been literally blown to pieces.
The house above was a mere shapeless mass of wreckage, and Jim had little difficulty in clambering
over the debris into the street.  As he emerged from the wrecked building there was a rattling
volley, and a shower of bullets whistled past the young officer's head.  His own men were firing
at him, under the impression that he was one of the enemy!  He snatched a handkerchief from
his pocket and waved it, just in time to avoid being riddled by a second discharge.

A moment later Douglas was shaking hands with his rescuers, who had so nearly escaped being
merely his avengers.  It now appeared that the coxswain of the launch, suspecting treachery,
had followed Jim and his guide to the house, outside which he had waited for some time in the
hope that he was mistaken, and that Jim would presently make his appearance.  But when an hour
had passed, the man felt convinced that something was wrong, and hurried back to the ship to
report.  Admiral Williams had thereupon sent an ultimatum to the intendente that, unless Senor
Douglas was returned to the Blanco Encalada by daybreak, he would bombard.

The unfortunate official, knowing nothing of the occurrence complained of, had failed, of course,
to produce the young man; and Rebolledo Williams had carried out his threat, very nearly destroying
the man whom he wished to save in so doing.  Under cover of the heavy gun-fire a party of marines
had been landed, and, under guidance of the coxswain, had gone toward the house where Jim was
known to be.  The men, seeing the place in ruins, naturally concluded that Jim was dead, and
were on the point of retreating when the lad put in an appearance among the ruins.

Having happily accomplished their errand, the detachment now returned to the ships, having
to fight their way back through the streets in the face of an almost overwhelming Peruvian
force.  But they won through eventually, and regained their boats without great loss.  That
afternoon Jim reported to the admiral, who thereupon determined to bombard in grim earnest
on the following morning.  Needless to say Jim slept sounder that night than he had done in
the dungeon on the previous evening.

CHAPTER FIVE.

THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE ESMERALDA AND THE HUASCAR.

On the following morning, shortly after daybreak, Rebolledo Williams began his preparations
for a further bombardment of Iquique; but, just as he was on the point of opening fire, the
Blanco Encalada's yeoman of signals presented himself with a report that the Chilian gunboat
Magellanes--a vessel of 772 tons displacement and of eleven knots speed--had just made her
appearance in the bay, coming up from the southward, and flying the signal, "Have important
news to communicate." The admiral therefore ordered operations to be suspended for the moment,
and waited impatiently for the captain of the Magellanes to come aboard and make his report.
The little vessel was evidently in a hurry, for she steamed in at full speed, and did not bring
up until close alongside the flagship.  The anchor then splashed down to the accompaniment
of a roar of chain-cable through the hawse-pipe the captain's gig was lowered away; and a few
minutes later that individual was being pulled across the short space of water between his
own ship and the Blanco Encalada.

Captain Simpson was closeted for over an hour with his admiral; at the end of which time the
signal was made for the whole fleet to heave short in readiness for an early departure.  The
Magellanes was also ordered to accompany the squadron.  As the ships were to go northward at
top speed it was impossible to take the Esmeralda along as well, in consequence of her phenomenally
low rate of speed.  But as she herself would be at the mercy of almost any hostile ship that
might happen to heave in sight while the main body of the fleet was absent, it was decided
to leave with her the gunboat Covadonga; and these two vessels were ordered to continue the
blockade of the port to the best of their ability.

The news brought by the Magellanes very soon filtered through the fleet, and was to the effect
that her skipper had been sent from Valparaiso to inform the admiral that the Peruvian President
Prado intended to leave Callao, on the night of May 16, for Arica, in the paddle-transport
Oroya; and that he was to be accompanied by the Independencia, Huascar, Chalaco, and Limena.
Admiral Williams was therefore ordered to abandon the blockade of Iquique, and, proceeding
northward immediately, was to endeavour to intercept the squadron and, by forcing a fleet action,
to destroy it, and so deal a fatal blow at the naval power of Peru.  Simpson also reported
that while on his way to join the flag he had fallen in, off the mouth of the river Loa, with
the Peruvian warships Union and Pilcomayo, and that he had fought a running action of over
two hours with them; his final escape being entirely due to his superior speed; as either of
the Peruvian vessels would alone have been more than a match for his own little ship.

This news occasioned the utmost bustle and activity among the Chilians. Every man was most
eager to be off, for the prospect of a decisive action appealed irresistibly to all, both officers
and men.

Jim Douglas, however, was found by the ship's surgeon to be suffering from a very severe attack
of prostration, which had doubtless been brought on by his recent experiences ashore at Iquique.
Sorely against his will, he was removed aboard the little Esmeralda, together with a number
of other sick men, the admiral having decided that since he was almost certain to be obliged
to fight a severe battle, he would take with him no men save such as were absolutely sound.

Amid the commiseration of his friends, among whom was, of course, Terence O'Meara, Jim, together
with other sick men from the flagship's crew, was put into a steam-launch and conveyed to the
gunboat, from the deck of which he watched, half an hour later, while comfortably seated in
a deck-chair, the departure of the Chilian squadron, consisting of the Blanco Encalada, Almirante
Cochrane, O'Higgins, Chacabuco, Magellanes, and Abtao, the last-named being filled with combustibles
so that she might serve, if necessary, as a fire-ship.

The poor lad felt very keenly disappointed at being unable to accompany the fleet and take
part in the action which everybody confidently looked forward to as being inevitable; but,
had he only known it, fortune was at that moment about to smile on him, for Rebolledo Williams
did not catch a glimpse of the Peruvians, while the Esmeralda and Covadonga were presently
to take part in a fight which has since become world- famous, by reason of the dauntless bravery
which was exhibited by the Chilians in the face of overwhelming odds.

Commander Arturo Prat, the captain of the Esmeralda, was at this time only thirty-one years
of age, but was the senior officer of the two ships; the Covadonga was commanded by Carlos
Condell, whose name has also passed into history.  As has been said, Admiral Williams, having
kept too close in under the land, altogether missed the Peruvian fleet, which escorted President
Prado safely into Arica.  The Huascar, Captain Grau, and the Independencia, Captain J.G.  Moore,
thereupon proceeded southward in the hope of falling in with some of the Chilian ships, and,
having looked into Pisagua to make sure that the squadron of Rebolledo Williams was not lurking
there, went on again toward Iquique, off which port they appeared at daybreak on the morning
of May 21.

Jim, having had nearly a week in which to recover from his attack of prostration, was by this
time quite himself again; and it was with keen satisfaction that he reported himself to the
commander as fit for duty, upon the appearance of the two Peruvian warships.  The lion-hearted
captain, when he saw the enormous superiority of the vessels opposed to him, recognised at
once that he would have no chance in the coming encounter; but, quite undaunted, prepared at
once for action, and signalled to the Covadonga to do the same.  Both gunboats were fortunately
under steam at the time, although the little Esmeralda's boilers were in such a shocking condition
that she could muster only sufficient power to move herself as fast as a man could walk.  In
a few minutes both vessels were as completely prepared for action as it was possible for them
to be, and, calling aft his crew, many of whom were invalids, Prat made a short speech to them,
which exhibited the lion courage of the man who has been called "the hero of Chili."  He said:

"Children, the odds are against us, but our flag has thus far never been lowered in the presence
of the enemy, and I hope that it will not be to- day.  As long as I live that flag shall fly
in its place; and if I die, my officers will know how to do their duty."

The men were then dismissed to their quarters, and almost immediately afterwards--at eight
o'clock in the morning--the Huascar fired the first shot, which fell right between the two
Chilian ships, and then began one of the most memorable sea-fights that have ever been recorded
in history.  The Chilians at once replied with every available gun, and the action instantly
became fierce, the Huascar singling out the Esmeralda as her antagonist, while the Covadonga
was attacked by the Independencia.

The Peruvian ironclads steamed slowly along toward their prey, the Huascar firing her two 10-inch
turret-guns as she came, but she was somewhat handicapped by the circumstance that there was
great risk of her shot striking the town, which was, of course, still in Peruvian hands.  But
each of these shells weighed as much as 300 pounds; and whenever they hit the unfortunate sloop
at which they were aimed, the effect was terrible.  One of them pierced her thin side, and
penetrating to the engine-room, burst there, killing every one of the engineers, and partially
disabling the crazy engines.  Arturo Prat, however, immediately detached from among the invalids
a squad of men to do duty in the engine-room, and redoubled his fire upon his opponent, keeping
up such a furious fusillade with his small-arms that Captain Grau of the Huascar mistook it
for machine-gun fire; and so excellent was the aim of the marksmen that it destroyed the Peruvians
who were working the unprotected guns, and prevented them from being replaced.

Jim was here, there, and everywhere, encouraging and cheering on his men, both with voice and
example; but the odds were most fearfully against the Chilians.  Shot fell upon the unfortunate
Esmeralda like hail, and one of them shivered Douglas's sword in his hand as he waved it above
his head.  The undaunted crew of the sloop were too fully occupied with the work of fighting
the Huascar to take any notice of what was happening in the town behind them, and suddenly
a shower of shells began to hurtle over the devoted craft from shoreward.  The Peruvians there
had dragged down to the beach a battery of field-pieces, with which they now opened a galling
fire upon the Esmeralda.  Her present berth at once became untenable, for she had not enough
men left to work the guns on both broadsides, and Commander Prat at once rang down to his engine-room
for "full speed ahead," the anchor having been raised at the beginning of the action; and the
doomed vessel's engines began the last revolutions that they were ever to make.

As soon as she was seen to be slowly steaming farther out into the bay, the captain of the
Huascar determined to try to ram his opponent, and thus end the fight at once.  He accordingly
steamed for the Esmeralda at a speed of about eight knots, steering north-east, while the sloop
was steering due north but was only just moving through the water.

Douglas at once divined the intention of the Peruvian and shouted a warning to Prat, who had
left the bridge for a few moments in order to assist with the repairing of a gun, the mechanism
of which had become jammed, and the gallant commander immediately sprang to his bridge- telegraph,
and rang for all the steam his boilers could give him.  But the engineers were already getting
every possible ounce of work out of the crazy machinery, and the sloop's speed could not be
increased!  For two dreadful minutes the combatants paused, as if by mutual consent, while
the Huascar rushed onward, like some fearful sea-monster, at its prey.

But Captain Grau stopped his engines just a few seconds too soon, and the Esmeralda was within
an ace of scraping clear.  She was nearly past--only a few yards more and she would be in safety--but
her wretched engines chose just that precise moment to break down, and the sloop at once lost
her way.  The next second the Peruvian monitor struck her with a concussion that threw every
man to the deck; but the blow was fortunately a glancing one, and the Huascar rubbed harmlessly
along the sides of the sloop, coming to a standstill alongside her in consequence of the entanglement
of some raised port-shutters.

Now was the Chilian's last opportunity to snatch success out of the jaws of failure, and Captain
Prat immediately seized it.

Waving his sword above his head, he shouted: "Boarders, away!  Follow me all who are able!"
And he sprang over the side of his ship on to the decks of the Huascar.

Douglas was the second man aboard the Peruvian monitor, and he raced along her deck, followed
by only twelve men, in the wake of his gallant commander.  The Peruvians were not prepared
for the attack, as they had quite expected to sink the little sloop with the first blow of
the Huascar's ram; but they quickly recovered from their surprise and swarmed out of the turret,
and up from below, charging furiously upon the boarders, with drawn cutlasses and revolvers.
Scarcely a man, it appeared, had been touched aboard the Peruvian, owing to the great thickness
of her armour-plating, and her crew, being practically intact, brought an overwhelming force
to bear upon the handful of invaders, who were instantly surrounded by their enemies.

There were but fourteen of them, all told, against quite a hundred of the Huascar's people,
but they fought like the heroes they were, and repeatedly charged home with their cutlasses,
into the thick of the foe. Prat, still at the head of his men, laid about him with his red-stained
sword, and encouraged them, both by voice and example, in the which he was ably seconded by
Douglas, who took upon himself the task of guarding his captain's rear.  Cut and thrust, cut
and thrust, the little band raged at the Peruvians; and for a few seconds it really seemed
as though their desperate valour would prevail.  But, alas, they had all long since emptied
their revolvers, and only their blades remained to them, many of which had been broken by the
delivery and warding of furious blows, so that many of the men were obliged to use their bare
fists, or their pistols held club-wise.

Such an unequal conflict could not long endure; the Chilians were falling, man after man, but
all fighting desperately to the very last. Then, from somewhere up aloft, rifle-bullets began
to hurtle among them, and then the end was very near.  Looking upward, Douglas saw that a number
of Peruvians, armed with rifles, had clambered up on the roof of the turret, and up into the
Huascar's low fighting-tops, and were firing directly downward into them.

It was one of these bullets that put an end to the career of the gallant Chilian commander.
He and Jim were fighting, shoulder to shoulder, and, at the head of only five men, were endeavouring
to cut a way through their foes in order to regain their own ship.  Indeed, their desperate
valour had nearly carried them through when Prat, suddenly dropping his reeking sword, put
both hands up to his face, and, after swaying on his feet for a second, fell into Jim's arms.
His face, as Douglas saw when the dead hands fell away, was literally shot to pieces by at
least half a dozen bullets which must have struck simultaneously.  Nothing could be done for
the gallant sailor, for he must have died instantaneously, so Jim allowed him to sink gently
to the deck, and took up his own defence again.  There were only two men now left, beside himself,
and escape seemed absolutely hopeless, when a volley of rifle-bullets plumped into the circle
of Peruvians, evidently fired by some of the few remaining members of the sloop's crew.  Taken
by surprise, the Peruvians scattered for a moment; and Jim, with the two Chilian seamen, took
advantage of the opening and dashed through the crowd, gaining the Huascar's side in safety.
But to his horror he found that the two ships had drifted apart, and that the Esmeralda was
even now steaming away, at a very slow speed, certainly, but still far beyond the reach of
the three deserted men on the Huascar!

Jim took one hasty look round and then, putting his hands above his head, plunged downward
into the sea, and began to strike out after his own ship.  A few bullets splashed harmlessly
into the water alongside him, and then the Peruvians turned their attention to other and larger
prey.  The Huascar went ahead once more and, taking a wide circle, presented her stem once
more at the unfortunate Esmeralda.  Jim then recognised that the sloop was doomed, and that
it would be of no use for him to strive to regain her.  It would be better to endeavour to
reach the Covadonga, should she still be afloat, and he looked round to see whether he could
see her.

To his great surprise, even as he was looking for her, he heard a shout and saw the gunboat
heading directly for him, with the Independencia in hot pursuit.  Carlos Condell, seeing the
fate of his consort, and realising that he was hopelessly outmatched, had evidently determined
to retreat while his engines were still intact; and the Covadonga was now heading out of the
bay at full speed to the southward.

For a moment Douglas thought that the ship would run over him, but a second glance showed him
that it was evidently Condell's intention to try to pick him up.  As the Covadonga approached,
her captain sent his engines hard astern, checking the vessel's speed sufficiently to allow
of Jim being picked up by a rope which, already noosed, was cleverly thrown to him.

Although the lad thought that his body must certainly be torn in half by the strain upon the
rope, he was safely hauled aboard and deposited on deck, whereupon Captain Condell again sent
his engines ahead at full speed and resumed his flight.  Jim was soon upon his feet again,
and almost before he had fully recovered his breath an officer came up to him to tell him that
Commander Condell wished to see him, in order to receive a report from him as to what had,
up to now, occurred aboard the Esmeralda.  Jim therefore made his way to the little conning-tower
where Carlos Condell was directing the fighting of his ship; but before he had time to enter
he saw the final act in the fight between the Huascar and the Esmeralda.

The Peruvian had dashed straight at the sloop and, stopping his engines when only eighty feet
away from her, had struck her fairly on the starboard broadside, piercing a huge hole in her
side, through which the water poured in cataracts.  That finished the fight; and at ten minutes
after twelve o'clock mid-day the gallant little Esmeralda, with her colours still flying, and
guns still firing, plunged downward out of sight into the deep blue waters of Iquique bay,
having fought a most heroic battle against overwhelming odds.

Jim was not long in making his report to Captain Condell, and with a glance at the Independencia,
which was hard upon the Covadonga's heels, firing as she came, he now ran down below to change
into dry clothes and equip himself with another sword and revolver; having, of course, lost
his own when he jumped into the sea.

The Independencia was a slightly faster craft than the Covadonga, but she drew a good deal
more water; and Captain Condell, with masterly skill, availed himself of this circumstance
to the full, by running across shoals over which the Peruvian ship dared not follow him, and
by keeping quite close in to the shore where she could not approach. Luckily, too, the Independencia's
gunners were raw, and found great difficulty in hitting the little gunboat; but whenever they
did the execution on board the small craft was tremendous, by reason of the huge size of the
projectiles.

At last, finding that he could not hit the Covadonga in a vital spot, or bring her to a standstill,
Captain Moore, the Peruvian captain, determined to risk his own ship in an endeavour to bring
the running fight to a close.  The combatants were now off Punto Gruesos, where the shore was
steeper, and the water consequently of greater depth, and Moore decided to ram his opponent.
He gradually edged closer and closer to the Covadonga--continually firing his heavy guns, to
which the Chilian replied with a withering small-arm fire--until he was separated by only about
a cable's-length from the gunboat.

He now suddenly changed his course from south to south-south-east and steered straight for
the Covadonga, which was within a hundred yards of the beach, and had herself just touched
a rock in her passage over it.  But alas for the Peruvian, she missed her blow, and struck
immediately upon the rock over which the gunboat had a moment before passed, becoming immovably
fixed there.

"Now," roared Condell to the helmsman, "up with the helm, and we will go about and destroy
that fellow completely.  Senor Douglas," he continued, to Jim, "kindly go down and superintend
the working of that forward 70- pounder gun; I am told that the lieutenant in charge has been
killed by the Independencia's last shot."

Jim ran off, as requested, and took charge of the weapon, while the Covadonga, describing a
wide curve, wheeled round until she presented her bow to the wrecked Peruvian, and at a distance
of about half a mile, began to plump shell right into her stern.  Jim made excellent practice
with the gun, and put shot after shot into the hapless vessel, each of which, entering her
stern, passed through the whole length of the ship, finally setting her on fire in several
places.  Then, the Independencia's hull having very nearly filled with water, she fell over
on her side and became a complete wreck.  Jim, however, still continued his firing until a
man on board the Peruvian crawled aft and, hauling down the colours, hoisted a white flag in
its place.  The Covadonga then, and only then, ceased firing.

But unfortunately she could not enjoy the fruits of her victory, for, at the very moment when
the Peruvian surrendered, the Huascar, having picked up the survivors of the Esmeralda's crew,
made her appearance beyond the western end of the island which forms the south side of the
bay of Iquique.  The gunboat was, of course, no match for the monitor; and Condell was therefore
reluctantly compelled to abandon the Independencia and seek his own safety in flight to the
southward.

Jim therefore fired a gun in defiance at the Huascar, which immediately took up the pursuit,
and the Covadonga steamed away toward Antofagasta, which she reached on the following day,
having run the Huascar out of sight; that ship being unable to steam very fast in consequence
of an injury to her bow, caused by the ramming of the Esmeralda.

CHAPTER SIX.

THE INCA'S PROPHECY.

On reaching Antofagasta the Covadonga went into the roads and lay inside the reef which stretches
across their entrance; and there, her captain, Carlos Condell, telegraphed to Valparaiso, giving
details of the previous day's fight, and asking for further orders, while he set about repairing
the very extensive damage which had been sustained by his ship in her fight with the Independencia.
On the following day Condell received news from Valparaiso to the effect that the Chilian fleet
had gone north to Callao; and was instructed that he himself was to rejoin as soon as he received
word from Iquique that Admiral Williams had returned to that port.  He was further instructed
to proceed, meanwhile, as rapidly as possible, with the repairs to his own ship.

The gunboat was accordingly hauled alongside the wharf at Antofagasta, her heavy guns were
lifted out of her, and the vessel was careened in order that the shot-holes below her water-line
might be plugged.

As the work on the Covadonga would, it was expected, occupy at least a fortnight, Jim Douglas
applied to Commander Condell for leave to go ashore occasionally, that he might explore the
quaint old town, which dated back to a period long anterior to the conquest of Peru by Pizarro
and his band of adventurers.

During his short sojourn on board the Covadonga Jim had formed a rather intimate acquaintanceship
with her first lieutenant, a man named Jorge Montt; and one evening, after he had returned
from one of his periodical surveys of the town, Jim entered the tiny mess-room to find Montt
discoursing at length to an eager circle of listeners upon the legends and traditions of old Peru.

"Yes," Montt was saying, as Douglas entered, "it is an undisputed fact that there are thousands--nay,
tens of thousands--of the descendants of the ancient Inca race now living in Peru, Bolivia,
and upper Chili, who implicitly believe that a time will come when the Incas will regain their
old supremacy, drive all the Latin races out of this part of South America, and re-establish
the old Inca monarchy once more, in all its pristine glory.  You know, of course, that there
are many stories extant in this country as to the existence of vast hoards of buried treasure?
Well, it is prophesied, I believe, that one day a man shall arise in Peru who shall head a
vast Indian insurrection and drive the `oppressors' into the sea; and his power will, it is
said, be derived from these enormous hoards of buried treasure, the locality of which is well
known among the Incas, and which will be revealed to the `Libertador'--when he makes his appearance.
The study of these Indian traditions is very interesting, I assure you, gentlemen," he concluded.

"But then," remarked Jim, who had sat down and was listening intently, "nearly all semi-civilised
races have traditions of the same sort.  Take the North American Indians, for instance; or
the Zulus.  Why, even the Chinese believe that one day a chief will arise among them who shall
lead them to the conquest of the whole world!  I do not think there is very much in these old
legends.  Every nation has them, in some form or other."

"Yes, that is so," agreed Montt; "but I have studied the history of the Inca races very closely,
and, so far as my experience goes, there is no nation on earth whose prophecies are so likely
to come to pass as are theirs.  I am personally aware of many occasions on which prophecies
made by members of this strange race have come true in the most marvellous way.  For myself,
I feel convinced that the Incas really have some means, unknown to us, of foretelling future
events; for I once visited in my youth an old woman in this very town of Antofagasta, who prophesied
many things about my future, many of which have, so far, come true, and the rest of which will
doubtless happen in due time."

Montt finished his remarks to the accompaniment of a chorus of derisive laughter, and a number
of voices were raised in protest against his attempted imposition upon their credulity.  Whereupon
the lieutenant became somewhat angry, and replied shortly:

"Well, gentlemen, you may believe me or not, as you please; but it is the truth that I am telling
you; and I can take you to that identical personage, if you wish, for I believe she still lives
here, and you can therefore experiment for yourselves, should you feel so inclined.  For my
own part I believe implicitly everything that she told me.  Now, are any of you willing to
accompany me to this Inca woman's house and put her powers to the test?"

There was a lengthy pause, for all the officers were either Chilians or of Chilian descent,
and the South American races are notoriously superstitious.  But Jim, being an Englishman,
had no qualms; and he felt, for some reason or other, a great curiosity to see this strange
personage.  He therefore replied:

"Well, Montt, if none of these other gentlemen feel disposed to go with you, perhaps you will
have no objection to take me?  I am very much interested in all matters of this kind, and I
have been impressed by what you have just told us.  I should very much like to go with you,
if you don't mind."

Montt bowed gravely and answered: "By all means, Senor Douglas; I shall be only too pleased;
for I am sure that the woman would interest you, whether you believe in second sight or not.
I shall be off duty to- morrow evening, after six o'clock.  We shall dine at half-past, as
usual, I suppose: how would half-past seven suit you as the time for going ashore?  We could
be back before midnight, easily, if we went at that time."

"Yes," Douglas agreed, "that time will suit me very well, Senor Montt; and I shall look forward
to our expedition with great interest."

The conversation then turned upon other matters, and the subject was dropped; but the next
evening, after dinner, Douglas reminded Montt of their arrangement; and the two men, dressing
themselves in mufti, stepped off the Covadonga on to the wharf, and made their way up into
the town.

They walked along the sea-front, where the horse-trams were wont to ply before the electric
cars were introduced, right away up to the north end of the promenade, until they came to the
Hotel de Sucre, where they turned off to the right, up a very narrow and badly-lighted side-street,
which conducted them into a part of the city very much resembling the place in Iquique into
which Jim had been inveigled.  Indeed Jim began to have some doubts as to the wisdom of their
little adventure when he saw the evil glances and scowls of hatred which everywhere met them
on their progress; for it was not so very long that the Chilians had occupied the place.

However, Montt betrayed not the slightest uneasiness, and assured his friend that the Bolivians
always looked askance at strangers in the city, and as they were both dressed in mufti, so
that their connection with the Chilians was not apparent, the young Englishman decided not
to worry himself about the matter, but to trust entirely to his companion's discretion.

They traversed a number of narrow side-streets and gloomy alleys, and presently came out in
the broad Plaza de la Libertad, where some patriotic orator was volubly holding forth about
the rights of man and the iniquity of the Chilian invasion.  Montt hurriedly seized Jim's arm
as the Englishman was on the point of crossing the road to hear what the orator had to say,
and guided him away to the left, so that they skirted the plaza instead of crossing it.

"The people seem in rather an excitable mood to-night," said the lieutenant; "we had therefore
better make ourselves as inconspicuous as possible.  I wonder what has occurred?  Possibly
there may have been some battle, in which the Bolivians have been defeated.  I would not have
come ashore had I thought that the city was likely to be in this state of unrest.  However,
as we are here we may as well go forward; so come along, and let us get away from this frothing
volcano as soon as we can.  We will turn down this side-street; it is not very much out of
our way, and we shall be out of sight of the crowd all the sooner."

Jim readily acquiesced, as a good many of the people whom they met seemed to regard them with
anything but friendly glances, and the two men hurried away down the Calle San Antonio, where
they soon got out of range of the angry growling of the mob.

"Can't imagine what's wrong here to-night," muttered Montt, in a low voice, "but it must be
either, as I said, that we have defeated their countrymen somewhere on land, or else that one
of our ships has sunk or captured the Huascar; nothing less would, I imagine, have roused them
to such a pitch of excitement.  We Chilians are maintaining a ridiculously small army of occupation
here; far too small for the purpose, in my opinion; and if the Bolivians were to turn restive,
as they seem very much inclined to do, we should have rather a bad time of it, I am afraid.
However, we are not far away from the house where this old Inca witch-woman, or whatever she
calls herself, lives.  It used to be in one of the small hovels on the right side of the street
we are just coming to."

They turned into the street--or, rather, alley--indicated by Montt, and at once found themselves
in a cobble-paved and exceedingly ill-lighted thoroughfare, flanked on either side by a curious
assortment of huge, old-time houses, which were doubtless, at one period, the dwellings of
high Government officials, and tiny, tumbledown hovels, which seemed to have sprung up, like
fungi or some other evil growth, on the small spaces of ground which had formerly been left
vacant between the larger houses.

Half-way down this evil-looking, evil-smelling, and squalid alley Montt called a halt and,
looking round carefully, remarked:

"Now, Senor Douglas, so far as I can remember--for it is a good many years since I was here
before--this is the house; but as I see no sign of any light in the place, the old woman may
have gone away, or died. However, having come thus far, we will try our luck."  And the lieutenant
knocked softly upon the door.

The sound echoed dully through the little building, but otherwise the silence remained unbroken;
it seemed as though the place was indeed deserted.

"Caramba!" exclaimed Montt, "I don't believe there is anybody here, after all; what a pity!
I do not care to knock too loudly, either, for fear of attracting the attention of the neighbours.
They are a queer lot down in this quarter, I can tell you.  Hallo! did you hear anything moving
inside there, just then, Douglas?"

Jim listened intently for a few seconds, then replied: "Yes, I think I do hear something prowling
about in there, but--upon my word, Montt, it sounds more like a--a--well, an animal than a
human being; and--what a very curious smell there is; quite like--let me see--" here the young
officer sniffed several times--"yes," he continued after a pause, "it is quite like the odour
of a wild beast!"

"Per Dios! you are right," exclaimed the lieutenant, sniffing in turn. "And I remember that
last time I visited this place the old woman certainly seemed to carry with her an uncanny,
musty, animal odour. Therefore it is probably she.  I will knock again."

Montt thereupon drew from his jacket pocket a revolver, which he had taken the precaution to
bring with him, and tapped softly on the door with its butt.

This time there followed a plainly perceptible "shuffle-shuffle" like the soft padding of a
heavy animal's paws, and both men started violently when, directly afterward, and from the
other side of the door, a whining voice inquired--

"Who knocks at my door?  Go away, whoever you are.  I am a poor, lone old woman, and if you dis--"

"Are you the Inca woman, Mama Huello?" broke in Montt; "for, if so, we wish to consult you.
We are two naval officers who have heard of your wonderful powers of foretelling the future,
and we should like to have a demonstration of them."

There was a pause, and then the whining voice replied: "Yes, I am the Mama Huello; wait ye
there for a short time, while I prepare for your reception."

Again that curious shuffling sound was heard, and Jim somehow felt a shiver of fear run down
his spine.  It was only a disordered fancy, of course; but to him it certainly seemed as though
the voice proceeded from an animal, rather than from a human being.  Then Montt remarked:

"She must surely have a big dog, or some other pet animal with her, I should think, for I distinctly
heard the `pad-pad' of paws when the Mama turned away.  I hope the creature will not attempt
to worry us, under the impression that we mean harm to the old woman."

Jim did not reply.  He felt instinctively that they would find no animal there when they entered
the house; but he had no further time for reflection, for, at that moment, the door opened
with startling suddenness, and a voice invited them to enter.

Montt stepped inside, and Jim followed close upon his heels.  The door shut after them, of
its own accord, apparently; and they found themselves in a narrow stone-flagged passage, which
was dimly lighted by an oil-lamp with a large red shade over it.  The whitewashed walls were
covered with all manner of hieroglyphs and drawings, the meaning of which Jim could not fathom.
Nor had he much time to examine them, for the voice of the Mama, still proceeding from some
unseen quarter, invited them to go forward, and they presently found themselves in a large
apartment, built of stone, upon the walls of which hung rich silks and cloths made of vicuna-wool,
together with a number of other articles, evidently of ancient native manufacture, the like
of which the young Englishman had never seen before.  To say that he was astonished at the
barbaric splendour of the apartment is to put it very mildly; and he could not understand how
it was that such an apparently diminutive house could contain a room of such large size as
the one in which he now stood.

But he soon forgot his astonishment in watching the extraordinary owner of the place.  She
was a wizened little woman, of an age far beyond the allotted threescore years and ten, if
appearances went for anything; but it was her face and hands that riveted Jim's attention and
excited his disgust.  Her features bore a strongly marked resemblance to those of an animal
of the cat species, and her teeth were all pointed instead of being square; while her hands
resembled claws, the fingers were hooked and skinny, and the nails were discoloured and extraordinarily
long. Taken altogether, it was a personality to excite repulsion and fear in any one brought
in contact with it, and Douglas felt another strong shiver run down his back as he looked at
her.  She stood in the middle of the room, leaning upon a thick ebony stick, and peering out
from beneath her overhanging eyebrows at the two young officers, with an expression which they
could not quite fathom, and which seemed to be reading their very souls.  Then Montt pulled
himself together and remarked:

"We have heard of your powers, Mama, and we have come to ask you to foretell the future to
us.  As I said before, we are both naval officers in the service of--well--I won't say what
country; and we are anxious to learn what may be in store for us.  Will you read our lives?"

"Sit ye both down there," replied the old crone, pointing to a richly cushioned couch which
was placed against one of the walls.  "If ye really wish to know the future I can tell it ye.
Oh yes, the Mama can tell ye.  You, Don Jorge Montt, have visited me before--seven years ago;
and I told you many things about your future.  Have they yet come to pass?"

Montt started.  He had not expected that she would again recognise him, for he was very much
changed in appearance; and her remembrance of his name, and the date when he last visited her,
seemed rather to savour of the uncanny.

"Yes, Mama," he replied, "I did visit you at the time you mention; and all that you told me
has, so far, proved true.  But men's actions govern their lives, and I thought that, perhaps,
mine might have altered my future.  You did not forecast a very prosperous career for me then,
you know."

"You speak truth, Don Jorge," replied the woman.  "Your brave deeds in the past have indeed
influenced your future; and methinks I shall see great things in store for you.  I will read
your future first, my officer," she went on.  "Come over here, and sit in this chair.  Yes,
that is it.  Now do not speak until I give you permission; nor you either, Senor Englishman.
Ha!  You wonder how I know your nationality, do you not?  I will show you stranger things than
that, however, before you leave."

Montt having taken his seat in the chair, as directed, the Mama brought from a corner of the
room a large copper brazier, on the top of which was a bowl of the same metal.  Having filled
the brazier with hot coals, which she took from a fire burning in the open hearth, she waited
patiently for the metal bowl to become hot.

After the lapse of perhaps ten minutes the copper basin began to glow dully red, and the witch-woman
thereupon poured into it some powder, which she took from a little gold casket.

Immediately a great cloud of smoke rushed up from the bowl, and, to Jim's unbounded amazement,
hung suspended over it, without mingling with the air of the room, as he had expected it would.
At the same time a delightful odour greeted his nostrils, and he began to experience a delicious
sensation of drowsiness stealing over him, while to his ears there seemed to come a faint sound
as of music being played at a distance.  The outlines of the room began to vanish and fade
away, little by little, until the only thing that remained before his eyes was the column,
or rather ball, of smoke which now appeared gradually to assume larger dimensions, until at
length he seemed to be looking into a dense mist, wherein he could at that moment discern nothing.
And all the time his sensation of drowsiness was becoming stronger and still stronger, until
he seemed to be in a state of semi-coma, very much like that induced by the use of opium.

Then, quite suddenly, his lassitude left him, his senses became preternaturally acute, and
a sense of well-being and complete satisfaction pervaded his whole being.  The mist into which
he was gazing became faintly luminous, and strange shapes began to flit across it; shapes the
like of which he had never seen in his life before.  Then something approached him and rested
its head upon his knee.  He looked down and saw that the "something" was a huge jaguar or South
American tiger; and it bore a striking resemblance to the woman, Mama Huello. But, strange
to say, Jim felt no sensation of fear; instead, his whole being seemed to be quivering with
eagerness to see what was to be displayed upon the curtain of mist, still stretched before him.

The light became stronger and stronger, and the cloud more luminous, until it seemed to be
a mass of living flame; and presently, out of the mist, pictures began to shape themselves
one after another, in rapid succession.

Jim saw his friend, Montt, as the central figure in many battles, conducting himself with unexampled
bravery, and covering himself with glory.  Scenes occurred which Douglas knew, instinctively,
related to the war at present in progress.  He saw the lieutenant in command of a small gunboat
fighting an action against a whole Peruvian fleet, and coming off victorious, though sorely
wounded.  Then many years seemed to elapse, during which Montt had apparently attained to a
high position in the Chilian navy.  The country was now divided against itself, was in the
throes of revolution, and Montt was the leading spirit among the insurgents.  He carried all
before him by the magic of his consummate genius, and out of anarchy created concord.  Then
the scene changed again, and Jim beheld the representation of a broad plaza in some city which
he had never visited but which some sixth sense told him was Santiago de Chili.  Montt, now
supreme head of the Chilian navy, was just issuing from a building fronting on the square.
It was night-time, and the man was clothed in a heavy black cloak which he had flung round
his shoulders.  Montt descended the steps leading from the house, and started to walk across
the square, when suddenly, from behind the large fountain which played in the middle of the
plaza, there sprang four men, all masked and armed with knives.  There was a brief struggle,
a shrill scream, and Montt fell pierced by the daggers of his enemies.

Then the scene vanished from before Jim's eyes, and he knew that his own future was about to
be presented to him.  He saw himself once more back on board the Blanco Encalada, and knew
that that ship, together with another Chilian vessel, was engaged in a fierce fight with a
Peruvian ironclad, the name of which was hidden from him.  The Chilians were victorious, although
the carnage on both sides had been enormous, and Jim perceived that he himself had been wounded.
Several other actions passed across the screen of mist, in all of which Douglas took a leading
part, distinguishing himself brilliantly, and receiving rapid promotion. The scene then changed
from sea to land, and Jim knew that he was detailed for shore service in some obscure town
among the Bolivian mountains.  He could distinctly see the whole picture laid out before him,
and he knew instinctively that some great good fortune was awaiting him when the time should
come for him to visit that place.

As he stood, or rather seemed to stand, gazing out over the scene, it vanished from before
his eyes; and a voice, like that of the Mama Huello, spoke, saying:

"You, Senor Englishman, shall come to great honours through your own exertions and bravery;
but I also see great riches before you, of which you shall obtain possession with but little
trouble on your part.  They are still under the earth, but in due time, and in a manner little
suspected by you, their whereabouts shall be revealed to you, and you shall become a great
man and a powerful chief in the land of your adoption."

The voice ceased, and a rumbling sound seemed to make itself heard in Jim's ears.  Then the
cloud of mist slowly dissolved, and the outlines of the room wherein he was seated gradually
came back to his senses. Yes, there was the copper brazier, but the glow had vanished from
the coals, which were now black and cold.  Montt was still seated in his chair, looking like
a statue carved out of marble, and Jim found himself still on the couch whereon he had first
placed himself.  The curious feeling of drowsiness gradually left him, and the figure of Mama
Huello appeared, still standing close to Montt and the copper brazier, apparently in the same
position as she had taken up when the mist began to appear before his eyes, and she was laughing,
a grim, noiseless chuckle that disclosed all her white, pointed teeth.

Suddenly the spell broke, and Montt and Jim rose to their feet simultaneously, the former wiping
the cold perspiration from his brow, and smiling in a curiously strained manner.

"Well, Mama," he said, "you have shown us some very strange things, I must say.  I only hope
that the last part of your prophecy concerning myself will not come true.  Here you are, Mama,"
he went on, feeling in his pockets for a coin, "here is a five-peso piece for you.  I hope
you will consider the payment sufficient."

The old Inca woman grabbed the coin and hid it away in the recesses of her girdle.  "Quite
sufficient, gallant cavalier," she replied.  "Your generosity has not withered with the years.
You are a brave man; and I would that I might have shown you a more pleasant ending to your
life; but fate is fate, and there is no changing it.  Adios, senores, adios; I do not think
we shall ever meet again.  You, Senor Englishman, go forward to honour and fame; while you,
Don Jorge Montt, go forward to honour and--death!  But you will meet it with the brave heart;
and it will not be very bitter when it comes."

By this time the two men had reached the door, which the Mama now opened, and a moment later
Montt and Douglas were in the street, which was now illuminated by the rays of the full moon.
As the door closed behind them Montt shivered, although the night was oppressively hot, and
Jim could have sworn that he heard the sound of an animal's pads retreating down the passage
behind them.

The two men swiftly pulled themselves together, however, and started off for the Covadonga,
which they reached just as the first faint flush of dawn made its appearance in the eastern sky.

CHAPTER SEVEN.

A NIGHT-ATTACK.

The day following the joint adventure of Douglas and Montt in Antofagasta a telegram arrived
for the skipper of the Covadonga, ordering him to leave the place immediately, and rejoin the
flag at Valparaiso without delay.  All shore leave was accordingly stopped, and that same evening
the gunboat raised her anchor and steamed out of Chimba Bay, on her way to the headquarters
port.  The telegram had also contained a warning that the Peruvian warships Huascar and Union
were prowling up and down the coast, and, as each one separately was a good deal more than
a match for the little Covadonga, it behoved her captain to keep a very sharp look-out for
any sign of the enemy, especially as the gunboat was not fast enough to enable her to rely
upon her speed for safety.

Men were, consequently, posted at the mastheads, with orders to report directly any sign of
a strange ship was seen, and the ship slid slowly along under the stars, keeping as close in
to the land as possible.  As soon as his watch was at an end that night, Douglas, feeling rather
tired after his experience of the previous evening, went down below and turned into his bunk;
and it was not very long before he was in the land of dreams.

It seemed to him that he had only just fallen asleep when he was rudely awakened by a commotion
up on deck.  He lay half awake in his bunk for a minute or two, and heard men running about
overhead, the sound of excited voices shouting, and then, loud and clear above the uproar,
rang out Carlos Condell's voice giving orders for the men to be called to quarters and the
guns to be cast loose.  Evidently, thought Jim, there was more fighting in the wind.  He quickly
tumbled into his clothes, slung his uniform ulster over his shoulders, for the night was cold,
and stumbled up on deck, every pulse in him throbbing with excitement at the anticipation of
another encounter with the enemy.

As he dashed up through the hatchway he cannoned into, and almost knocked down, his friend
Montt, who was rushing forward with orders from the skipper.

"Hallo, Montt!"  Jim ejaculated, "what's the matter this time?"

"Two steamers have just been sighted coming out of Chaneral Bay, and heading this way," returned
the Chilian, breathlessly.  "They are believed to be the Huascar and the corvette Union, and
it looks as though they had been up to some mischief in there, for there is a big glare away
to the south-east--there, you can see it for yourself!--which seems to point to their having
set something on fire.  But you mustn't keep me now, my friend, for it is `all hands to quarters
and prepare for action'; and, if it should prove to be as we believe, we shall have a tough
fight to get clear of these two fellows."  And the gallant first lieutenant bustled away to
carry out his orders.

Looking in the direction indicated by Montt, Jim could plainly see the dull, lurid glare of
a large fire away to the south-east; and, outlined sharply against the glow, he could also
make out, even from the level of the deck, a brig-rigged steamer, which could be none other
than the Peruvian monitor; and she was accompanied by a large, three-masted, ship-rigged steamer
which was undoubtedly the corvette Union.  Whether the enemy had yet sighted the Covadonga
was still doubtful, for the gunboat was close in under the high cliffs which formed the coastline
at that point, and they would hardly be on the look-out for a vessel so near in to the land.
But when they got nearer to her they could hardly help sighting her; and her only hope of ultimate
escape was to avoid detection, if possible, until she was nearly abreast of the Peruvians,
and then to make a running fight of it, trusting more to her heels than to her fighting powers
to enable her to get away.

But the Covadonga could scarcely hope to avoid a fight of some sort; and her gallant skipper,
Condell, was not at all the sort of man to wish to do so.  He would at any time much rather
stay and fight than run, even though hopelessly outmatched; but orders were orders, and he
was wanted at Valparaiso, so for once he was forced to acknowledge discretion as the better
part of valour.

At this moment, the "word" having been quietly passed, the men came tumbling up on deck, and
Jim was obliged to abandon his survey of the Peruvians and attend to his duty of getting his
own particular battery of guns ready for the coming encounter.  In about ten minutes everything
was prepared, and Montt, the first lieutenant, marched into the tiny conning-tower and reported
to Condell, "Ship cleared for action, sir." Jim was then free, for a short time at any rate,
to turn his attention once more to the swiftly approaching steamers, which were travelling
so fast as to give the impression that they feared pursuit.

"If," mused Jim, "the Almirante Cochrane or some other of our ships are really after these
fellows it will probably mean the saving of us, for the Huascar and the Union will in that
case hardly dare to remain and fight against us.

"Ah!--" he continued, as he saw a rocket stream up into the air from the Huascar, "they have
sighted us, that is clear, and we shall have to fight after all.  Yes; here they come!  They
are both altering their course now, and heading directly for us.  I was afraid we should not
escape detection."

The Peruvians, which had been heading off the land, had now turned slightly, and were pointing
about north-north-west, directly for the spot where the Covadonga was creeping along under
the land, and Jim could see the dull red glare above their funnels which showed that the stokers
were coaling up vigorously.

Condell now shouted down the voice-tube to the engine-room, ordering the staff to let him have
as much steam as the boilers would carry, and rang for full speed at the same time.  The little
gunboat began to quiver from stem to stern, from truck to keel, under the increased pulsations
of the throbbing screw, while the curl of white water at her bows gradually crept higher and
still higher up her stem as her speed increased, until she swept along at her best pace of
about nine knots in the hour.

As she ran down the coast the Huascar and the Union both pointed their bows more and more shoreward,
as if to cut off the gunboat; and it began to look very much as though there was no hope for
the Covadonga, when suddenly another rocket, blue this time, soared up from the monitor, and
she described a wide circle seaward once more, her consort following her example.  Jim immediately
guessed that Admiral Grau had, like a prudent man, had a leadsman at work on board his ship,
and that the Peruvian skipper had suddenly found himself in danger of running aground through
standing so close inshore.

The two hostile warships then eased down to half-speed, and kept on a course parallel with
the shore, and at a distance of about a mile away from it.  As the Covadonga herself was obliged,
by reason of shoals and sunken reefs, to keep at a distance of quite half a mile from the beach,
this left her an avenue of escape just about half a mile in width.  But although the Huascar
and the Union could not approach closer than eight or nine hundred yards from the gunboat,
she would still have to run the gauntlet of their fire, and they could easily destroy her,
by gun-fire alone, at six times that distance.  There did not appear to be very much hope for
the Covadonga, thought Jim, unless she could somehow manage to disable her antagonists--a very
unlikely contingency, owing to the smallness of her guns, or unless a Chilian ship should happen
to be in the neighbourhood and be attracted to the spot by the sound of the firing which was
bound to open in a few minutes.

When the Covadonga had approached to within about a mile of the Peruvian ironclads, Jim saw
the Huascar go about and heave-to, with her bows pointing to the south, while the Union came
foaming along on her original course, which was parallel to that of the gunboat, and about
half a mile distant from it to seaward.

"Aha!" thought he to himself, "so that is the manoeuvre, is it?  Grau is going to get us between
two fires if he can.  As soon as the corvette is past us she too will swing round and attack
us with her bow-guns while the Huascar rakes us with her stern weapons.  It looks as though
the Covadonga were in for a hot time!"

The young Englishman's surmise soon proved correct; for directly the Union had passed out of
the line of fire the Huascar opened with one of her turret 300-pounder guns.  The first shell
passed close ahead of the gunboat, but it was aimed much too high, and struck the cliffs on
the Covadonga's port beam, exploding with a brilliant flash of light and a roaring concussion
that sent ton after ton of rock hurtling down into the sea.  The corvette was now abreast of
the Chilian ship, and as she drew level she let fly her whole broadside, consisting of one
100- pounder, one 70-pounder, and six 40-pounders, at the devoted gunboat.

The effect was as though a hurricane of fire and steel had broken loose aboard the Covadonga.
Three of her smaller machine-guns, together with their crews, were blown to atoms, while her
bulwarks were levelled with the decks in several places.  The execution on board was terrible;
and Jim had an exceedingly narrow escape, for at the moment when the Union fired he was just
entering the little conning-tower with a communication for Captain Condell, and a 100-pounder
shell struck full upon one of the Covadonga's 70-pounder gun-shields, tearing a portion of
it away.  It then burst into a thousand fragments, one of which whizzed past Jim's head and
struck the conning-tower beside him with such force that the piece of metal weighing several
pounds was firmly embedded in the soft steel of which the tower was constructed, while Jim
was dazed with the shock and half blinded by the flying iron dust and grains of powder.

He managed to stagger inside the citadel just as the Huascar let fly with one of her 40-pounder
guns, the shell from which struck full upon the very spot on the deck where he had been standing
ten seconds previously, ripping a huge hole in the iron sheathing with which it was covered,
and then exploding right over the engine-room hatch, which luckily was protected by a bomb-proof
grating.

When Jim had at length cleared his eyes of dust and powder he delivered his message to the
captain and was about to leave, but Condell requested him to remain, saying that he might want
to make use of him.  Montt was in the conning-tower, carrying out Condell's orders as to the
working of the engines, while the skipper himself watched carefully through the narrow observation-slit
in the citadel, waiting for the moment when he might begin to open an effectual fire upon the
enemy.

At length the moment arrived.  The Covadonga had come up level with the Peruvian monitor, and
the Union, being obliged to circle to seaward as she found herself in shoal water, was about
three-quarters of a mile astern, although still firing incessantly.  Condell gave one last
look round and then shouted "Fire!" through the voice-tube which led to the gunboat's little
turret.  Immediately there came a deafening roar and a tremendous concussion, as the two 70-pounders
hurled forth their shells at the Huascar, and a dense cloud of white smoke drifted down upon
the conning-tower, filling it with acrid fumes and momentarily blotting out the view.

When it cleared away it was seen that it had been a most lucky discharge, for one shell had
struck full upon the monitor's military mast, causing it to fall lengthwise along the ship,
partly wrecking the funnel and a number of ventilators, while the other had apparently penetrated
an open gun-port and thus reached some part of the ship's boiler-room, for columns of steam
were seen issuing from every available opening on the monitor's midship section.

"Load again, men; load again!" cried Douglas, quite forgetting himself in the excitement of
the moment.

"Another discharge like that, and we shall have the fellow completely crippled.  Hurrah for
the gallant little Covadonga!"

He was recalled to his senses by a short, sharp laugh from Condell, who remarked, with a grim
smile: "Surely, Senor Douglas, you are not going to take away the command of my ship from me,
are you?"

Jim, of course, promptly apologised, explaining that it was owing to the excitement that he
had forgotten himself, but Condell told him to think no more of it, as it was the sort of spirit
that he liked to see a young man display.  There was little time for conversation, however,
for the Huascar, as though in revenge for the damage inflicted by her puny enemy, again discharged
her whole broadside--or at least so much of it as was still capable of being fired; and the
marksmanship was so excellent that every missile again struck the Covadonga, while at the same
moment the Union again started firing with her bow-guns, and a 100-pounder shell struck the
gunboat full upon the stern, blowing a huge hole in it, killing four men, and shooting away
the ensign-staff and flag.

When the smoke cleared away Douglas saw that their flag was gone, and at the same time heard
the sound of cheering coming across the water from the Huascar--the Peruvians were under the
impression that the gunboat had struck!  But they were soon to be undeceived, for Jim rushed
out of the conning-tower and down below, presently reappearing with another ensign under his
arm.  He then ran aft and proceeded to fix the spare staff, under a perfect hail of rifle-bullets
from the monitor and corvette, and, having done so, ran up the flag amid cheers from the Covadonga.
Then he went forward once more to his place in the conning-tower, which he reached just as
Condell gave orders for the battery of 70-pounders to be fired again.

"Bravely done, gallantly done, my young friend," said the skipper, as Jim made his appearance;
"I won't forget that action of yours if we come through all right."

Both of the Covadonga's shells at this moment burst on board the monitor, one of them blowing
her short squat funnel clean over the side, while the other, by one of the strange happenings
of war, entered her hull through the same gun-port as the previous shell, working still further
havoc in the Huascar's engine-room.

The gunboat had by this time drawn considerably ahead of the monitor, and Condell soon saw
that the latter was too seriously crippled in her engines to pursue.  Yet she still continued
firing with deadly effect, and the Union was slowly but surely creeping up astern.  The skipper
therefore ordered his men to turn their whole attention to the corvette and try to disable
her also, since they would soon be beyond the range of the Huascar's guns.  Every weapon was
thereupon trained astern, and the accuracy of the little gunboat's fire was soon apparent,
for on board the corvette one of the forward 100-pounders was dismounted and silenced, several
Nordenfeldts were damaged and put out of action, and a luckily placed solid shot struck the
Union's foremast full upon the cap, wrecking it and bringing the upper spars down, with disastrous
effect to the men on deck below.

Indeed it began to look as though the plucky little ship would escape after all, for she was
now beyond range of all but the Huascar's heaviest guns, while the Union had been obliged to
slacken speed considerably in order to enable her to get her wreckage cleared away. But Condell
surmised that the Peruvians must have shrewdly guessed at his destination, and he knew that
they would not give up the chase so long as there was a chance of getting him again under their
guns. Moreover, he had still nearly three hundred and fifty miles to go before he could reach
safety,--more than a day and a half's steaming!

The Covadonga very soon ran the Huascar hull-down, and had left the corvette about five miles
astern before the latter got the wreckage of her foremast cleared away and resumed her pursuit
at full speed; but Condell had improved the shining hour by putting his own little ship to
rights, and getting up more powder and shell in readiness for the renewed attack which he knew
must come.

Day had just begun to dawn when the Union again opened fire, and her first shell unluckily
cut the tiller-chains on board the gunboat, so that the Covadonga very nearly ran up on the
beach before the chain could be repaired and the ship again got under control; indeed, Jim
distinctly felt her keel scrape as she ran over a shoal which stretched out about half a mile
into the sea.  By the greatest good fortune, however, she got clear, and again resumed her
attempt at escape.  But the Peruvian ship had by this time lessened her distance to about two
miles, and was firing so accurately that nearly every shot came aboard Condell's little ship,
which, however, still continued to reply pluckily, and with such precision that she did a considerable
amount of damage to the Union.

Then suddenly it seemed as though the end had come, for a particularly well-aimed shell came
hurtling into the Covadonga, close to her rudder-post, almost entirely destroying the rudder,
and smashing one of the blades clean off the propeller.  As a consequence, her speed immediately
dropped to about five knots, and Condell ground his teeth with rage.  If they could but have
held out a little longer all might have been well, and he might have escaped into one of the
shallow bays abounding on the coast where there was too little water for his heavily armed
enemy to follow.  He felt that it was cruelly hard.  But the brave skipper was not yet beaten;
far from it.  He was determined to fight to the bitter end and, if need be, go down with his
colours flying and guns firing, as did his friend and brother officer, Arturo Prat, on board
the Huascar at the battle of Iquique Bay, in which he, Condell, also took part.  Surrender?
No; perish the thought!

"Two columns of smoke approaching from the southwest, sir," suddenly reported Douglas, who
had been attentively gazing southward through the slit in the conning-tower, "and we are raising
them so fast that they must be steaming hard, whoever they may be.  Is it possible, I wonder,
that they are two of our ships brought up by the firing?"

"Where, Senor Douglas?  Allow me to look!" ejaculated Condell excitedly. "By all that's wonderful,
if you are right it means that we are saved! Be so good as to bring me my glass, young man,
as quickly as possible. Every moment is now very precious."

Douglas was back in less than a minute, carrying the telescope, by the aid of which it was
presently seen that the approaching steamers were undoubtedly warships; one of them having
very much the appearance of the Magellanes, while the other, a corvette, might be either the
O'Higgins or the Chacabuco.

Condell looked long at the approaching ships, and then turned to look at the Union.  The Peruvian
was fast coming up astern, and could not now be more than a mile away.  She was still firing
remorselessly into the gunboat, and apparently had not noticed the smoke columns.

"Now," shouted Condell to his men, "there is the Union, and yonder are two of our ships coming
up.  We will stand and fight where we are, for we can no longer run; and we must endeavour
to disable the Peruvian so effectually that she will fall an easy prey to the Chilian ships.
When once we get to close grips we must keep her so busy that she will not have time to look
round her until our friends are close aboard, when we will hand her over to their tender mercies!
To quarters again, my brave hearts, and may God defend the right!"

A rousing cheer answered his words, and the men returned to their guns full of hope and with
renewed energy.  They opened such a furious fire upon the Peruvian that she fairly reeled under
the impact of that storm of missiles.  But she nevertheless came on, unchecked, and a few minutes
later ranged up, broadside on to the Covadonga, at a distance of about seven hundred yards,
when the action at once became close and fierce.

In less than a minute the Chilian gunboat had her mizzen-mast shot away close to the deck,
her funnel riddled by machine-gun bullets, and every man not under cover killed.  But the survivors
sheltered themselves behind the gun-shields, and manfully replied with every weapon still capable
of firing.  The Union lost her captain and first lieutenant during the first few minutes of
the renewed encounter, her mainmast came down by the board, having been struck, fair and square,
by one of the Covadonga's 70-pounder shells, and all her small boats were in a few minutes
utterly destroyed by the storm of shot from the gunboat's gatling-guns.

Then, suddenly, the Covadonga observed a wild commotion on board the Union, and her screw begin
to revolve once more, while columns of black smoke pouring out of her shot-torn funnel showed
that there was a considerable amount of activity in her engine-room.  Then she began to forge
ahead and, turning slowly to starboard, headed away to the north. She had caught sight of the
approaching Chilian craft, and meant to effect her escape while the way still lay open to her.

Jim saw a man run aft and dip the Peruvian ensign three times in a mock farewell salute, while
the white water began to boil out from under the Union's stern.  She was in full retreat, firing
with her stern guns as she went.  But Condell had no intention of permitting her to escape
so easily.  His ship would still steer, after a fashion, if she was not driven too hard, and
he immediately took up a slow pursuit, hoping against hope that he might still be able to plump
a lucky shell into her which should destroy either rudder or propeller, and so leave her at
the mercy of the new arrivals, which were rapidly coming up, and which could now be plainly
made out as being the Magellanes, gunboat, and the Chacabuco, corvette.

The Peruvian was going away fast enough, however, to take her soon out of range of the Covadonga.
But the Magellanes and Chacabuco, as they rushed past the gunboat cheering, now began to fire
at the flying ship, and several of their shells burst aboard her.  As the Chacabuco passed
she made the signal "Proceed forthwith to Valparaiso, and report that I am chasing to the northward.
Good luck and congratulations." The two ships swept rapidly away in chase of the Peruvian,
and the Covadonga, obeying orders and resuming her voyage, made the best of her way to Valparaiso,
which she reached the following evening, dropping her anchor in the middle of the assembled
Chilian fleet, to the accompaniment of rousing cheers for her gallant conduct at Iquique Bay
and Punto Gruesos.

Jim then bade good-bye to Captain Condell and returned to his own ship, the Blanco Encalada,
where he was most enthusiastically received by all his friends, an especially warm welcome
being extended to him by his chum Terry O'Meara.

CHAPTER EIGHT.

MINE AND COUNTERMINE.

Jim found, upon rejoining the Blanco Encalada, that there was great excitement prevailing aboard
that ship; for the fleet had received orders to sail, that very day, for the port of Arica,
and the squadron was only waiting for Commodore Riveros, who had superseded Rebolledo Williams,
to come aboard to start.

There were numerous rumours flying about the Blanco as to the object of the cruise northward;
but the one which obtained most credence was to the effect that the Chilian fleet had been
instructed to find and destroy the Huascar, Union, and Pilcomayo, which were waging a destructive
war against the Chilian commerce, and which, it was very strongly suspected, had been guilty
of certain acts against Chilian and other craft which more nearly resembled piracy than civilised
warfare. So much damage, indeed, had been wrought by them that the Chilian Government had decided
to hunt down the obnoxious craft; and for this purpose there were now assembled in Valparaiso
harbour the Almirante Cochrane and Blanco Encalada, both battleships, the corvette O'Higgins,
and the armed merchant-steamers Loa and Mathias Cousino.  The little gunboat Covadonga had
also been intended to sail with the squadron, but, as has been seen, she had been too badly
damaged in her gallant fight with the Peruvian vessels to permit of her doing so.

Mid-day came, but it brought no sign of the commodore; and it was three o'clock in the afternoon
before his launch was seen to steam away from the naval steps at the jetty.  The side was then
piped, and Riveros came on board, to the accompaniment of the flagship's band and a crashing
salute from the other vessels in the harbour.  Upon his arrival on board he immediately went
below to his cabin and sent for his captain, with whom he was in close conference for about
an hour.  Apparently he informed him as to the plan of campaign, for soon after Captain Castello
came on deck it became known, all over the ship, that a telegram had been received from a Chilian
spy in Arica to the effect that the Huascar and the Union were to call in at that port in about
three days' time, and that they would be detained there for about a week in order to effect
certain repairs.  Therefore, should the Chilians sail immediately, suggested the telegram,
they would be almost certain to catch their prey without difficulty.  It was also within the
bounds of possibility that the Pilcomayo and Manco Capac might likewise be there; and in that
case, since the opposing forces would be pretty evenly matched, there was every prospect of
a general engagement being fought, a prospect which aroused the keenest enthusiasm of every
man in the fleet, and more especially that of such young hot-bloods as Jim and his friend O'Meara,
to say nothing of Lieutenant Montt, who was being transferred, to his great gratification,
from the Covadonga to the Blanco Encalada.

A few minutes after Captain Castello had come on deck the bugles shrilled out, "Clear lower
deck.  Hands up anchor!" and the seamen came tumbling up from below, happy and eager as a parcel
of schoolboys off for a holiday.  A string of signal-flags soared aloft to the Blanco's mainyard-arm,
and half an hour later her screw began to revolve as she led the way out of the harbour, with
the other ships following, in column of line ahead.

It was five o'clock in the afternoon of October 1, 1879, and the cruise had begun which was
to prove so eventful for at least two of the ships comprising the squadron.  As they passed
out to sea with ever-increasing speed the forts on either side of the bay fired a farewell
salute; and the spectacle of the sun sinking over Monte Bajo and the Centinela Alto, coupled
with the lurid flashes of flame and clouds of white smoke from Forts San Antonio, Bueras, Valdivia,
and the Citadel, constituted a picture the grandeur of which Jim never forgot.

A very careful look-out was maintained during the progress of the fleet up the coast, and Commodore
Riveros took the precaution to look into Chaneral Bay, Cobija, and Iquique, to make quite sure
that the Peruvians--who might possibly have got wind of the expedition--should have no chance
of escaping by lying hidden until the Chilians were past, and then making a sudden dash southward
upon the comparatively defenceless ports of the lower coast.

There was, however, no sign of the enemy anywhere in any of these places, and all the news
that Riveros was able to pick up tended to confirm the telegram which he had received at Valparaiso,
to the effect that the Peruvians would certainly be found at Arica.  Having, therefore, made
certain that they had left no enemy in their rear, the Chilians steamed away from Iquique on
the 3rd of October, and arrived at a point ten miles to the south of Arica at three o'clock
the next morning, where the fleet hove to, in order to allow of a council of war being held
by the commodore and captains in the cabin of the Blanco Encalada.

The captains of the Cochrane and the O'Higgins were in favour of an attack by the whole squadron
upon the Peruvian fleet supposed to be lying in the harbour, but the commodore, with the captains
of the Loa and Mathias Cousino, opposed that plan, on the grounds that the harbour was very
strongly defended by forts; consequently, if such an attack were carried out the Chilians would
be obliged to silence the batteries before they could turn their attention to the Peruvian
ironclads.  The scheme favoured by Riveros, and which was ultimately carried out, was to send
in a number of steam-launches from the ships, each armed with a couple of spar-torpedoes, and
try to blow up the Peruvian ships.  The commodore's argument was that they would almost certainly
be successful, if the attack were properly made; while, if it were to fail, the Peruvians would
be certain to come out of port in pursuit of the torpedo-boats, and find themselves face to
face with the Chilian fleet, and beyond the protection of the shore batteries.

This having been decided upon, the captains returned to their ships, and the squadron once
more headed northward, at a speed of about five knots, finally coming to an anchor some four
miles away from Arica, but completely hidden from it by the headland of Santa Catharina, which
forms the southern extremity of the bay.  The steam-launches of the Almirante Cochrane and
the Blanco Encalada were then lowered into the water, together with a small Hereschoff torpedo-boat
which the O'Higgins had brought up on her deck.  These little craft all rendezvoused at the
flagship, and spar-torpedoes were hastily fitted to all three, one projecting from the bow
of each boat.  As the expedition was likely to be an extremely hazardous one, Commodore Riveros
decided to call for volunteers to man the torpedo-boats; and Jim Douglas and Jorge Montt were
the first two officers who presented themselves for the service, while Terry O'Meara asked
to be allowed to accompany his chum, should the latter be accepted, to take charge of the engines
of the boat in which Jim was to go.

At length the commodore decided to send Jim in charge of the Blanco's torpedo-boat, with Terry
O'Meara in charge of the engines.  Montt was to take command of the Cochrane's launch; and
a man named Juarez was given the command of the Hereschoff torpedo-boat, which was a craft
of about sixteen tons displacement.  Jim, as being second lieutenant of the flagship, was given
the command of the little squadron; and, after half an hour's interview with the commodore,
during which he received the most minute instructions as to how he was to proceed, he went
over the Blanco Encalada's side into her steam-launch, and gave the signal to start.

There was no cheering at their departure, for all those who were left behind felt that they
might never see their comrades again; moreover, it was necessary to maintain the strictest
silence, since, the night being very still, sounds would carry to an immense distance over
the water. If suspicion were once aroused on shore, it would mean the absolute annihilation
of the brave fellows who had started on their desperate errand.  The fleet, of course, showed
no lights, and neither did the three torpedo--boats; consequently, within a minute after the
latter had started the darkness swallowed them up completely, and there was no telling whereabout
they were, or what progress they were making.

Jim had, however, most carefully taken his bearings before leaving the flagship, and, by the
help of the chart and compass, knew exactly where to find the fleet again when his perilous
mission had been accomplished. He steamed along northward over the three or four miles which
separated him from Arica in extended column of line abreast, so that the chances of detection
should be as much reduced as possible, and so that they could pick up any small craft which
might perchance be cruising about in the neighbourhood; and he had already arranged a simple
code of signals, whereby the three small steamers might communicate with one another without
attracting undue attention to themselves.

Half an hour after pushing off from the Blanco Encalada, the flotilla came abreast of the southern
extremity of Santa Catharina island, and Jim knew that in another five minutes he would obtain
a full view of the harbour, when he would also know whether his intended prey lay in the roads
or not.  The heart of every man in the little flotilla beat fast, and his breath came thickly
under the stress of the intense excitement of the moment; and Jim, from his position in the
stern of the Blanco's launch, tried to pierce the darkness with his eyes to get the first glimpse
of the Peruvian vessels.

A moment later the three boats, closer together now, swept round the northern end of the island,
and Arica roadstead lay in full view before them.

It was now the hour before the dawn, and consequently the night was at its darkest, but Jim
could hardly repress a cry of delight as he caught sight of four indistinct, dark masses, looming
up on the surface of the bay.  There were no lights showing anywhere, save in one or two isolated
houses on shore, where sickness probably kept the inmates awake; but he had not expected to
find any lights showing among the Peruvian fleet, since they would naturally desire to keep
their whereabouts hidden from chance Chilian prowlers.  But in Jim's mind there was no doubt
that the four shapeless blurs lying close together, about half a mile away, were the vessels
of which he had come in search; and he passed the word to the other launches to select each
her own particular vessel, torpedo her, and then steam away back to the Chilian fleet.  He
himself intended to be responsible for two of the Peruvians, while his consorts were instructed
to take one a-piece.  No conditions, he thought to himself, could have been more favourable
to the enterprise.  So far as he could make out, no suspicion had been aroused that the Chilians
were in the vicinity; the night was dark, and the town seemed to be asleep.  In fact, their
enemies appeared to be indulging in a feeling of security from which they would awake--too late!

The order was now passed for the launches to ease down to half-speed, so that the sound of
the churning propellers might be less perceptible, and the three boats crept forward almost
in complete silence upon their prey.  Jim could now plainly make out the brig-rig of the monitor
Huascar, and the three masts and single funnel of the corvette Union, and these two ships he
intended to account for with his own torpedo-boat.  Away to the right, close under the forts,
and about four hundred yards from the Huascar, lay what looked like a couple of other monitors.
He had quite expected, or at least hoped, to find one other monitor there, the Manco Capac,
but not a third; for, according to the information received, the fourth ship should have been
the Pilcomayo gunboat.  But, no matter; it would be as easy to blow up an ironclad monitor
as a gunboat; and Jim ordered each of the other two torpedo- boats to select one of the monitors
lying under the forts, while he himself steamed toward the vessels which he took to be the
Huascar and the Union.

After waiting about five minutes, to allow of the other two launches getting close to their
objectives, Jim inquired in a low tone if all was in readiness; and upon being informed that
everything was prepared, called in a whisper to Terry O'Meara, "Full speed ahead, and give
her every ounce of steam she can carry!"

In response to this command the little steamer's propeller suddenly started to revolve at a
tremendous rate under the pressure of steam which Terry let into the cylinders; her stern dipped
several inches deeper into the water, and with a rippling noise like that of tearing silk at
her bows, she darted toward the nearest ship, which Douglas took to be the Huascar, and which
could not have been more than five hundred yards away.

Nearer and nearer they rushed, the men in the bows craning their necks eagerly forward to see
where the torpedo would strike, and Jim, in the stern, crouching over the tiller and holding
his boat's bows fair and square for the middle of his prey.  It occurred to him, for a moment,
as being rather curious that even now he could detect no signs of life aboard either of the
Peruvian ships, for he had fully calculated on the launches being seen and an alarm raised
ere he had approached so close. But no suspicion entered his mind, and he thanked his lucky
stars that he had been fortunate enough to catch the enemy totally unprepared.  It would make
his task so much the easier.

Now the little steamer was quite close to the Peruvian monitor, and in a few seconds more the
blow would be struck which would send a warship and her entire crew to the bottom.  Oh, the
fools! he thought to himself, not to take more care of their ship.  They were doomed; nothing
could now save them; success was within his grasp.  Five seconds more--then three--then two.
Now the spar with its deadly torpedo was almost touching the Huascar's side--

Crash!

A rending sound of ripping and tearing timber and another awful crash came immediately afterward,
and every man in the Blanco Encalada's launch was hurled off his feet, and thrown either into
the bottom of the boat or overboard, while the little steamer's bows rose bodily out of the
water until her keel reached an angle of almost forty-five degrees, and there she stuck, still
quivering in every timber from the shock.

In a second Jim realised the terrible truth.  By some means or other the Peruvians had got
wind of the intended attack, and had placed a stout boom of timber all round the ship, and
it was upon this obstacle that the Chilian launch had charged at full speed, running right
up on to it with the force of the blow, and remaining there immovable and almost a wreck.

Jim's first thought was of how to warn the people in the other two launches, for if the enemy
had been prepared for attack in one quarter, he would certainly have taken the same precautions
in the other.  Ah, yes!  There were several blue rockets in a locker in the stern-sheets; these
would serve to show that something had gone wrong, and might perhaps save the others from a
similar mishap.

Jim scrambled out of his seat and was just raising the locker lid when a long streak of flame
burst from the Huascar's side.  There was a deafening, thudding roar, and a stream of machine-gun
bullets screeched and hummed over their heads.  They had indeed walked right into a cunningly
contrived trap, and the Peruvians had been on the watch for them the whole time.

The next minute there was a dull roar away to starboard, and Jim saw, out of the corner of
his eye, a huge column of water leap up, with something dark poised upon the top of it.  In
a second he realised that one at least of his consorts had been successful and had torpedoed
her prey; but even before the column of water had subsided, there broke out a crash of musketry
aboard the second monitor, and sparks of fire sprang up in different parts of her, which quickly
brightened into a lurid glare and showed that her people were lighting beacon-fires, the better
to see who their attackers might be and their whereabouts.

Truly it was the Chilians who had been taken by surprise, not their enemies!  And what a mess
they had made of it all, too!

But there was no time now to think about the other launches; they would have to look after
themselves; for Jim's whole energies were now directed toward the saving of his own boat's
crew.  After the first volley of machine-gun fire from the ship which he had attacked, the
Peruvians got their aim right, and sent a perfect hail of Gatling, Nordenfeldt, and rifle-bullets
hurtling into the wrecked launch, so that her men began to fall in all directions.  Beacon-fires
were also lighted in bow and stern and at amidships, so that the vivid red glare shed a lurid
radiance over everything within a hundred yards.  And by their light Douglas saw that the ship
which he had attacked was not the Huascar at all; neither was the craft lying close to her
the Union! They were a pair of old hulks, roughly metamorphosed so as to resemble the warships,
and heavy barriers of floating timber had been thrown out all round them, while they had been
armed with machine-guns and crowds of riflemen.  The monitor and the corvette had escaped out
of Arica harbour to continue their depredations elsewhere, and the Pilcomayo had probably gone
with them.  The Chilians had walked into a cleverly set trap and were paying dearly for their
mistake.

Jim quickly recovered his presence of mind, and springing out of the launch while the bullets
whistled about his ears, started to examine the boat in order to ascertain whether she were
still seaworthy.  He soon discovered that although there were numerous holes in her planking,
they were all above the water-line, as luck would have it, and although a long piece of her
keel was gone, it had not started the boat's timbers so far as he could see.

"Now, boys," he shouted, "if we can get the launch back into the water we may escape after
all.  Who will lend me a hand?"

The men needed no second bidding, but sprang to their young leader's assistance, and worked
with all the energy of despair.  Man after man fell under the deadly hail of fire from the
hulk, but as fast as they fell others took their places, until at last, under their furious
exertions, the little steamer began to quiver, and then moved slightly backward off the boom.
There was an ominous cracking of timber for a few seconds, as some part of her splintered planking
caught in the obstruction, and then, with a rending, tearing noise, it gave way, and the launch
slid into the water of the bay, shipping a ton or two of it over her stern as she splashed
in.  But she was afloat once more, and could she only come unscathed through that inferno of
bullets, the few remaining members of her crew might, even yet, hope to escape at last.

"Into the boat with you," cried Jim; "into the boat, all but four men. You, Terry, get to your
engines, and give me all the steam you can, while the others bale the boat clear of all that
water.  Now, you four men," he went on, "I am going to ask you to help me in a very dangerous
task.  I am not going to leave this ship with my duty unfinished.  I intend to torpedo her,
at all hazards!  Cut loose that spar at once, and we will place it along the boom in such a
way that the torpedo touches this ship's side.  I will then cut a short length of fuse, and
attach it to the explosive, so that it will burn for about a minute.  That will just give us
time to get out of reach before the powder blows up, and will not leave the Peruvians sufficient
to displace the torpedo.  Now then, grapple hold of the spar, you four men, and stand by to
push all together when I give the word.  Be ready, Terry, my boy, to go ahead with your engines
directly we scramble on board, for a second's delay may mean that we shall all be blown to
smithereens.  Give me that piece of fuse, Carlos.  There, that has fixed that up," continued
Douglas, as he cut and placed the slow match in the opening provided for it.  "Now then, all
together--lift!"

As Jim gave the word the men gripped the spar, lifted it, and pushed it forward until the pointed
barrel-like apparatus at its further extremity touched the ship's side.  The Peruvians up above
were by this time aware of what the Chilians contemplated, and turned all their attention to
the men engaged upon the dangerous task of fixing the spar, thus giving those in the launch
a welcome respite.

But owing to the hulk's high bulwarks and her great amount of "sheer," they could not fire
directly into Jim's party, and the bullets plugged harmlessly into the boom about a yard behind
the Chilians.  Jim then ordered the men to place all their weight upon the spar, and this having
been done, he clambered nimbly along it until he came to the torpedo. Then he rearranged the
fuse, struck a match and applied it.

There immediately began a violent splutter of sparks, accompanied by a fizzing noise, and Jim
knew that no power on earth could now avert the imminent explosion.  Like a cat he worked his
way backwards along the spar, which bent and heaved under his weight, until presently he stood
once more upon the beam.

"Now, there's no time to waste," gasped Douglas, as the five men stood in the shelter of the
hulk's tall sides.  "We must make a rush all together, and trust to getting aboard the launch
unhit.  But if any of us are wounded, the wounded must remain where they are; for any attempt
at rescue will mean the death of us all.  Now then--go!"

As one man the five brave fellows sprang forward, hoping to reach the launch before the Peruvians
were ready for them.  But the latter were on the look-out, and as the men left their shelter,
rifles and machine-guns cracked and roared once more.  Two men fell, literally riddled with
shot, but the others scrambled aboard the launch, and Jim gasped out, "Go ahead, Terry!" not
a moment too soon.

The launch had not got more than fifty yards away when there was an appalling explosion, and
the whole side of the hulk seemed to fall bodily inward.  She heeled over, and almost instantly
plunged into the depths of the bay, the waters of which at once closed over her, dragging down
the living and the dead, in the fearful vortex which she created.

Jim then sent up a blue rocket to call the other boats away, for it was hopeless to attempt
anything farther that night, and half an hour later he was rejoined, just as day was dawning,
by the Almirante Cochrane launch, which was almost in a worse state than his own.  She brought
word that the two monitors had been the Manco Capac and Atahualpa, and that the Hereschoff
torpedo-boat, under Juarez, had blown up the latter, but had herself been destroyed by the
Manco Capac.  Three men only had been rescued from her crew, and these were on board the Cochrane's
boat, which had herself lost nearly three-quarters of her men.  Taking it all round, however,
the attacking force had not done so badly, having destroyed a two thousand-ton ironclad and
sunk a hulk full of men and guns, with a loss of one small torpedo-boat, and seventeen men killed.

Jim then gave orders for the wounded to be made as comfortable as possible under the circumstances,
and the two launches continued their journey back to the fleet, which was reached about eight
o'clock.  The young man immediately made his report to the commodore, and the latter, who seemed
to have no mind of his own, then called another council of officers to decide whether they
should enter the bay and destroy the Manco Capac and the forts, or whether they should take
up the pursuit of the other three Peruvian warships which had eluded them in so mysterious a way.

It was unanimously decided to pursue, so as to prevent them from doing any further damage;
and Riveros therefore divided his squadron into two parts, consisting of the Almirante Cochrane
and Blanco Encalada in one division; and the O'Higgins, Loa, and Mathias Cousino in the other.
One column, consisting of the three latter vessels, was to steam a hundred miles due westward,
and then head south, while the admiral would proceed in the same direction, but would keep
close in along the coast.

These arrangements having been made, the captains returned to their respective ships, the anchors
were raised, and the fleet separated into two divisions--one going south direct, and the other
going west in the first instance.

CHAPTER NINE.

THE BATTLE OF ANGAMOS.

Although somewhat disappointed at their failure to find the Peruvian fleet lying in Arica Bay,
the men on board the Blanco Encalada looked forward, with all the pleasure of anticipation,
to the time when they should overtake the marauding warships, bring them to action, and destroy
them.  And Commodore Riveros' offer of a hundred pesos to the man who should first sight the
enemy, only increased the anxiety of the flagship's crew to fever-heat, and men were to be
found aloft upon the look-out at all hours of the day and night.  It had been made known, too,
that Captain Latorre, who had been promoted to the Almirante Cochrane, had also offered a similar
reward; and every man aboard the Blanco made up his mind that his ship should have the honour
of bringing the Peruvians to action.

Leaving Arica on the 4th of October, the inshore squadron, with the flagship leading the way,
steamed slowly down the coast, exploring every nook and cranny where the enemy might by any
possibility be lurking--for it was evident that they must have been hiding somewhere when the
Chilians had steamed northward a few days before.  But no sign of an enemy was seen during
that day, nor during the next, in and on the 6th the fleet steamed into the harbour of Mejillones
de Bolivia, in order to coal.

Commodore Riveros, bearing in mind his own attempt on the Peruvians at Arica, and feeling convinced
that their fleet must be somewhere close at hand, gave the strictest orders that no men should
be allowed to go ashore, and that a patrol of steam-launches should ply up and down the harbour
the whole night through, in order to prevent the attempt of similar tactics on the part of
the enemy.  He had also seen fit to express approval of the manner in which Jim Douglas had
carried out the task assigned to him in Arica Bay, and he therefore sent for him to his cabin
and informed the young man that he was to take command, in the Blanco Encalada's launch, of
the flotilla which was to do patrol-duty during the night--a circumstance which afforded Jim
the utmost satisfaction, and emboldened him to ask as a favour that Terry O'Meara should again
be allowed to accompany him; to which request Riveros immediately acceded.

Night came on with no sign of the enemy; but as Mejillones was in Bolivia, and had only very
recently been occupied by the Chilians, the danger was almost as likely to come from the direction
of the shore as from the sea, as the port was full of Bolivian and Peruvian refugees who would
stop at nothing to effect the destruction of part of the Chilian fleet.  As soon as the dusk
began to fall, the launches of the two ironclads were hoisted out, their crews picked, and
at half-past six Jim and his friend Terry took their places in the flagship's boat, which steamed
off slowly in one direction round the harbour, while that of the Almirante Cochrane started,
under easy steam, in the opposite direction.  Both launches were provided with a Gatling gun
in the bows, and their crews were armed with rifles and revolvers, and orders had been given
that any strange craft upon failing to answer a challenge should be fired into immediately.

It occupied the launches about an hour, running under easy steam, to circumnavigate Mejillones
harbour, and Jim's boat had already made her round five or six times without any suspicious
circumstance occurring, and he himself was beginning to feel very tired and sleepy, when about
a mile and a half away, at the northern extremity of the bay, he fancied he saw a spark of
light flare up for a moment and then go out suddenly, as though hastily quenched.

He was broad awake immediately, with every sense on the alert, and he strained his eyes into
the darkness--for there was only a very thin crescent moon shining--in order to try to make
out where the light had come from and what had caused it.

"Terry," he whispered to his chum, who was sitting drowsily over the little engines, with the
starting lever loosely clutched in his hand, "did you catch sight of a glimmer of light away
there to the northward just now?"

"Light?  No; I saw no light," replied Terry, suddenly pulling himself together.  "Did you?
Whereabouts was it, old boy?  This continual going round and round has become rather monotonous,
and I am afraid that I was very nearly asleep."

"Well, it was over in that direction," explained Douglas, pointing, "and it looked as though
some one had suddenly opened the slide of a dark lantern, and as quickly closed it again. 
However, it may, of course, only have been my fancy--for I, like you, have been frightfully
sleepy for the last two hours; and in any case it could hardly have been an enemy, for the
light was quite two miles away from the ironclads.  No, I must have been-- Hallo! though, there
is the light again, and, by jingo! how quickly it is travelling over the water, too.  Here,
Terry, man, wake up!  There is something amiss, after all.  Go full speed ahead, for all you
are worth.  That light is heading straight for the Blanco Encalada, and if it should be an
enemy's boat which is carrying it we shall have all our work cut out to intercept her before
she reaches the flagship.  I wonder whereabouts the Cochrane launch is. She would be of great
assistance to us now.  Get every knot you can out of your engines, old man, for I fear foul play."

Terry O'Meara needed no second bidding, for he also had caught sight of the swiftly moving
point of light, and the circumstance reminded him very forcibly of their own attempt to torpedo
the Peruvian fleet lying in Arica Bay.  He pushed over his regulator to its top notch, and
started the weary stokers to the task of shovelling on coal with all possible dispatch.  The
tiny screw revolved faster and faster, churning and frothing the water up astern, and the launch
darted away like a greyhound slipped from the leash.  The seamen handled their rifles and revolvers,
to make sure that they were loaded, opening and closing the breaches with a smart click, while
the men in charge of the Gatling gun moved up forward, close to their weapon, and trained it
up and down, and from side to side, to assure themselves that the mechanism was in perfect
working order.

For a few seconds Douglas's heart seemed to stand still with anxiety, for it appeared as though
the launch would not be able to intercept the rapidly moving spark of light--which he was now
convinced belonged to a torpedo-boat--before it reached the Blanco Encalada, for which ship
the boat was undoubtedly heading.  But little by little, as soon as the engines got into their
swing, the launch drew ahead, and after about ten minutes' steaming Jim saw that he would,
all being well, cross the stranger's bows before she reached the flagship.

The launch was showing no lights, and the torpedo-boat--if such she was--was still too far
away for a hail to reach her.  Jim was therefore in hopes of taking her by surprise, and ordered
the men to maintain perfect silence, but to be ready to open fire directly he gave the word.

Closer and closer the two converging craft swept toward each other, until barely a quarter
of a mile separated them, and then, just at the critical moment, when Jim was about to shout
his challenge across the water, an accident happened which had well-nigh proved disastrous
for the Chilians.  A seaman who had remained behind in the cockpit was ordered to go forward
and join the crew of the Gatling gun, which it was now discovered was one man short, and in
clambering along the narrow strip of deck which ran round the little steamer the man stumbled
and dropped his rifle.  Unluckily, the weapon fell muzzle downward, and the fixed bayonet dropped
edgewise into the tiny crank-pit.  There was a sudden shock and a noise of cracking metal,
and the screw ceased revolving with a jerk that shook the launch from stem to stern, while
her way, of course, fell off immediately.

"Caramba!" ejaculated Jim, keeping one eye fixed upon the spark of light which was now rapidly
travelling past them, "if we can't put that machinery right in two minutes, then--good-bye
to the Blanco!  Quick, Terry, is there any hope, do you think?" he asked, dropping on one knee
beside his chum, who had already shut off steam and was crouching over the machinery.

"Wait a bit, Jim," replied Terry, working away like a madman with spanner and screw-wrench;
"if I can but loosen this nut I can disconnect this bent rod and replace it in half a jiffy."

The young man heaved and strained at the spanner, with the perspiration dripping off his forehead,
but he could not get the refractory nut to turn.  The stout steel handle quivered under the
strain, and Terry's muscles stood out on his bare arms like whipcord, but still the nut would
not budge.  In a second Jim threw his strength into the balance; the spanner showed signs of
slipping round the nut, but the next second it flew round, and the nut gave at last.

It was then only a few seconds' work to take out the bent rod and replace it with a new one;
but the suspected torpedo-boat had by that time drawn ahead of the launch.  Jim, however, was
not the sort of man to say "die," and at his quick word of command the boat leaped forward
once more after the enemy, and under the increased pressure of steam due to the stoppage, actually
began to gain upon the chase.  Douglas put his hands to his mouth and sent a sharp challenge
ringing across the water toward her.  This was immediately followed by a slight commotion aboard
the suspected Peruvian, which showed that the hail had been heard; but there was no sign of
her stopping; indeed, the next second a strong volume of flame gushed up from her funnel, which
proved that her engineers had shovelled on more coal and turned on the forced draught.

Jim almost groaned in his agony of mind, for it seemed as though the accident to the launch
had doomed the flagship to destruction, and he was just about to order his men to fire the
Gatling gun at the dimly seen shape, in the hope of hitting her, despite the fact that the
smoke would hide the chase from him, when he saw a long steel-coloured shape glide past the
bows of his own boat.

His heart gave a great thump at the sight, for he knew that he had had a narrow escape from
death.  The torpedo-boat was not carrying a spar- torpedo, but was towing the infernal machine,
which she doubtless meant to drag under the flagship's bows.  It was one of the newly invented
Lay torpedoes, and a terrible weapon when effectively used.  But alarm at his own narrow escape
was swamped in the feeling of relief for the safety of the Blanco Encalada; for the torpedo-boat
would be obliged to manoeuvre a little to get her torpedo into place, and thus there was just
a chance that he might yet be able to intercept her.  In a second he had whirled the wheel
hard over and was off along the Peruvian's wake, telling the men to keep a bright look-out
for the torpedo, and to commence firing in the direction of the torpedo-boat.

Then the quick, metallic clatter of the Gatling broke out, mingled with the whip-like crack
of the rifles, and the darkness was illuminated by the vivid flashes of flame.  From the Peruvian
a series of hoarse screams, oaths, and yells told plainly enough that the Chilians had made
good practice, and that some at least of the hailing bullets had found their billets; but the
craft was all too surely drawing away, and it became a question whether, even now, the launch
would be in time to save the Blanco Encalada.

Suddenly Jim perceived a speck of fire break out aboard the flagship, which quickly broke into
a great glow of flame, and he heaved a sigh of relief which was almost a sob, for he knew that
her people had taken alarm from the firing and were prepared.  In a few seconds the beacon-
fire spread a lurid glare wide over the waters of the bay, and the Peruvian torpedo-boat was
plainly disclosed to view, together with a phosphorescent glimmer which indicated the position
of the deadly torpedo.

"Now, men!" cried the young Englishman, "now is your chance, while the light lasts.  Train
the gun on the torpedo, and fire at it until you hit it.  Riflemen, do the same, and remember
that the Blanco's safety depends upon your shooting."

"Ay, ay, sir!" responded the Chilians, and a second later the Gatling in the bows began to
chatter out its deadly message, while the seamen rapidly loaded and fired their rifles, in
the hope of destroying the infernal machine before it could reach the Blanco Encalada.  But,
try as they might, it seemed impossible to hit that fish-like object which dashed through the
water ahead of them.  Twice the Chilians had hit the torpedo-boat's helmsman, and twice he
had been replaced, while the shrieks that came from the boat itself testified to the execution
inflicted upon her crew.  Still she was creeping nearer and nearer to the flagship, the crew
of which were vainly trying to depress the muzzles of their great guns sufficiently to reach
the Peruvian, and but a few more short seconds were needed for the latter to complete her fell
work.

Then, all in a moment, the end came.  Jim did not know how it happened, whether it was due
to his own men, or to those on board the flagship; but a bullet struck the torpedo fair and
square.  The next instant there was a stunning concussion, and the water between pursuer and
pursued seemed to be blown into a great hollow sphere, the sides of which then rushed together
again, while a tall column of water heaped itself up fully thirty feet into the air, to collapse
into spray which drenched to the skin every man both in the torpedo-boat and in the launch.

A wild cheer broke out on board the Chilian launch and the Blanco Encalada, and their men now
turned all their attention to destroy the wasp which had just been deprived of its sting. 
The moment that her towed torpedo had exploded she was practically powerless for injury, and
she turned her nose seaward at once, hoping, by a desperate rush, to get clear away.  And so
she doubtless would, had it not been for the launch belonging to the Almirante Cochrane.

This craft had, like Jim's boat, several times made the circuit of the bay; and she was away
down at the south end of the harbour when her lieutenant in charge first heard the sounds of
firing.  He immediately guessed the cause and, putting his engines at full speed, raced along
toward the spot where he could see the rifles flashing, and before he had gone very far he
had the Blanco Encalada's beacon-fire to help him.

As the launch came rushing along toward her consort, Jim blew his steam- whistle three times
to attract her attention, and he was only just in the nick of time, for the Peruvian would
have been in front of the Cochrane's launch in another half-minute.  But like a hawk upon its
prey the Cochrane's boat dashed forward, her commander determining to hazard all in one stroke,
instead of using his guns.  He aimed straight for a point which the torpedo-boat must pass
in a few seconds, and went ahead full speed.

The impact was so violent that the Peruvian torpedo-boat collapsed like an eggshell, the Cochrane's
launch driving right over the wreck without doing herself any very serious injury.  The torpedo-boat's
boilers exploded as she sank, and probably killed every remaining man among her crew, for not
a single living being was to be found when the Chilians proceeded to search for the survivors.

This exciting little episode over, Jim and his consort resumed their patrol of the harbour
until daylight, when their long and trying vigil ceased.  The ships finished coaling by five
o'clock in the afternoon of the new day, and immediately stood out to sea, much to Douglas's
relief, for he felt that another night like the last would have been too much for him.  Once
outside the harbour, the two ironclads turned their heads to the south again; and Riveros made
the signal that Antofagasta was to be their next port of call.

It was 3:30 a.m. on the 8th of October when Jim was awakened by a stentorian cry from the deck
of "Two ships ahead!"  Galvanised into alertness he listened intently, and heard the officer
of the watch calmly reply, "Where away?"

There was a short pause, and then the seaman answered, "Three points on our port bow.  They
are hull-down; but there are two columns of smoke approaching at a great speed from the south-east.
They are about twelve miles away and, so far as I can make out, are just abreast of Point Angamos."

Jim did not wait to hear the reply of "Very good.  Keep your eye on the smoke, and report any
further developments," but jumped into his clothes and hurried up on deck just in time to hear
the bugles call "Hands on deck.  Clear ship for action."  It was quite evident that the smoke
could not be coming from the second Chilian division; for, in that case, there would have been
three columns of smoke instead of two.  Therefore the strangers could scarcely be other than
the long-sought-for Peruvian ships the Huascar and the Union.

A few seconds after the bugle had sounded the men came tumbling up on deck, full of excitement
at the idea of a fight; and with many a jovial laugh and jest they hurried away to their quarters.
Jim made the rounds, saw that the men were at their stations, that the guns were ready and
run out, and that plenty of ammunition had been supplied to the turrets, and then he reported
to the first lieutenant that the ship was "clear for action."  The first lieutenant at once
made his report to the captain, who, in turn, reported to Commodore Riveros, who had already
entered the conning-tower.  Several signals were made to the Almirante Cochrane, which was
steaming about a cable's-length astern; and the two ships surged forward in silence to the
encounter which was to seal the fate of Peru, to destroy her sea-power, and to go down to history
as the battle of Angamos.

Jim was wandering from gun to gun, seeing that everything was in order, and waiting for the
action to commence, when he heard a roar of anger and execration coming from the deck above,
and, running up from below, he saw that the ships were the Huascar and the Union, and that
they had turned tail, having evidently discovered the proximity of the Chilians, and were steaming
to the southward as fast as they could go. But Commodore Riveros had anticipated some such
action, and as the Blanco Encalada, owing to a foul bottom, could only steam about eight knots,
he sent forward in chase of the Peruvians the Cochrane, which was capable of nearly eleven knots.

Latorre's ship instantly leaped forward at full speed upon the signal being made, and Jim soon
observed through his telescope that the Cochrane was a good deal faster than the Peruvians,
and that she must inevitably overtake them in a few hours' time.  Riveros also sent word down
to his engine-room staff that the very last knot was to be got out of his ship, and the effect
of the increased steam-pressure was soon observable on the Blanco.

At about a quarter to eight there was another change of tactics on the part of the Peruvians.
The corvette Union, which up to that time had been keeping station on the Huascar's port quarter,
suddenly slowed down and passed under her stern, turned to the eastward, and made for Arica
under a full head of steam.

Jim Douglas immediately reported the occurrence to Commodore Riveros, who, after debating for
a minute or two as to whether or not he should follow the corvette, finally decided in favour
of pursuing the Huascar, as she was the more formidable craft of the two; and the Chilian ironclad
accordingly was kept on her previous course.  Jim then returned to his post, and kept his glass
fixed upon the flying steamers in front of him; and hardly had he taken up his position again
when he saw the Huascar put her helm over and head to the northward, steaming toward the Cochrane
and the Chilian flagship.

A second later he saw a brilliant flash of flame leap from the Huascar's turret; there was
a huge cataract of spray as the shot struck the water midway between herself and the Cochrane,
and then a cloud of greyish-green smoke spouted up on board the Chilian vessel, showing that
the shell had exploded on board her, somewhere about her bows.  The Almirante Cochrane did
not reply for several minutes, but silent and grim as death itself, she held steadily on her
course toward the monitor.

Then, when she had approached to within a distance of a little over a mile, she in turn opened
fire with both her forward turret-guns on the Huascar, and the battle of Angamos had begun
in real earnest.  The effect of the projectiles on board the Peruvian was terrible; for both
shells struck her on the port bow, penetrated her armour, and exploded inside her hull, and
thus temporarily jammed her turret-tracks, and covered the deck with debris.

Jim closed up his telescope with a snap, and made his way to the forward turret of the Blanco
Encalada to ascertain how long it would be before the gun captains thought they might effectively
open fire; for he was most anxious to share in the combat before all was over.  At that moment
the officer in the fire-top shouted the news that the range had now lessened to 3000 yards,
and the word was immediately given to fire both forward turret-guns.

A moment later there was a terrific gush of white flame, a cloud of fleecy smoke, and a tremendous
roar as both guns spoke simultaneously, followed by a hoarse, screaming roar as the shells
sped through the calm morning air toward their mark.  Both missiles struck on the unarmoured
portion of the Huascar's bows, and pierced her through and through, without exploding, however,
as the thickness of steel penetrated was insufficient to detonate the projectiles.  The Peruvian
at once replied with a shot from her 300-pounder, which struck the Blanco's navigating bridge
and blew it to pieces.

Meanwhile the Cochrane had by this time circled round, and was running on a course parallel
to that of the monitor, and at the same time driving her toward her consort, so that the unfortunate
ship was now between two fires.  Crash! crash! roared the guns as the two Chilian ironclads
converged upon their quarry; and so excellent was their gunnery that every shot told.  Half
an hour after the action had commenced the Huascar's tiller-chains were shot away, and she
at once yawed to starboard, almost in the track of the Cochrane.  Captain Latorre instantly
saw that this was his opportunity to ram, and he accordingly sent his ship straight at the
helpless Huascar.  But the aberrations of the Peruvian ship's course introduced an element
of uncertainty which defied calculation, and the result was that the Cochrane dashed past her
stern, missing her by a short five yards.

And now the Blanco Encalada closed in on the other side of the doomed ship, which was already
on fire in several places from the disastrous effect of the Chilian shells, and pounded her
mercilessly; while the Peruvians, on the other hand, fought their sorely pressed ship with
a desperate gallantry that excited the utmost admiration of their opponents, and in the face
of a perfect inferno of fire rove new tiller ropes.  But it was all to no purpose.  A shell
from the Blanco, fired by Jim's own hand, exploded immediately afterwards in her stern, killing
every man at the relieving-tackles, and causing the now almost wrecked ship again to fall out
of control.

It was at this moment that a shell from the Cochrane exploded right inside the Huascar's conning-tower,
and blew the gallant Peruvian admiral and one of his lieutenants to pieces.  It was clear that
the Peruvians were beaten, yet several brave spirits strove desperately to regain the control
of their ship, and, if it might be, break away to the northward and get clear.  But it was
too late; for a shell had already exploded in the engine-room and had penetrated one of the
boilers.

Lieutenant Garezon, the sole remaining Peruvian officer, then called a brief council of war,
at which it was resolved to sink the ship rather than yield; and orders were accordingly sent
to MacMahon, the chief engineer, to open the injection-valves and thus flood the vessel; but
even as the Scotsman set about his task a number of Peruvian seamen ran forward and waved white
cloths and towels, in token of surrender.

The Chilian fire immediately ceased, of course, but the battle was even yet not quite over,
for down below, in the seclusion of the engine-room, it was not known that the men on deck
had surrendered, and the engines were still kept moving.  The Chilians therefore reopened their
fire, and the Blanco Encalada rushed up close alongside the now fast-sinking monitor, intending
to ram her, but was stayed in her deadly purpose by the exhibition of fresh signals of surrender.

At length a boat, manned by a lieutenant, an engineer, half a dozen seamen, and four soldiers,
was dispatched from the Cochrane to go on board and take possession of the Huascar.  They met
with no resistance; and Jim, who, in a boat from the Blanco, had also boarded, at once rushed
below, just in time to prevent the Peruvian engineers from sinking the ship.  A little longer
delay and he would have been too late; for the Huascar had already nearly two feet of water
over her engine-room floor when he rushed in, revolver in hand, and many of the shot-holes
in the hull were by that time all but flush with the water's edge.  At the point of his pistol
he drove Macmahon and the other engineers away from the valves and closed them.  The battle
of Angamos was over at last.  The Huascar's men were then secured, a prize-crew placed on board,
and under escort of the Almirante Cochrane and Blanco Encalada she went under her own steam
into the harbour of Mejillones, where she was temporarily patched up and rendered more or less
seaworthy.

Two days later the three ships left in company for Valparaiso, where they arrived on the 14th
of October, amid the salutes of the forts and the frantic cheers of the populace, who were
thankful beyond measure to be freed from the menace of the Huascar, which, they had felt, might
attack any of their seaports during the absence of the Chilian fleet. Commodore Riveros was
promoted to be Rear-Admiral, Captain Latorre to be Commodore, and Jim was made First Lieutenant
of the Blanco Encalada.

CHAPTER TEN.

THE GUN-RUNNERS.

The ovation accorded to the victorious Chilians upon their return to Valparaiso was enthusiastic
in the extreme; the officers were everywhere feted and made much of; and Jim Douglas and Terry
O'Meara came in for a very large share of attention owing to the fact that they were British.
The sympathies of Great Britain had been decidedly turned in favour of Chili by the atrocities
which had been committed by the Peruvian fleet in its war against commerce, and by which English
ships had suffered to a very serious extent.

After the battle of Angamos Commodore--or rather Admiral as he was now-- Riveros had been greatly
exercised in his mind as to what course he should pursue with regard to the corvette Union.
She had effected her escape before the battle commenced, and when last seen was steaming in
the direction of Arica, the most southerly port which the Peruvians possessed.  She was a very
heavily armed ship, and was nearly, if not quite, as formidable as the Huascar had been, and
thus still constituted a standing menace to the unfortified ports of Chili. Riveros was in
a quandary, for he already had more work on his hands than he knew how to deal with; yet the
Chilians resident in the coast ports were clamouring for him to proceed to sea again and hunt
down the cruiser.  But he did not in the least know where to look for her; nor could he, by
the most diligent inquiry, gain any intelligence of her. She might be at any one of the numerous
Peruvian ports; and were he to go in search of her she would quite probably slip past him again
in the night, as she and the monitor had once before done.

The fleet had been lying at Valparaiso for nearly a month undergoing the repairs and refit
of which they so sorely stood in need, when one morning Jim, from his station on the Blanco
Encalada's bridge, where he was on duty, observed a signal flying from the official residence
of the Secretary for War.  In a moment he had his glass to his eye, and began to spell out
the signal, which, when completed, ran as follows: "Blanco Encalada.  Admiral Riveros to call
here without delay.  I have important orders for him."

"Hallo!" thought Jim, "what's in the wind now?  More work for somebody, I'll be bound.  I wonder
whether the Union has been up to any fresh tricks?  She has kept remarkably--suspiciously--quiet
for some time now."

Then the young man made his way down to the admiral's cabin and delivered the message, with
the result that the admiral's barge was piped away, and five minutes later Riveros was being
pulled across the sparkling blue waters of the bay, to learn what it was that Senor Baquedano
wanted to communicate to him.

Several hours elapsed before the gallant Chilian returned aboard, and when he finally did so
his first action was to send for Jim Douglas and request him to accompany him to his cabin.
Arrived there, the admiral closed the door, locked it, and then leaning across the table toward
Douglas, remarked in a low tone:

"Senor Douglas, I am paying you no empty compliment, when I say that I consider you a remarkably
efficient and promising young officer.  You have carried out, with the utmost credit to yourself,
several exceedingly difficult pieces of work, and for that reason I am going to detail you
for a service which I suspect will prove even more difficult than any which you have yet been
called upon to perform."

Jim bowed, and did his best not to look too pleased.

"As you, of course, are aware," continued the admiral, smiling, "we lost sight of the Union
corvette before the battle of Angamos, and as we had more important business on hand at the
moment, we were not able to pursue her; consequently she got clear away.  The Chilians in the
coast towns have for some time been living in mortal dread of her appearing, some fine day,
off one or another of their ports, and bombarding it; and for some weeks past I have been daily
expecting orders to sail in pursuit of her and to hunt her down.  We have, however, until to-day
had no definite news of her whereabouts upon which we could work.  But this afternoon I was
summoned ashore and informed by his Excellency, General Baquedano, that the Peruvians are expecting
several cargoes of arms from Europe, and he has been informed by one of our spies that the
Union has been dispatched to the mouth of the Straits of Magellan to convoy those vessels to
Callao, or whatever Peruvian port they are bound for. If, then, we dispatch a vessel down to
the Straits we are almost certain to fall in with the corvette and bring her to action; and
if we are lucky we may also secure the arms-carrying vessels.  That would of course be in itself
a service of inestimable value to our government, since if our enemies cannot obtain arms and
ammunition they will soon be obliged to give up the struggle.  To make a long story short,
you, Senor Douglas, are the man whom I have selected to perform this difficult, arduous, and
decidedly dangerous task.  We have recently purchased a steamer, which we have armed so powerfully
that she is to all intents and purposes a cruiser, and you will be given the command of her.
Your task is, as I have just explained, to hunt down and destroy the Union, and if possible
to capture the gun-running steamers which she has been sent to convoy.  This new cruiser of
ours has been named the Angamos, in honour of our recent victory; and I shall look confidently
to you to uphold the honour of her name.  She is quite ready to sail, and you must commission
her to-morrow, and sail the same day.  It is a very important service for so young a man as
yourself, but from what I have already seen of you I am confident of your ability to bring
your task to a successful termination.  That is all, I think, that I have to say to you, Senor
Douglas, except that, should you wish to do so, you have my permission to number your friend,
the young engineer, among your crew. Now, good day, young sir, and the best of good luck to you."

Jim saluted in silence, feeling rather at a loss to know what to say by way of thanks, and
marched out of the cabin, "as proud as a dog with two tails."  He had never anticipated anything
like this when he entered the Chilian service, and the news seemed almost too good to be true.
Yet he speedily pulled himself together and hurried off to find his friend O'Meara, whom he
came across in his cabin, smoking, and to whom he promptly imparted the joyful news.  And half
an hour later the two lads had packed up their slender stock of baggage and were quite ready
for their new adventure.  Bearing in mind the admiral's order that he should lose no time in
getting his new command ready for sea Jim, accompanied by his chum, went the rounds of the
flagship, saying good-bye to their numerous friends, who betrayed no little curiosity as to
the reason of the Englishmen's somewhat sudden departure.  But Jim thought it best to keep
his own counsel, and only enlightened the Chilians so far as to say that his friend and he
had been selected for a special service, the nature of which he was not at liberty to disclose.

A shore-boat was then signalled for, and upon her arrival alongside the two lads got into her
and had themselves and their baggage conveyed ashore, where they chartered another boat in
which they were rowed out to the Angamos.  The object of the double journey was to keep, as
far as possible, their movements secret.

Having arrived on board, Jim found that everything was in readiness for a start, except for
the fact that certain stores had not yet come off from the shore.  He mustered his crew aft,
however, and proceeded to read his commission to them.  His appointment to the command was
received with cheers of delight, for the crew was made up, for the most part, of men drafted
from the other ships of the squadron, consequently they either knew Jim personally or had heard
something of his exploits. They therefore knew what sort of commander they were sailing under,
and looked forward to a lively and adventurous cruise.  Douglas then sent the purser and a
few men ashore to hurry up the belated stores; and by midnight everything and everybody was
on board--and the ship ready.  But remembering Admiral Riveros' orders as to sailing on the
morrow, he waited until daybreak, and then signalled that everything was in readiness for his
departure, and inquired whether it was the admiral's pleasure that he should sail at once.
The answer promptly came back that the sooner he sailed the better; and Jim, ordering the saluting
guns to be manned and loaded, made his way with a proud step to the navigating bridge, and
rang his engines to half-speed ahead, the anchor having already been got up.

There was a responsive tinkle from the bridge-telegraph, at which the young commander smiled,
for he recognised, in the long-continued response, the hand of Mr Terence O'Meara.  A slight
tremor thrilled through the hull as the screw began to revolve, and the shipping in the harbour
drifted slowly astern as the fine 1180-ton cruiser gathered way and threaded her path out of
the anchorage.  Then, as she passed the Blanco Encalada, the guns roared out their salute,
and a tempest of cheers burst out on board the flagship as her crew recognised who it was that
was standing on the cruiser's bridge; and Jim could see the glances of astonishment and the
questioning looks writ large upon the faces of his recent companions.  But the Angamos was
past the flagship in about half a minute, and Jim then put his engines at full speed.  The
cruiser, which had only very recently been built, was capable of steaming at the rate of fourteen
knots, consequently she was at least two knots faster than the Union, the ship she was being
sent to hunt down.  She very soon covered the length of the harbour and vanished from the sight
of the fleet beyond Punta Angeles.

Although from the information in Jim's possession it was to be supposed that the Union was
by this time several days' steam ahead of him, it was yet by no means certain where she really
was; and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that they might sight her at any moment.
Douglas therefore took the precaution to have a man in the fore-topmast crosstrees, with instructions
to keep his eyes wide open, and to report any three-masted, one-funnelled steamer that might
happen to put in an appearance.  A fresh man was sent aloft every two hours, since the weather
was hot, and it was distinctly irksome to be obliged to remain aloft, exposed to the full glare
of the sun for any length of time; moreover, Jim kept a man at the masthead day and night.
There was therefore absolutely no chance of the Union being missed should she come within twenty
miles from the Angamos, for a man with a powerful telescope would be able to cover at least
that distance from the cruiser's fore-topmast head.

But despite the strict look-out maintained aboard the Angamos, the days passed without any
sign of the Union making her appearance.  The gun-running vessels Jim did not expect to meet
until several days after his arrival off the Straits of Magellan; but he could not quite understand
not having yet sighted the Peruvian corvette.  Past Concepcion they swept, on the afternoon
of the second day out from Valparaiso; then past Valdivia, and still there was no sign of the
enemy; then Childe Island was dropped astern, and on the fifth day out at about two o'clock
in the afternoon Cape Pillar, at the north end of Desolation Island and the entrance to the
Straits, was sighted, but the sea was still bare of the ship of which they had come in search.

Still, as Jim remembered, the Union was a very fast boat, only two knots slower than the Angamos
herself, and he thought it not improbable that she might be found lurking somewhere among the
numerous islands which make the navigation of Magellan Straits so difficult and dangerous.
The young skipper therefore took his cruiser into every little creek and inlet that he came
to, in the hope of finding his quarry there; or, if the water was too shoal, sent away boat
expeditions to explore.  But still there was no sign of the Union, and a week after leaving
Valparaiso the Angamos dropped her anchor off Punta Arenas, and Jim went ashore to interview
the governor of that port, in the forlorn hope that he might have seen the Peruvian pass, or
have heard something of her whereabouts.

Then Douglas received a surprise which he little expected.  He found Senor Morales, the Governor,
in a state of great perturbation.  That worthy man had a body of only forty men under his command
to garrison the place; and he gave Jim the astonishing news that the Union, with brazen effrontery,
had called in at Punta Arenas that very morning, and that her skipper, taking an armed force
ashore with him, had seized Morales, and placed the town under contribution for a supply of
coal and a quantity of provisions which he needed.

There was no resisting him, averred the unhappy governor, for the Peruvians numbered quite
eighty men and were all fully armed, while the corvette's guns were trained on the town, so
that, in the event of resistance being offered, she could have brought the place about their ears.

To make a long story short, said the governor, the Union had coaled and taken in a supply of
provisions--neither of which had been paid for, by the way--and had steamed off down the Straits
to the eastward not three hours before the Chilian cruiser had hove in sight.  He was quite
sure that el Senor Capitan would catch the scoundrel if he sailed at once.  And, moreover,
the carnicero had had the audacity to boast that he was going to convoy two cargoes of arms,
which were coming from Europe, back to Peru; that he should return through the Straits; and
that he should knock the town to pieces as he went past, as payment for the articles that he
had received.

Jim ground his teeth with anger upon hearing the recital of this insolence, and he vowed that,
could he but find the Union, he would make Captain Villavicencio eat his words.  But unfortunately
the Angamos was herself short of coal and fresh water, and several hours-- very precious hours--were
spent in getting these necessaries on board; so that it was already dark before Douglas finally
got away, having promised the Governor that he would do all in his power to prevent the Peruvian
from carrying out his threat.  But the Union was by this time a good many miles ahead, and
the navigation of the tortuous and intricate channel, with its furious currents, was not a
thing to be undertaken at any great speed at night.  Consequently Douglas was obliged to crawl
slowly along at about five knots an hour, with two leadsmen in the fore chains, at the very
time when he wanted to be steaming fourteen; and he feared that the Union would have got such
a lengthy start, while daylight lasted, that it would be a very difficult matter indeed to
overhaul her.  But there was just one hope for him; he reflected that she would almost certainly
wait at the eastern entrance of the Straits for her convoy, and, if she were there, he would
find her, and bring her to action.

The moment that daylight dawned, Jim, whose nerves were by this time torn to fiddle-strings
by frequent necessary stoppages during the night, put his vessel at full speed again, and,
still with two leadsmen sounding the whole time, the Angamos swept along the narrow waters,
finally emerging at the Argentine end of the Straits.  A fresh disappointment was, however,
in store for the young Englishman; for still there was no sign of the corvette; and now he
did not in the least know in what direction to look for her.  Finally, after cruising to and
fro off the entrance for some hours, in the hope of sighting the chase, he determined to reach
over toward the Falkland Islands, in the hope that the Union might have gone there to meet
the convoy.

The Angamos had, by about midnight on the next night, traversed close upon half the distance
to the Islands, and Jim was almost beginning to despair of ever catching the elusive corvette,
when a hail came down from one of the men who were still stationed at the masthead: "Light
ahead! bearing about a point on our port bow!"

Douglas's heart jumped.  Here, surely, must be the craft of which he was in search.  He had
to wait a few seconds to control his excitement, and then he replied: "How far distant is the
light, and what does it look like?"

"It's about eight miles distant," replied the seaman, "and looks like the light at a ship's
masthead; but I can now see two red lights, one over the other, arranged just below the white
one; and I should say that the three of them, shown together as they are, mean a signal of
some sort; for I can see neither port nor starboard lights showing in their usual places."

"Aha!" thought Jim, "this is not so bad, after all; this approaching craft can hardly be our
friend the Union, I should think; it is more likely that she will prove to be one of the gun-running
steamers, and if so--well, her career as a gun-runner will close somewhat abruptly, I think.--Masthead
ahoy, what is it now?" he continued aloud, as the seaman aloft gave an excited yell, which
he immediately suppressed.

"Why, sir," the fellow answered, "I have just sighted a second set of lights, almost dead astern
of the first lot; we have just this moment opened them.  There are certainly two steamers approaching,
sir; and-- ah! one of them has just sent up a rocket--I expect it is because she has sighted us."

"Then, by jingo!" soliloquised the Englishman, "they will be the gun- runners, and no mistake
about it.  How I wish I knew what lights it has been arranged for the Union to show as a signal
to them.  However, I don't; so that cannot be helped."  Aloud, he went on, addressing the excited
Chilian at the masthead, "Keep your eye on those ships, Pedro; and report any change to me
at once."

"Ay, ay, sir!" replied the man, "they are still coming this way."  Then Jim called up his lieutenant,
a young fellow named Manuel, and instructed him to get the ship immediately cleared for action,
and to douse every single one of the lights on board at once.  He then went back to the bridge,
and, as soon as every light on board had been extinguished, ordered the quartermaster at the
wheel to turn the ship's head eight points to starboard; thus, a few minutes later, the Angamos
was running at full speed, on a course at right angles to her previous one, and was leaving
the gun-runners on her port quarter.

Douglas still continued to watch their lights intently, and soon perceived that his failure
to give them a signal of some sort had occasioned quick suspicion to their skippers, for they
gradually slowed up; and presently the lights drew close together, by which Jim could guess
that the steamers had run alongside each other to permit of a conference between the two captains.

A few minutes later Jim turned the Angamos eight points to port, bringing her back to her old
course, but at a distance of about four miles from the supposed gun-runners.  He held on in
this direction until he was well astern of them, and then circled right round and headed straight
after them, immediately in their wake, at full speed.  After a pause of about a quarter of
an hour the Peruvian skippers again went ahead on their old course, doubtless much perturbed
in their minds at the sudden and extraordinary disappearance of the craft which, a short time
before, had seemed to be coming directly toward them.  And so simple were they that they did
not suspect Jim's subsequent move, but went straight ahead, keeping all their lights burning
as before; thus he was able to keep them in full view, although they could not see him. Probably
it never occurred to either of them to cast a single glance astern!

Jim had reckoned on the suspected steamers being slower than his own cruiser, and he soon saw
that he was steaming about three knots to their two, and overhauling them fast.  The lieutenant
had some time ago reported the ship as cleared for action; and the look-out aloft stated that
there was no other sail in sight; consequently, Jim reckoned on bringing the enemy to book
in about half an hour's time, and dealing summarily with him before the Union could complicate
matters by putting in an appearance; a prospect which caused him no little satisfaction, as
he felt that he might have had all his work cut out to deal effectively with the three, had
the corvette been opposed to him at the same time.

The Angamos, vibrating from stem to stern under the rapid revolutions of her screw, plunged
along through the black night, while, three miles ahead, the guiding-lights shone out clearer
and clearer every moment. Half an hour passed and the cruiser was very, very near; so near,
indeed, that Jim could plainly hear the throbbing of the gun-runner's machinery; and they must
also have caught the sound of his, for he suddenly saw another rocket rush up into the still
night air, and directly afterwards a red glow began to hover over the tops of their funnels,
showing that they were trying to increase their speed by coaling up furiously.

But it was of no use.  The gun-runners only gained a very few minutes' grace.  The Angamos
was much too fast a ship for them; and a few minutes later she ranged up on the starboard side
of the sternmost steamer, while Jim, seizing a speaking-trumpet, hailed at the top of his voice:
"What ship is that?  Heave-to!  I wish to speak to you!"

CHAPTER ELEVEN.

CAPTAIN VILLAVICENCIO CATCHES A TARTAR.

For the space of quite half a minute there was no reply; and then, in response to Jim's repeated
summons, both steamers, as if by previous arrangement, began to send blue rockets flying into
the air; while both set up a most unearthly shrieking on their steam-whistles.  They had by
this time recognised that the suspicious stranger was not the Union; but, knowing that she
must be somewhere in the vicinity, they determined to attract her attention by some means or
other, should she be anywhere within sight or hearing.

But Jim smiled grimly to himself as he saw and heard their despairing efforts, for he had kept
a man at the masthead for the express purpose of ascertaining whether the Peruvian corvette
was anywhere in the vicinity, and the last report, received less than five minutes before,
assured him that she was nowhere to be seen.

He waited patiently, therefore, until the discordant blasts on the sirens had ceased, and then
hailed again for the skipper to heave-to, vowing that he would fire into him if he did not
do so.  The young Englishman had imagined that he saw, by the light of the rockets, a number
of men scampering about the decks, but he concluded that it was merely the effect of terror
and astonishment, and he was totally unprepared for the gun-runner's next move.  The fellow
had, when he saw that there was no hope of escape, hastily prepared his ship for action; and
the last words were hardly out of Jim's mouth when a perfect storm of machine-gun fire broke
out aboard the flying steamer, and the bullets whistled round Douglas like hail, killing the
quartermaster at the wheel, and several other seamen who were not under shelter.

The cruiser immediately yawed wildly, and in another minute would have crashed into the gun-runner,
probably sending both craft to the bottom, had not Jim seized the wheel, as it spun out of
the dead man's fingers, and brought the Angamos back to her course just in the nick of time.
At the same moment he saw the leading steamer circle round in a wide curve and head directly
for him, evidently with the idea of helping her consort in the fight against the Chilian.

There was no time for any more palaver, thought Jim; the fellows meant to fight, and to disable
him if they could, and he must be ready for them.  In a voice hoarse with anger at the useless
slaughter of five of his men, he gave the order to fire; and immediately the guns of the Angamos
began to speak.

She was armed with several Gatling and Nordenfeldt guns, three 12- pounder breech-loaders,
six 3-pounders, and one 8-inch breech-loading Armstrong gun, throwing a projectile weighing
170 pounds, which was mounted forward; and, immediately upon Jim's command her whole broadside
crashed out, raking the foolhardy steamer from end to end, and making her fairly reel under
the impact of the iron shower.  Away forward, Manuel, the first lieutenant, had observed the
approach of the second steamer; and he now laid the big 8-inch gun directly for her bows, firing
when she had approached to within about four hundred yards of the cruiser.  The gun's deep
roar rang out loud above the din of the smaller weapons, and a brilliant flash of white light
leaped out on board the steamer, the missile blowing a huge hole in her starboard bow, and
setting her on fire forward; as was seen by the blaze which at once sprang up on board her.

At the same time the Angamos passed ahead of the first steamer, which, by the light of the
beacon-fires now lighted aboard all three vessels, was seen to be named the Miraflores; and,
running alongside the second, the Huemul, she delivered every gun of her starboard broadside,
bringing down the steel foremast, riddling the funnel with rifle and machine-gun bullets, and
killing every man on deck who was not under cover.  At the same time a 12-pounder shell, which
struck a heap of ammunition which had been placed on the Huemul's deck to feed a 32- pounder
breech-loader, blew up the whole lot, killing the unfortunate gun's crew, and lifting the gun
itself bodily over the side into the sea.  The Angamos then slowed down a little, and a few
seconds later the Miraflores overtook her and discharged every available gun into the cruiser,
killing several more men, and dismounting one 32-pounder and two 3-pounder quick-firing guns.

But the cruiser's people had meanwhile again loaded their guns on the port broadside, and were
not slow in avenging the death of their comrades.  They did not require the stimulus which
Jim sought to impart to them, by urging them in his excitement to "slap it into the beggars!"
for they worked their guns like demons, and, notwithstanding their rage and fury, made such
excellent practice that the Miraflores began to look more and more like a wreck every minute.
At last, in desperation, her captain actually tried to run his ship aboard the Angamos, with
the idea of boarding her; but the cruiser was several knots faster than the gun-runner, and
Jim, perceiving the fellow's intention, turned the Angamos to starboard and so avoided the
collision, at the same time pouring in another broadside with all his undamaged guns.

Instantly there arose a dense cloud of steam on board the Miraflores, accompanied by a loud
hissing noise; her speed suddenly slackened; and Douglas knew that one of the cruiser's shells
had penetrated a boiler; and he shuddered in spite of himself at the thought of the scene which
was now probably enacting down in the gun-runner's engine-room.  But, just as he was looking
at the stricken ship through his glass, to see whether she had surrendered, he was deafened
and well-nigh stunned by an appalling explosion which came from somewhere astern of the Angamos;
and pieces of wood and iron, fragments of charred human bodies, exploding cartridges, and wreckage
of all descriptions began to hurtle round his ears; while, from the shelter of the chart-house,
to which he precipitately retreated, he saw an enormous column of black smoke hanging over
the place near which he had last seen the Huemul; and he had little difficulty in accounting
to himself for the disaster.

The steamer had been set on fire forward by one of the cruiser's shells, which had exploded
a quantity of ammunition on her deck; and this fire rapidly spreading, had communicated itself
to some of the powder and cartridges which formed the greater part of her cargo.  This had
forthwith exploded, and, in its turn, blown up the remainder, causing a most terrible catastrophe;
for, when the smoke of the explosion cleared away, there was not a trace of the Huemul left
upon the surface of the water.  She and her gallant crew had been blown, literally, to atoms.

Appalled by the suddenness and extent of the disaster, both the Miraflores and the Angamos
ceased firing for several minutes; and, by the light of the fires which were still burning
on board both vessels, Jim could see the gun-runner's crew dashing wildly about, as though
in the last extremity of terror, while the ship herself was almost shrouded from view by the
dense clouds of steam, coloured ruddy yellow in the light of the braziers, which still gushed
in volumes from her pierced boilers.

The cruiser's men quickly recovered their equanimity, however; and, running to their guns,
poured in another broadside upon the demoralised crew of the Miraflores.  This was more, apparently,
than flesh and blood could endure; for Douglas saw several men immediately rush upon the captain,
who was still inciting them to continue the fight, and cut the unfortunate man down.  The crew
then rushed aft in a body, hauled down the Peruvian flag, under which both ships had been sailing,
hailed at the same time that they surrendered, and begged for quarter.  The men frantically
waved handkerchiefs, towels, in fact anything white that they could lay their hands upon, to
emphasise the fact that they had struck.

"I detest being obliged to give quarter to mutineers," said Douglas to his young first lieutenant;
"and these fellows undoubtedly are such, for they murdered their captain, and surrendered against
his wishes; but I must accept their surrender, I suppose, as it would simply be murder to continue
firing into them now; they are all half crazy with fright. Have the port and starboard quarter-boats
manned and lowered, Senor Manuel, if you please, and bring off the crew of that ship; but take
the precaution of first putting them all in irons.  After you have transferred them to the
Angamos I will put a prize-crew aboard, under your command; and you shall keep me company until
we return to Valparaiso.  I have a little plan at the back of my mind which I hope to be able
to put into execution and I will tell you what it is before you finally go aboard the Miraflores.
Now, be as quick as you can, for there has been a good deal of firing during this action, and
the Union may put in an appearance at any moment; and I do not wish to see her-- just yet."

Manuel saluted, and ran away aft to give orders about the boats, and, five minutes later, they
were being pulled across the water toward the now motionless gun-runner.  Jim saw Manuel climb
up her tall sides; and then he went into his chart-house to await the lieutenant's return,
and to think out the details of the plan about which he had spoken to Manuel.  However, he
first sent a man into the fore-topmast crosstrees, and one into the main, with orders to keep
a bright look-out for the appearance of the Peruvian corvette.

Some two hours later Manuel returned, bringing with him the whole of the Peruvian ship's crew,
most of whom consisted of ne'er-do-wells of almost every nationality under the sun: and a choice-looking
lot of rascals they were.  Jim wisely refused to accept the parole of any of them, placed them,
still in irons, in the cruiser's punishment cells, and took the precaution to post a strong
guard over them.  He then received the report of his lieutenant, which was to the effect that
the damage on board the Miraflores was, with the exception of the shell in her boiler-room,
mostly superficial, and could soon be repaired by the prize-crew.  Several of her guns had
been badly damaged; but the young man suggested that they could be replaced, together with
the damaged weapons belonging to the Angamos, from the gun-runner's cargo, which consisted,
in part, of a number of similar pieces.

Jim carefully digested the report, and then unfolded his latest plan to Manuel, which was to
the effect that the Miraflores, with a prize-crew aboard, and the Angamos, should impersonate
the two Peruvian gun- runners expected by the Union; and that they should hoist the enemy's
flag and go in search of him; thus getting close enough to bring the elusive corvette to action.
The lieutenant was therefore ordered to get aboard at once, with his prize-crew, execute the
necessary repairs, re- arm the ship out of the cargo she carried, and, as the boiler was too
badly damaged to admit of repair at sea, to cut off steam from it altogether, and fire up under
the remaining three, which could, even then, give the Miraflores a speed of about nine knots.

Manuel accordingly selected his crew, and again went aboard the gun- runner; where he and his
men worked with such a will that by mid-day the repairs were complete enough to allow of a
start being made.  The remaining repairs were of such a nature that it was possible to execute
them while the ship was under way.  Steam was then raised in the three sound boilers, and,
the water being quite smooth, the Miraflores was brought alongside the cruiser, which then
replaced her damaged guns, and hoisted fresh ones out of the gun-runner's hold with her own
derricks.

At length, by five o'clock in the afternoon of the day after the battle, both ships were in
a condition to proceed; and, much to Jim's satisfaction, there had been no sign of the Union
to disturb them. They were now ready to go in search of her; and, with two well-armed ships
under his command, Douglas swore that he would pay Captain Villavicencio in full for all the
injury that he had done in the past to Chilian commerce.  The Peruvian flag was then hoisted
aboard both ships, and each also arranged three lanterns upon her foremast, for use after dark,
in the same manner as they had been previously arranged, as a signal, on board the gun-runners.
Before starting Jim also questioned the captured crew as to what they knew of the plans of
their skipper, and where he had expected to meet the Union.  The men refused information at
first, but, upon being told that they would be kept upon half-rations until they chose to speak,
they said that they had expected to meet the corvette almost midway between the Falkland Islands
and Cape Virzins, at the eastern mouth of the Straits; also that both captains had mistaken
the Angamos for the Union when they first sighted her. Jim could not understand how it was
that in that case there were no signs of the corvette, but he determined not to leave the locality
until he had found her and brought her to action.

With the Miraflores steaming along in his wake, in the same formation as that adopted by the
gun-running steamers, Jim started off on his search for the Union, heading west-south-west
for the mouth of the Straits of Magellan, with a man at either masthead of each of the two
vessels, and a prize of fifty pesos to the seaman who should first sight her.  He did not feel
altogether happy at the idea of sailing under the Peruvian flag and adopting such a ruse, even
for a short period; but his orders to capture or sink the Union were precise and imperative,
and he considered that, in this case at least, the end justified the means employed, for he
knew that he would never succeed in getting alongside the corvette if her captain were once
allowed to entertain the slightest suspicion that the two ships were Chilians. True, the Angamos
was a faster ship; but the Union drew far less water; and, since she would probably be found--if
found at all-- somewhere among the shoal waters of the Straits, she might be able to get away
by dodging into shallow water among the numerous islands, where the Angamos, with her deeper
draught, would be unable to follow.

Darkness fell very shortly after the two ships had started on their run toward the Straits;
and the lanterns on their foremasts were lighted after the same manner as on the previous night;
while they surged along over the indigo-coloured water at the rate of about nine knots an hour,
a sharp look-out being maintained meanwhile for the appearance of the Union.  But to the great
disappointment of everybody, that craft most persistently refused to put in an appearance;
and when the next morning dawned the high, rocky cliffs of Tierra del Fuego and the Patagonian
coast lay before them, and it became evident that the Peruvian had either retreated up the
Straits, or that she was still behind them.

About nine o'clock the two ships, still flying the Peruvian colours, entered the Straits, and
immediately slowed down to half-speed, not only on account of the intricate navigation, but
also to give the Union a better chance of overtaking them if it should happen that she really
was still astern.  Catharine Point was passed and left behind, and the two steamers crossed
Lomas Bay into the "First Narrows," where Jim thought it possible that the Union might be waiting;
but she was not there. They were steaming slowly across Elizabeth Bay, and Douglas was beginning
to fear that the corvette had eluded him, after all, when a voice, hoarse with excitement,
hailed from aloft:--

"On deck there!  I can see three mastheads showing above that hummock of rock at the entrance
to the `Second Narrows'; and there is a column of smoke visible, too, so the craft must be
a steamer.  We shall open her out in a few minutes now, and I think she must be that detestable
corsair we are looking for."

Jim was, as usual, on the navigating bridge when the hail floated down; and his first act was
to seize a speaking-trumpet and shout the news to Manuel on the bridge of the Miraflores. 
His second was to spring up the ratlines, seat himself alongside the seaman in the crosstrees,
and take a good look at what he could see of the stranger from that elevation.  A prolonged
scrutiny convinced him that the craft could be none other than the Union; and he hurried down
to give his final orders, both ships having been kept practically prepared for action ever
since the moment on the evening before when they started in company to look for the corvette.
There was consequently very little to do in the way of preparation; and a quarter of an hour
after sighting the Peruvian's mastheads both Chilian ships were ready for the fray.

They had not steamed another cable's-length when it became evident that a sharp look-out must
also have been kept aboard the corvette; for her masts began to slide along the top of the
ridge of rock, showing that she was under way; and a few minutes later the entire ship swept
into view, flying the Peruvian ensign, and so leaving no room to doubt that she was the long-sought-for
Union.

Directly she hove in sight Jim signalled to the Miraflores to close up and come alongside him,
at a distance of half a cable's-length away, and both ships quickened up their speed, by such
small degrees as to be imperceptible, to nine knots, which was as fast as the cruiser's consort
could steam.  Presently a long, dismal wail came floating across the water from the Union,
and Douglas saw that she wished to attract his attention to a signal which she had just hoisted.

He at once dived into the chart-house for the signal-book, and presently he and his second
lieutenant were poring over it in an effort to read the communication.  But, to Jim's intense
annoyance, the signal, when translated, seemed to have no meaning, and he realised that the
corvette was making a private and pre-arranged signal, which he was, of course, unable to read.

"Confound it, Aranjuez!" he exclaimed, angrily, to his second lieutenant, "what are we to do
now?  I did not anticipate this; and if we are not careful he will take alarm and sheer off.
I wish I had thought of looking among the papers of the Miraflores' captain; they might have
contained the key to this private signal."

"Well, senor," replied the lieutenant, "we must delay making a signal of any sort until the
very last moment.  Then, when he shows signs of becoming suspicious and sheering off, we will
hoist, very slowly, a string of flags meaning nothing in particular.  It will take him some
little time to decipher the flags; and we shall gain a few minutes while he tries to fathom
their meaning from his own private signal-book.  We ought, by that time, to be close enough
to him for you to be able to open fire effectively if the men will only keep calm and shoot
straight. Should we fail to disable him with the first few shots, however, he will be off and
we may be unable to catch him again."

"Precisely!  This is the best--the only thing we can do, Aranjuez," replied Jim, gazing steadily
through his telescope at the Union.  "I am not afraid of being unable to catch him if he will
stick to deep water; but I feel convinced that if he takes the alarm he will be certain to
run for shoal water at once.  Have you got that bunting ready?" he continued, "for, if so,
we had better run up a string of flags; he seems to be slowing down, as though he didn't altogether
like our looks.  Quick! bend on and send them up.  There, that's it--not too fast now; not
too fast.  Ah, he has begun to move again, Aranjuez. Don't hoist that signal any farther; if
he only keeps as he is going for another ten minutes he will be under our guns.  Oh, good luck,
good luck! he's coming along at full speed, or I'm a Dutchman!"

Jim was right; the Union was coming along at full speed; yet her captain was not quite such
a fool as the young man took him to be.  He had seen the two Chilians from his mastheads before
they had seen him; and he had been watching them closely ever since; with the result that he
had arrived at the conclusion that some trick was being played on him.  But he fell into the
error of mistaking the cruiser for the Huemul, and of believing that the crews of both vessels,
corrupted by Chilian gold, had seized the ships, after murdering their officers. Villavicencio,
therefore, promptly made up his mind to retake the gun- runners, which he felt certain were
no longer in Peruvian hands, since his signals remained unanswered; and when he had approached
to within a mile and a half of the two Chilian craft, he very much astonished Jim Douglas by
opening fire upon him with his heavy 8-inch bow-guns.

Although he could not account for this sudden commencement of hostilities on the part of the
Union, Jim on his own part had only been waiting for the proper moment to open fire himself,
and now he, in turn, gave Villavicencio a most unpleasant surprise by returning his fire with
a very much larger gun than the Peruvian imagined that the Huemul carried.  For a few seconds
the skipper of the Union hesitated as to whether he should not, even now, turn and run; for,
taken altogether, matters seemed to be rather in the nature of an elaborately-laid trap.

But Villavicencio, now that Admiral Grau was dead, was the bravest man in the naval service
of Peru; and his hesitation was but momentary.  He continued to steam ahead at full speed,
but put his helm over to starboard, causing the corvette to swerve slightly to port, and thus
presented her whole starboard broadside to the approaching Chilians, who now hauled down the
Peruvian flag and hoisted their own ensign.  Then, as soon as his broadside guns bore on the
enemy, Villavicencio fired, and a storm of shot and shell came flying round the Angamos and
her consort, hulling the latter badly, and dismounting two of the recently replaced 12-pounder
breech-loaders.

Jim ground his teeth as he saw the terrible execution wrought by the Union's broadside; and,
exhorting his men to keep cool, ordered them to load and fire as fast as they could.  Once
more the cruiser's 8-inch gun roared out, sending its vengeful messenger shrieking toward the
corvette.  The shell struck right at the base of that ship's foremast, and there exploded,
scattering death and destruction all round it.  The huge spar remained upright for a second
or two, then it swayed slightly forward and to one side; the rigging, which had been badly
cut up by fragments of flying shell, suddenly parted; and the mast went over the side with
a crash that was plainly audible aboard the Chilian ships; and high above the crash of rending
wood rang, loud and painfully clear, the agonised shrieks of the poor maimed wretches who had
been crushed by its fall.

"Now's your time," shouted Jim, "they are lumbered up with the wreck of the foremast, and will
not be able to fire their big gun until they have cleared it away.  Fire into her now with
every gun that will bear, and keep at it until she strikes.  Miraflores ahoy! pass under my
stern and take up a position on the Union's port side when we come level with her; I will engage
her to starboard.  That's the style, lads," he continued enthusiastically, as a couple of 12-pounder
shells exploded, one on the corvette's navigating bridge and the other at the base of her conning-tower,--"that's
the style!  Keep it up, and show them how the Chilians fight."

The Peruvian skipper, however, was quicker in getting his wreckage cleared away than Jim had
anticipated, and the Angamos had not fired many rounds before the cumbersome spar was cut adrift
and went floating astern, and Villavicencio got his guns to work again.  Their recent disaster,
moreover, had not disturbed their aim; for the next 8-inch shell fired by the Union blew away
the Miraflores' funnel, and killed her helmsman, with the result that she turned sharply to
port, with smoke and flame sweeping along her deck from the cavity which the shell had blown
in it, and very narrowly escaped ramming the Angamos. The latter had by this time approached
to within half a mile of the Union, and now got her machine-guns to work, mowing down the Peruvians
who were not under cover as with a scythe, for the deck of the corvette was crowded with men.

After ten minutes of furious bombardment, and with the Miraflores crawling slowly up to take
part again in the encounter, Villavicencio, brave as he was, realised that he had walked into
a trap and had caught a Tartar; for he now recognised the Angamos for what she really was--a
cruiser.  Something had happened to the Huemul, that was perfectly clear, and the Miraflores
was also in Chilian hands; he therefore considered that he was not justified in risking the
Union any longer in an engagement which could have but one ending, considering the fact that
the corvette was now the only effective ship which the Peruvians possessed in their sadly depleted
navy.  He consequently put up his helm and, describing a wide sweep to port, made off toward
the entrance to the "Second Narrows," maintaining, however, a well-directed fire as he went
with his 8-inch stern gun, which weapon dropped shell with remarkable precision aboard the
cruiser and her consort.

Jim had just signalled the Miraflores that he was going to chase the Union, and that the prize
was to rendezvous at Punta Arenas, when an event occurred which made a rendezvous as unnecessary
as it was impossible for the second gun-runner.

For, as though determined to do all the damage he possibly could before slipping away, Villavicencio
had ordered a number of his broadside guns to be shifted aft, to enable him to maintain as
heavy a fire as possible from that part of the ship; and so rapidly did he now fire from his
stern ports that the series of explosions looked almost like a continuous sheet of flame, while
the solid shot and shell fell round the Chilian ships like hail.  The Miraflores had by this
time dropped about a quarter of a mile astern of the Angamos, and the latter was gaining rapidly
on the corvette, when the Union fired what was intended to be her last shot, a shell from an
8-inch gun.  But that shell was the saving of her for, having pierced the unarmoured sides
of the Miraflores as though they had been paper, the explosion took effect right among the
tightly packed ammunition-cases which constituted her cargo, and the next second she went into
the air, as the Huemul had done, with an appalling roar, followed by a tremendous shower of
all kinds of debris.

From the very nature of the explosion Jim felt practically certain that no one could possibly
be left alive out of her whole company, yet there was nevertheless just one chance in a thousand
that there might be; and with a groan of disappointment at being obliged to abandon the chase
of the Union, he turned his ship round and began to search for possible survivors.

But he found none.  A few poor unrecognisable human remnants were all that rewarded him for
his attempt at rescue; and after a precious hour lost in this way, he once more turned his
ship's head and went off at full speed after the Union.

But that hour's start had been sufficient for the corvette, and had enabled her to evade pursuit
among the numerous islands which dot the Straits.  Douglas haunted the Straits for a whole
week, searching every nook and corner of them for the Peruvian; but the Union's captain had
done his work well, and the fugitive was nowhere to be found.  And at length, unwilling though
he was to give up his search, but anxious not to lose time when the Angamos might be required
for other and more important work, he started back for headquarters, arriving at Valparaiso
just a month after he had left it.  He had carried out one part of his task, which was to prevent
the two cargoes of arms from falling into the hands of the Peruvians; but the Union still remained
at large, and was destined to give the Chilians a great deal more trouble before they finally
closed her brilliant and adventurous career.

CHAPTER TWELVE.

THE BOMBARDMENT OF CALLAO.

When Jim reported to the admiral he was greatly gratified to find that his chief was perfectly
satisfied with the way in which he had carried out the task entrusted to him; and although
the Chilian very naturally regretted that the young skipper of the Angamos had not been able
to bring the Union to book, he fully recognised that Douglas had done all that was possible.
And he commended the judgment he had displayed in bringing the cruiser back to Valparaiso,
instead of waiting about in the Straits of Magellan on the off-chance of again encountering
her, for, as he explained to Douglas, the fleet was even then on the point of leaving port
to harry the Peruvian coast, and the Angamos was required to take part in the work.

He was also informed that Captain Castello would take charge of the Angamos on the coming expedition,
and that Jim himself was, for certain particular reasons, to return to the Blanco Encalada,
in his former capacity of first lieutenant of the flagship.  Admiral Riveros also hinted that
he had it in his mind to depute to him in the near future a difficult and extremely important
piece of work, the character of which he would fully explain to him later, and this circumstance
was quite sufficient to compensate the young man for any disappointment he may have temporarily
felt at finding that he was not to retain the command of the cruiser.

Accordingly Jim returned to the flagship, where he was heartily welcomed by his old comrades,
who informed him that the destination of the squadron was thought to be Callao, and that in
all probability the Chilians would bombard the place, and then endeavour to take Lima, the
Peruvian capital; so that there promised to be plenty of excitement and adventure in store
for everybody.

At length all preparations were completed, and on the 2nd of April 1880, exactly a week after
Jim had returned to Valparaiso in the Angamos, the fleet, consisting of the Blanco, Huascar,
Angamos, Pilcomayo, Mathias Cousino, and the two torpedo-boats Guacolda and Janequeo, left
that port and, steaming out of the bay, headed to the northward.

The ships, which had of course been coaled and provisioned at Valparaiso, had no need to call
in anywhere for stores, but headed direct for Callao, which was openly stated to be their destination
as soon as they were out of the harbour; and on April 9 the squadron arrived within a couple
of hours' steam of the Peruvian port.  At three o'clock in the afternoon of the same day the
two torpedo boats, under convoy of the Huascar, went on ahead to scout; and, arriving off the
port just about dusk, Lieutenant Goni of the Guacolda rashly determined to make a raid on the
Peruvian shipping on his own account, and accordingly slipped away into the harbour toward
the place where the enemy's warships were known to be lying.

The Union was soon identified as one of the ships lying at anchor, and Goni promptly headed
for her.  But when about half a mile distant from her quarry, the torpedo-boat accidentally
ran down a fishing-smack, drowning all the crew except three, and losing one of her own torpedo-
spars.  It was by this time quite dark, and in the confusion the precise position of the Union
had been lost; but Goni, having rescued the three surviving fishermen, forced them to pilot
him to the spot where the corvette was lying, only to discover, when he got close to her, that
her skipper had surrounded her with a boom.  But undismayed by this, the gallant Chilian forthwith
destroyed the boom, and then discovered that he had lost his second spar, and consequently
was unable to torpedo the ship herself.  The Union then opened a smart machine-gun fire, and
the Guacolda was compelled to beat a retreat, much to Lieutenant Goni's annoyance.

Unfortunately, this ill-timed attack had put the Peruvians thoroughly on the alert, and as
soon as daylight appeared they hauled their fleet, consisting of the Union, Rimac, Chalaco,
Oroya, and Atahualpa into shoal water behind the breakwater of the stone docks, where were
also the Talisman and two hulks, the Apurimac and Maranon.  They had also several new torpedo-boats,
as well as launches and tugs armed with spar-torpedoes, with which they patrolled the harbour
to prevent any repetition of an attack like that of the Guacolda.

Admiral Riveros was extremely angry with Lieutenant Goni when upon his arrival off Callao he
saw that every possible preparation had been made for his reception; that any further surprise
was impossible; and that the attack would now have to be made openly.  He therefore called
away his barge and, under a flag of truce, visited the senior Peruvian naval officer for the
purpose of informing him that Callao was to be blockaded, and that, since bombardment might
at any moment become necessary, all non-combatants should at once leave the town and seek a
place of safety.  The Chilian also sent a notice to this effect to the principal consular agent
and to the senior foreign naval officer of the neutral warships lying in the roads, eight days
being the time allowed for neutral shipping and foreigners generally to leave the place.  Upon
the representation of the consuls, however, that eight days were not enough, the admiral increased
the period of grace to ten days, and then set to work on the task of making his fleet ready
for the bombardment which he saw was inevitable.

The defences of Callao consisted for the most part of a series of batteries arranged in crescent
form round the shores of the bay.  At the extreme south-west point of land, between the bays
of Callao and Miraflores, stood the strongest Peruvian battery, called the Dos de Mayo, which
had only very recently been constructed.  This contained two 20-inch M.L.  Rodman guns, mounted
on United States service iron carriages; and these formidable weapons commanded nearly seven-eighths
of the horizon.  Tarapoca battery, which faced due south over Chorillos bay, contained two
15-inch Dahlgren guns, as also did Pierola battery, facing Callao bay.  Next to Pierola came
the Torre del Merced, a revolving turret mounting two 10-inch rifled Armstrongs.  Then came
a brick fort called the Santa Rosa, containing two 11-inch rifled Blakely guns.  The Castle,
a very old and ruinous structure, the only strength of which consisted of two masonry towers,
had four 11-inch rifled Blakelies.  Seven large-bore guns were mounted on the mole, together
with two small and very ancient 32-pounders.  At the north end of the town itself was Fort
Ayacucho, containing one 15-inch Dahlgren and one 11-inch Blakely.  Then came another revolving
turret, with two 10-inch Armstrongs; and finally a sand-bag battery, named the Rimac, which
mounted four 15-inch Dahlgren muzzle-loaders.

It will thus be seen that the Chilian fleet would have all its work cut out if it meant to
take the port of Callao, as the first step toward the capture of the capital, Lima.

By April 20 all the foreign merchant ships had gone away, and all the foreign warships had
moved out of the line of fire and taken up their position off the mouth of the Rimac River,
about two miles to the northward of the port of Callao.

It was half-past one o'clock p.m. on the eventful day of April 22 when Admiral Riveros hoisted
a signal on the Blanco Encalada for the fleet to weigh anchor and stand over toward the batteries
in readiness to engage; and a few moments later the clatter of chain-cables was heard, as the
men-o'-war got their anchors.  The Pilcomayo, gunboat, was the first to move, and she took
up a position north of the middle of the bay; Jim's recent command, the cruiser Angamos, being
next in line; with the Huascar at the south-west extremity.  The flagship, to the intense annoyance
of her crew, was held in reserve; but the men would not have grumbled at their enforced idleness
had they but known of what was in store for some of them.  Jim, in particular, was never tired
of speculating as to what was the mysterious service which Riveros had hinted his intention
of employing him upon, and longed for an opportunity which would enable him to distinguish himself.

He was roused from his somewhat moody reverie by the boom of a great gun, and, looking up,
he saw a cloud of white smoke hanging over the Huascar, which had been the first ship to fire,
while a brilliant flash of flame on board the monitor Atahualpa showed where the death- dealing
shell had struck and exploded.  The Angamos and the Pilcomayo were not slow in chiming in,
and presently the air fairly vibrated with the concussion of heavy guns; for the Peruvians
were now replying with their seventeen large-bore guns mounted in the batteries, assisted by
the pivot-guns of the Union and several large smooth-bore guns from some of the obsolete ships
behind the mole or stone pier.

The Blanco Encalada was theoretically beyond the range of any of the enemy's guns; and although
several shells exploded in the air near her, she was never at any time in the least danger,
and Jim Douglas, with his chum Terry, had a splendid opportunity of witnessing a bombardment
at close quarters without taking any risks.  But both of them were so unappreciative of this
immunity that they would have infinitely preferred their ship to be in the thick of the fighting,
instead of lying safely out of range as she was.

But presently the Chilians found that it was almost impossible to hit the shipping behind the
mole from the position which they had taken up, and as Admiral Riveros' principal desire was
to annihilate the Peruvian navy, and thus render Peru harmless at sea, he signalled for the
Huascar to move closer in, and to take up a position more to the north-eastward.  The signal
was acknowledged, and presently the monitor lifted her anchor and stood over still closer to
the mole, maintaining a terrific fire as she went, and receiving a 20-inch Dahlgren shell on
her water-line as some slight return for the damage that she was inflicting. But luckily she
was well provided with water-tight bulkheads, or nothing could have saved her, for the sea
poured into her in tons through the huge hole which the shell had made in her side.

Nothing daunted, however, her captain, Carlos Condell--the man who had fought the Covadonga
so splendidly, and been promoted through several ships to the Huascar--continued to stand on
until he had approached to within a mile of the mole, when he dropped his anchor and opened
a still more furious and destructive fire upon the Peruvian ships.  One well- aimed shell set
the Union on fire, and for a few minutes Jim and his chum--together with every other man in
the Chilian navy, for that matter--thought and hoped that the famous ship had run her course.
But Villavicencio was, as has already been seen, a man of resource and energy, and in half
an hour he had the fire under control.

Not so fortunate was the school-ship Maranon.  Although old, she was armed with the newest
weapons for the instruction of naval men in gunnery, and though these guns were of small calibre,
and therefore of little use against the thick armour of the ironclad, she steamed out from
behind the mole and replied heroically to the Huascar's fire, killing twelve men who were working
the monitor's machine-guns, jamming one of the turret-tracks, cutting one of the anchor cables,
and nearly wrecking the Huascar's new foremast which had been put in at Valparaiso, before
one of the ironclad's 10-inch shells burst in her hold and blew the bottom clean out of her.

"By George, Terry," exclaimed Jim enthusiastically, "did you ever see such a plucky fight?
Why, the school-ship has given the Huascar a thoroughly nasty mauling!  I expect the Peruvians
feel more than a bit sore at seeing the ship which used to be the pride of their fleet in Chilian
hands.  Caramba! but the Maranon is sinking lower in the water every second; she will be gone
in less than five minutes.  I hope those brave fellows will be able to get out of her before
she goes, for the bay is simply swarming with sharks!  Look at the black dorsal fins of the
beggars playing round the old Blanco!  It's enough to make a fellow sick to think of those
gallant chaps being torn to pieces by such monsters as these.  Ah!  I am glad to see that Condell
has ceased firing to allow those Peruvian launches which are just coming out to pick up the
survivors.  Too late! too late!" he groaned, a second or two later; "there she goes already!
Why, the whole bottom must have been blown clean out of her for her to sink in that short time!"

The launches held back for a few seconds to avoid being caught in the vortex caused by the
sinking ship, and then dashed forward to the rescue.  They saved a good many, but if Jim had
but been close enough he would have seen that his prophecy with regard to the sharks had proved
only too true; for the voracious monsters, darting hither and thither, snapped up the unfortunate
men before the very eyes of the comrades who were straining every nerve to save them, the fierce
fish sometimes leaping half their length out of the water in their furious efforts to snatch
their prey back even when the man had been hauled up on to the boat's gunwale.

The two lads were fortunately spared a close view of this harrowing sight, and their attention
was speedily diverted from the catastrophe by a further commotion behind the mole, when, looking
through their glasses, they saw that the Peruvians, encouraged apparently by the damage wrought
by the Maranon, had got a couple of tugs alongside the old monitors Manco Capac and Atahualpa,
and were towing them out close to the Huascar; their ironclad sides being more capable of resisting
the latter's shells than the Maranon's wooden hull.

Directly the Chilians perceived this new move, the Angamos and Pilcomayo stood in to the support
of their consort, and in a very few minutes Jim beheld the somewhat rare spectacle of a close
fleet action in which the sides were well matched, for the two Peruvian monitors were of about
equal strength to the three Chilian warships.  The thunder of the cannon now became deafening,
and Callao bay was positively flecked with white by the hundreds of ricochetting shells and
solid shot; while even at the distance of four miles the boys could see, through their telescopes,
the ships' hulls reel and quiver under the frightful impact of the shot and shell.

But the combat did not last very long, for the merciful darkness came down about an hour after
the monitors had been towed out, and put an end to the action.  The signal for recall was hoisted
aboard the Blanco Encalada, the firing gradually ceased, the Huascar, Angamos, and Pilcomayo
got their anchors, and shortly after nightfall the whole Chilian fleet was once more anchored
safely under the lee of San Lorenzo island.

These tactics and the bombardment of Callao continued day after day, and the port seemed to
be as far from surrendering as it was when they began; but the Chilians found, after the first
few days, that it was necessary to lay down permanent moorings under San Lorenzo Island and
buoy them, so that the fleet could leave its berth every night at dusk, and return when morning
dawned.  This was because of the fact that the Peruvians had constructed several fast torpedo-boats
which prowled round the fleet after dark and attempted to torpedo the vessels composing it;
and also to avoid the peril of the floating mines which the enemy put into the water at the
mouth of the harbour and allowed to drift down upon the Chilian vessels with the tide.

The flagship had, in particular, been made the objective of several of these torpedo attacks;
and it was this fact which put into the head of the admiral a scheme which he had now been
turning over in his mind for some days past.

On the 8th of May a meeting of officers was convened in Admiral Riveros' cabin on board the
flagship; and Jim was one of the officers present. It was about seven o'clock in the evening,
and darkness had already closed in, the fleet then steaming, in double column of line abreast,
on and off, about two miles to seaward of their anchorage.  As soon as all the Chilian officers
had come aboard Riveros took his seat at the head of the cabin table, and straightway plunged
into business.

"As you are aware, gentlemen," he began, "we have now been lying before Callao for nearly three
weeks; and, despite our best endeavours, the town still remains untaken, and the way to Lima
is still closed to us. This cannot be permitted to continue very much longer; for we are running
short of provisions and coal, while the ships' bottoms are getting so foul that, should the
need for fast steaming arise, we should find that the vessels are incapable of making their
top speed by at least two or three knots.  If we are compelled to raise the blockade of the
place so that we may put ourselves in order, the Peruvians will naturally avail themselves
of the opportunity to throw cargoes of arms, ammunition, and provisions into the place; and
thus, upon our return, all our work will need to be done over again.  Therefore, it is out
of the question for us to think of raising the blockade before Callao has fallen; and it appears
to me that the principal obstacle in the way of our bringing that to pass is the presence of
those Peruvian ships lying behind the mole.  We have proved that it is impossible to reduce
the port by gun-fire alone; a general assault, therefore, seems to be the only alternative
left us; and a general assault is equally impossible in the face of the hurricane of shot and
shell which those ships are, as we have already seen, capable of discharging.

"Therefore, as you will doubtless have gathered from my remarks, gentlemen, it will be necessary
for us to destroy those ships, and that soon.  The question is, how are we to do it?  So long
as they remain where they are, they are safe from our guns, for they are all protected by the
mole.  I have therefore summoned you aboard the flagship with the object of ascertaining whether
any of you have any plans or suggestions to offer for the solution of the difficulty.  If so,
I shall be very glad to hear them."

For a considerable time there was silence in the cabin, everybody seeming to be busily engaged
in the endeavour to evolve a plan whereby the admiral's difficulty might be overcome; but at
length Jim, who had been cogitating profoundly, with his head between his hands, looked up
and inquired whether Riveros happened to possess a chart of Callao harbour.  As it happened
there was one ready to hand; and a few seconds later Douglas was poring over it by the light
of the cabin lamp, with a pencil and a pair of compasses in his hand.

Meanwhile several of the Chilian officers now began to propound schemes, each of which was
promising enough--up to a certain point, at which somebody was certain to point out an insurmountable
difficulty.  One suggested a concerted attack by the entire Chilian squadron; but this was
manifestly impossible, in face of the enormously powerful guns which the Peruvians could bring
to bear.  Another put forward the suggestion that an assault could be delivered in the rear
of the town, by landing a number of seamen and marines in Chorillos bay.  But Chorillos bay
was open to the full "run" of the Pacific Ocean, and upon nearly every day throughout the year
there was such a terrific surf on the beach that a landing by means of small boats would be
impossible.

Presently Jim looked up from the chart which he had been studying, and remarked quietly:

"I think, sir, I can manage the business; but it will probably involve the destruction of a
torpedo-boat, her crew, and myself!  As regards myself, I am perfectly willing to take the
risk; but it is for you to say whether you will spare the torpedo-boat, and I suppose it will
be a question of calling for volunteers if you should decide to allow me to try my experiment."

"Let us hear what you have to propose, Senor Douglas," said the admiral, "and we shall then
be the better able to decide whether your scheme is sufficiently promising to justify me in
risking the loss of--or rather, by your own showing, throwing away--a torpedo-boat and her
entire crew. Such a loss would of course be a small price to pay for the achievement of our
object; but you must convince me that there is at least a possibility of success before I can
consent to what you may have to suggest."  Whereupon the young Englishman described in detail
what he purposed doing.

When he had finished Riveros sat back in his chair and stared fixedly at the ceiling for some
minutes while he drummed upon the table with his fingers.  The other officers seated round
the cabin seemed divided into two parties, one party sunk in deep thought, while the other
stared at the young man as though he had taken leave of his senses.

Then presently Riveros brought his fist down upon the table with a clatter that made everybody
start.  "By Jove! young man," he exclaimed, "you shall try your scheme; and if you are successful--of
which, however, I have very grave doubts, let me tell you--I believe I can promise that there
is nothing that Chili will not do for you. Caramba! but it is a brilliant as well as a daring
idea; what say you, gentlemen?  Yes, Senor Douglas, you shall have the torpedo-boat Janequeo,
and with her everything that you require.  As for a crew, I cannot order men to go on such
an expedition as you contemplate, but I believe that if you call for volunteers you will get
your complement. At least, I hope so, for the honour of the Chilian navy.  Now when do you
propose to make your attempt?"

"Well, sir," replied Douglas, "I am afraid that I shall require all to- night and all day to-morrow
to prepare; but I have very little doubt that I shall be able to make the attempt to-morrow night."

"Very well, then," said the admiral, rising; "I will not detain you any longer, Senor Douglas;
for, as you have hinted, you will have a good many preparations to make, and the sooner you
are able to carry out your scheme the better."

Jim wished the admiral good-night, and retired to his own cabin to snatch, if he could, a few
hours' sleep, which might very possibly prove to be the last he would ever take on earth. 
He left orders with the sentry that he was to be called at midnight; and accordingly at that
hour he turned out, washed and dressed, and then made his way to the magazine, between which
and his own cabin, with one or two intervals for meals, he was busily engaged until four o'clock
in the afternoon of the next day; hearing all the time the thunder of the heavy guns rolling
and reverberating over his head; for during the last few days the Blanco Encalada had herself
taken part in the bombardment.

As soon as he had finished his mysterious preparations in the magazine, he went on deck and
spoke a few words to the admiral.  The latter listened, nodded once or twice, and then gave
a certain order to the yeoman of the signals.  A few minutes later a stream of brilliant- coloured
flags soared aloft into the now fast-gathering gloom; and it would have taken a very sharp
eye on shore to discern that the signal was briefly answered by a man on board the Janequeo,
who waved a small yellow flag.

In another half-hour it had become too dark to continue the bombardment, and the usual signal
of recall was made from the flagship; in response to which the furious cannonading ceased,
and the ships drew away over to San Lorenzo Island, where they always assembled prior to going
to sea for the night.  Then, with the flagship and the Huascar leading the double line, the
fleet steamed away into the offing until they were hidden from the sight of Callao behind San
Lorenzo Island.  But here, in response to a signal, the fleet anchored, thus departing from
its usual custom of cruising to and fro during the hours of darkness.

But even before the ships had lost their way prior to dropping their anchors, the Janequeo
was seen to sheer out of her place in the line; and presently she raced up alongside the Blanco
Encalada, where she came to a standstill.  The Blanco's side-ladder was then lowered, and Jim
went down it on to the small craft's deck.  Then a number of seamen took their places on the
accommodation-ladder, one on every step, from the top to the bottom, and a group of Chilians
likewise formed up on the Janequeo's deck.

Then a man made his appearance at the Blanco's gangway, carrying something heavy, which he
handled with quite exceptional care.  This object he handed to the man at the top of the ladder,
who passed it to the next man, and so on until it reached the Janequeo, when it was taken aboard
and stowed away below with every sign of the utmost precaution.  This process was repeated
again and again, until a dozen of the mysterious packages had been placed on board; when, in
profound silence, the torpedo-boat sped away from the flagship, to visit each of the other
craft of the squadron in turn; receiving two men from one, half a dozen from another, and so
on, until her complement was complete. All her lights were then extinguished, and she slid
off into the darkness without a sound.  There was no cheering from the fleet, not even so much
as a shout of "Farewell!" but in his heart every man in every ship silently wished success
to the daring young Englishman and his crew.  The Janequeo was out of sight in half a minute;
and when she had vanished the squadron got under way once more, and continued its usual nightly
cruise on and off the port; while Admiral Riveros, standing on the navigating bridge, strained
his ears in an attempt to catch the sounds which should tell him that Jim's effort had been
unsuccessful, and that he and his gallant crew were no more.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN.

JIM IS TAKEN PRISONER.

Douglas's plan was, indeed, a sufficiently daring one; for he had resolved upon the accomplishment
of no less a task than that of blowing into the air every ship in the Peruvian fleet then lying
at Callao; and to do this he had been obliged to set to work on quite a new system. The Janequeo
was constructed to carry only two spar-torpedoes, and these, of themselves, were quite insufficient
for Jim's purpose.  For the ships would almost certainly be protected by booms to ward off
possible attacks by torpedo-boats; and, should he manage to approach near enough, the young
Englishman would need one torpedo to destroy the boom, leaving him but one more with which
to destroy the ship it had protected.

But the destruction of a single ship was not sufficient; for to ensure the subsequent success
of the Chilian fleet it was imperative that all should be destroyed.  The young man had therefore
brought along his spar-torpedoes for use if necessary; but he had also manufactured a dozen
large bombs which he meant to attach to the ships themselves, afterwards exploding them by
means of a time fuse.  By doing this he hoped to be able to destroy the whole fleet practically
simultaneously; whereas by the spar method, even had he been able to carry a sufficient number
of torpedoes, he would have been obliged to destroy them one after another; and of course,
after the first explosion, the crews of all the rest would be prepared for him.  He also had
it in his mind to use the two spars themselves as a bridge, should he find that the vessels
were protected by booms.  Thus, if he could but attach the bombs undetected, he ought to be
able to ensure the annihilation of the entire Peruvian squadron.

But it was a terribly dangerous service that he had undertaken, for he had on board the Janequeo
enough explosive to destroy twelve ships, and if but one searching little machine-gun bullet
were to strike her cargo--well, there would be an end of Douglas, his crew, and the torpedo-boat
together.  However, neither he nor the brave fellows with him gave much thought to the danger
which they were themselves incurring; their country needed them, and if it must be so, she
should have them.

Jim had calculated to the utmost nicety the time which he would probably need in getting through
his business, and he had cut each of his fuses to such a length that the bombs should explode,
as nearly as possible, at the same instant.  If he received no check, and remained undiscovered,
well and good; but if he were delayed at all after lighting the fuse, it would be very bad
indeed for the Janequeo and her crew.

The wheel was in charge of an old quartermaster who knew Callao Bay as intimately as he did
Valparaiso harbour; and as Jim stood beside him in the tiny shelter, watching him peer through
the darkness and ever and anon give the wheel a slight turn this way or that, he realised that
he had on board most of the elements which go to make up success.  Luck was all that was wanting;
and, as fortune is supposed to favour the brave, Jim had high hopes of bringing his expedition
to a successful issue.

Away through the blackness swept the little torpedo-boat, with not a light showing anywhere
on board her.  The men had even been forbidden to smoke; and the stokers down below put coal
on as carefully as though the furnaces were a lady's drawing-room fire, so that there might
be no flicker of flame hovering over the top of the funnel, or even so much as a spark to betray
their whereabouts.  In a little less than half an hour after leaving the Blanco Encalada the
Janequeo sneaked round the south-east corner of San Lorenzo Island, being very careful not
to collide with the big buoys which marked each Chilian vessel's moorings. These passed, she
slid in between San Lorenzo and Fronton, and entered the Boqueron Passage, coming in sight
of the small lighthouse which was, strangely enough, still allowed to show its light at the
back of the Dos de Mayo battery.  Luckily for the daring little vessel searchlights had not
yet come into vogue, or she could scarcely have hoped to escape discovery, for when she crossed
the Camotal Bank, previous to turning to starboard in order to run up Callao Bay, she was so
close inshore that her crew could plainly hear the shouts of the Peruvian soldiers who occupied
the Mayo battery, and who were evidently holding a high carousal.  For this circumstance Jim
thanked his lucky stars, for there was the less likelihood of any men being on watch; while
the noise they were making would prevent them from hearing, as a careful listener might have
done, the throbbing of the Janequeo's engines and the churning of her propeller.

Just as they had rounded the point, however, and the boat had turned her nose north-east, the
bacchanalian sounds from the battery suddenly ceased, and lights began to flicker among the
earthworks.  Jim felt his heart stand still, for discovery now would mean the utter ruin of
his project, to say nothing of the death of all of them; for a shot from one of those enormous
20-inch guns would send the frail Janequeo to the bottom like a stone, if it chanced to hit
her.  And evidently the Peruvians in that particular battery had taken alarm at something;
for a tiny point of light appeared on the ramparts, and then quickly flared up into a bright
blaze.  A beacon-fire had been lighted, and at any moment now its glare might reveal the presence
of the torpedo-boat to the Peruvians.

Jim immediately passed the word down to the engine-room for all the steam she could carry,
and the little vessel's speed at once increased by a knot or two.  They were nearly in safety
now, being about five hundred yards beyond the point, and a few minutes more would take them
under the shadow of the higher ground upon which the Pierola battery was placed, when the glare
from the beacon would be unable to reach them. But Jim's great fear now was lest the other
batteries also might take the alarm and light their beacons; in which case he could not possibly
escape discovery.

By a happy chance, however, the Janequeo glided into the deep shadow, unobserved; and Jim now
ordered the speed to be reduced so that the boat should not make so much "fuss" in going through
the water, when she stole along at a speed of about ten knots, fifteen being her maximum, of
which she was quite capable, as she was a perfectly new boat.  The men in Pierola, being half
a mile away from the Mayo battery, had evidently not noticed the beacon light, nor were their
suspicions aroused, for all was perfectly quiet as the Janequeo crept safely past, with not
a light gleaming anywhere in the battery to show that anybody was awake. This battery and the
two lying next to it, to the north, had, as it happened, borne the brunt of the fighting that
day, and presumably the men were overcome by fatigue.  Next, the Torre del Merced and Fort
Santa Rosa were safely passed, and the lights of Callao itself swung in sight; the railway
station, which lay close to the waterside, was particularly brilliantly lighted, while the
sounds proceeding therefrom seemed to indicate that troops were either arriving at, or were
being dispatched from, the place.

They were now only about a quarter of a mile from the southern end of the mole, and Douglas
passed the word round for his crew to hold themselves in readiness, although the entrance to
the harbour where the ships were lying was still half a mile distant, the mole being nearly
five hundred yards in length.  The queer-shaped bombs were then got up on deck, and Jim busied
himself upon the task of attaching the fuses to them.  He was obliged to work by the sense
of touch alone, as he dared not, of course, use a light of any description.  By the time that
he had finished his preparations the Janequeo had almost reached the northern end of the mole,
and the moment was at hand for the great attempt to be made.  Douglas now lessened speed still
further, for he did not quite know what shape the defences to the harbour would take.  He anticipated
that there would almost certainly be a number of floating mines to pass through; and it was
more than likely that a patrol of the place might be maintained by launches steaming with their
lights out.

A few minutes later the adventurers arrived abreast the northern end of the mole, and were
made aware of the fact by a slight diminution of the pitchy blackness caused by the wall of
the mole being left on their starboard quarter.  The light on the pierhead was, of course,
extinguished while hostilities were in progress; for the Peruvians were much too sensible to
leave any beacon by which an enemy might easily make the mouth of the harbour.  Jim could now
see the forest of spars belonging to the ships which he had come to destroy outlined against
the luminous haze formed by the lights of the town, although his own little craft was shrouded
in dense blackness; and he ordered the man at the wheel to port his helm a few spokes, upon
which the Janequeo turned gradually to starboard until she came abreast of the harbour entrance,
which was only about two hundred feet in width.  He then stopped his engines altogether, and,
when the torpedo-boat had come to a standstill, he proceeded to listen with all intentness
for suspicious sounds.  But everything was as still as the grave, and Douglas began to hug
to himself the conviction that events seemed to be turning out fortunately. He could hear no
sounds aboard the Peruvian warships; and there was no sign of any patrol launches being about.
Having, therefore, taken all the precautions in his power, he started his engines once more
and went ahead, dead slow, turning to starboard until the Janequeo's bows pointed straight
for the harbour entrance.  Nearer and nearer she stole, while her crew waited in readiness
for action, every muscle tense and quivering with anticipation and excitement.  The bombs had
been ranged in two lines of six each, one on the port and one on the starboard side, so that
there would be no need to carry them far, whichever side the torpedo-boat presented to the enemy.

She was gliding through the water at a speed of about five knots when, suddenly, there was
a slight grating sound, the Janequeo's bows lifted out of the water, and the boat came to a
dead stop, with her screw still slowly churning up the water astern.  The shock caused some
of the men on deck to lose their footing, and the whole row of bombs on the port side splashed
overboard as the Janequeo heeled in that direction.  In a second Jim was on his feet and, rushing
to the engine-room, bade the man in charge to stop his engines.  Then he dashed on deck again,
half expecting to hear the crash of guns opening fire upon him, while he listened intently
in order to ascertain whether his presence had been betrayed by the disturbance.

There was no sound of alarm, however; and Douglas presently realised that, strange as it appeared,
the Janequeo was still undiscovered. Then, silently, he and his men set about the task of discovering
what had caused the obstruction, and they were not long in finding that a stout chain had been
stretched across the entrance evidently to prevent just such an attack as this, and that the
Janequeo had run in upon this chain where it "sagged" in the middle, her momentum carrying
her right up on to it, for her fore-foot was nearly out of the water.  Thus they were in a
particularly perilous predicament, for if they were discovered now no power on earth could
save them; but Jim was thankful beyond measure that he had not been running in at full speed,
otherwise the Janequeo would most certainly have broken her back and sunk on the instant. 
The loss of half the bombs was very serious too, but he still had six of them left, and if
he could sink a ship with each he would not have done so badly on the whole.

The question now, however, was, how were they going to get clear of the chain, and, once clear,
how were they going to surmount the obstacle and get into the harbour?  But, "one thing at
a time," thought Douglas.  Let them get off the chain first of all; and that without breaking
the torpedo-boat in half or alarming the enemy.  He listened again intently for any sound which
would indicate that the Peruvians were stirring, and then, hearing nothing, he sent his engines
astern at full speed, with the concentrated energy of a quarter of an hour's pent-up steam.
The water frothed and boiled under the boat's counter, making, in the intense stillness of
the night, such a disturbance that Jim thought it must be heard all over the town; but, although
the boat rocked from side to side under the strain, grinding her keel and bilges against the
chain, she remained immovably fixed; and Jim ordered the engines to be stopped, feeling that
so violent a disturbance of the water must speedily lead to their detection.

Douglas's face became drawn, and his eyes took on a very strained look, as he realised what
it would mean if he could not get the Janequeo off; the Peruvians would give very short shrift
to a body of men who had been caught in the attempt to torpedo their fleet.  Moreover, he had
heard certain gruesome stories from the Chilian seamen to the effect that some of the half-caste
troops which the Peruvians had with them were rather addicted to the pastime of torturing any
prisoners who might be unlucky enough to fall into their hands--a relic, undoubtedly, of the
customs of their Indian ancestors.

After the engines had been stopped, Jim called a hasty council of the crew, consulting with
them as to what was best to be done.  They could not possibly force the boat over the chain,
because, even were the engines powerful enough, the Janequeo would break her back in the process.

"If only we had a couple of good strong files we might manage even yet," whispered Douglas,
leaning over the side and feeling at the chain.  "The links are not more than half an inch
thick, and we could soon cut them. Does anybody know whether there are any good stout files
aboard?"

As he ceased speaking a man dived down through the tiny engine-room hatch, and presently reappeared,
bearing in his hands two large files.

"We have these, senor," he whispered excitedly to Jim; "they were brought on board this morning
from the Blanco, when I was doing some repairs to the engines, and I forgot to take them back
before we started.  How will they do?"

Douglas eagerly seized the tools and ran his thumb along the edges. They were very rough and
coarse, being hardly worn at all, and were just what was wanted for the purpose.  Given sufficient
time, and immunity from detection, the work of getting clear of the chain by filing it through
would be easy.

"That's the very thing, El Lobo," ejaculated Douglas in a low voice. "Now, start on the job
at once.  Let one man cut the upper side of the link, and one the lower, and we shall be free
in next to no time.  Who will take first spell with me?"

Every man silently held out his hand for the other file, and Jim selected a fellow of herculean
proportions to take first turn with him. In a few seconds the low rasping sound of the rapidly
moving files broke the stillness of the night, and seemed preternaturally loud by comparison
with that stillness.  The remaining members of the crew concentrated all their powers in the
act of listening, so that they might give instant warning to the workers, should the noise
appear to attract any attention from the shore.

Jim and his fellow-labourer were soon bathed in sweat, while Douglas's hands, unaccustomed
to such toil, grew red and raw and blistered under the friction; for the files, as is quite
usual in engineering departments, were unprovided with wooden handles over the rat-tail shank.
Moreover, the task threatened to be long and difficult, in consequence of the awkwardness of
the conditions.  Jim's spell of work came to an end after a quarter of an hour, however, and
another couple of men took their places at the chain.  But they had not been working more than
five minutes when there was a heavy splash, followed by a cry of disappointment from both men.

It appeared that, while working, the two files had suddenly met in the middle of a stroke,
with the result that one of them had been knocked out of its user's hand and had gone overboard.
This was a serious loss, indeed, and one that might cost the whole of them their lives; but,
as Jim said, it was no use crying over spilt milk, the file was gone, and there was an end
of it.  The other man must work doubly hard, that was all.  Meanwhile, he went down into the
engine-room and prowled round to see whether, by some lucky chance, there might not be another
file lying about.  He was successful in finding a small one, but it was very much worn, and
not likely to be of much use; nevertheless, in the hands of a strong man it might still be
made to cut a little.  He immediately took it up on deck and gave it to one of the crew.  To
his great relief, he found that one part of the chain was nearly severed.  By the time that
it was entirely cut through, the lower part of the link was half- severed; and then it was
but a short job to completely cut it with the large file.

At length it was done.  There was a final rasp of the file, a little snapping noise, a sudden
splash as the chain fell into two halves and disappeared below the surface, and the Janequeo
dropped back in the water with a loud "squelching" noise.

But they were free!  Free at last; though every man on board was trembling like a leaf in the
wind under the stress that they had undergone.  There was no time for delay, however.  Many
precious minutes had been lost, and there were all too few left in which to complete the work
that had to be done.  Jim passed the word once more for steam for five knots, the screw began
to revolve, and the Janequeo stole forward again on her errand of destruction.  Jim feared
that there might be a second chain across the harbour, a little higher up, but the Peruvians
had evidently considered the single barrier sufficient, for there were no more booms.

Now he could see the towering spars of two school hulks, and in a few minutes he passed slowly
and silently by them, but without stopping. They were old and practically worthless hulks;
he would destroy them after he had annihilated the ironclad monsters which were capable of
doing efficient work.

With carelessness that amounted to fatuity there seemed to be no watch kept on board the ships,
and there were no lights visible.  All was as still and silent as the grave.  The Union was
the next craft in line; she was a gunboat, and had already shewn herself capable of stinging
pretty severely, but he promised himself to attend to her on the return journey, and pushed
on still farther up the harbour.  The ships were apparently all lying on the Janequeo's port
side, so it became necessary to shift the bombs over.  By the time that this was done Jim saw
a dark, shapeless mass looming up in front of him, crowned by one short, squat funnel and one
mast; and he knew that he was approaching either the Atahualpa or the Manco Capac, the two
monitors which had done so much damage to the Chilian fleet.

Here at last was a foe worthy of attention, and Jim stopped his engines altogether, allowing
the Janequeo to slide along through the water by her own momentum.  It was a fortunate thing
that he did so, for when the torpedo-boat was within twenty feet of the monitor she suddenly
collided with a floating wooden boom which had been placed round the ironclad. The impact was
very slight, however, and Jim presently had his little craft securely moored alongside.  He
then got overboard on to the boom, with half a dozen men, and, carrying the bomb gingerly in
his arms, and followed by his men bearing one of the torpedo-spars, made his way round to that
portion of the timber which floated opposite the ironclad's stern.  Jim meant to affix his
torpedo to the ship's stern-post, so that, if it did not actually sink her, it might at least
blow away both rudder and propeller, and so render the ship useless.

Arrived at the stern, he saw that she was his old enemy, the Manco Capac, and he at once set
to work.  The men laid the spar down on the boom and pushed it out until one end was touching
the Manco Capac's stern-post, the other remaining on the boom.  They then lashed the boom-
end securely, and Jim, having slung the bomb round his shoulders, started to crawl out along
the spar, while the Chilians sat on the other end to make it still more steady.

It would have been a perilous enough journey at any time, but in the dark and with a heavy
weight slung round the shoulders it was trebly difficult.  Furthermore, the place fairly swarmed
with sharks, and Douglas knew what his fate would be should he lose his hold and fall into
the water, even if he did not happen to be dragged to the bottom at once by the weight round
his neck.  Several times his knees or his hands slipped, making the spar quiver ominously,
but, fortunately, he retained his hold on the pole, and at last, after many a narrow escape,
arrived under the ironclad's overhanging counter.

Here the worst part of his task was over, for he could now support himself by clinging to the
rudder, and he soon found a large nut, close to the water's edge, from which he could suspend
the deadly torpedo.  He quickly unslung it from round his shoulders, and presently had it lashed
firmly in position against the curve of the Manco Capac's counter, the lower edge of the bomb
being just about a couple of inches clear of the water.  He then fixed the fuse alongside the
rudder-post, and after listening to hear whether any one was about, he struck a match and applied
it to the loose end.

This being the first torpedo, he had cut a length of fuse to burn for two hours, so that he
would have time to do all his work and get away before the first explosion occurred, but when
the fuse was lighted it seemed to fizz away with alarming rapidity, and Jim was so startled
that he nearly fell into the water.

"That fuse will never burn for two hours," he told himself; "there must be something wrong
with it, for at that rate it will not last thirty minutes."  He therefore made his second journey
along the pole at the best speed of which he was capable, and in a couple of minutes was standing
on the boom once more.  The seven of them made short work of unlashing the spar and getting
it back to the torpedo-boat, and the Janequeo was soon under way again and stealing up the
harbour once more.

The Atahualpa was the next ship they came to, and to their unbounded satisfaction they found
that she was unprotected by a boom.  The Peruvians probably thought that a hostile craft would
never get so far without being discovered.  The Janequeo was therefore run right under her
stem, and the torpedo was affixed without any difficulty, a fuse timed for an hour and a half
being lighted.  This fuse, too, Jim noticed, seemed to be burning away much faster than it
ought, but there was no time to watch it, and the torpedo-boat swung off once more on her mission
of destruction.

These two craft were, with the exception, perhaps, of the Union, which was a fast ship, the
most formidable in the Peruvian fleet, and Jim experienced a thrill of satisfaction at the
thought that the Manco Capac and Atahualpa would, at any rate, not trouble the Chilians again.
There was another ship lying close at hand, which Douglas judged to be the fast transport Oroya,
because of her paddle wheels, and he made up his mind to attend to her before running back
to blow up the Union.  He selected her paddle-box as the best place to which to attach the
torpedo, and as she, too, was unprotected by any boom, he soon had the bomb fixed in position
and the fuse lighted.

"Now, men," he whispered excitedly to his delighted crew, "we will run down and attend to the
only other ship of theirs which is of any use-- the Union.  Hard over with your helm, quartermaster,
and we will get down the harbour again."

The wheel spun round in Pedro's sinewy grasp, and the Janequeo's nose was presently pointing
down the harbour.

"Full speed ahead," Douglas whispered down the tube, "we haven't much time to lose."  And the
little engines began to throb more rapidly, while the screw thrashed the water up astern. 
They soon passed the Atahualpa again, and Jim could plainly make out the jumping sparks which
came from the fuse and hissed into the water, but the sight was hidden from any one up above
by the overhang of the ship's counter, and he felt fairly certain that it could not possibly
be discovered before the bomb had exploded and done its deadly work.  As they slipped past
the doomed monitor Douglas's eye suddenly caught sight of a dark figure with a rifle over its
shoulder silhouetted against the luminous haze thrown off by the lights of Callao, and his
heart gave a great bound, for the figure had not been there when the torpedo-boat passed up,
and she could now hardly hope to avoid detection.

Jim's fears were only too well founded, for the sentry saw the Janequeo as quickly as Jim saw
the sentry, and in a second the fellow roared a hoarse challenge across the water, discharging
his rifle at the boat as she swept past, without waiting for any reply.  And indeed there was
no need for him to expect an answer to his hail, for he knew that no boat ought to be cruising
about there if she were a Peruvian; while, if she were a Chilian--

The rifle-shot was the signal for an immediate uproar; it seemed as though every man must have
been asleep at his post, for the Atahualpa's decks suddenly became literally alive with figures,
and rifles began to flash about her in scores, while the bullets pattered round and into the
torpedo-boat with most unpleasant accuracy of aim.

"There is no time to destroy the Union now," hissed Douglas between his teeth; "we shall have
to be satisfied with what we have already done, and, caramba! we shall be fortunate if we get
away with whole skins.  Look out, all people with thin skulls; the Manco's people are training
her big guns on us!  Full speed ahead, below there," he roared, there being no more need now
for secrecy; "give her all the steam she can carry, or they will have us for certain."

The screw was already turning at its utmost speed, however, and not another knot could be got
out of the flying little steamer; indeed, she was already doing sixteen, or one knot more than
they had any right to expect.  Just as Jim spoke, a red rocket leaped up into the still night
air with a whistling roar, bursting high up in the sky with a shower of brilliant red stars.

"A signal to the patrols in the bay!" cried Jim; and at the same moment the huge 15-inch gun
on board the Manco Capac roared out its vengeful message.  "We shall have to hurry to get clear
now, and no mistake."

The flash of the great gun, fired at such close quarters, nearly blinded the Janequeo's crew,
while they were dazed by the hurtling roar of the shell as it sped past, a few feet only above
their heads.  But the torpedo-boat was now moving very rapidly, and the Manco's crew would
not be able to load and fire their stern gun again before she was out of its range; but there
was still her bow gun to be feared, and the gauntlet of the Union and the two school hulks
had to be run before they could get clear.  It looked as if the Janequeo was in for a bad ten
minutes; for, after the alarm had been given, it seemed as though every ship in the harbour
had lighted her beacon-fire; and Jim could see, by the glare of those which had sprung up aboard
the Union and her consorts, that guns, both big and small, had been run out ready to fire into
the intruder as she passed; while every vessel's side was literally black with riflemen, all
waiting to pour a volley into the daring Janequeo.

Douglas had almost forgotten, in the prevailing excitement, the fact that torpedoes had been
attached to three Peruvian vessels, and, in any case, he did not expect them to explode for
at least an hour; when, just as the Janequeo had got about fifty yards past the Manco Capac,
there was a most appalling explosion from the stern of the latter craft; and Jim, turning round,
saw that the air was full of blazing fragments of wreckage, and that, even as he gazed, the
great monitor was beginning to settle by the stern.  At the moment when the mine exploded,
the monitor was just about to fire her 15-inch bow gun; but the catastrophe of course threw
everything into confusion, and the weapon, flung from its trunnions in the very act of firing,
discharged its deadly missile high into the air, where it exploded, sending out a blaze of
flame like a miniature firework display.

"One of them done for, at any rate!" soliloquised Jim through his set teeth, as he bent over
the deck-telegraph of the flying boat to ring for yet more speed.  "But now they will surely
find the other torpedoes and cut them adrift before they have time to explode.  Confound those
fuses! The wretched things must have perished badly, or perhaps they have been wrongly timed
in the manufactory."

The young man had no opportunity, however, for further reflection, for they were now dashing
along toward the Union and the other two ships; and after the first shock of terror at the
destruction of the monitor, the Peruvians had returned to the guns, and were quite ready to
send the Janequeo to the bottom.

"God help us!" murmured the young Englishman; "we shall never get through that tempest of fire;
but I am going to try!"

Nearer and nearer they swept, until the torpedo-boat was only a hundred yards away, and then
the Union fired her first gun, a large 8-inch rifled weapon, loaded with a shell which screamed
horridly as it swept past and plunged into the water just astern.  The riflemen raised their
pieces, levelled them over the corvette's high sides, and, at the word of command, which all
aboard the torpedo-boat could hear, they sent their volleys hurtling aboard that devoted craft.
Jim felt a sharp twinge in his left shoulder, and knew that he was hit; two other men fell
to the deck, limp as empty suits of clothes.  The Janequeo was now abreast the Union, and,
as she drew level, the latter ship discharged every gun that she could bring to bear.

It was simply impossible that she could miss.  There was a ripping and tearing of iron as the
shower of steel struck the torpedo-boat.  Both her funnels were blown completely out of her,
and the hissing roar of escaping steam, followed by the screams of the scalded stokers down
below, told all too plainly that a boiler had been pierced.  The quartermaster at the wheel
let go the spokes and collapsed on deck, and Jim staggered to the helm just in time to prevent
the Janequeo from crashing into the mole.  Then, still floating, and with smoke, steam, and
flame billowing along her decks and blinding her gallant skipper, the maimed little vessel
staggered forward.  But escape was not for her. The Union had a smart man for captain, and
he did not intend the little Chilian hornet to go clear.  The forward 8-inch gun bellowed out,
and its shell struck the Chilian fair and square on her stern, exploding as it passed into
her hull, and literally blowing the after-part of her away.

Her stern plunged downward; she rolled heavily once or twice, and then turned right over, throwing
Jim, in a state of semi-unconsciousness, into the water of the harbour.  Then she sank, and
the bottom blew out of her as she plunged beneath the surface.  At this precise moment, to
Jim's fast-failing senses there came the roar of a terrific explosion, followed almost instantly
by a second, and he knew that, though his own ship was lost, he had done his duty and succeeded
in destroying three of the enemy.

Just as he was on the point of sinking, however, for the last time, a hand shot out, grasped
his collar, and hauled him roughly into a boat, while a voice growled out in Spanish, "This
is the only one afloat, senor; the rest are down among the sharks, who will not go hungry to-
night."  Then darkness closed down over Jim's senses, though not before he had realised that
he was a prisoner in the hands of his enemies, the Peruvians.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN.

IN THE FACE OF DEATH.

When Jim recovered consciousness, it was to find himself in a small dark cell, whether on board
a ship or on land he could not tell, for there was no window in his prison, and there was not
a particle of that motion which he knew there would have been had he been at sea; but he presently
came to the conclusion that he must be in one of the "punishment cells" aboard some ship lying
in the harbour, for he thought that, now and again, he could hear the faint plash and gurgle
of water close at hand, a sound similar to that which he had often heard when down about the
bilges of the Blanco Encalada, far below the water-line.  He also very soon realised that,
in addition to being in prison, he had chains upon his legs, and further, that those chains
were fastened to a ring, or staple, set into the wall of the chamber.  The poor lad was consumed
by a raging thirst, too; while the wound in his shoulder, inflicted either by a bullet or a
piece of flying shell, was occasioning him very great pain.  If he only had a light, he reflected,
things would not be quite so bad, and he rummaged among his pockets in the endeavour to find
a box of matches which he knew had been in his pocket when he was thrown overboard off the
Janequeo.  They were in a tin box, so that it was just possible that the water would not have
had time to get to them during the short period of his immersion; and, in any case, as his
clothing was very nearly dry again, it was more than likely that the matches would be the same.

After trying several pockets, and discovering that they had already been gone through, and
that all articles of any value, including his watch and chain, had been taken from him, he
found the box for which he was searching in the hip-pocket of his trousers; and, to his great
delight, the wet had not reached its contents.  He therefore struck a light, and the first
thing his eyes rested upon was a large pitcher of water, and a plate containing a piece of
black bread and several slices of pemmican or dried meat.  These had been placed close beside
him, and he was thankful that he had not accidentally capsized the water-jug in the darkness.
He seized and drank at it eagerly, and when he had half- finished the contents he discovered
that he was famished with hunger. He therefore struck another match and, by its light, possessed
himself of the food, which he proceeded to devour ravenously, and finished off the entire supply
before his hunger was satisfied.  Having made a good meal, he felt very much better, and then
by the light of a tiny fire, made of match-stalks, scraps of straw, and similar odds and ends,
he managed, with some difficulty, to strip off his coat and shirt, and to attend, in some small
degree, to the wound in his shoulder.

It presented a somewhat inflamed appearance, so he improvised a pad and bandage by tearing
strips off his shirt.  These he soaked in the precious remainder of his drinking water and
wrapped them round the injured part, binding the whole tightly in place with a strip of linen
wound right round his body.  This having been done, he felt so much more comfortable that he
began to think a little natural sleep would do him no harm, and he accordingly composed himself
to slumber upon the heap of straw which had been thrown down in one corner of the cell.

How long, he wondered, had he been in this miserable hole?  It must certainly have been a good
many hours, or he would not have felt so intensely hungry and thirsty; and he also wondered
in what ship, if any, he was, and how the Peruvians would treat the man who had blown up three
of their finest ships, leaving them only the bare skeleton of a navy.

He did not think very long, however; for he was fatigued to the point of exhaustion, and soon
sank into a state of complete oblivion.  How long he had slept he could not tell, but he was
awakened by the noise of a door opening, and the shining of a bright light full upon his face.
Before he could fully collect his faculties the bearer of the lamp, a burly Peruvian seaman
with the name Union on the front of his cap, bade him in a rough tone of voice stand up, at
the same time producing a key from among a number which hung at his belt and unlocking the
young Englishman's irons.  As they fell away from his limbs Jim heaved a sigh of relief, which
the seaman heard; and hearing, remarked: "You need not be so glad to get them off, you young
whipper-snapper; you will be free for only a few minutes, while the captain sees you, and after
he has done with you, you will probably be shot--or worse!  So you need not look so pleased."

Needless to say, after the communication of this item of information Jim did not feel exactly
jubilant; but the fellow, he considered, might only have been speaking thus to vent his ill-will;
and in any case Jim was not going to let him see that what he had said affected him in the
least.  He therefore merely answered: "We shall see what we shall see; fate is fate, and nobody
can alter that."

The fellow made no reply in words, but, uttering a raucous laugh, bade Jim precede him out
of the cell, and mind that he played no tricks or he would get a bullet through him.  Then
the seaman locked the door, pocketed the key, and placing his rifle with its fixed bayonet
at the "charge," ordered the prisoner to walk on in front, which Jim did; keeping his eyes
very wide open, meanwhile, so as to make a note of the position of the cell and its surroundings
for possible use on some future occasion.

They first passed along a passage flanked with other cells, similar to Jim's, that in which
he had been confined being the last of a row, and then they came to an iron-studded door, which
the prisoner was commanded to open.  It opened at his touch, and the Englishman and his guard
passed through it, finding themselves immediately upon the Union's lower deck.  As the Peruvian
marine guided Jim through the ship, with the point of his fixed bayonet, the young Englishman
took the opportunity to satisfy his curiosity regarding this famous craft--a curiosity which
was perfectly natural in view of the fact that he had himself fought an action with her, and
chased her while he was in the Angamos.  He smiled as his eyes fell upon one of the beams supporting
the main deck, for in it were embedded several pieces of shell which the Peruvians had not
seen fit to remove; and he knew that they were the fragments of a missile, fired by his own
cruiser, which had entered one of the Union's open gun-ports that day of the battle in the
Second Narrows.

But his examination of the interior of the corvette was necessarily only a very cursory one,
for he was hurried forward by a prod from the sentry's bayonet whenever he showed a disposition
to loiter.  They presently mounted a ladder leading from the lower to the main deck, walked
along the latter toward the stern, and presently Jim found himself outside the door of a cabin
in the extreme after-end of the ship, which he shrewdly surmised belonged to the skipper.

The sentry then grounded his rifle, knocked upon the door, opened it slightly, and announced
in gruff tones: "The prisoner, sir!"

There was a short pause, broken only by the rustling of papers, and then a low, carefully modulated
voice replied: "Bring the fellow in, then, sentry"; and Jim was ushered into the presence of
Captain Villavicencio, the famous captain of the Peruvian corvette.

Entering, Douglas found himself in a large and airy cabin, situated in the extreme after-end
of the ship, opening on to a narrow gallery running round the stern of the ship, from quarter
to quarter.  Two tall and narrow doors which gave exit on to this gallery, and which now stood
open, disclosed a view of Callao harbour, with the water shimmering in the rays of the newly
risen sun, for it was early morning.  In the centre of the cabin, which was most luxuriously
furnished, stood a magnificent mahogany writing-table, at which sat the man whose name was
still ringing through a whole continent.  He was an extremely handsome individual, and his
enormous proportions were well set off by the dark blue and gold of his naval uniform.  He
had jet-black curly hair, and a short, pointed beard; while the dark eyes which looked out
from beneath thick, overhanging brows, seemed to pierce through and through the individual
toward whom his glance was directed.  Jim saw at once that this was a man among a thousand,
one who would make a name for himself, and come to the front in spite of all opposition.  But
there was a certain subtle something about the Peruvian which inspired in the young man a feeling
almost akin to terror.  The eyes, for instance, had a distinctly tigerish look about them,
and the man's whole personality was strongly suggestive of a feline nature.  Those deep-set
dark eyes, Jim knew instinctively, could, at times, flash forth lightnings deadly in their
intensity; while that low, purring voice could also take on a note of such deadly menace as
would make the hearer's blood curdle.  The steel-pointed claw beneath the velvet glove was
all too apparent to the young Englishman, and he looked forward to the coming interview with
feelings that were anything but pleasant.  He felt as though he were in the power of some gigantic
cat which might play with him until it was tired of that amusement, and would then turn and
rend him.  No wonder, he thought to himself, that the Chilians feared this man, and spared
no pains in their endeavours to destroy him and his ship.

In response to a wave of Villavicencio's hand, Jim took up a position on the side of the table
opposite to that occupied by the skipper, while the sentry posted himself close alongside the
prisoner.  Then the Peruvian busied himself with some papers for a few minutes, apparently
oblivious of Jim's presence.  At length, having found that for which he was searching, he glanced
up, and his gaze flickered over Jim like summer lightning, inspiring in the young man so strong
a feeling of repulsion that it almost amounted to nausea.  There was something horribly magnetic
in the look, and Jim felt that this man possessed some strange occult power which was lacking
in most human beings.

After looking at the young man for a few seconds, Villavicencio turned to the sentry and remarked,
"I shall not need your presence, I think, Jacinto.  You may leave the room, but post yourself
outside my cabin door, and see that we are not interrupted."

The sentry gravely presented arms, and walked out of the cabin, closing the door softly behind
him.  When he had gone the skipper took up a blank sheet of paper and a pencil, wrote down
a few lines on the paper, and then looking at his prisoner, said in a low, purring tone--

"You are the young Chilian naval officer who was in charge of the torpedo-boat which destroyed
three of our ships the night before last, are you not?"

Jim replied that he was.

"Well," resumed Villavicencio, "you will be sorry, I am sure, to hear that all your comrades
were drowned when the Janequeo--that was the name of the boat, I believe--went down.  You are
the sole survivor.  By the way, how many men had you with you?"

"There were eighteen of us altogether," replied Douglas.

The skipper made a brief note on the paper before him and then remarked softly, "H'm, it is
a pity that they were all drowned.  I should have much liked to have saved a few more of them."

Although there was absolutely no fault to be found with the sentiment expressed by the captain,
Jim felt instinctively that the words possessed a double meaning, and he shivered in spite
of the heat of the morning, which was already becoming excessive.

"What is your name, young man?" was the next question, and upon Jim answering, his reply was
noted down by his interrogator upon the paper before him.  Just as he had finished writing
a thought seemed to strike him suddenly and he looked up quickly from the sheet.

"Were you ever on board the Chilian cruiser Angamos?" he inquired, still in the same low and
even tones, but with a curious new thrill in his voice.

"Yes," replied Jim, looking him straight in the face, "I had the honour to command that ship
upon the occasion when she encountered the Union in the Straits of Magellan.  If I remember
rightly, the Union did not stay to finish our little encounter."

"Ah-h-h," breathed Villavicencio, through his teeth, "so you were the man in command of the
cruiser.  I thought you might be when I heard your name, but you struck me as being rather
young for the post.  By the way, how old are you?"

Jim told him, not without a certain curious sinking sensation about his heart.

"So young as that?  Dear me, dear me! it certainly does seem a pity, but it cannot be helped,"
said the captain.  "Your name does not sound like a Chilian one, however.  Of what nationality
are you, if I may ask?"

"I am an Englishman," replied Jim, "and proud of the fact," he immediately added.

Villavicencio appeared to be sunk in thought for a few seconds, during which he ejaculated
"Caramba!" and "Carrajo!" several times.  The last item of information seemed to be both unexpected
and unpleasant. Presently, however, he muttered to himself, "Well, I don't suppose it matters
very much.  People are liable to accidents here as well as elsewhere, and if inquiries should
be made I can easily plead ignorance. Only, I shall have to alter the method of it.  My first
idea might possibly attract too much attention.  However--I shall see."  Aloud, he went on,
"Have you any relations in this part of the world, Senor Douglas?"

Inconsequent as the question appeared to be, Jim felt an uncanny, creepy sensation about the
roots of his hair, but his voice did not shake as he replied, "No, I have no relations either
in Chili or in any other part of the world.  I am absolutely alone."

Villavicencio's face at once brightened, and he rubbed his hands, remarking, "Ah! then so much
the better, Senor Douglas, for in that case they will not miss you."  Then his whole appearance
changed, and his voice dropped to a harsh, hissing note as he resumed, "It is a great pity,
though, that you are an Englishman, and so well known in the Chilian navy, for that fact prevents
me from dealing as I had intended with the miscreant who destroyed two of our ships and seriously
damaged a third.  But though I cannot punish you as I should have liked, I can and will have
you shot, and that immediately, on the deck of my ship, the Union, the vessel which, you so
pleasantly remarked just now, ran away from your cruiser and her consort in the Straits."

"But," exclaimed Douglas, in astonishment, "I am a prisoner of war, and I demand to be treated
as such.  I have done nothing but my duty, nothing to merit death at your hands; and even if
I had, I have yet to learn that one man only, even though he be the captain of a corvette,
can sit in judgment upon a prisoner and sentence him to death.  I am at least entitled to a
proper court-martial, if I am to be tried for my life."

Villavicencio laughed.  "What you say, my dear young man, is no doubt technically correct;
but here might is right, and I will deal with you as I please, as you shall very soon see.
Sentry!" he called, suddenly raising his voice and smiling evilly into Jim's face.

For a brief moment Douglas was on the point of leaping across the table and endeavouring to
strangle the Peruvian where he sat, and neither the man's sword at his side nor his huge proportions
would have intimidated him, but there was that curious look in Villavicencio's eyes which seemed
to hypnotise and chain poor Jim to the spot on which he stood. The next second the sentry entered,
and it was too late to think about resistance.

"Sentry," said the skipper, "take the prisoner back to his cell, and see that he does not attempt
to escape on the way; he looks desperate.  When you have locked him up in safety, send Lieutenant
Rodriguez to me at once."

Like a man in a dream, Jim marched to the door, scarcely hearing the skipper's sauve voice
remarking: "Hasta la vista, Senor Douglas; I will not say adios, for we shall meet again--once
more."

The cabin door then closed, and Jim was conducted back to his cell, followed by the curious
glances of the men who were assembled about the decks.  Once back in his prison, he seemed
able to think more connectedly, and he began to wonder whether or not there might be some means
of escape from this semi-human creature's clutches.  He had done absolutely nothing to merit
this threatened summary execution, and he felt convinced that his sentence was simply due to
the skipper's own desire for personal vengeance on the man who had made him turn and fly upon
that memorable day at the Second Narrows.  If it really was so, there was nothing to be hoped,
Jim felt, from the man's clemency; for he clearly knew no more of the meaning of the word "mercy"
than does an untamed tiger.

Thus thinking, Douglas fell into a deep and gloomy reverie, from which he was aroused by the
sounds of footsteps clattering about above his head, accompanied by the occasional clank of
arms, and several short, crisp words of command.  It sounded as though a body of men had been
formed up on the deck above him, and had then been marched off to some other place.  In a moment
the horrible truth struck him; it was the firing-party which had been told off for his own
execution!

That he was right was proved by the fact that he almost immediately afterwards heard footsteps
approaching the door and echoing along the passage.  There was a rattle of keys, and he was
confronted, this time, by two armed seamen, who roughly bade him get on his feet and accompany
them.  The poor lad was too thunderstruck to move for a few moments, so one of the men prodded
him roughly with his bayonet, and again bade him rise.  Jim then got on his legs, with the
blood streaming from the thrust which had been inflicted in his thigh, and between the two
guards he again made his way to the main deck.  This time, however, he was not taken so far
aft as before, but was conducted up the main companion stairs on to the upper deck.

Having arrived there, the intense light from the brilliant sun nearly blinded him after his
imprisonment in the pitchy blackness of his cell; but as soon as he could see clearly he at
once perceived, drawn up in single line across the quarter-deck, a body of men armed with rifles,
and he knew that this was indeed the firing-party which Villavicencio had promised him.  The
skipper was nowhere in sight; but the lieutenant, Rodriguez, stood at the end of the firing-line
with his drawn sword in his hand.  Jim was piloted by his guards past the end of the firing-
party and placed with his back against a number of stout planks reared on end, which were there
for the purpose of stopping the bullets after they had passed through the young man's body.
It was only when the lieutenant came up to him and began to bandage his eyes that Jim recovered
from the state of semi-coma into which he had been thrown by the news of his impending execution;
but the touch of the Peruvian's hands recalled him to his senses and, flinging the man's fingers
aside, he protested vigorously against the gross injustice and inhumanity of the proceeding.

The only answer was a short word of command from Rodriguez, in reply to which the two guards
seized Douglas by the arms and pinioned him so that further struggles were impossible.  The
bandage was then adjusted, and Jim was forced back against the planks.  The guards then stood
aside; but, Jim's arms being now bound behind him, resistance was useless and escape impossible.
Rather, therefore, than engage in a useless and undignified struggle, he determined to put
a bold face on the matter, and meet his fate like a man.  Accordingly, he stood still, waiting
for the end.

He heard the sharp command to load, then to present; and he was nerving himself to hear the
fatal word "Fire!" when the voice of Villavicencio broke the intense stillness.  What he said
Jim did not know, but the command to fire did not come.  Instead, the rifles were grounded
with a clash, and Douglas heard somebody walking toward him.

Then the Peruvian skipper's voice broke the intense silence.  "Take off that bandage," he commanded;
and the handkerchief being stripped from Jim's eyes he found himself looking into those of
Villavicencio.

"You are reprieved, Senor Englishman," he said; "I have just received a letter which has induced
me to change my mind about you.  Instead, therefore, of shooting you, I am sending you, together
with a number of your comrades, the Chilian officers whom I captured in the Rimac, to the silver
mines on the shores of Lake Titicaca.  That will, in some sort, compensate me for your insulting
remark about the incident in the Second Narrows, for I can promise you that your life, and
the lives of your comrades, will be made a very purgatory for you.  Shooting is much too easy
a death for you, my friend; you will die, all the same, in the silver mines; but the process
of dying will be slow and very unpleasant. You will start on your journey to-morrow, senor;
and you will have a splendid opportunity to view the beauties of the country, for you will
walk the whole distance, which is several hundred miles.  And now, senor, I bid you a final
adios.  Guards, take the man away and lodge him again in his cell.  Look after him well; for
you will pay for it with your lives if you let him escape.  Again, senor, adios!"

CHAPTER FIFTEEN.

ON THE ROAD TO SORATA.

It is small wonder that Douglas felt so unnerved by the ordeal through which he had just passed
that his brain seemed numbed to such an extent that he scarcely realised what was going on
around him.  Villavicencio's taunts passed him by almost unheeded, and Jim most certainly did
not realise that he was only exchanging a sudden for a lingering death.  He was conscious only
of the fact that his life had been spared; and he walked to his cell, between the guards, like
a man in a dream.  It was not until the heavy prison door banged to after him that he really
awoke once more to a sense of the reality of things; and, although he speedily realised all
that was meant by his being condemned to the silver mines for life, hope sprang up again in
his breast.  While there was life there was hope; and he would be a poor sort of man, he reflected,
if he could not somehow contrive to escape, and that soon, from the terrible captivity to which
Villavicencio had consigned him.  And further than that, he determined that, once free, he
would make the brutal Peruvian skipper pay, and that heavily, for the mental torment to which
he had put his prisoner.

To occupy his mind, Jim then began to examine his prison, so far as his bonds would permit
him to do so, with the view of ascertaining whether there was any possibility of escape for
him; and he came to the conclusion that, though he might possibly manage to break out, if he
were given time enough, he would need a very much longer time for the accomplishment of such
a task than the few hours which were to elapse before he was to be taken out of the cell and
placed among the chain- gang which was to march to the silver mines.  No; escape, if escape
was to be compassed, would have to be effected while on the march; and Douglas fell to wondering
who his companions in misfortune would prove to be, and whether they would be likely to be
prevailed upon to join him in a dash for liberty.  At any rate, he decided, as he fell asleep,
nothing could be done, no arrangements could be made, until he saw the men who were to be his
fellow-prisoners.  Then, and then only, would he be able to judge whether an escape while on
the march would be practicable.  Jim sincerely hoped that the captives would prove to be "game"
men, for once they had arrived at their destination, the silver mines, there would be very
little chance of escape.  Their freedom would have to be won while on the march, or not at all.

Thus musing, Jim, overcome by the many and varied emotions of the morning, at length fell asleep;
and he continued to slumber peacefully and almost continuously until he was wakened, on the
following morning, by the sounds of the clashing of arms and the tramp of heavy footsteps outside
his cell door.  The young man sat up quickly, feeling much refreshed after his long sleep;
and a second later the cell door swung open, a file of Peruvian marines entered the prison,
and he was ordered to rise to his feet.  His manacles were then unlocked, and, between his
two guards, he walked out of his cell for the last time and proceeded on deck.  There was nobody
there when he arrived, and he was ordered to sit down under the port bulwarks, which he did,
with the marines mounting guard over him.  But a few minutes later Lieutenant Rodriguez appeared
on deck, followed by a miserable-looking squad of half a dozen Chilian officers, among whom
Jim recognised one or two whom he knew.  They were guarded by a score of Peruvian seamen armed
with drawn cutlasses.  Jim was then roughly hauled to his feet and pushed into the midst of
the new arrivals, who, recognising his uniform, tattered and torn though it was, hailed him
as a comrade, and received him with, figuratively, open arms. The seven men were then formed
up in line, and their names called out by Rodriguez.  When they had answered the roll the Peruvian
lieutenant called the sergeant in charge of the guard aside and gave him certain instructions;
after which the Chilians were once more formed up in the middle of their escort, and the whole
body, prisoners and guards, marched down the sloping gangway which led from the Union's deck
to the wharf, and Jim found himself once more, after many weary months, on terra firma.

Still surrounded by their guards, the Chilians marched away along the stone quay wall, and
presently, having left the precincts of the harbour, they arrived in the town proper of Callao.
There, as soon as they made their appearance, a crowd of roughs surrounded the prisoners and
began to deride them and pelt them with such filth and garbage as came to hand.  Their destination,
Jim discovered, was the Plaza, or great square, of the city, where they were to join the main
body of prisoners destined for the mines.  For the whole of the way the unfortunate men were
in peril of their lives from the ferocity of the mob; indeed, in one instance the crowd made
such an ugly rush in its attempt to get at the Chilians, to tear them to pieces, that their
guards were obliged to halt, form a hollow square, with their captives in the middle, and repel
the attack with their fixed bayonets.

At the moment when the danger was at its worst Jim seized the opportunity to observe the faces
of his companions in misfortune, and on only two of them did he perceive any signs of terror;
he therefore decided that when making his plans for escape he would take especial care that
those two officers were not made acquainted with them, as they would be not unlikely to disclose
the plot, hoping that by so doing they might procure their own freedom without the danger involved
in fighting for it.  The remaining four held their heads high, and looked as though, if only
they possessed weapons, they would have been more than glad to take a share in the fight. 
These were the sort of fellows, Douglas decided, with whom to discuss plans for escape, and
he made up his mind that as soon as he could do so without being observed by the guards, he
would take them aside with a view to the arranging of a plan of escape to be put into effect
before the prison-gang should arrive at the mines.

At length the crowd, finding that the military guard round the prisoners was too strong for
it, abandoned its attempt to wreak its vengeance on the Chilians, and finally dispersed.  The
procession then resumed its march, and a quarter of an hour later arrived at the gran Plaza
de Callao, where another depressing sight met Jim's eyes.  Round the Plaza now ranged rank
upon rank of armed Peruvian soldiers, who were mounting guard over a hundred or more disconsolate-looking
Chilian prisoners, who were nearly all manacled, some singly and some in groups. There were
present representatives of nearly every regiment of the Chilian army, and naval men of all
ratings; and, since the poor fellows had had no change of clothing during their captivity,
most of their uniforms were almost unrecognisable.  But Jim distinguished among them officers
who belonged to the Constitucion and Valparaiso regiments, the Guias, and Grenaderos, together
with Carabineros, Lancers, and Rifleros. Most of the naval prisoners were, however, officers;
and Jim was overjoyed to see that among these were several men whom he knew, and to whom he
determined to make his presence known at the first possible opportunity.  The Englishman was
at first a little surprised at the preponderance of military over naval captives, until he
recollected that some months before, the Union, in command of the redoubtable Villavicencio,
had captured the transport Rimac, which was on her way to Arica with troops.  These unfortunate
men had been subjected to a rigorous captivity in Callao for some months, and had only been
taken from prison that very morning in order to march to the still worse fate of captivity
in the mines.  Altogether there were, with the new arrivals, about a hundred and fifty Chilian
prisoners present on the Plaza; and Jim speedily made up his mind that it would be very curious
if they could not by some means or other manage to effect their escape while on the road.

The appearance of the naval prisoners from the Union was the signal for cheers from their companions
in misfortune, and Jim was speedily recognised by some of the officers near him.  The Peruvian
soldiers, however, did not seem to relish this manifestation on the part of their prisoners,
and several of them ordered the Chilians to keep silent, enforcing the command with savage
blows from the butt-ends of their muskets.  But at this moment a gorgeously uniformed official
rode up on horseback and spoke to the captain in charge of the guard.  Jim could not hear what
was said, but the official handed the captain a paper, appeared to give him certain instructions,
and then galloped off. Captain Veragua--for that, Jim afterwards learned, was the soldier's
name--glanced through the paper, and then began to call the roll of the prisoners.  Most of
them were present; but a hiatus now and again occurred, which was filled in by a voice responding,
"Dead, captain!"

This ceremony having been finished, several armourers made their appearance, with hammers and
cold chisels, and proceeded to knock off the prisoners' leg-irons, so that they would be able
to march.  Then the unhappy men were manacled together in groups of a dozen by means of a long
chain to which their right wrists were fastened.  Jim, seeing that this process was in progress,
unostentatiously moved from where he was standing and took up a position in the midst of a
number of naval officers whom he knew, and who had already been making covert signs for him
to do so.  It thus fell out, as he had hoped, that he was manacled to a group of men whom he
already knew, and he determined to lose no time in discussing with them plans for a possible
escape.

There was no opportunity for that just at present, however; for his group was practically the
last to be attended to; and, directly their chains had been riveted on, the whole body was
formed up in a solid square.  They were then surrounded by the troops, the order to march was
given, and the entire company wheeled to the right off the Plaza into the Calle de los Angeles,
down which they proceeded at a rapid pace.

The low hum of conversation immediately broke out among the Chilians, and it was not checked
by their guards; therefore, although it was impossible at present to discuss anything of a
private nature, Jim took the opportunity to ask his friends if they had any information as
to the fate in store for them, beyond the fact that they were destined for the mines.  He found,
however, that the latter fact was practically all that was known.  They were to be taken, in
the first place, he learned, to the recently erected station at Callao, and then put in the
train for Lima.  There they were to be imprisoned in the castle for one or two nights, until
a second detachment of Chilian prisoners should have arrived from the south, and then the whole
body was, as far as could be ascertained, to be marched direct to Sorata by way of Yanyos,
Huancavelica, Guantanga, Cuzco, and Santa Rosa.  This constituted a journey of some six hundred
miles, the whole of which was to be accomplished on foot!  Truly a pleasant prospect!  But
Jim vowed to himself that it would not be his fault if he did even as much as a sixth of that
distance before he escaped.  He therefore caused the word to be passed round among his fellow-officers,
to whom he was manacled, that he wished to have a private talk with them upon the first occasion
that offered; and their nods of comprehension assured him that they pretty clearly understood
for what purpose the conversation was to be held.

But they had, by this time, arrived at the railway station, and the detachment was halted in
the goods-yard just outside.  Although regular passenger communication had not yet been established
between Callao and the capital, there had been for some time a line of railway for the purpose
of carrying merchandise from the coast to Lima; and when the war began this line was seized
upon by the military authorities for the purpose of transporting stores and soldiers.  A huge,
gloomy barrack of a station had been built, together with a number of auxiliary goods- sheds
for the purpose of holding the war material; and it was among these sheds that the Chilians
found themselves halted.  The tedious process of calling the roll was then again gone through,
and by the time that that was finished a shrill whistle, accompanied by much blowing-off of
steam, and the clank of coupling-chains, announced that the train was being drawn up.

Presently it came in sight round a curve, bumping and jolting over the points, and Jim saw
that it was made up of a number of goods-trucks, to which no covering whatever had been attached,
so that the unhappy prisoners would be exposed, during the whole of their journey, to the fierce
rays of an almost vertical sun, and, as some of the men had already been without water for
twelve hours, and there seemed to be no prospect of getting any before their arrival at Lima,
it looked as though their journey, short as it was to be, would prove a never-to-be- forgotten one.

The Chilians were now formed up in two long lines, one on each side of the set of metals on
which the train was approaching; and, as soon as it steamed into its place, they were ordered
to get on board.  Manacled as they were in groups of twelve, this was necessarily a very tedious
process, and two hours elapsed before the prisoners were all stowed away.  It was then found
that too few wagons had been provided, and, as there were no more procurable, the consequent
crushing was terrible. But it had one advantage, which was, that the Peruvians were obliged
to send a much smaller guard of soldiers than they would otherwise have done, for the simple
reason that there was no room for more; and, as all the Chilians had now stowed themselves
away and it would have taken too long a time to rearrange them, all the guards had to go in
the last truck, instead of being distributed all over the train.  This gave the prisoners the
opportunity that some of them were looking for to have a little private conversation; but there
was no present chance of escape; for the Peruvians with their rifles could fire from one end
of the train to the other, and thus speedily put an end to any attempts of the sort.

The train was on the point of starting when one poor thirsty wretch began to cry out most piteously
for a drink of water; and in a second all the others were also clamouring for some.  But the
Peruvians merely laughed at their entreaties, telling them that it would do them good to be
without for a while, and that they would appreciate their drink all the more when they got
to Lima.  The signal was then given, the whistle blew, and the melancholy procession moved
out of Callao station, to the accompaniment of ironical cheers and wishes for a safe and happy
journey from the soldiery and such of the townspeople as had come to witness the departure.

The pace of the train was positively snail-like, and, as the engine had no tender attached,
and burned wood instead of coal, the stoppages in order to replenish with fuel were very numerous.
At the same time, it being now high noon, the vertical sun streamed down upon the uncovered
trucks until they resembled so many ovens.  The intense heat, coupled with the inordinate length
of time occupied by the journey, reduced some of the prisoners, especially those who had been
without water for many hours, to the verge of frenzy.  Their supplications for water would
have moved the hearts of any but the brutal Peruvian guards, whose canteens were full of spirit
and water, and who constantly refreshed themselves therefrom, tortured the thirsty prisoners
by holding the water-bottles up to their gaze, and then pouring the contents down their own
throats. Gradually a low moan of pain and misery made itself heard in one of the trucks, which
soon spread to the others as the miserable men became unable to bear their tortures any longer
in silence.

"By Jove!" exclaimed Jim, "this is awful; what fiends these Peruvians are!  We have never treated
our prisoners of war as these fellows are doing; I wish I had some water to give them, but
unfortunately I have none; moreover, I am nearly perishing with thirst myself.  Dozens of these
men are wounded, you know, Carlos," he continued, to a brother officer who was sitting next
to him, "and their sufferings must be awful; some of them will go mad before we get to Lima.
Hallo! quick there, stop that man!" he yelled, as a haggard-looking Chilian soldier staggered
to his feet, his eyes blazing with insanity.

But Douglas's warning came too late.  The Englishman had understood instinctively what the
maddened wretch was about to do, and shouted his warning, but the men were packed so closely
that there was no opportunity to save him.  Before a single individual could rise to his feet
the Chilian, manacled by one wrist as he was, had flung himself over the end of the truck and,
falling between the metals, was now being dragged along by the train, his shrieks of agony
filling all who heard them with horror.  The soldier happened to be the end man of his group,
and his length of chain was rather longer than that connecting the other members of that particular
party; but he had nearly dragged the man next to him to a similar fearful death, for the poor
fellow, half crazed with terror, was hanging over the end of the truck with his arm nearly
torn from its socket by the corpse trailing on the line.  His companions, however, seized him
by the body, while several strove to disconnect the chain which fettered him to the awful object
trailing beneath the train.

Jim and several others had staggered to their feet and were shouting to the driver to stop
the train, but the man was too far away to comprehend what was said.  The Peruvians in the
last truck, feigning to believe there was a mutiny of the prisoners, and glad of any excuse
for cruelty, began to fire into the huddled mass of Chilians, the bullets doing fearful execution
at such short range.  The officer next in line to Jim fell dead with a bullet through his heart,
and pulled Douglas down with him, thereby saving the Englishman's life, for a perfect hail
of bullets whizzed into the truck the moment after he fell.

At this moment there was a fearful shriek from the front end of the truck.  The body of the
man who had committed suicide had by this time been cut to pieces by the wheels, and the loose
end of chain had consequently been relieved of the drag upon it and was now lashing about among
the wheels.  Before the soldier who had been nearly dragged over could realise this and haul
up the chain, the swaying end had got entangled among the spokes of a wheel.  It was quickly
coiled up and broken, of course, but before this happened it had actually torn the unhappy
Chilian's hand completely off, and his shrieks would have convinced the Peruvian guards that
something was wrong had they been willing to be convinced, and not been too busily occupied
in firing into their helpless prisoners.

The maimed soldier had, however, fainted, and he now fell senseless upon the floor of the car,
while his companions, unable to assist him, followed his example by lying down, to be out of
the line of fire.  The Peruvians, however, fired a few more shots into the truck; but since
they could no longer see anybody at whom to shoot, they presently tired of their pastime, and
laid down their rifles, laughing heartily among themselves at the sport they had enjoyed. 
Douglas and his fellow- officers heard the raucous sounds of merriment, and each in his heart
vowed that, if they lived, they would exact a fearful retribution for the inhuman treatment
which they had that day received from their captors.

At four o'clock that afternoon the train crawled and jolted into Lima; the trucks were at once
surrounded by soldiery who were waiting for their arrival, and the unhappy prisoners were roughly
hauled out and formed up in a square as before.  The weary, hungry and thirsty prisoners were
hurried off to the castle of Lima, where, in the courtyard, they were given the first food
and water that many of them had received for nearly thirty-six hours.

While the starving wretches were refreshing themselves, the gates opened to admit another body
of about fifty Chilians surrounded by guards. These were herded in among those who had arrived
by the train, and likewise were given food and water, upon which they fell like ravenous wild
beasts.  After having satisfied his hunger, Jim seized the opportunity to look round him a
little.  There were now about two hundred Chilians present, and it was evident, from the preparations
that were being made, that they were all to be taken to the mines.  Even as he looked about
him the new force of guards began to form up.  There were quite a hundred of them, Jim noticed,
or about one to every two prisoners.  But the Peruvians were all armed with rifle and bayonet,
whereas the Chilians were not; moreover, the guards were free, while the Chilian prisoners
were manacled together in groups of a dozen.

Douglas had been led to expect that they would be kept a day or two at Lima, but he now saw
that he had been mistaken in his surmise. Apparently the second body of prisoners had arrived
sooner than they were expected, and consequently the authorities had decided that all the Chilians
should commence their march without delay.  The captives were now ordered to stand up, and
were formed into one company of five men deep.  After this was done a number of Peruvians brought
in a couple of wagons, which they at once began to unload, taking therefrom a number of pickaxes
and shovels, which were then served out among the prisoners, and each man was given one of
each tool.  The reason for this, Jim discovered, was that there were not sufficient implements
at Sorata to supply the new labourers, so the prisoners were compelled to carry with them the
tools wherewith they were to do their work when they reached their destination.

"Carrajo!" exclaimed Douglas under his breath, as he watched his fellow-prisoners shoulder
the pickaxes and shovels.  "Do those fools of Peruvians know what they are doing?  Why, they
are absolutely delivering themselves into our hands!  I was wondering by what means we should
be able to overcome a hundred armed soldiers while on the march, but now that we have got these
things it will be easy."

He was aroused from his reverie by receiving a heavy blow on the shoulder and hearing a rough
voice exclaim: "Now then, wake up; don't stand there dreaming all day.  What are you thinking
about?  Here, catch hold of this spade and pickaxe; that's your share.  Ha, ha! it's a good
idea and an excellent joke to make you rascals carry the tools with which we are going to make
you work when you reach the mines.  That's it; now get into your place, and look sharp; we
shall be on the march in a few minutes.  I hope your honour won't find the weight too heavy,
for you will come off rather badly if you do!"

Jim clutched his tools with the grasp of a drowning man, and there was joy in his heart as
he shouldered them, for he did not regard them as tools, but rather as the precious means by
which to regain his liberty. Find them too heavy!  Well, he rather thought not; he would not
part with them, now that they were his, on any account, for a scheme of escape had come into
his mind which he believed he could easily put into practice, if he could but secure the co-operation
of his fellow- prisoners.

But there was no more time at present for thought; the column was on the point of departure.
A bugle rang out shrilly from somewhere in the courtyard; a stentorian voice barked out certain
orders, and the Peruvian guards closed up round their captives.  Then, just as dusk was falling,
the gates were thrown open, and the column of three hundred men marched out of Lima castle
into the broad streets, on the road to Sorata.

Nothing could be done that night, Jim decided; and a week elapsed before he could even speak
to his companions upon the subject which was uppermost in his mind.  Then, one evening, shortly
before midnight, when the vigilance of the guards had somewhat relaxed, Jim found his opportunity.
He softly wakened the man next to him, and whispered earnestly to him for about ten minutes.
The Chilian officer listened intently, and then awoke his companion in turn and passed the
idea on to him.  Thus the "word" percolated through the sleeping camp, and before morning every
one of the Chilians who could be trusted had been informed of Jim's plan, and had agreed to
be on the watch for the signal which the young Englishman had promised to give them upon the
very first opportunity which presented itself as being likely to promise success.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN.

THE RED DAY OF CUZCO.

A fortnight had passed since that memorable night upon which Jim communicated his plan of escape
to his fellow-prisoners, and still no opportunity had come for the Chilians to make a bid for
freedom.  For some days after Douglas had communicated with them the weary men had brightened
up considerably.  The spark of hope which glimmered in the midst of their darkness gave them
strength to bear up under their many misfortunes.  But as day after day came and went without
the signal being given, a dull despair had taken the place of hope, and many a worn-out and
soul-sick man fell down in the dusty road, never to rise again.  Belonging, as the bulk of
the prisoners did, to a southern race, they were very easily cheered up or cast down, and their
despair was all the deeper for the short interval of hope which had been given them. The majority
of them seemed to have almost resigned themselves to fate, and were looking forward to nothing
better than a lifelong captivity in the mines of Sorata.  To such an extent, indeed, was this
the case that Jim realised that, unless an opportunity should very shortly occur whereby he
could put his scheme into execution, his companions would be too profoundly dispirited to attempt
to make use of the chance of escape when it should actually arrive.  He had told them, however,
at the outset that it would be folly to make the attempt while crossing the mountains; for,
even should they contrive to get away, they would be in the heart of a hostile country, where
they might easily be recaptured. The young Englishman's plan had been to wait until they got
farther south, when they would again be comparatively close to the coast, so that they might
escape thither and trust to being able to get away in boats.  But the long-protracted waiting,
coupled with the intense cold which they experienced up among the mountains, was fast taking
all the heart out of the prisoners, and Jim saw that unless the attempt were made almost at
once everything would be lost.

They were now nearing Cuzco, having travelled nearly half the distance to Sorata, and the weary
men hoped to sleep that very night in the ancient capital of the Incas.  Jim had managed to
interchange a few hasty words about mid-day with the officers of his own group, all men of
high courage and of advanced rank, and they and he had come to the conclusion that the escape
should be attempted that very night, should they fail to reach Cuzco, or the night after leaving
that city, should they happen to arrive there that day.  These few were the only men who had
retained their courage unimpaired, and Jim felt that he could rely upon them.  It would not
do, they all decided, to wait any longer; and although Cuzco itself lay among the mountains,
it would be better to make the attempt there, and trust to being able to get away to the sea-
coast, than be obliged to defer it indefinitely.

The word to be on the watch and ready was therefore passed round immediately after the mid-day
halt; and it was astonishing to see how the news brightened up the weary men and made new beings
of them. Indeed, Jim almost felt sorry that he had not delayed the message until the evening,
for he felt alarmed lest the guards should observe the change and guess at its cause.  They
seemed, however, to take no notice of it, and the forlorn procession moved forward slowly along
the great, dusty road, which had not been repaired since the time of Pizarro's conquest.  Hour
after hour went by and there was still no sign of the City of the Sun; so that, by the time
that four o'clock arrived, Douglas decided that the escape would have to be attempted that
very night. Just before dusk the clouds, which had been covering the heavens all day long,
broke; the glorious setting sun shone out in all his majesty; and there before them in the
distance, some fifteen miles away, his beams fell on the city of Cuzco, gilding and glorifying
it until it actually did present the appearance of a city of gold.  It was a magnificent sight,
and drew an exclamation of admiration and delight from the Chilians, weary as they all were;
but they hoped that the view which they had just obtained of the place was all that they would
ever see of it--as it would be, if fortune would but favour them that night.

It was now perfectly evident that they would not be able to reach Cuzco that evening, and as
the darkness was fast coming on the Peruvians began to look about them for a suitable place
in which to camp for the night. About half a mile farther on could be seen, through the gathering
gloom, a small hillock, crowned with great rocks and boulders, apparently the remains of some
ancient Inca fortification.  This struck Douglas as a place that might have been made on purpose
for their attempt, could the guards but be induced to pitch the camp there.  He was casting
about in his mind for some scheme by which they might be induced to select the spot as a halting-place,
when the officer in command of the troop rose in his stirrups and, pointing to the hillock
with his sword, exclaimed:

"There, over yonder, is the place for us, mi hijos; we will encamp among those boulders.  We
shall be as comfortable there as in the city of Cuzco itself.  Forward, guerreros; we shall
soon be there; and we will have a good long rest to-night."

"Ay, that you will, you inhuman scoundrel," muttered Jim; "but it will not be the sort of sleep
of which you are thinking!"  However, the prisoners and their guards pushed forward, and in
about ten minutes' time the group arrived at the foot of the little hill, which they at once
began to climb.

"Now I wonder," thought Jim, "whether the next time we tread this road it will be as free men
once more.  God grant us success this night, for if we fail there will be no second chance for us!"

The other officers seemed to be occupied with similar thoughts, for they examined the whole
place and its surroundings very carefully as they ascended; evidently in order that, should
the attempt be successful, they might be able to find their way down in the darkness.  At last
the summit was reached; but before the weary men could enjoy the rest of which they stood in
such great need, they were obliged to unload the tents and provisions from the pack mules,
the Peruvians being much to lazy to do anything for themselves.  It was therefore about eight
o'clock by the time that the tents were pitched and the evening meal prepared; and when the
food was ready the prisoners ate as much as they could, for they did not in the least know
where they would obtain their next meal.  This having been done, the pots and pans had to be
cleaned and put away; so that it was a tolerably weary company which at last sought its tents
to lie down and rest.

But not to slumber.  There was not a single Chilian among those to whom the plan had been revealed
who closed his eyes, lest he should fall asleep and thus not be ready when the momentous signal
should be given. Long before this it had been ascertained that there were but four keys for
the purpose of locking and unlocking the prisoners' manacles; one being held by the captain,
while the other three were distributed in turn among the soldiers, being given to three different
men every day, for the better security of the prisoners, and to make sure that there could
be no tampering with the guards.  Jim had been keeping his eyes very wide open all through
the day, and he had noticed which of the Peruvians were the men who had the keys in their possession
that night, while he had also carefully marked the positions where they had thrown themselves
down to sleep.  Two of the soldiers had retired to a tent, but the third had fortunately elected
to sleep in the open, as the night was very warm.

The plan arranged was for Jim and his group of manacled fellow-officers to crawl forward, and
either kill or stun one of the gaolers--it would be too risky to tackle more than one--secure
his key, unlock their own fetters, and then to go silently the rounds, setting free their companions.
When all were at liberty they were to seize their shovels and pickaxes and with them attack
the slumbering soldiery, killing as many as possible before they were fully awake and could
seize their rifles.  Should they be discovered before the work was complete, those who were
free were to keep off the Peruvians while the remainder were set at liberty.

It sounded rather a barbarous scheme, but Jim could think of no other which would be at all
likely to be successful; and he was by this time rendered altogether too hardened by privation
and ill-treatment to feel very much pity for the callously brutal Peruvian guards.  Besides,
it was his life or theirs, and he had no difficulty in choosing.

The young Englishman waited until midnight, in order to allow the soldiers to get well asleep,
and then he silently nudged his companions to make sure that all were awake.  They all were,--very
wide awake, too,--and, after a few low-voiced instructions from Douglas, the little body of
men began to crawl away through the darkness, taking the utmost care that there should be no
clanking of chains to betray their movements.  Forward on hands and knees they went, all moving
together; and they soon passed through the ranks of their comrades, who did not make a single
movement while the gallant little band crawled past.

Soon they had left the Chilian part of the encampment behind; and a few minutes later, Jim,
who was the leading man of the party, came abreast of the first Peruvian tent.  The night was
pitchy dark, although there was a young moon, for the sky was covered with dark, low-lying
clouds. This was all the better, for it lessened the probability of their being seen by the
sentries; but they had to exercise a great deal of caution to avoid colliding with and so disturbing
any soldiers who had elected to sleep out in the open.

"Now," whispered Jim, as they came abreast of a certain tent, looming up dim and ghostly in
the darkness; "Pedrillo is sleeping just outside this tent.  Forward, men; but carefully, for
your lives.  One false step now, and all will be lost.  Come along, and remember--we must be
quick and silent at--at the work which we have to do.  There must not be so much as a single
struggle."

His companions now came up abreast of Douglas, instead of following in single file; and, still
abreast, they crawled toward the slumbering custodian of the key.  Nearer and nearer they drew,
until only a few yards separated them from their prey, then only a few feet.  They were almost
within arm's length of him now; silently they crept forward again, then they paused.  The only
sound was that caused by the heavy breathing of the victim and the soft, hissing breaths of
his executioners.  Now they crept forward again until they were close to the man; Jim plucked
the sleeve of the Chilian nearest to him, and together they leaned over the gaoler.

"Now!" hissed Jim, and four men flung themselves upon the fellow's body at the same moment
that Douglas's hands clutched his throat.  There was a short quick scuffle, and it was all over.

In a second he had snatched the key from the dead man's girdle and was feverishly unlocking
his comrades' fetters.  Then they, in turn, unlocked his, and in less than five minutes the
twelve men were all free.  Back they sped to their own portion of the camp, and were soon unlocking
their friends' manacles, with the result that in less than twenty minutes at least half the
Chilians were free, and stood, grasping their pickaxes and shovels, ready for the fight which
was inevitable before they could get away.

Then a horrible thing happened.

Among the Chilians was a naval petty officer, a surly, cunning--faced creature whom nobody
trusted, and from whom, therefore, all particulars of the plot had been kept secret.  Jim had
just inserted the key in his manacles, when this traitor shrieked at the top of his voice:

"Help! help! the Chilians are escaping!"

Why the fellow did it nobody ever knew, but it was surmised that, being too much of a craven
himself to attempt to escape, he had hoped to purchase his own freedom by betraying his comrades.
But he must have been mad to do such a thing, surrounded as he was by Chilians, for he might
have felt certain that before assistance could reach him he would be dead.

The mischief, however, was done, and the slumbering camp was effectually alarmed.  The sentries
squibbed off their rifles, and then, reloading, began to blaze away into the Chilian encampment.
The captain's harsh voice was heard giving orders, and in a few seconds the Peruvian soldiers
had formed up in line, fixed their bayonets, and were prepared to charge.

"Quick," exclaimed Jim; "seize your shovels and pickaxes and repel their attack.  I will help
you.  You, Manuel, take the key and free the others while we who are already free keep the
Peruvians at bay.  But be cool-- keep calm, and all will be well; we will defend you."

Tossing the key to Manuel, Jim seized a shovel, and put himself at the head of his men.  "Charge!
charge!" he roared, and the fifty free Chilians charged straight at the place where the Peruvians
were known to be.

The next second a sanguinary and ferocious struggle had commenced in the darkness.  The Peruvians,
hearing the Chilians approach, had levelled their rifles, and poured a withering volley into
the charging men, with murderous effect.  But, their rifles once emptied, conditions were somewhat
more equal, and for a quarter of an hour the combat raged furiously.  But such an unequal contest
could not last very long; the soldiers were able, during pauses in the struggle, to reload
their rifles; and this being done, they mowed the Chilians down by dozens. Manuel did his work
well, but the liberated men who straggled up, by twos and threes, did not prove a very valuable
reinforcement for the prisoners.

Then, to crown all their misfortunes, the moon came out and flooded the battle-ground with
light; and light was all that the Peruvians needed to enable them to turn a one-sided combat
into a massacre.  The Chilians, mowed down by the score, at last threw down their primitive
weapons and called for quarter; but the soldiers, rendered still more ferocious by the sight
and smell of blood, continued to fire into the defenceless prisoners until they were sated
with slaughter.  Then the hapless band was surrounded once more, and the unhurt and least seriously
wounded men were manacled afresh.  The mortally wounded were simply bayoneted as they lay,
their friends being unable to stay the murderers' hands.

At last it was all over; the casualties were counted up and the roll called.  The Peruvians
had lost but eleven men, all killed, whereas the Chilians were reduced to forty, all told,
scarcely one of whom did not bear a more or less serious wound on his person.  But the Peruvian
captain was furious at what he called the "dastardly attack" of the Chilians on his men, and
he swore to take a full and complete revenge when the next morning should arrive.  The wretched
men were then allowed to lie down once more and sleep--if they could; and thus the remaining
hours of that ghastly night passed slowly away.

The next morning, as soon as day dawned, Captain Garcia-y-Garcia, having appointed a sergeant
and a corporal to assist him, constituted himself and his two assistants into what he called
a "court-martial," and then proceeded to try the prisoners.

Jim he promptly pounced upon as the ringleader, and subjected the young Englishman to a short
examination, which, however, was the merest farce, for the captain had already determined upon
his fate.  After a trial lasting, perhaps, five minutes, therefore, Jim was condemned to be
shot before mid-day, as were nine more of his unfortunate companions.  The remaining thirty
Chilians were each sentenced to receive a flogging of a hundred lashes as soon as they arrived
at the mines; and Captain Garcia- y-Garcia promised himself that he would be the man to supervise
the punishment.

The ten men who were condemned to death were then separated from the rest of the troop, and
were told to seat themselves on the ground at some little distance away, where they were at
once surrounded by guards. Garcia-y-Garcia then selected a squad of twenty Peruvian soldiers,
and told them off for the firing-party.  They were then formed up in a single line and ordered
to load their rifles with ball cartridge.

When everything was in readiness, the ten unfortunate prisoners were brought forward and made
to stand, also in line, with their backs against a huge rock which was to serve as a background;
and Jim found himself, for the second time in his life, facing a firing-party and condemned
to death.  But this time there seemed to be no hope or possibility of reprieve.  He was surrounded
by cruel men who had no feelings save those of a brutal nature, and it seemed as though no
power on earth could save him.

Jim was very thankful that no attempt was made to blindfold them, for he had had a bandage
round his eyes on a previous occasion, and knew from experience that the suspense of waiting
for the squad to fire, not knowing what they were doing meanwhile, was worse than death itself
could possibly be.

At last the fatal moment came, and the unlucky men shook hands with one another in sad farewell.
The doomed men then stood to attention, and the soldiers examined the breeches of their rifles
to make sure that they were properly loaded.

Then came the word "Ready!" and the twenty rifles came up to the soldiers' hips as though by
machinery.  At the second word of command the barrels glinted in the sun as the men planted
the rifle-butts in the hollow of their shoulders.  Jim involuntarily cast his eyes skyward
as he waited for the final word, and his lips were seen to move slightly.

A painful pause--and then Garcia-y-Garcia's voice rang out, loud, clear, and triumphant: "Fire!"

There was a simultaneous crash as the rifles were discharged, and Jim felt a sharp, stinging
sensation in his left side and in his arm as he fell back upon the ground.  A body fell a second
after his own and lay right across his face, and Jim had actually put up his hand to push away
the corpse before he realised that he was not at all severely hurt.  He was recalled to his
senses by hearing the captain's voice commanding his men to reload and fire again into the
heap of corpses, to "make assurance doubly sure," as he put it, and Jim had presence of mind
enough to abstain from making any further movement, though he suffered agonies of suspense
while waiting for the second discharge.

It came at last, and Douglas escaped yet a second time, although the body lying above his own
was riddled with bullets.  The Englishman could feel now that the bullet which struck him had
passed between his left side and his left arm, grazing both, but inflicting no injury worth
speaking of.  But would he escape after all, or would he have his brains blown out as he lay?
The question was soon answered, for even as he was thinking about it, the body was hauled off
his face and a soldier shouted: "Why, captain, here is a man who is still alive."

Garcia-y-Garcia ran up and stood over Jim, looking down at him with eyes that glittered with
savage menace.  He half turned away to give the order for Jim's death, when he checked himself.
His expression gradually changed, and presently he spoke:

"No; I don't think I'll shoot you to-day, Senor Chileno, although I don't know that I may not
change my mind later.  However, I will spare you this once, for you deserve to escape death
after having been shot at twice.  Get up!"

Hardly able to believe his ears, Jim rose to his feet, and was immediately secured to the chain
once more.  Then, still in a dream, he heard the command given to march, and the sadly depleted
company moved down the side of the knoll, leaving nearly seventy unburied corpses lying on
its summit.  How very differently things had looked yesterday at this hour, thought Jim: how
sadly everything had changed!  Between now and yesterday lay this blood-red day of Cuzco--a
day which Jim knew he would never forget so long as he lived.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.

A CURIOUS DISCOVERY.

After the dreadful episode near Cuzco a heavy gloom settled down upon the poor remnant of the
prisoners, and the group marched forward and ever forward in a sullen, hopeless silence.  Jim
made several efforts to put fresh heart into his comrades, and to persuade them that everything
was not lost, even yet, if they could but pull themselves together.  He told them that the
mines were still some distance away, and that a second attempt at escape might perhaps be so
engineered as to be successful; but it was all to no purpose; the unhappy Chilians had completely
lost heart.  Moreover, they seemed to think that the ill- success which had attended their
effort at Cuzco was in some measure due to the young Englishman who had, as they put it, misjudged
the time; and Jim soon found that he was everywhere greeted with sullen looks instead of with
the cheery smiles which were once accorded him.  He therefore gave up the idea of inciting
them to another attempt, and came to the conclusion that he would have to make his escape alone,
if it was to be made; and he determined that henceforth he would keep his intentions secret
from the others, and would not even invoke their assistance; for he feared treachery on their
part in the temper that then possessed them.

Watch as he might, however, the young man could find no opportunity, for the guards had redoubled
their vigilance, and they kept an especially sharp eye on Jim, for he was considered by all
the Peruvians to have been the ringleader of the Cuzco affair; indeed, the soldiers quite failed
to understand why Captain Garcia-y-Garcia had shown him any mercy on that occasion.  The young
Englishman also kept his eyes open, carefully marking in his mind the route by which they had
come, so that he might find his way back along it upon some future occasion.  They had now
left the strictly mountainous region, and had entered upon the flat dusty tableland in the
midst of which Lake Titicaca is situated; and it was for the northern end of the lake that
the party was now heading.

Then, one day at dawn, they beheld a magnificent sight.  There, before them, lying at a slightly
lower level than the surrounding country, lay the blue waters of the lake, shimmering in the
sun, whose beams had already gilded the snowy summit of Mount Sorata, which lay a little to
the south-eastward.  It was at the foot of this giant among mountains that the village of Sorata
was situated, and Jim realised that their long journey of seven hundred miles was nearly ended.

It was exactly one month after the tragedy of Cuzco that the way-worn troop marched into the
village; and a fearful-looking lot of scarecrows the prisoners were by that time, in truth.
They had scarcely a rag to their backs, while their boots and stockings had long since worn
away from their feet, and they had to tramp along barefooted.  They were lean and gaunt, with
scarcely an ounce of flesh on their poor starved bodies; in fact they presented the appearance
of a squad of skeletons rather than of living men.  Tanned, as they were, to a deep mahogany
colour by the fierce sun and strong air, with hair growing down upon their shoulders, and with
coarse, matted beards, no one would have believed that a few short months ago many of these
men were among the smartest and best-dressed officers in the Chilian army and navy.  Jim himself
looked as bad as the rest, but he had one advantage which the others had not, for under his
tattered rags his brave heart beat as strongly and as resolutely as ever, whereas the Chilians
had entirely lost their courage.

The sun was just setting, and the long day's work was over, when the Chilians arrived, and
they were just in time to see the prisoners who were already there taking their evening meal.
A few half-starved curs had run out to meet the new arrivals, and now jumped and barked savagely
around them in a transport of fury at seeing a few new faces.  The village, if such it could
be called, consisted simply of a number of long wooden huts roofed over with corrugated iron.
Some of the huts were used as barracks for the convicts, some as quarters for their guards,
and a still larger number as engine, boiler, machinery, and store houses for the purpose of
extracting and storing the silver from the ore.  The whole place was intersected by narrow-gauge
tram-lines, upon which were run little wagons which a couple of men could push, for bringing
the raw material from the mine to the smelting-houses.  Several of these standing about in
various parts of the village added to the general uncouthness and desolation of the scene;
and Jim felt that if he were compelled to stay here for very long, he would go mad with the
very dismalness and horror of his surroundings.

But he was not allowed very much time for reflection, for directly the much-diminished roll
was called, the prisoners were conducted to a shed containing a large number of sacks of crushed
Indian corn, the staple food of the Indians in Peru; and here a small quantity of the unappetising
stuff was served out, together with a tin can, to each man. This corn, made into a sort of
porridge by boiling it with water, was to constitute the prisoners' evening meal; and they
were given to understand that all their other meals would consist of the same food. The unfortunate
men, who had been freed from their shackles as soon as they arrived at their destination, then
took their tins, and, making themselves as comfortable as they could in the prisoners' compound,
proceeded to boil and eat their unwholesome-looking porridge.  By the time that this was done,
darkness had fallen, and the village was lighted up by means of rough paraffin lamps hoisted
on poles.  By the light of these the prisoners were now herded together once more and marched
away to the long iron sheds in which they were told they would have to sleep.  But before entering
these hovels, a number of Peruvian soldiers brought out a quantity of clothing, made on purpose
for the convicts, and the Chilians were ordered to strip and put these on.  Jim was very glad
to have another suit, although it consisted of only a pair of rough blue serge trousers, a
kind of jersey, a neckcloth, and a jacket, for his own garments were so torn and ragged that
they were hardly sufficient to cover him.  They were then told that a pair of clogs would be
served out to each of them the next morning at daybreak, when work would commence, but that
now they were expected to turn in for the night, according to the rules governing this little
convict settlement.  The iron-roofed shed looked even more uninviting inside than outside.
Down each side were ranged narrow platforms, which were divided into "beds" by narrow strips
of wood about three inches in height, and all the covering allowed was a pair of very old dirty
blankets; of mattresses there was no sign, not even loose straw being provided, and the whole
interior was dirty and odoriferous beyond description.  However, considered Jim philosophically,
prisoners cannot be choosers; and having arranged his blankets as comfortably as was possible
under the circumstances, he turned in and slept the sleep of the utterly weary.

The next morning he was awakened by a hideous clanging noise, which proceeded from a huge gong
hung in the courtyard.  Everybody immediately sprang out of bed, folded up their blankets,
and streamed out into the courtyard, where, Jim noticed, there was a narrow stream of running
water.  He availed himself of this to have a good wash, a proceeding which excited the laughter
of the gaolers, many of whom looked as though they had never touched water in any form during
the whole of their lives.  This having been done, he procured his tin and his daily allowance
of meal and prepared his breakfast, for which he had an excellent appetite.  When this was
over, the prisoners were told off in groups of ten each, a soldier with loaded rifle mounting
guard over each section.  These were marched away one by one, until only one group remained,
and Jim had not yet been apportioned to a party; but he soon found that Captain Garcia-y-Garcia
had represented him to the Governor as being a most dangerous character, so that he was to
have a guard all to himself, and not to be allowed near the other prisoners.  This arrangement
suited Jim admirably, for he had already made up his mind that if he was to escape at all,
it must be alone, and he would have a much better chance of getting away while working by himself
than he would get if he were one of a gang; for it would be strange indeed if a strong, able-bodied
young Englishman could not get the better of a mere Peruvian soldier.

He therefore accepted the situation with much satisfaction, which, however, he took care not
to show, and marched off toward the mine with his guard.  When he arrived at the place where
he was to work, he saw that the word "mine" hardly described the place, for it was not in the
least like an English mine.  The so-called mines consisted of a number of ancient Inca workings
which, after having lain idle for hundreds of years, had been again started by the Peruvians.
Instead of a shaft being driven down into the earth, and galleries being cut in various directions
from that shaft, the mines simply consisted of tunnels driven horizontally into the side of
a hill.  It was a primitive method, and one adopted by the Incas; but the ground was so rich
and ore so plentiful that this method was found as good as any other, and cheaper than most.
There were scores of these tunnels, some of which had been exhausted and abandoned, while the
ore was being taken out of others by truck-loads at a time, the little narrow-gauge tram-lines
running from the tunnel-mouths right down into the village.

By the time that Jim had arrived at his allotted post his fellow- prisoners had disappeared
elsewhere, and he found, to his great joy, that he was working on the side of the hill remote
from all the other convicts.  He could hardly conceal his satisfaction, for everything was
falling out much better than he could possibly have expected; and, under the influence of his
newly awakened hope, he became quite chatty and affable with the sentry, who gradually thawed
under the Englishman's flow of talk and high spirits.  Douglas now found that he was not expected
to extract ore, for indeed there was no tram-line here whereby it could be carried away.  This
particular tunnel had been closed up by a fall of rock as long ago as the sixteenth century
and had never since been worked, and as the Peruvians thought that there might still be a good
supply of ore there, they had determined to open it once more. This, then, was Jim's task,
and he approached the blocked-up tunnel- mouth determined to do as much work as he possibly
could, and thus endeavour to earn the sentry's good-will, for that, he decided, should be his
first step on the road to freedom.

By the time that dusk had fallen and work had ceased for the day, Douglas had cleared away
several cubic yards of rubble from the tunnel- mouth, and had also impressed the sentry so
favourably that the latter not only thought himself lucky in having charge of so docile a prisoner,
but also decided that it would not be necessary for him to exercise quite so much vigilance
as he had expected to be obliged to do.

Morning after morning the Englishman and the Peruvian went up to the tunnel, and the two soon
became, to all appearance, very excellent friends.  Jim steadily worked his way farther and
farther into the tunnel, and the sentry sat at the entrance thereto, smoking and dozing, instead
of standing close beside the prisoner during the whole day, as he had done at first.  Douglas
was delighted, for this was precisely what he wanted.  The soldier's suspicions were being
lulled to sleep very effectively, and Jim told himself that the time was fast approaching when
he might try to hoodwink the fellow still further. However, in order not to act too hastily,
he allowed a few more days to elapse, and then one morning, during his mid-day meal, he entered
into conversation with the Peruvian, adroitly keeping the conversation as personal as possible,
and leading the fellow on to talk about himself. It was an easy task that Jim had before him,
as he very soon found.  He sympathised with the man in all his little troubles, and advised
him what to do to make matters easier for himself, the consequence being that Douglas passed
the whole afternoon sitting down and talking with the soldier, with the result that by the
evening the two were as friendly together as even Jim could wish.

The Peruvian Government, it now appeared, was in the habit of giving the prisoners a small
bonus for every cubic yard of rubble or ore that was removed above a certain fixed quantity,
and this bonus Jim laid himself out to earn, with the result that he very soon had a nice little
hoard of pesetas, which he laid out on such comforts as the village provided.  He also took
care to keep his gaoler well supplied with cigarillos, which proved the best prescription for
keeping him in a good temper.  So that by the time that three months had slipped by, the man
had ceased to keep guard over his prisoner at all, and left him to excavate the tunnel unwatched,
while he himself sat down on the shady side of a rock to enjoy his tobacco.  Things were now
indeed shaping very well for Jim, and having lulled his gaoler's suspicions, the young man
next set about getting together a small store of provisions, which he secreted little by little
behind a great boulder which he found about fifty feet inside the mouth of the tunnel, and
a month later he had accumulated what he considered to be enough provender to last him, with
care, until he could reach either the sea-coast or the nearest Chilian outpost, which at that
time was lying somewhere near Caraguara.

The next thing, he told himself, was to wait for a favourable opportunity to escape; and while
waiting he put all his energies into his work, so that he might have as much money as possible
when the time came for him to make his attempt.  It was quite the usual thing now for the guard--whose
name, Jim had ascertained, was Carbajal--to lie down behind his rock, and either sleep or smoke
while his charge laboured in the tunnel; and one day Jim crawled over to the rock where he
lay and took a good look at the fellow.  He was sitting with his back against the rock, fast
asleep; his rifle was lying about three feet away from him, and his peaked cap was tilted over
his eyes.  If he would only go to sleep like that in the morning, thought Jim, all would be
well; for the escape would have to be made very early in order that the fugitive might get
a good long start before his absence was discovered when the roll was called at nightfall.

Douglas had now quite a nice little stock of money, and he soon made up his mind what to do.
One evening, before going to the sleeping barracks, he bought a bottle of aguardiente, and
from an Indio with whom he had made friends he procured a large quantity of coca leaves, which
he put into the bottle of spirit to soak overnight, knowing that by the morning the strong
liquor would have absorbed all the cocaine out of the leaves.

The next morning he extracted all the leaves and recorked the bottle, which he carefully secreted
under his coat, for he had determined to make his escape that very day.  Then he went up to
the tunnel, followed by the guard, who lay down behind his usual rock directly they arrived
at the works.  Jim considered for a few seconds whether he should offer the man the bottle
at once or later, and finally determined in favour of the latter, in order to avoid arousing
his guard's suspicions, and to give him an opportunity to get thoroughly thirsty in the hot
sun.  Jim then went into the tunnel and walked down to its far end, not to work, however, for
he determined to save himself up as much as possible, in view of future contingencies.

He therefore sat down, with his back against one of the tunnel walls, but would not close his
eyes lest he should inadvertently drop off to sleep.  He had been staring abstractedly at the
opposite wall for some minutes, when it dawned upon him that one of the blocks of stone of
which it was composed had a very curiously symmetrical appearance, and the longer he gazed
at it the more convinced did he become that the slab was not nature's handiwork at all, but
that of man.  In a moment all sorts of legends vaguely flashed through his mind, and, knowing
that this tunnel had been originally used by the Incas and had not been opened since, he began
to wonder whether the curious circumstance was worth investigating.  He soon decided that it
was, and seizing his pick, he inserted the point at the edge of the slab, and attempted to
lever the stone away.  It resisted for so long, however, that he was beginning to think the
stone was after all no more than a part of the natural rock, when, under a more than usually
vigorous pull, he saw it move forward slightly.

He now wrenched at it more determinedly than ever, and in a few seconds had the satisfaction
of seeing the heavy slab totter and then fall outward on to the floor of the tunnel.  Douglas
was provided with matches and a lantern for the purposes of his work, and he lost no time in
exploring the cavity which the stone had disclosed.  With eager fingers he searched and probed
about, but for some time found nothing. Then his hand suddenly encountered something that felt
metallic and heavy, and upon bringing it to the light, he found that he held in his hand a
small golden image, some three inches high, evidently representing the god Rimac.  This spurred
him on to new efforts, and in a few minutes he had extracted five other little figures from
the same place.  Jim believed that he had now emptied the cache, and he was on the point of
abandoning further search, since time was flying, but was just feeling round the hole for the
last time, when his hand came in contact with something else.

This last object which he brought to light proved to be nothing less than a roll of Inca paper,
a coarse material made of the wool of the vicuna, which the priests were accustomed to use
in keeping their records.  This was probably a prize of considerably greater value than the
gold, Jim thought, and he carefully opened it with trembling fingers.  But, as he quite expected,
he could make nothing of it, for it was written in the ancient Inca character, which few white
men have ever seen, and which only a small number of Indians, directly descended from the ancient
Peruvian race, are able to decipher.  There was not much of it, but Douglas guessed that its
value must be great, or it would not have been hidden so carefully away.  He therefore folded
it up carefully, and put it, together with the little gold figures, in his pocket, and then
left the cave with his bottle of aguardiente, which he meant to present to Carbajal.

The fellow was already very nearly asleep, as it happened, and he was, moreover, very thirsty,
consequently Jim's offer was accepted with almost indecent haste; as a matter of fact, Carbajal
put the bottle to his lips the moment that Jim held it out to him, and he only removed it when
it was nearly all gone.

"Ah! senor," sighed the soldier, as he wiped his lips, "that stuff was good--it always is good
when one is thirsty, but--but what a curious flavour it has with it.  Not that it is a disagreeable
taste, mind you; indeed, I rather like it, but it is somewhat different from the stuff one
usually gets here."

"Ah," replied Douglas, "I can see that you are unused to the taste of aguardiente.  It is perhaps
a long time since you tasted any? However, there is plenty more where that came from, so don't
be chary of using it; besides, I can see that you are thirsty."

After having offered Jim a taste of the spirit, which he declined, much to Carbajal's satisfaction,
that worthy again raised the bottle to his lips and finished the contents, flinging the empty
bottle away as soon as he had done so.  He then composed himself as comfortably as he could
against the rock, tilted his cap over his eyes again, and, after a preliminary grunt or two,
announced that he felt tired and wished to be left alone.  Jim was not slow in taking the hint,
but instead of returning to the tunnel, he took up a position from which he could watch his
fatigued warder.  He kept his eyes fixed on the fellow, and very soon had the satisfaction
of seeing Carbajal fall over on his side, completely overcome by the potency of the drug with
which the spirit had been doctored.

Jim at once left his hiding-place and crept cautiously forward, presently reaching Carbajal's
side.  Then he proceeded to shake him, lightly at first, and afterwards more vigorously, until
he saw that nothing would wake him for at least a dozen hours.  The next thing was to carry
the man into the tunnel, and, once there, Douglas lost no time in stripping off the fellow's
uniform and clothing himself therein.  He then fastened on the leather belt, with its cartridge-pouch
attached, and possessed himself of Carbajal's carbine.

This completed Jim's transformation; and he flattered himself that he could now be very easily
mistaken for a Peruvian soldier, which was, of course, what he desired.  He took one last look
round the tunnel, felt in his pockets to make sure that he had transferred to them the golden
images and the document, as well as all his other belongings, and marched boldly out of the cavern.

"Clang! clang! clang! clang!"  At this moment there came rolling up from the village the sound
of the alarm-bell, cutting sharply into Jim's meditations, and he knew in a moment what had
occurred.  A perverse fate had prompted some prisoner to seize this precise moment in which
to make a dash for liberty, and the alarm was being given.  For a few seconds Jim hesitated,
considering; then, with a hurried look round, he started off down the hillside at full speed,
leaping rocks, boulders, and everything else that came in his way.  The soldiers were already
pouring out of their barracks!

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.

ESCAPED!

This was indeed a sorry trick that fortune, that perverse jade, had played him, meditated Jim.
The chances were, too, that the fugitive would take the same direction as Douglas himself,
in which case they would probably both be captured.  This thought gave wings to the young Englishman's
feet, and he went bounding away down the hill like a startled deer, thinking of nothing but
getting to cover as quickly as possible.  But the unfortunate fact was that there was no place
within at least a mile where a man could be concealed, and Jim knew well that long ere he could
reach the strip of forest on which he was keeping his eye, he would be in full view of the
pursuers should they happen to come that way, which was more than probable.

Stay, though; were both fugitives taking the same direction?  There was not so much clamour
perceptible now, and Jim pulled up suddenly to listen, at the same time looking back along
the way by which he had come.  For a few seconds dead silence reigned, and Jim was beginning
to congratulate himself that the Chilian had taken another course, when round the corner of
the hill he saw a figure emerge, flying along at a tremendous pace, and leaping every obstacle
that came in its way; a moment later he heard a renewed uproar of shouts and curses, and he
observed that the other fugitive was heading directly for him, doubtless with the pursuers
hard on his track.

Then, at this critical moment, an idea flashed through Jim's brain.  He did not believe that
the fugitive had yet caught sight of him, while the soldiers would not reach the corner for
a few seconds, he hoped.  Like a man shot, Jim flung himself prone on the ground, and commenced
to crawl toward a large boulder which he had just caught sight of, and in less than half a
minute he was ensconced behind a rock which was just big enough to afford concealment to one
man, if that man had the sense to remain perfectly motionless.  Then, stretching himself flat
upon the ground, Jim cautiously peered round the edge of the boulder, in order to keep an eye
upon the escaping prisoner, for a plan had come into his head which he thought might possibly
be successful, and which was certainly the only one which offered any hope of his being able
finally to get clear away.

Douglas had suddenly remembered that he was wearing a Peruvian soldier's uniform; and his idea
was to allow the fugitive to pass him and then join in the chase, trusting to luck that the
pursuers would mistake him for one of themselves.  He would, of course, take care not to overtake
the Chilian,--let the poor man get away if he could, by all means,--but he thought that if
he could himself lead the pursuit, so to speak, he might be able gradually to out-distance
the rest of the soldiers, and thus finally get clear away by allowing the Peruvians to imagine
that he was still keeping up the pursuit.  Should the man be caught, however, Jim trusted to
being able to slip away unseen amid the excitement, especially if the capture should happen
to take place anywhere near that strip of forest country a mile or so ahead.

A very few seconds sufficed to show Jim that he had not been seen by the Chilian, and that
the latter did not intend to avail himself of such an insecure hiding-place as the rock afforded,
for he went dashing past at full speed, leaving Jim about a hundred yards to the left.

Just as the man fled by, his heavy gasps for breath sounding marvellously loud in the still
air, the first of his pursuers put in an appearance round the corner of the hill, a quarter
of a mile away, carrying his carbine at the trail; and he was immediately followed by about
a score more soldiers, who began to shout themselves hoarse as they came in sight of their
quarry.  Then several of the Peruvians pulled up, and, dropping on their knees, levelled their
carbines and began to blaze away at the running man.  Douglas prayed that the unhappy creature
might not be hit, for if he were, it would bring the pursuit to an end in the precise spot
where Jim could not possibly avoid being discovered; but he need not have been alarmed; the
shooting was execrable, and the bullets flew everywhere but near the fugitive. Several of them
flattened themselves against the face of the boulder behind which Douglas was lying, and one
nearly blinded him with the dust which it threw up as it plugged into the earth just in front
of his face.

The Peruvians did not keep up their target practice very long, for they found it impossible
to hit the runner, and realised that he gained a lot of ground when they pulled up to fire.
They therefore rose to their feet and dashed along in pursuit once more, only occasionally
discharging their weapons pistol-wise in the hope of a lucky bullet finding its billet.

And now they were approaching the rock where Jim was concealed; in a very few seconds he must
be prepared to act, and to act quickly too. They evidently had no idea that a second prisoner
was so close to them, for, to the young man's great relief, they were aiming to pass the rock
at a distance of quite eighty yards.  Closer and closer they came, and as they did so Jim gradually
edged his way round the rock in such a manner as to keep out of their sight as far as was possible.
Another moment's suspense and the leading soldier had passed the rock without giving it so
much as a glance.  Then another and another man panted past, until presently the rearmost Peruvian
went grunting and gasping by.

In a second Jim had sprung to his feet and was scudding along in the wake of the rearmost soldier,
at the same time edging away to the right of the rock in such a manner as to bring him directly
behind the group of Peruvians.  Then he put on the pace a little, and found that he could easily
outrun any of the soldiers, since he himself was quite fresh while they were already somewhat
winded.  He soon overtook the last soldier, and began to pass him, his heart in his throat
with apprehension lest the fellow should recognise him as one of the Chilian officers, and
shout his discovery to the rest.  But the fellow, although somewhat astonished to find that
there had been a comrade behind while he thought that he himself was the rearmost man, paid
little attention to his supposed comrade, being too much out of breath to do much thinking.
Douglas passed him, unsuspected, and meanwhile kept his eye on the Chilian, who, although obviously
failing in speed, was rapidly nearing the belt of forest.

Jim then put on another spurt, and passed a second soldier, then another, and still another,
without attracting any particular attention to himself; and a few minutes later he found that
he was leading the entire party of pursuers.  So far so good; his back was now presented to
them all, and they had therefore no opportunity to recognise his features; yet while he ran
he had a very unpleasant feeling that he might expect a bullet to strike him between his shoulder-blades
at any moment.  But the bullet did not come; and he could tell, by the diminishing sounds of
trampling feet that he was still steadily drawing ahead of the rest of the soldiers.  At this
moment the Chilian plunged into the thick brushwood, and was, in a few seconds, lost to sight,
while a yell of angry disappointment and execration went up from the pursuing soldiery.

"Now," muttered Douglas to himself, "if that fellow only knows what he is about, and keeps
cool, he should be able to make his escape without much difficulty."  And he too plunged forward
at top speed, in order that he also might get into the wood well in advance of the soldiers;
for his own chance of escape depended upon his being able to give his "comrades" the slip.
A few seconds more, and Jim saw a small opening among the brushwood disclosing an Indian "bush-path";
it was along this that the Chilian had gone, and Douglas now himself dashed into the wood,
tearing his hands, face, and clothes on the sharp thorns with which the path was bordered.

Once inside the wood he was out of sight of the Peruvians; and hope lent wings to his feet.
He fairly flew along the narrow pathway until he felt he must soon catch up the Chilian, if
the fellow were still ahead; but, even when Jim came to a comparatively long length of straight
path, he was unable to see any one, and he soon came to the conclusion that the man had, very
wisely, slipped away into the thick undergrowth to wait until the pursuit had gone past and
darkness should come on. Douglas resolved that he would do likewise, and increased his pace
still more, so that he might be out of sight before the soldiers should enter the straight
length of path, where, of course, they would be able to see some distance ahead.  The Englishman
was lucky in finding an opening in the thick wall of brushwood, and he plunged into the brake
just a second before the pursuing soldiery came in sight, making a tremendous noise as he broke
a way for himself, which he fervently trusted would not be heard amid the uproar that the Peruvians
themselves were creating.

As soon as he had got about ten yards from the path he flung himself down at full length upon
the ground, in a little open space which was clear of thorns, to recover his breath and listen
to the sounds of the pursuit.  At the same time he examined the breach of his carbine and,
finding it empty, loaded it, wondering at the carelessness of the guard from whom he had so
recently taken it.  For a second or two the noise of the runners came nearer and nearer; and
then, suddenly, there was a loud cry of "Halt!" followed by a terrific shouting and hubbub,
the snapping of small branches, the crackling of undergrowth trodden down, and then-- the report
of a carbine.

"Carrajo!" muttered Jim, "they have sighted that unfortunate Chilian, then!  I wonder how it
was that I passed without seeing him?  Poor beggar!  I am afraid that they won't show him much
mercy--nor me, either--if they catch me," he added.

But there was no more shooting, and from various parts of the wood men were heard calling to
each other; so Jim surmised that it must have been a false alarm, and that the Chilian was
still undiscovered.  The soldiers were yet rather too far distant for Jim to hear what they
were shouting to one another, but presently they approached near enough for him to catch the
words, and he found that they were inquiring of one another whether there were any signs of
the fugitive, and whether "any one had seen that swift-running man who entered the wood first."
The replies were to the effect that the Chileno had not yet been sighted, and that the "runner"--that
was, of course, Jim himself--had also mysteriously vanished, but that the latter must be somewhere
about, and that they would soon come across him.

Douglas was beginning to fear that the last part of the remark might very soon prove only too
true, for it was evident that the Peruvians were slowly but surely working their way through
the wood toward the place where he was concealed.  Observing, therefore, that the undergrowth
was fairly thin ahead of him, he started to crawl along so as, if possible, to get out of the
course of the beaters before they should arrive on the spot.  Grasping his carbine so that
his hand covered the trigger-guard--in order to avoid any accidental discharge in consequence
of the trigger becoming caught in some trailing twig--he began to creep forward, making as
little noise as possible, and being particularly careful to avoid disturbing the bushes any
more than he could help.  The soldiers, luckily for him, kept up an incessant shouting, so
that he was able to guess pretty well their relative positions; and, after about five minutes'
slow progress through the brushwood, he came to the conclusion that he had at last got out
of their way.  There was, too, a nice little open space wherein he could lie hidden without
being in momentary fear of being bitten by a snake, a particularly deadly species of which
was known to swarm in that locality.

By this time Jim had recovered his breath, and was eagerly awaiting the moment when it would
be safe to move, wondering whether or not he had better remain where he was until darkness
set in, when he was dumbfounded to hear some one come crashing through the brake, apparently
quite close by, and making straight toward him.  It could not be the Chilian, for he would
never be making all that disturbance--unless indeed he had gone mad under the stress of being
hunted--so it must necessarily be a stray Peruvian soldier.  Jim at once sprang to his feet
and began to poke about among the bushes with the muzzle of his carbine, as though searching
for somebody who might possibly be hidden among them, at the same time turning his back on
the approaching man, who was still pushing his way through the bush and singing softly to himself
as he came.

Presently the noise sounded very close indeed, then still closer, when suddenly it stopped
altogether.  Jim knew that the other had seen him, and was doubtless wondering what he was
doing there; but he dared not turn round for fear of being recognised; so he continued to poke
about among the bushes, as though unaware that any one was present.  Then a rough voice, which
Jim at once recognised as that of his old enemy, Captain Garcia-y-Garcia, broke the silence
with an explosion of Spanish profanity and a desire to be informed why this particular unit
of the forces should be thus wasting his time instead of joining in the pursuit of the fugitive.

Douglas at once realised that the captain must have come along some time after his men, and
that he had probably only just entered the wood.  He also realised that, directly he turned
round, Garcia-y-Garcia would infallibly recognise him, in spite of the Peruvian private's uniform
which he was wearing.  He could also see, out of the tail of his eye, the glitter of a drawn
sword which the man carried in his hand.  But it was necessary to act at once, for at any moment
the fellow's suspicions might be aroused, or the soldiers might come back, or--

Like a flash Douglas wheeled round, bringing the carbine up to his hip as he did so, and looked
the officer full in the face; while his forefinger curled caressingly round the trigger.  The
captain's life hung by a thread, and he knew it, for he had recognised Jim as an escaped prisoner
the moment that the latter showed his face.

"Ah!" gasped Garcia, his face turning ghastly white, "it is that scoundrel of an Englishman!
From whom have you stolen these clothes, senor?" he went on, at the same time taking a fresh
grip of his sword- hilt and moving slightly nearer to Douglas.

It was a lucky thing for Jim that he had never removed his eyes from those of Garcia, for he
saw the murder that was lurking in them.  Garcia was but trying to put him off his guard by
asking that question, and Jim saw it.  He had barely time to raise his carbine when the officer's
sword flashed in the air and the next second would have smote full upon Douglas's head.  But
the young man caught the blow on the barrel of his weapon, turning the blade aside, and at
the same instant he pushed the muzzle of the carbine into Garcia's face and pulled the trigger!

There was a sharp, ringing report, and the Peruvian fell backward among the bushes, with his
head blown to pieces.  Jim hastily pushed the corpse out of sight, reloaded his rifle, and
then started to run as hard as he could; for he knew that the explosion could not possibly
pass unnoticed in that echoing wood; and, indeed, he immediately heard a chorus of excited
shouting coming from somewhere away on his left.  He therefore picked up his heels and ran
for his life.  Luckily he came upon another path, running at right angles to the main path,
and into this he plunged, stripping off his long military overcoat as he ran. After running
for about ten minutes, and getting thoroughly out of breath, he stopped to listen; and, to
his great relief, found that all sounds had died away, and that the part of the wood where
he found himself was as still as the grave.

He therefore pressed on again, but not so fast as before, and in half an hour's time he fancied
that the wood was beginning to grow less dense, and that he was therefore coming to its boundary;
but it proved to be only a large wind-gap in the forest, across which he made his way as quickly
as possible, striking into a still denser part of the wood on the other side.  It was by this
time beginning to grow dark, and Jim was considering ruefully the prospect of having to spend
the night in the forest when he thought he heard a slight noise somewhere among the trees near
him.  He at once brought his rifle to the "ready," and glared about him, searching the wood
with his glances to see who or what the intruder might be.  The next moment he sprang behind
a tree; for it was certain that there was somebody close at hand.  It could hardly be a Peruvian
soldier so far away from his friends, thought Jim; moreover, the individual was treading stealthily,
as though in fear of being heard. The next moment the fugitive Chilian pushed his way cautiously
into the path, looking warily to right and left as he did so.  Douglas immediately sprang out
from his hiding-place, nearly scaring the man to death for a moment.  The Chilian proved to
be an officer who had formerly been on board the O'Higgins, and he and Douglas recognised each
other instantly.

They at once sat down to talk matters over, and Jim soon found that his friend knew this part
of the country very well, having been there before; and that he had decided to make for Arica,
which was at this time in Chilian hands.  Jim readily fell in with the plan, and after a good
long rest the two men started away upon their arduous journey. They camped for the night on
the outskirts of the wood, which they reached about midnight, and there made a meal off the
provisions which each had been thoughtful enough to bring.  These provisions lasted them a
week, by which time they were approaching the region where they might hope to find the Chilian
outposts.  But they had either miscalculated the distance, or the Chilians had retreated, for
it was another week before they finally came into contact with a Chilian force at Tacna; and,
meanwhile, they had had to procure food at the muzzle of Jim's carbine, for the country-folk
soon perceived that the two fugitives were escaped Chilian prisoners.

As soon, however, as they fell in with Colonel Barros, in command of the first company of the
Taltal regiment, stationed at Tacna, their troubles were over.  He at once provided them with
mules and a small escort, at the same time lending them as much money as he could spare.  And
after a stay of three days with this hospitable and kindly man they took their departure, arriving
at Arica two days later; and there, before their eyes as they came in sight of the harbour,
lay the Blanco Encalada, the Chilian flagship, a sight which Jim thought the finest that he
had ever seen.  The O'Higgins was there also, together with three other ships; and the two
scarecrows lost no time in repairing on board their respective vessels.

Jim Douglas's reception on board was one which he will remember all his life.  He was instantly
shouldered by his brother officers and carried off to the ward-room, where he was made to detail
all his adventures, the captain and admiral being at the moment ashore.  It was nearly midnight
before Jim had finished; and, the admiral being still ashore, he retired to his bunk and slept
the sleep of the utterly weary.

The next thing he knew was that he was being violently shaken, while a voice cried, "Rouse
up, amigo; rouse up!  The admiral has just come on board; and, having been informed of your
return, desires to see you immediately.  Hurry up! for I believe, from the look of the old
gentleman, that he has something good in store for you.  It's just nine o'clock, and he breakfasts
in ten minutes; so look sharp."

Jim did "look sharp."  He dragged a uniform out of his chest, slipped it on, and in less than
ten minutes was standing shaking hands with Admiral Riveros.

CHAPTER NINETEEN.

A GUERILLA STRONGHOLD.

"Buenas dias, Senor Douglas," said the old gentleman heartily; "sit down and tell me all about
yourself and your doings since the memorable night when you left the Blanco Encalada.  I feared
that you, with all the rest of the crew of the Janequeo, had perished in Callao harbour, or
fallen into the hands of the Peruvians--which is even worse, so they tell me.  I am indeed
glad to see you back again, my young friend.  Now proceed with your report, senor, if you please."

Thus commanded, Jim plunged into a fairly full and detailed recital of all that had befallen
him since he had left the flagship, only pausing in his narrative when Riveros wished to be
enlightened upon some point or other.  The admiral continually nodded approbation of what Douglas
had done; and the lad noticed that he paid particular attention to the account of the silver
mine at Sorata, and Jim's description of the country thereabout.  When the young Englishman
had finished his report, which he did in the course of about an hour, Riveros suddenly said:

"Then I may take it, Senor el Teniente, that you are pretty well acquainted with the country
about Sorata?  Did you, by any chance, see or hear anything of a village called Coroico during
your captivity, or while you were escaping?"

"Coroico?" mused Jim; "let me see--yes, sir; I seem to remember hearing the place spoken of
by a warder with whom I contrived to become friendly--the man whose uniform I took the small
liberty of appropriating, you will remember.  He said that a Bolivian force was collecting
near there, for the purpose, I believe, of making raids into the newly acquired Chilian territory."

"Exactly!  Just so," replied Riveros; "that is the matter in a nutshell. Now listen to me for
a few moments, please.  As you are aware, we have practically destroyed the naval power of
Peru; and we have also made short work of her armies wherever we have come into contact with
them. In a word, Peru is almost at the end of her resources; and the Government is ready to
come to terms, allowing us to keep the territory we have newly acquired along the sea-coast,
namely, that strip of land reaching, roughly, from Papos to Arica.  So far, so good.  A small
portion of that territory, however, belonged to Bolivia, which is, as you know, the ally of
Peru.  Now, the Bolivian Government is also ready to surrender that land; but a large portion
of the population will not hear of it being given up, since their only port, Antofagasta, is
situated upon it.  These--rebels, I suppose I may call them, are trying to displace the president
of Bolivia in order to put in power a man who will not accede to the Chilian demands; but Dr
Ladislao Cabrera is too strong for the rebels, and still retains his office.

"Having therefore been foiled in that direction, a force of Bolivians has been collected by
a noted guerilla leader named Bajos; and this force, amounting to about a couple of thousand
men, has entrenched itself in a strong position near Coroico, whence frequent destructive raids
are being made into our newly won territory.  They burn and slay wherever they go; in fact
they leave a trail of blood and ashes behind them plain enough for anybody to follow.  Mercy
seems a thing absolutely unknown among these desperadoes; and instead of carrying on their
warfare in a civilised manner, they are committing the most dreadful atrocities on all Chilians,
both civil and military, who fall into their hands.  Now, these men are a menace which we cannot
tolerate; for, unless the band is rooted out and utterly destroyed, there will never be peace
or safety in the northern part of Chili.  This has been a somewhat long introduction to what
I have to say, teniente, but it was necessary, in view of the remarks which I am about to make.

"As I say, the work of the navy is practically finished; but we are very short of men in the
army; for the army has to cover a large extent of country.  I have therefore decided to transfer
you from the navy to the army, and to send you, at the head of five hundred men, against these
outlaws.  You are acquainted with the country; and you have always carried out most satisfactorily
such work as I have given you to do. More than that number of men cannot, as I understand,
be spared.  Five hundred against two thousand is heavy odds, I admit; but much will depend
upon the man who is in charge of the smaller force; and I have no hesitation in saying that
I do not think I could have chosen a better man for the purpose than yourself."

Jim bowed and murmured his thanks.  "Now," resumed Riveros, "the force is actually ready, and
is waiting to start on its march.  If you had not turned up in the nick of time I should have
been obliged to send another man; for this is a matter that cannot wait.  Since you are here,
however, I shall be glad if you will start for Coroico at once.  I am sorry to be obliged to
send you away so soon, for you deserve a long rest after all that you have gone through; but
perhaps this commission as captain in the army which I have procured for you may be some slight
recompense for what you have been obliged to endure.  Should you bring this expedition to a
satisfactory issue, I think I can promise that you will be raised to the rank of major.  That
is all, I think.  And now, Senor Douglas, the sooner you get away the better.  Dios guarde
al Usted!  Any further particulars which you may desire to know will be given you by Captain
Simpson; you will find him in his cabin.  A Dios, senor, a mas ver!"

The kindly but extremely busy old gentleman pushed Jim out of the cabin without giving him
an opportunity to express the gratitude he felt for the promotion and the trust reposed in
him, and he made his way at once to Simpson's cabin, in order to get all the information possible
relative to the forthcoming expedition.  When he emerged, an hour or so later, he was beaming
with joy and pleasureable anticipation; for he found that the task was likely to be a very
difficult one; in consequence of which he had been provided with a squadron of the Guias cavalry,
together with a couple of field-pieces, which Simpson had told him he would find very necessary.
He quickly packed up his slender baggage, and, after saying good-bye to his comrades, had himself
rowed ashore.  There his first move was made to the establishment of a military tailor, where
he procured his new uniform and weapons; then he paid a visit to the cavalry barracks, selected
a charger for himself, inspected his troop, and gave orders for them to be ready for an early
start on the morrow.  They were a fine-looking lot of men, and Jim felt that they were just
the sort of fellows for an expedition of this kind.

The following morning at seven o'clock Douglas rode into the parade ground, and found his men
already drawn up, together with the two field- pieces; and half an hour later the little army
clattered out of the barrack-yard into the streets, past the plaza, out of the north gate,
and swung into the road which led north-eastward toward Lake Titicaca, reaching La Paz four
days after leaving Arica.  They stayed here one day, leaving on the following morning, and
by nightfall the force was at the foot of the mountains which they would have to traverse before
reaching Sorata.  Here they camped for the night, pushing forward the next day right into the
heart of the mountains, which, at this altitude, were clothed with thick pine forests, and
cut up by mountain torrents spanned by narrow and frail bridges, across which it was a very
difficult and supremely dangerous task to transport the horses and the guns.

They had been among the mountains a week, and were approaching fairly close to Coroico; Jim
therefore took the precaution to throw out scouts in all directions round his little force,
in order to prevent surprise; and one evening, just before darkness began to settle down, one
of the men came riding in to say that he had caught sight of a small body of Bolivians hovering
among the hills about a mile to the right of the main body.  "Evidently," thought the young
commander, "the guerillas are expecting some such expedition as this, and have thrown out their
outposts; there will therefore be little hope of taking them by surprise."  However, as there
was no further alarm, and as darkness was fast closing down, orders were given for the camp
to be pitched for the night; and very soon the horses were picketed and the men were under
canvas, sentries were posted, and everything was made snug and comfortable for the night.

About nine o'clock, feeling greatly fatigued, Jim turned into his tent, and, wrapping himself
in his heavy overcoat, threw himself down on the ground, determined to get to sleep early that
he might feel fresh and fit for the next morning, when they might reasonably expect to get
into touch with the enemy.  But try as he might, and tired as he was, sleep refused to visit
him, and the harder he tried the wider awake did he become.  He also found that he was rapidly
becoming obsessed by a horrible feeling that all was not right, that there was some unknown
but terrible danger hovering over the sleeping camp.  He strove to dispossess his mind of such
fancies by assuring himself that sentries were posted everywhere, and that therefore the camp
would be early alarmed in the event of an attack being made; but it was all to no purpose;
the presentiment only held him the more firmly in its embrace. He had just looked at his watch
and discovered that it was midnight, and that he had been tossing and tumbling for three hours,
when his ears caught a very faint sound, coming apparently from some distance away.

Douglas sprang to his feet in a moment, and striding to the flap of his tent, bent all his
energies to the task of listening intently.  Yes, there it was again!  It was coming from the
direction of a wooden suspension bridge which spanned a broad ravine, and which the force had
crossed about a quarter of an hour before camping down; and it took the form of heavy, muffled
blows of iron against wood.

"Hallo!" exclaimed Douglas, "there is something wrong here! but what are the sentries doing?"

In a second he had belted on his sword and revolver, and plunged out of the tent in the direction
from which the sound was coming, and a few minutes later arrived at the place where the sentry
should have been standing; but there was no sign of the man--he was nowhere to be seen.

"Caramba!" exclaimed Jim, "I believe there has been foul play here!" and he began to hunt about
among the undergrowth for some sign of the missing man.  The next moment he stumbled over something
soft, and fell upon his knees, putting out his hands to save himself.  They came in contact
with a rough overcoat, and in an instant Jim knew it for that of the sentry.  Somewhat incautiously
Jim struck a match, and saw at once what had happened to the poor fellow; he had been murdered
by having a dagger driven between his shoulders!

"By Jove!" gasped the Englishman, "there has been foul treachery here. Aha!" he continued,
starting to his feet, "what is that?"

His exclamation was occasioned by a sudden booming crash coming from the direction of the suspension
bridge over which his force had passed before camping, and, with a sense of imminent disaster
clutching at his heart, he dashed forward in the direction of the chasm, leaving the sentry
to the tender mercies of the vultures.  Jim came in sight of the bridge--or, rather, its remains--a
few seconds later, and saw at once what had happened.  The dull, chopping noise which had first
attracted his attention had been caused by axe-strokes, and the bridge had been cut through
from the farther side, allowing it to fall into the ravine. In a moment the significance of
the occurrence flashed into Douglas's mind.  What if the place whereon they were camped should
prove to be a sort of island between the ravines?  And suppose the farther bridge, their only
way of escape, should also have been destroyed?

Like a hare Jim doubled on his tracks and fled back to the camp, which he found already alarmed
by the noise of the falling bridge, and a few seconds sufficed to warn the men of what had
occurred, and to arouse in them a sense of imminent peril.  Horses were saddled, bugles rang
out, tents were struck, the guns limbered up, and in ten minutes the force was dashing along
at top speed toward the next bridge, which they now realised could not be very far away.

As they galloped, Jim suddenly caught the sound of chopping in the distance ahead, and he urged
his men to greater speed, the column sweeping along over the rough ground like a whirlwind.
And they were only just in time!  Round a bend in the road Douglas caught sight of a score
of flickering lights, and saw another ravine looming dim and black in the semi-darkness.  Were
they in time?  Was the bridge still intact? wondered the Englishman.

"Halt!  Halt!" he yelled; "halt, for your lives!"

With a clatter and scraping of hoofs, a chorus of hoarse shouts, and a terrific whirl of dust,
the troopers pulled up, and Jim saw on the opposite edge of the cleft a party of Bolivian guerillas
hacking furiously away with axes at the bridge.

"Forward with the guns!" was now the word, and a few seconds later the two field-pieces were
dragged to the front and fire opened on the outlaws, to which they replied with a furious fusillade
of rifle- bullets, several of the Chilian cavalry falling under that murderous fire.  But Jim
now ordered the guns to be loaded with canister shot instead of solid, and the guerillas were
unable to face that storm of missiles.  The men with the axes dropped their tools and took
to their heels into the forest--those of them who were unwounded, that is to say--while the
greater part fell dead and dying into the ravine.  Then gradually the riflemen themselves retreated,
keeping up a galling fire the whole time; and, from their evident reluctance to retire, Douglas
guessed that they must have a strong reinforcement somewhere close at hand.

There was therefore no time to be lost if they were to get across unmolested, and Jim was himself
the first to go over to the other side and examine the bridge, to see whether it was still
in a condition to bear the passage of the horses and guns.  Luckily, the guerillas had only
just begun operations upon the structure, and it was hardly weakened at all; he therefore gave
the signal to his men on the opposite side, and in half an hour the whole force was safely
across.  But it was quite evident that they were in a very perilous situation and completely
surrounded by Bolivians.  Jim therefore called a council of war, composed of his officers,
the result of which was a unanimous decision to press forward at all hazards and strike a paralysing
blow at the guerillas before they were fully prepared for it, if possible.  Jim's force could
not be very far away now from the Bolivian stronghold; indeed, they might come upon it at any
moment, for the gigantic peak of Sorata was well in sight, and Jim took his bearings from that.

Forward they pressed, therefore, going as fast as their horses could carry them over the rough,
rock-encumbered ground, and taking care to keep scouts thrown out all round the main body.
But, strangely enough, they saw no further signs of the outlaws, and Jim was beginning to wonder
where the force that was trying to destroy the bridge could have hidden itself, when, away
in the distance ahead, he heard a piercing shriek of intense agony.  There was then a pause
of a few seconds, but immediately afterwards scream after scream went wailing up into the air!
Jim clenched his teeth and drove the spurs into his horse, crying, as he did so: "Follow me,
half a dozen of you; there is some more foul work going on ahead of us!"

Six men immediately spurred their horses out of the press and followed Jim at full speed, the
little squad of men experiencing no difficulty in finding the direction in which to go, for
the piercing shrieks were now becoming incessant.  After five minutes or so of hard riding,
Jim came within sight of a ruddy glare of light shining ahead among the trees, and he at once
guessed what was going forward.  Almost directly afterwards the seven horsemen burst into an
open glade, at the far end of which was gathered a group of men, who immediately fled into
the thick brushwood at the approach of the cavalry; not, however, before Jim had caught sight
of their uniforms, which were those worn by the Bolivian guerillas.  At the end of the clearing
a large fire had been built in the form of a circle, in the centre of which stood a stout wooden
stake driven into the earth, and to this stake was lashed an Indian who, poor creature, was
being slowly roasted to death.

Jim and his men threw themselves from their horses, and, drawing their swords, promptly began
to clear away the burning wood with their blades; and the moment that the circle was broken,
Jim dashed through the opening, cut the ropes which bound the wretched Indian to the stake,
and carried him out into the open, where the poor creature was laid down on the ground and
given a canteen of water, which he drained eagerly, immediately begging for more.  This was
given him, and Douglas proceeded to examine his injuries just as the Chilian main body rode
up.  To his satisfaction, Jim found that the man was suffering from nothing more serious than
a severe scorching, and he guessed that it must have been the anticipation of torture which
had made the Indian send up those heartrending screams.  As soon as the poor wretch had recovered
from the shock which he had sustained, Jim questioned him as to how he came to be in such a
situation, and was told that the man, whose name, by the way, was Jose, had been a guide in
the guerilla service.  The Bolivians believed that it was impossible for anybody to find the
way to their stronghold unassisted, and therefore, as soon as the Chilian cavalry appeared,
they had suspected treachery on the part of somebody, their suspicion focussing itself in this
case upon the unfortunate Jose.  They had therefore put him to the torture, partly as punishment,
and partly to make him disclose the strength of the attacking force, which the guerillas averred
he must certainly know, since there was no doubt that he had been in communication with it.
It was useless, said the Indian, for him to assert his innocence and his inability to supply
the information required; he was simply not believed, or perhaps it was that the Bolivians
were glad of an excuse for exercising their cruel instincts.  The latter, thought Jim, was
the more likely cause.  Jose, having finished the recital of his adventure, now flung himself
at Douglas's feet, praying that el senor capitan would not abandon him in this place, where
he would certainly be again captured, but that "His Excellency" would take him into his service.
If he would but do that, Jose averred he would be a faithful and true servant to his rescuer
for the remainder of his life: he would ask no reward for his services; he would only ask to
be allowed to be near Jim--to be his own private bodyguard, and, in short, to do everything
that he possibly could to show his gratitude for his timely deliverance.

Jim listened in silence to this outburst, and then somewhat inconsequently inquired: "Do you
know whereabout this guerilla fort is situated, Jose?"

"Yes, senor, I do," replied the man; "it is not more than a mile away from here, and I can
lead you to the place by way of a road which the Bolivians would never suspect you of knowing."

"Then," said Jim, "I will take you into the Chilian service as a guide, and you can be my own
personal servant as well, if you choose.  Only be careful that you play no tricks with me,
or I will hang you from the nearest tree.  Now, I think you are well enough to walk, are you
not? Yes; very well, then; lead the way, Jose, to this road of which you speak; the sooner
we root out this nest of rebels and outlaws the better!"

Jose did not, as Jim had expected, burst into a torrent of protestations of fidelity; he simply
bowed his head and placed the young Englishman's hand upon it, in token of submission, and
then said quietly:

"If, Excellency, you will follow me, and also give orders for your men to ride as silently
as possible, I will lead you, undiscovered, to the fort in less than half an hour.  The road
is not very good, it is true; but everything has been prepared for your reception at the other
approach, and I can tell you that you would never have stormed the stronghold had you gone
by that route."

All being now in readiness, the men again mounted, and, with the Indian walking in front, swung
away to the right, finding themselves in a few minutes upon a rough but wide road traversing
the edge of a ravine, the inner side of the path being bounded by a high cliff which leaned
outward until its top edge actually overhung the chasm, so that it was impossible for any one
at the top to molest a force passing along the road by hurling rocks down upon it.  As the
Indian had remarked, the road was undoubtedly rough; they could not therefore get along very
rapidly; but the half-hour had not quite expired when Jose laid his finger on his lips and
held up his hand as a sign for the troop to halt.

"Now, mi libertador," said the man, "we have managed to make the journey undetected.  The fort
is round the bend which you see in the road, and lies among the brushwood a little to the left
of it.  There is a broad slope leading up from the road to a gate in the fort which is small
and very seldom used.  The guerillas will not expect an attack from that quarter, for they
are looking for you to approach from the opposite direction.  Horses will be of little or no
use for the attack; but if you can run up your guns, you will be able to blow in the small
gate and rush into the fort over its ruins before the Bolivianos can offer any resistance."

Jim accordingly dismounted his men, telling them, however, to take their carbines with them;
and the horses were hobbled.  The guns were then unlimbered and loaded, when the pieces were
dragged quietly along the road by the men; and presently the whole force drew up, just out
of sight of the fort, ready to make their rush as soon as Douglas gave the signal.  This he
did by waving his sword, so as to obviate the necessity for shouting a command, and then swiftly
the men swept out beyond the concealment of the cliff into the open space fronting the fort,
dragging the field-pieces with them, which were immediately levelled at the gate and fired.

When the Chilians dashed into view, there was a sentry on the roof of the fort, and he immediately
squibbed off his rifle; but the alarm was given too late; the report of his rifle was drowned
in the roar of the guns, and the splintering and rending of the fort gate was the first intimation
afforded the guerillas that the enemy was upon them--from a different quarter from that whence
he was expected.  Over the ruined gates dashed the Chilians, discharging their carbines as
they went, and as they entered the fort they threw down their rifles and drew their sabres.

Then began a fight most grim and terrible.  The Bolivians outnumbered their assailants by about
four to one, but the latter had the advantage of a complete surprise, and they mowed down the
savage guerillas by the score.  There was a passage leading from the gate to the interior of
the fort, but this was soon very nearly choked with dead and wounded.  Jim therefore rallied
his men for another charge before the way should be quite closed, and, with a cheer, his brave
fellows forced a passage through for themselves, cutting down all who opposed them.  So completely
were the outlaws taken by surprise that many of them had not found time to arm themselves,
and were therefore slaughtered like so many sheep.  The promise of success, on the other hand,
spurred the Chilians on to still further effort, and in another ten minutes they had struck
such terror into the hearts of the defenders of the stronghold that the guerillas flung down
their arms and cried for quarter; and thus at last the tide of death was stopped.

The guerillas were then disarmed and imprisoned in batches in the prison cells which they had
so carefully prepared for others, while their arms were collected and destroyed, and the fort
was in the hands of the Chilians.  The terror of the surrounding country had been brought to
nothing at last, and there would be no more savage raids and midnight massacres.

A messenger was at once dispatched to La Paz to acquaint the Government with the fact of the
capture and downfall of the guerilla band, with a request that a body of Bolivian troops might
be dispatched to take charge of the prisoners.  Jim determined, however, not to hand over the
fort, although it was situated in Bolivian territory, until he should receive definite instructions
so to do from headquarters; for he did not know what new boundaries Chili proposed to arrange
as the limits to the country which she had acquired by conquest from the two republics; and
he thought it more than probable that his Government would decide to retain the fort, since
it occupied such a very commanding position.

He therefore in due time handed over the eight hundred prisoners--the rest of the band having
been killed--to the Bolivian troops; who immediately returned with them to La Paz.  Meanwhile
Jim repaired the fort sufficiently to provide accommodation for his own troops, with whom he
temporarily garrisoned the place.  Then he sent a messenger on horseback to Arica to report
the success which had been obtained, and to ask for instructions as to what he was to do with
the fort.

Meanwhile the young Englishman made up his mind that he was in for at least a fortnight's sojourn
in the fort, or until such time as his messenger should return from Arica; and he began to
cast about for some means by which to while the time away.

CHAPTER TWENTY.

THE FULFILMENT OF THE PROPHECY.

"Well, Jose, what do you make of it, eh?  Why, surely, man, there is nothing in it to frighten
you, is there?"

So spoke Jim Douglas to his Indian guide one morning, three or four days after the messenger
had been dispatched to Arica.  The Englishman had found the time hanging somewhat heavily on
his hands up there in that lonely mountain fortress; and therefore, having nothing better to
do, he had brought out the roll of parchment which he had found in the tunnel at Sorata, and
had set himself to the task of deciphering its meaning. Failing entirely, however, to make
any sense out of it, yet somehow convinced that the document was of some importance, he had
called Jose into the tent and asked him whether his knowledge of the various native dialects
was sufficient to enable him to translate it.

The effect of the sight of the document upon Jose had been peculiar, to say the least of it.
The moment that his eyes had fallen upon the parchment, his face had turned that peculiar greyish
tint which a dark skin takes on in lieu of pallor; his hands had trembled with excitement or
some other emotion, and his whole demeanour had been so strange as to call forth the exclamation
from Jim above recorded.

The Indian made no reply for several seconds, but sat gazing at the document with eyes that
seemed to threaten every moment to start out of his head.  Then he turned the parchment over
and over in his hands, holding it tenderly, even reverently, as though it were some extremely
precious or sacred thing.  Finally he pulled himself together, and, in a voice trembling with
emotion, replied: "No-o, senor; there is nothing in this document to frighten me, but--but--.
You have no idea at all, senor," he continued, after a lengthy pause, "what this writing refers
to?"

"No, of course I have not," answered Douglas, somewhat impatiently.  "If I knew the contents
I should not be under the necessity to ask you to translate them, should I?"

"Pardon me, senor; I spoke foolishly," replied Jose.

"Let the senor, however, listen to me while I recount a few facts to him.  He will then see,
perhaps, why I have been so utterly astonished at the sight of this document.  Long ages ago--ay,
long before the conquistadores appeared in Peru--we Indians worked the silver and gold mines,
which, as you know, abound in this country; and we also gathered enormous quantities of precious
stones from the river-beds for the purpose of adorning the person of the Inca, our lord, and
those of his nobles whom he deigned to favour, as well as for the adornment of the temple and
of the royal palace.  By the time, then, that Pizarro and his horde of robbers overran the
land, there were millions upon millions of dollars-worth of precious metals and precious stones
in the possession of the Inca and his nobles.  You have heard of the ransom which Pizarro exacted
from Atahualpa; how a large room was twice filled with gold, to the value of fifteen millions
of your pounds?  Well, the Spaniards themselves knew that that ransom was but a small fraction
of the enormous wealth which we Peruvians possessed; but they did not know, as we did, how
very small a fraction it was.  We had not time enough to secrete all our treasure, for the
arrival of the Spaniards was unexpected; but we hid away an enormous quantity of gold, silver,
and jewels.  Some of it has been lost; irretrievably, I fear, through the sudden death of the
men to whom the secret of its hiding-place had been entrusted.  But we Peruvians still know
the whereabout of a good deal of that vast hoard which is being kept for the time when a new
Inca shall arise who shall set himself at the head of our armies and sweep the invaders of
our land into the sea.  All our preparations are made; we only await the arrival of the man.
And this document, into possession of which you have so strangely come, relates to the burial
of one of these hoards, and tells the secret of its hiding-place, as also the means whereby
that hiding-place may be found.

"That is why I was so greatly overcome with amazement when you showed me the paper, senor.
I am one of the descendants of the ancient Peruvian race; and, since this document is written
in the secret character used by the Incas, I can read it, and I can say, now, where this treasure
is located!"

"Phew!" whistled Jim, "that's a strange story, and no mistake.  I did not think when I brought
that document away that it would prove of quite so much importance and value; although, to
be sure, there were several small gold and silver images buried with it."

"Images!" ejaculated Jose excitedly; "where are they, where are they, oh, my preserver?  If
you really have the signs in your possession, then I-- Show me them, senor, show me them, I
pray you."

Thus exhorted, Jim dived into the chest which he had brought with him to accommodate his belongings,
and produced the little images which he had found in the tunnel at Sorata.  Jose fell upon
his knees before them in a perfect ecstasy of mingled reverence and delight, turning them over
and over in his hands, and speaking to them as though they were, in very truth, alive.  Then
presently he recovered himself and, placing Jim's hand upon his head in token of submission,
he said in a trembling voice:

"Oh, my deliverer, it was prophesied of old that the man who possessed those figures should
also possess the treasure; for that man would be destined to do great things for the benefit
of our race.  But in addition to this, you have found the document; there can be no doubt,
therefore, that you, my master, are the man who is destined to receive this great treasure,
for all the signs point that way.  I am willing, therefore, to translate this writing to you,
senor, and to show you the way to the place where the treasure is hidden, so that you may obtain
possession of it."

"By Jove!" exclaimed Douglas, leaning back in his chair and wiping his forehead, "this is the
most extraordinary affair that I have ever come across; and--let me think! what was it that
old Inca witch-woman told me about treasure being in store for me?  Ah yes!  I remember.  She
said that one day I should come into possession of great wealth; that it was still hidden in
the ground, but that the secret of its hiding-place should one day be revealed to me.  Caramba!
It really seems as though the Inca's prophecy is about to come true.  Now, Jose," he went on,
aloud; "this is a very curious tale indeed.  I hope you are not playing any tricks with me.

"Senor, you saved my life, only a few days ago," replied the Indian; "is it likely that I should
deceive the man who rescued me from a horrible death?  Besides, the treasure is situated only
a very short distance from here--about a day's journey--so your Excellency can easily prove
whether I am telling the truth or not by accompanying me to the place, and seeing the treasure
with your own eyes."

"H'm!" said Jim, "yes; that is of course the most satisfactory way of proving the matter. 
My messenger cannot possibly return for eight or ten days yet, so I should have plenty of time
to make the journey.  I can leave the fort in charge of Lieutenant Munoz, as there is really
nothing in the way of duty to keep me here.  Yes, I think that will be best.  Very well, Jose,"
continued the Englishman, "we will start early to-morrow morning; and you shall show me the
way to this wonderful treasure-house of which you speak.  You had better not talk too much,
however, about the matter whereon we shall be engaged; for there is no need to excite an undue
amount of curiosity about our movements.  Make all the necessary preparations to-day,--you
will of course know what we ought to take with us for the expedition,--and I will let it be
understood that I am setting out for a hunt of two or three days' duration.  We can make an
early start, travel during the day, encamp on the spot for the night, and start work on the
second day, returning here on the third.  That ought to give us enough time to do what we have
to do, ought it not?"

"Plenty of time, Excellency," returned the Indian.  "And the senor need not be afraid that
I shall disclose the secret of our journey.  You had better take a rifle with you, senor, and
let me take one, too; for it is just possible that we might be obliged to defend the treasure
after we have secured it."

Jose then went away to make his preparations, while Jim remained in his tent thinking over
the very curious train of incidents which had led up to that of this morning.  Later in the
day he sent for Munoz and handed the command over to the lieutenant during his absence, giving
him instructions how to act in any eventuality which was in the least likely to arise; and
the next morning, just before daybreak, he set off in company with the Indian for the spot
where the Inca's treasure was asserted to be concealed.  Two mules had been loaded with provisions,
a tent, cooking utensils, blankets, etcetera, and in the middle of the blankets had been concealed
a couple of picks and the same number of shovels.  Jim and the Indian each carried an ordinary
army rifle slung over his shoulder, and had a bandolier of cartridges strapped round his waist,
so that they were well prepared for whatever might befall.

The treasure was buried, said Jose, in a cave in the side of a ravine, at a spot about twenty
miles north-eastward of Coroico, and the road thither was a difficult and dangerous one to
travel, consisting as it did, for the most part, of a narrow path just wide enough for one
man-- or a mule--to pass, and skirting the edge of tremendous abysses whose bottoms could not
be seen because of the mists which veiled them.  Many a time they came to portions of the cliff-path
which were so narrow that Jim thought it would be impossible to get any farther, but they managed
it somehow; the mules stepping along as though they had been used to that kind of road all
their lives, as, indeed, they very probably had. For some hours the two treasure-seekers continued
to ascend, the scenery growing more and more gloomy, and the country more and more barren,
until, at mid-day, they reached the summit of the pass and began to descend.  Then the character
of the scenery rapidly changed; they left the region of bare rock and entered upon that of
the forests, leaving that in turn for the lower lands and the region of tropical foliage, with
deep ravines crossed by frail bridges made of rattan and light branches.

It was just becoming dusk when Jose threw up his hand as a sign for the little cavalcade to
halt.  He then took a careful look round him, observing the formation and appearance of the
surrounding country; then he made a long and close scrutiny of the document, which they had,
of course, brought with them, and a frown of perplexity made its appearance between Jose's eyes.

"What's the matter, mi amigo?" demanded Jim, noticing the look.

"Well, senor," replied Jose, "this paper says that from here one should be able to see, close
at hand, a large pinnacle of rock in the shape of a pyramid.  It is from that pinnacle that
the bearings of the treasure- cave are to be taken and--and I can see no such rock anywhere
about here."

"That is awkward," said Douglas.  "Does the paper say whether it was a big or small column
of rock?"

"It says that it is about the height of two men, Excellency," replied the Indian.

"Oh, then, we may very easily find it hidden away somewhere among this thick brushwood," replied
Jim.  And sure enough, they found the rock, after an hour's search, during which it had become
almost dark, completely covered with a thick growth of tropical foliage.  They were able to
do nothing further that night, the light having completely gone by the time that the rock was
finally identified; so they camped out where they were, and began the search again the next
morning.

From the rock Jose now carefully paced off certain distances; and, by ten o'clock in the forenoon
he announced that he had discovered the spot where the treasure lay.  At their feet ran a stream,
the approach to which had been made by way of a gentle grassy slope.  But the opposite side
of the torrent was nothing more than a sheer wall of rock some hundreds of feet in height,
and it seemed to Jim as though they had reached the uttermost confines of the world.  They
had come so far, but it was manifestly impossible to go any farther.  However, it was not necessary
to do so; for, on the opposite side of the stream Jim saw, when Jose pointed it out to him,
a black, round opening which, said the Indian, was the mouth of the treasure-cavern.

Douglas thought that it would have been impossible to secure a better hiding-place; for the
approach to the spot was difficult, and beset with many dangers.  And had any one arrived at
the bank of the stream whereon the two men then stood they would never have guessed that the
little inconspicuous hole on the opposite side was the entrance to a chamber wherein was contained
the ransom of, not of one, but many kings.

The stream, though swift-flowing, was shallow, and the adventurers had little difficulty in
getting across; whereupon they found themselves standing on a narrow ledge of black rock, while,
four feet above their heads, was the lower edge of the hole, which proved to be much larger
than it had appeared from the other side.  It was the work of a few seconds only for Jim to
mount on the Indian's shoulders and secure a foothold in the mouth of the cave, after which
he assisted Jose to climb up.

As soon as they were inside, Jose seemed to be overcome with awe at the idea of standing on
such sacred ground; but Jim had no such feelings, and kindling a torch, he bade the Indian
lead the way.  The latter soon recovered his equanimity, and, after they had hauled up the
picks and shovels, led the way into the interior of the cave, which widened out as they receded
from the entrance, until it assumed enormous dimensions, the light of the torch being quite
insufficient to disclose the boundaries of the cavern.  And now they began to meet with traces
of a former civilisation.  Along the rock walls were ranged stone images of the Incas and their
wives, and at the feet of each figure was to be seen a large package wrapped in raw-hide, and
secured with strips of the same material.  These packages, Jose said, contained gold bricks;
and Jim quickly proved the truth of the statement by slitting open one or two with his hunting-knife.

It was, however, toward a row of huge chests, ten in number, that the Indian led Jim, telling
him that the real treasure was contained in them.  Although strong, they were quickly broken
open by well-directed blows of the pickaxes; and upon the lids being raised there burst upon
Jim's eyes such a vision of wealth that he was positively dazed by the immensity of it.  The
particular chest which he opened was full, from bottom to top, of solid gold ingots, black
with age on the surface, but showing the dull red metallic lustre of gold when scraped with
a knife. There must have been half a million pounds' worth of it, Jim guessed, in that one
chest alone--and there were nine others!  The two men then opened a second box, at random,
and this chest contained all manner of gold and silver ornaments, of the most exquisitely delicate
and intricate workmanship.  Cups, necklaces, finger-rings, clasps, sword- hilts, and breast-plates,
the latter studded with rough, uncut jewels of enormous size, filled the chest to the very
brim, and took away Jim's breath with the magnificence and lavish abundance of it all.  The
other cases were each opened in turn, disclosing to their astounded eyes the veritable treasure
of the Incas; and Jim immediately saw that the removal of such a vast accumulation of wealth
must necessarily occupy a considerable time, and that the treasure would have to be conveyed
away piecemeal on mule-back.  He therefore selected from the hoard of uncut jewels as many
of the finest as he believed that he and Jose could conveniently carry, wrapped them up in
two parcels, and, giving one to Jose to carry, took charge of the other himself.  This done,
the two men closed up the chests and left the cavern, returning to the spot where they had
camped on the previous nigh.  During the long silent hours while Jose was asleep, Jim kept
guard over the spoil which he had already secured, and made plans for removing the rest of
the treasure. He decided to dispose of the whole of the jewels--or, rather, as many of them
as he might find necessary--and with the money thus obtained fit out an expedition to the cavern,
to bring away the remainder of the spoil; but while he was wondering how he could elude the
watchfulness of the Bolivian authorities--who would pounce upon the whole if they should get
to hear of its existence--he fell asleep, and it was nearly eleven o'clock when he awoke the
next morning.

The two men then secured the gems to their persons, and started off on their toilsome journey
back to the fort, which they safely reached two days later, utterly worn-out with the fatigues
which they had undergone. Jim was so completely exhausted that he spent the whole of the day
after their return upon his narrow camp-bed; but by the following morning he was quite rested,
and burning with impatience for his messenger to return, so that he might the sooner get back
to civilisation and prepare for the expedition to the treasure-cavern.

It was some days, however, before the soldier returned, having ridden hard night and day to
deliver Jim's report and to return with orders to the young commander.  They were to the effect
that Douglas was to leave half his force in the fort--which the Chilians had decided to hold
for the present--and to return with the remaining half to Arica as soon as possible.  He therefore
set off with his reduced company upon the following morning, Jose insisting upon accompanying
him, and reached Arica a week later, reporting his arrival at the military headquarters there,
where he was complimented upon the success with which he had carried out his little campaign
against the guerillas, and where he received his promotion to the rank of major, as had been
promised him by Admiral Riveros in the event of his bringing the expedition to a satisfactory
conclusion.

There is very little more to tell, for by the time that Douglas returned to Arica the war was
practically over, and as peace negotiations were already in progress hostilities had ceased
almost everywhere.  A fortnight later the treaty was signed whereby Bolivia ceded the whole
of her sea-coast to Chili, and Peru was forced to give up 250 miles of hers to the conquering
Republic.  The Peruvian navy had been utterly destroyed, with the exception of one or two worthless
ships; the Bolivian armies had been cut to pieces, and the allies had been obliged to bow the
knee to Chili, which had everywhere been victorious.

As the fighting was now all over Jim resigned his position in the Chilian army and went to
Valparaiso, where he eventually disposed of his jewels for the very handsome sum of one hundred
and fifty thousand pounds, which was very much more than he had any idea they would fetch,
yet considerably less than they were actually worth.  He then made a journey into the mountains,
accompanied only by Jose and a small escort, in order properly to survey the place where the
treasure-cave was situated before he led the expedition there for the purpose of recovering
the remainder of the gold and jewels.  But to his utter consternation he found, when he reached
the locality, that an earthquake had recently occurred which had changed the whole character
of the surroundings!

He was, however, at length able to locate the spot where the cavern had been, and he took such
elaborate and complete bearings of it that he felt sure he would one day, when things had quieted
down a little, be able to get at the chests again and despoil them of their contents.  But
for the moment he had as much money as he actually needed; so, returning from Coroico, he bought
an estate in a lovely spot near Quinteros Bay, and settled down comfortably there, with Jose
as his faithful henchman.

Jim has never married, although he is now getting somewhat on in years. He says he is quite
contented and happy with his horses, his dogs, and Jose, who has never left his master's side
for a whole day since that eventful night when Jim rescued him from the guerillas.

For ten long years Jim lived in that house near Quinteros, which he named "Casa Coroico"; and
then the Chilian revolutionary war broke out, and he again took up his commission as major,
and fought in the ranks of the Congressionalists.  How he fared in that campaign is, however,
another story; as also is that of his subsequent adventures in quest of the Inca's treasure
which was lost during the earthquake.  Douglas is now a man of nearly fifty years of age; but
he declares that he is in the very prime of life; and, if you care to visit him in his magnificent
house overlooking the sea, there is nothing that will give him greater pleasure, you will find,
than to talk to you about the wild days of '79-'81, when he fought against the Peruvians. 
Every particular of this campaign he remembers as precisely as though it had occurred but yesterday;
and he will yarn for hours together about Prat, Condell, Lynch, Simpson, Williams, and all
the rest of them; men of English descent for the most part, who had adopted Chili as their
home and country, and who helped to make the Republic what she now is, a credit to herself
and to them, and a worthy protege of that greater country across the sea from which sprang
the noble and gallant gentlemen who raised Chili to the position of first of the South American
Republics.
