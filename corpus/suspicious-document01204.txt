The Western World, by W.H.G. Kingston.

This rather long book is not a novel: it is a fun-level introduction to the natural history
of the Americas, seen from a late nineteenth century perspective.  Quadrupeds, birds, plants,
trees, and the indigenous races are covered, always in an interesting and readable style. 
There are almost 200 engravings, many of them quite excellent, done by a variety of high-quality
artists.  Unfortunately all this adds up to additional size, such that the PDF of the book
is close to 100 megabytes, when an average novel is from 12 to 20 megabytes.

You could not use this book as a full guide to all the natural history of the Americas, but
instead it is intended to be read through in order to gain an introductory view of it.  The
book is divided into five parts of which the first, of nine chapters, covers North America;
the second, of three chapters, covers Central America; the third, fourth, and fifth, amounting
to twenty-five chapters, covers South America.

It is a well-written and absorbing book.

THE WESTERN WORLD, BY W.H.G. KINGSTON.

PREFACE.

In the following pages I have endeavoured to give, in a series of picturesque sketches, a general
view of the natural history as well as of the physical appearance of North and South America.

I have first described the features of the country; then its vegetation; and next the wild
men and the brute creatures which inhabit it. However, I have not been bound by any strict
rule in that respect, as my object has been to produce a work calculated to interest the family
circle rather than one of scientific pretensions.  I have endeavoured to impart, in an attractive
manner, information about its physical geography, mineral riches, vegetable productions, and
the appearance and customs of the human beings inhabiting it.  But the chief portion of the
work is devoted to accounts of the brute creation, from the huge stag and buffalo to the minute
humming-bird and persevering termites,-- introduced not in a formal way, but as they appear
to the naturalist-explorer, to the traveller in search of adventures, or to the sportsman;
with descriptions of their mode of life, and of how they are found, hunted, or trapped.  I
have described in the same way some of the most remarkable trees and plants; and from the accounts
I have given I trust that a knowledge may be obtained of the way they are cultivated, and how
their produce is prepared and employed.  Thus I hope that, with the aid of the numerous illustrations
in the work, a correct idea will be gained of the wilder and more romantic portions of the
great Western World.

PART ONE, CHAPTER ONE.

NORTH AMERICA.

INTRODUCTORY.--PHYSICAL FEATURES OF NORTH AMERICA.

The continent of America, if the stony records of the Past are read aright, claims to be the
oldest instead of the newest portion of the globe.  [According to some geologists, Labrador
was the first part of our globe's surface to become dry land.]  Bowing to this opinion of geologists
till they see cause to express a different one, we will, in consequence, commence our survey
of the world and its inhabitants with the Western Hemisphere.  From the multitude of objects
which crowd upon us, we can examine only a few of the most interesting minutely; at others
we can merely give a cursory glance; while many we must pass by altogether,--our object being
to obtain a general and retainable knowledge of the physical features of the Earth, the vegetation
which clothes its surface, the races of men who inhabit it, and the tribes of the brute creation
found in its forests and waters, on its plains and mountains.

As we go along, we will stop now and then to pick up scraps of information about its geology,
and the architectural antiquities found on it; as the first will assist in giving us an insight
into the former conditions of extinct animals, and the latter may teach us something of the
past history of the human tribes now wandering as savages in regions once inhabited by civilised
men.

Still, the study of Natural History and the geographical range of animals is the primary object
we have in view.

Though the best-known portions of the Polar Regions are more nearly connected with North America
than with Europe or Asia, we propose to leave them to be fully described in another work. 
It is impossible, in the present volume, to embrace more than the continental parts of the
Western World.

Looking down on the continent of North America, which we will first visit, we observe its triangular
shape: the apex, the southern end of Mexico; the base, the Arctic shore; the sides, especially
the eastern, deeply indented, first by Hudson Bay, which pierces through more than a third
of the continent, then by the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and further south by Chesapeake Bay and
the Bay of Fundy.  On the western coast, the Gulf of California runs 800 miles up its side,
with the Rio Colorado falling into it; and further north are the Straits of Juan da Fuca, between
Vancouver's Island and the mainland, north of which are numerous archipelagoes and inlets extending
round the great peninsula of Yukon to Kotzebue Sound.

Parallel with either coast we shall see two great mountain-systems--that called the Appalachian,
including the chain of the Alleghanies, on the east, and the famed Rocky Mountains on the west--running
from north to south through the continent.

We shall easily recollect the great water-system of North America if we consider it to be represented
by an irregular cross, of which the Mississippi with its affluents forms the stem; Lake Superior
and the River Saint Lawrence, including the intermediate lakes, the eastern arm; the Lake of
the Woods and its neighbours, Lake Winnipeg and the Saskatchewan, the western arm; and the
northern lakes of Athabasca, the Great Slave Lake, and the Mackenzie River, the upper part
of the cross. If we observe also a wide level region which runs north and south between the
Arctic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, bounded on either side by the two lofty mountain ranges
already mentioned, we shall have a tolerably correct notion of the chief physical features
of the North American continent.

Arriving at the northern end, we shall find it reaching some four degrees north of the Polar
Circle, though some of its headlands extend stilt further into the icy sea.  Beyond it stretches
away to an unknown distance towards the Pole a dense archipelago of large islands, the narrow
channels between them bridged over in winter by massive sheets of ice, affording an easy passage
to the reindeer, musk-oxen, and other animals which migrate southward during the colder portion
of the Arctic winter.

NORTHERN REGION.

With that end of America will ever be associated the names of Sir John Franklin and his gallant
companions, who perished in their search of the North-west Passage; as well as those of other
more fortunate successors, especially of Captains McClure and Collinson of the British navy,
to the first of whom is due the honour of leading an expedition from west to east along that
icy shore; while Captain Collinson took his ship, the Enterprise, up to Cambridge Bay, Victoria
Land, further east than any ship had before reached from the west--namely, 105 degrees west--and
succeeded in extricating her from amid the ice and bringing her home in safety.  Captain McClure,
not so fortunate in one respect, was compelled to leave his ship frozen up.  The two expeditions,
while proving the existence of a channel, at the same time showed its uselessness as a means
of passing from the Atlantic to the Pacific, as, except in most extraordinary seasons, it remains
blocked up all the year by ice.

The northern end of the American continent is a region of mountains, lakes, and rivers.  Several
expeditions have been undertaken through it,--the first to ascertain the coast-line, by Mackenzie,
Franklin, Richardson, Back, and others, and latterly by Dr Rae; and also by Sir John Richardson,
who left the comforts of England to convey assistance to his long-missing former companions,
though unhappily without avail. These journeys, through vast barren districts, among rugged
hills, marshes, lakes, and rivers, in the severest of climates, exhibit in the explorers an
amount of courage, endurance, and perseverance never surpassed.  In the course of the rivers
occur many dangerous falls, rapids, and cataracts, amid rocks and huge boulders, between which
the voyagers' frail barks make their way, running a fearful risk every instant of being dashed
to pieces.  Not a tree rears its head in the wild and savage landscape, the vegetation consisting
chiefly of lichens and mosses.  Among the former the tripe de roche is the most capable of
supporting life.  Here winter reigns with stern rigour for ten months in the year; and even
in summer biting blasts, hail-storms, and rain frequently occur.  Yet in this inhospitable
region numerous herds of reindeer, musk-oxen, and other mammalia find subsistence during the
brief summer, as do partridge and numerous birds of various species.

Here the Esquimaux lives in his skin-tent during the warmer months, and in his snow-hut in
winter, existing on the seals which he catches with his harpoon, the whales occasionally cast
on shore, and the bears, deer, and smaller animals he entraps.

The numerous rivers flowing from the mountain-ridges mostly make their way northward.  The
Mackenzie, the largest and most western, rising in the Great Slave and Great Bear Lakes, falls,
after a course of many hundred miles, into the Polar Sea.  The Coppermine River, rising in
Point Lake, makes its course in the same direction; while eastward, the great Fish or Back
River, flowing from the same lake as the first mentioned stream, reaches the ocean many hundred
miles away from it, at the lower extremity of Bathurst Islet.  It runs rapidly in a tortuous
course of 530 geographical miles through an iron-ribbed country, without a single tree on the
whole line of its banks, expanding here and there into five large lakes, and broken by thirty-three
falls, cascades, and rapids ere it reaches the Polar Sea.  Not far from its mouth rises the
barren rocky height of Cape Beaufort.

It was down this stream that Captain Back, the Arctic explorer, made his way, but was compelled
to return on account of the inclemency of the weather and the difficulty of finding fuel; the
only vegetation which he could discover being fern and moss, which was so wet that it would
not burn, while he was almost without fire, or any means of obtaining warmth, his men sinking
knee-deep as they proceeded on shore in the soft slush and snow, which benumbed their limbs
and dispirited them in the extreme.  Through this country the unhappy remnant of the Franklin
expedition, many years later, perished in their attempt to reach the Hudson Bay Company's territory.
Here, in winter, the thermometer sinks 70 degrees below zero.  Even within his hut, when he
had succeeded in lighting a fire, Back could not get it higher than 12 degrees below zero.
Ink and paint froze.  The sextant cases, and boxes of seasoned wood--principally fir--all split;
the skin of the hands became dried, cracked, and opened into unsightly and smarting gashes;
and on one occasion, after washing his hands and face within three feet of the fire, his hair
was actually clotted with ice before he had time to dry it.  The hunters described the sensation
of handling their guns as similar to that of touching red-hot iron; and so excessive was the
pain, that they were obliged to wrap thongs of leather round the triggers to prevent their
fingers coming in contact with the steel.  Numbers of the Indian inhabitants of the country
perish from cold and hunger every year--indeed, it seems wonderful that human beings should
attempt to live in such a country; yet much further north, the hardy Esquimaux, subsisting
on whale's blubber and seal's flesh, contrives to support life in tolerable comfort.

To the south of the Arctic Circle stunted fir-trees begin to appear, and at length grow so
thickly, that it is with difficulty a passage can be made amid them.  Frequently the explorer
has to clamber over fallen trees, through rivulets, bogs, and swamps, till often the difficulties
in the way appear insurmountable to all but the boldest and the most persevering.

MOUNTAINS.

On the western side of the continent rises gradually from the Polar regions the mighty chain
which runs throughout its whole length--a distance of altogether 10,000 miles.  The northern
portion, known as the Rocky Mountains, runs for 3000 miles, in two parallel chains, to the
plains of Mexico, flanked by two other parallel ranges on the west,--the most northern of which
are the Sea Alps of the north-west coast, and on the southern, the mountains of California.
At the north-western end of the Sea Alps rises the lofty mountain of Mount Elias, 17,000 feet
in height--the highest mountain in North America--not far from Behring Bay; while another range,
the Chippewayan, stretches eastward, culminating in Mount Brown, 10,000 feet in height, and
gradually diminishing, till it sinks into insignificance towards the Arctic Circle.  Point
Barrow is the most northern point of America on the western side.  It consists of a long narrow
spit, composed of gravel and loose sand, which the pressure of the ice has forced up into numerous
masses, having the appearance of rocks.  From this point eastward to the mouth of the Mackenzie
River the coast declines a little south of east.  The various mountain ranges existing on the
eastern side of the continent, including the chain of the Alleghanies, form what is called
the Appalachian system.  It consists of numerous parallel chains, some of which form detached
ridges, the whole running from the north-east to the south-west, and it extends about 1200
miles in length--from Maine to Alabama.  Besides the Alleghany Mountains in the western part
of Virginia and the central parts of Pennsylvania, it embraces the Catskill Mountains in the
State of New York, the Green Mountains in the State of Vermont, the highlands eastward of the
Hudson River, and the White Mountains in New Hampshire.  Mount Washington, which rises to an
elevation of 6634 feet out of the last-named range, is the highest peak, of the whole system.
To the north of the Saint Lawrence the lofty range of the Wotchish Mountains extends towards
the coast of Labrador; while the whole region west and north of that river and the great Canadian
lakes is of considerable length, the best-known range being that which contains the Lacloche
Mountains, which appear to the north of Lake Huron, and extend towards the Ottawa River.  These
two great ranges of mountains divide the North American continent into three portions.

GREAT RIVERS.

The rivers which rise on the eastern side of the Appalachian range run into the Atlantic; those
which rise west of the Rocky Mountains empty themselves into the Pacific; while the mighty
streams which flow between the two, pass through the great basin of the Mississippi, and swell
the waters of that mother of rivers.  The great valley of the Mississippi, indeed, drains a
surface greater than that of any other river on the globe, with the exception perhaps of the
Amazon.  The Missouri, even before it reaches it, runs a course of 1300 miles, while the Mississippi
itself, before its confluence with the Missouri, has already passed over a distance of 1200
miles; thence to its mouth its course is upwards of 1200 miles more.  The Arkansas, which flows
into it, is 2000 miles long, and the Red River of the south 1500 miles in length; while the
Ohio, to its junction with the Mississippi, is nearly 1000 miles long.

North America may be said to contain four great valleys--that of the Mississippi, running north
and south; that of the Saint Lawrence, from the south-west to the north-east; that of the Saskatchewan,
extending from the Rocky Mountains below Mount Brown to Lake Superior; that of the Mackenzie,
from the Great Slave Lake to the Arctic Ocean.  Although a large portion of the eastern side
of the continent is densely-wooded, there are towards the west, extending from the Gulf of
Mexico to the Arctic Ocean, vast plains.  In the south they are treeless and barren in the
extreme; while advancing northward they are covered with rich grasses, which afford support
to vast herds of buffaloes, as well as deer and other animals.

LAKES.

The most remarkable feature in North America is its lake system--the largest and most important
in the world.  In the north-west, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, are the Great Bear and
Great Slave Lakes, which discharge their waters through the Mackenzie River into the Arctic
Ocean.  Next we have the Athabasca, Wollaston, and Deer Lakes.  In the very centre of the continent
are the two important lakes of Winnipeg and Winnipegoos,--the former 240 miles in length by
55 in width, and the latter about half the size.  The large river of the Saskatchewan flows
into Lake Winnipeg, and with it will, ere long, form an important means of communication between
the different parts of that vast district lately opened up for colonisation.  At its southern
end the Red River of the north flows into it, on the banks of which a British settlement has
long been established.  Several streams, however, make their way into Hudson Bay.  Between
it and Lake Superior is an elevated ridge of about 1500 feet in height; the streams on the
west falling into Lake Winnipeg, while those which flow towards the east reach Lake Superior.

We now come to the site of the five largest fresh-water lakes in the world.  Lake Superior
extends, from west to east, 335 miles, with an extreme breadth of 175.  Its waters flow through
the Saint Mary's River by a rapid descent into Lake Huron, which is 240 miles long.  This lake
is divided by the Manitoulin islands into two portions, and is connected with Lake Michigan
by a narrow channel without rapids, so that the two lakes together may be considered to form
one sheet of water.  On its southern extremity the waters of Lake Huron flow through another
narrow channel, which expands during part of its course into Lake Saint Clair; and they then
enter Lake Erie, which has a length of 265 miles, and a breadth of 80 miles.  It is of much
less depth than the other lakes, and its surface is therefore easily broken up into dangerous
billows by strong winds.  Passing onward towards the north-east, the current enters the Niagara
River, about half-way down which it leaps along a rocky ledge of 100 feet in height, to a lower
level, forming the celebrated Falls of Niagara, and then passes on in a rapid course into Lake
Ontario.  The fall between the two lakes is 333 feet.  Lake Ontario is 180 miles long and 65
miles wide.  Out of its north-eastern end falls the broad stream which here generally takes
the name of the Saint Lawrence, and which proceeds onward, now widening into lake-like expanses
full of islands, now compressed into a narrow channel, in a north-easterly direction.  The
true Saint Lawrence may indeed be considered as traversing the whole system of the great lakes
of North America, and thus being little less than a thousand miles in direct length; indeed,
including its windings, it is fully two thousand miles long.  To the north-west of it exist
countless numbers of small lakes united by a network of streams; while numerous large rivers,
such as the Ottawa, the Saint Maurice, and the Saguenay, flow into it, and assist to swell
its current.  There are numerous other small lakes to the west of the Rocky Mountains, a large
number of which exist in the Province of British Columbia, and are more or less connected with
the Fraser and Columbia Rivers.  Further to the south are other lakes, many of them of volcanic
origin, some intensely salt, others formed of hot mud.  Among these is the Great Salt Lake,
in the State of Utah.  To the south of the Saint Lawrence also is Lake Champlain, 105 miles
long, though extremely narrow,--being only 10 miles in its widest part, narrowing in some places
to half a mile.  Near it is the beautiful Lake Saint George, with several other small lakes;
and lastly, in Florida, there is a chain of small lakes, terminating in Lake Okechodee--a circular
sheet of water about thirty miles in diameter.

We must now proceed more particularly to examine the regions of which we have obtained the
preceding cursory view, but, before we do so, we must glance at their human inhabitants.

ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS--THE RED MEN OF THE WILDS.

While the white men from Europe occupy the whole eastern coast, pressing rapidly and steadily
westward, the Redskin aborigines maintain a precarious existence throughout the centre of the
continent, from north to south, and are still found here and there on the western shores. 
On the northern ice-bound coast, the skin-clothed Esquimaux wander in small bands from Behring
Strait to Baffin Bay, but never venture far inland, being kept in check by their hereditary
enemies, the Athabascas, the most northern of the red-skinned nations.  The Esquimaux, inhabiting
the Arctic regions, may more properly be described in the volume devoted to that part of the globe.

INDIAN WIGWAMS.

Here and there, in openings in the primeval forest, either natural or artificial, on the banks
of streams and lakes, several small conical structures may be seen, composed of long stakes,
stuck in the ground in circular form, and fastened at the top.  The walls consist of large
sheets of birch-bark, layer above layer, fastened to the stakes.  On the lee-side is left a
small opening for ingress and egress, which can be closed by a sheet of bark, or the skin of
a wild animal.  At the apex, also, an aperture is allowed to remain for the escape of the smoke
from the fire which burns within.  Lines are secured to the stakes within, on which various
articles are suspended; while round the interior mats or skins are spread to serve as couches,
the centre being left free for the fire.  In front, forked stakes support horizontal poles,
on which fish or skins are hung to dry; and against others, sheets of bark are placed on the
weather-side, forming lean-tos, shelters to larger fires, used for more extensive culinary
operations than can be carried on within the hut.  On the shores are seen drawn up beautifully-formed
canoes of birch-bark of various sizes--some sufficient to carry eight or ten men; and others,
in which only one or two people can sit.

APPEARANCE OF THE INDIANS.

Amid the huts may be seen human figures with dull copper or reddish-brown complexions, clothed
in rudely-tanned skins of a yellowish or white hue, and ornamented with the teeth of animals
and coloured grasses, or worsted and beads.  Their figures are tall and slight.  They have
black, piercing eyes, slightly inclining downwards towards the nose, which is broad and large.
They have thick, coarse lips, high and prominent cheek-bones, with somewhat narrow foreheads,
and coarse, dark, glossy hair, without an approach to a curl; their heads sometimes adorned
with feathered caps or other ornaments.  Often their faces are besmeared with various coloured
pigments in stripes or patches--one colour on one side of the face, the other being of a different
hue. Their lower extremities are covered with leggings of leather, ornamented with fringes,
and their feet clothed in mocassins of the same material as their leggings.  The men stalk
carelessly about, or repair their canoes or fishing gear and arms; while the women sit, crouching
down to the ground, bending over their caldrons, shelling Indian-corn, or engaged in some other
domestic occupation; and the children, innocent of clothing, tumble about on the ground.  In
travelling, the Indian mother carries her child on her back.  It is strapped to a board; and
when a halting-place is reached, the cradle and the child are hung upon a tree, or on a pole
inside the wigwam.  Those who have communication with the whites may be seen clothed in blanket
garments, which the men wear in the shape of coats; while the women swathe their bodies in
a whole blanket, which covers them from their shoulders to their feet.

Though the men assume a grave and dignified air when a stranger approaches, they often indulge
in practical jokes and laughter among themselves; and in seasons of prosperity, appear good-humoured
and merry.  The women, however, are doomed to lives of unremitting toil, from the time they
become wives.  They are compelled to carry the burdens, and to cultivate the ground, when any
ground is cultivated, for the production of potatoes, maize, and tobacco.  The men condescend
merely to manufacture their arms and canoes, and to hunt; or they engage in what they consider
the noblest of employments, waging war on their neighbours.  The women, indeed, are often compelled
to paddle the canoes, sometimes to go fishing, and to carry the portable property from place
to place, or an overload of game when captured.

Intelligent as the Indian appears, it is evident that he has cultivated his perceptive powers
to the neglect of his spiritual and moral qualities.  His senses are remarkably acute.  His
memory is good; and when aroused, his imagination is vivid, though wild in the extreme.  He
is warmly attached to hereditary customs and manners.  Naturally indolent and slothful, he
detests labour, and looks upon it as a disgrace, though he will go through great fatigue when
hunting or engaged in warfare.

WOOD INDIANS.

The northern tribes are known as Wood Indians, in contradistinction to the inhabitants of the
open country, the Prairie Indians, who differ greatly from the former in their habits and customs.
All the tribes of the Athabascas, as well as those to the south of them, known as the Algonquins,
are Wood Indians.  They are nearly always engaged in hunting the wild animals of the region
they inhabit, for the sake of their furs, which they dispose of to the agents of the Hudson
Bay Company and other traders, in exchange for blankets, firearms, hatchets, and numerous other
articles, as well as too often for the pernicious fire-water, to obtain even small quantities
of which they will frequently dispose of the skins which it has cost them many weeks to obtain
with much hardship and danger.  These Wood Indians are peaceably-disposed, and can always escape
the attacks of their enemies of the prairies by retreating among their forest or lake fastnesses.
They obtain their game by various devices, sometimes using traps of ingenious construction,
or shooting the creatures with bows and arrows, and of later years with firearms. They spear
the fish which abound in their waters, or catch them with scoop and other nets.  Although their
ordinary wigwams are of the shape already described, some are considerably larger, somewhat
of a bee-hive form, covered thickly with birch-bark, and have a raised dais in the interior
capable of holding a considerable number of people.  The best-known of these Forest Indians
are the Chippeways, who range from the banks of Lake Huron almost to the Rocky Mountains, throughout
the British territory.

THE PRAIRIE INDIANS.

To the south of the tribes already mentioned, are the large family of the Dakotahs, who number
among them the Sioux, Assiniboines, and Blackfeet, and are the hereditary enemies of the Chippeways,
especially of their nearer neighbours, the Crees and Ojibbeways.  These Dakotahs occupy the
open prairie country to the south of the Saskatchewan, and are the most northern of the Prairie
Indians.  In summer, they wear little or no clothing; and possessing numerous horses, hunt
the buffaloes, or rather bisons, on horseback, armed with spears and bows and arrows.  They
are fiercer and more warlike than their northern neighbours, and have long set the whites at
defiance.  The buffalo supplies them with their chief support.  The flesh of the animal dried
in the sun, or pounded with its fat into pemmican, is their chief article of food; while its
skin serves as a covering for their tents, a couch at night, or for clothing by day, and is
manufactured into bags for carrying their provisions, and numerous other articles.  Physically,
they are superior to the Wood Indians.  They are both hunters and warriors; and though they
may occasionally exchange the buffalo robes-- as the skins are called--for firearms; they seldom
employ themselves as trappers, or attend to the cultivation of the ground.

The greater number of the tribes further to the south possess horses, and hunt the buffalo
and deer.  Some are even more savage than the Dakotahs, while others, again, have made slight
progress towards civilisation, and live in settled villages, while they rudely cultivate the
ground, and possess herds of cattle.

Although the Indian languages differ greatly from each other, a great similarity in grammatical
structure and form has been found to exist among them, denoting a common, though remote origin.
They differ, however, so greatly from any known language of the Old World, as to afford conclusive
proof that their ancestors must have left its shores at an early period of the world's history.

The governments also differed.  In some tribes it approached an absolute monarchy, the will
of the sachem or chief being the supreme law; while in others it was almost entirely republican,
the chief being elected for his personal qualities, though frequently the leadership was preserved
in the female line of particular families.

When describing the customs of the Indians, we are compelled often to speak of the past, as
the tribes, from being pressed together by the advancement of civilisation, have become amalgamated,
and many of their customs have passed away.  Most of the nations were divided into three or
more clans or tribes, each distinguished by the name of an animal. Thus the Huron Indians were
divided into three tribes--those of the Bear, the Wolf, and the Turtle.  The Chippeways, especially,
were divided into a considerable number of tribes.

RELIGIOUS BELIEF.

Though their language differs so greatly, as do many of their customs, their religious notions
exhibit great uniformity throughout the whole country.  They all possess a belief, though it
is vague and indistinct, in the existence of a Supreme, All-Powerful Being, and in the immortality
of the soul, which, they suppose, restored to its body, will enjoy the future on those happy
hunting-grounds which form the red man's heaven.  They also worship numerous inferior deities
or evil spirits, whom they endeavour to propitiate, under the supposition that unless they
do so they may work them evil rather than good.  They suppose that there is one god of the
sun, moon, and stars; that the ocean is ruled by another god, and that storms are produced
by the power of various malign beings; yet that all are inferior to the Supreme Ruler of the
universe. We can trace in some of the tribes customs and notions which have been derived from
those of far-distant nations.  Thus, the tribes of Louisiana kept a sacred fire constantly
burning in their temples: the Natches, as did the Mexicans, worshipped the sun, from whom their
chiefs pretended to be descended.  By some tribes human sacrifices were offered up,--a custom
which was practised by the Pawnees and Indians of the Missouri even to a late period.  Several
of the tribes buried their dead beneath their houses; and it was an universal custom among
all to inter them in a sitting posture, clothed in their best garments, while their weapons
and household utensils, with a supply of food, were placed in their graves, to be used when
they might be restored to life.  Several of their traditions evidently refer to events recorded
in Scripture history.  The Algonquin tribes still preserve one pointing to the upheaval of
the earth from the waters, and of a subsequent inundation. The Iroquois have a tradition of
a general deluge; while another tribe believe not only that a deluge took place, but that there
was an age of fire which destroyed all things, with the exception of a man and woman, who were
preserved in a cavern.  Many similar traditions exist; while it is probable that those mentioned
refer to the destruction of the Cities of the Plain by fire which came down from heaven, and
to the confusion of tongues which fell upon the descendants of Noah in the plain of Shinar.

AMERICAN ANTIQUITIES.

We are apt to suppose that the wild inhabitants of the New World have ever existed in the same
savage state as that in which they are found. Vast numbers, however, of remains, and buildings
of great antiquity, have of late years been discovered, showing that at one time either their
ancestors, or other tribes who have passed away, had made great progress in civilisation. 
As the white man has advanced westward, and dug deep into the soil, whilst forming railway
cuttings, digging wells, and other works, numerous interesting remains have been discovered--a
large number of fortified camps of vast extent, and even the foundations of cities, with their
streets and squares, have been brought to light. Idols, pitchers of clay, ornaments of copper,
circular medals, arrowheads, and even mirrors of isinglass, in great numbers, have been found
throughout the country.  Some of the articles of pottery are skilfully wrought, and polished,
glazed, and burned; inferior in no respects to those of Egypt and Babylon.

In Tennessee, an earthen pitcher, holding a gallon, was discovered on a rock twenty feet below
the surface.  It was surmounted by the figure of a female head covered with a conical cap.
The features greatly resembled those of Asiatics, and the ears, extending as low as the chin,
were of great size.  Near the Cumberland River an idol formed of clay was found about four
feet below the surface of the earth.  It is of curious construction, consisting of three hollow
heads joined together at the back by an inverted bell-shaped hollow stem.  This specimen also
has strongly-marked Asiatic features; the red and yellow colour with which it is ornamented
still retaining great brilliancy.  Another idol, formed of clay and gypsum, was discovered
near Nashville.  It represented a human being without arms.  The hair was plaited, and there
was a band round the head with a flattened lump or cake upon the summit. Numerous medals, also,
have been dug up, representing the sun, with its rays of light, together with utensils and
ornaments of copper, sometimes plated with silver; and a solid silver cup, with its surface
smooth and regular, and its interior finely gilt.

But besides these, and very many similar articles, throughout the whole country, and especially
towards the west, immense numbers of fortresses of great size have been discovered, with walls
of earth, some of them ten feet in height, and thirty in breadth.  There is a vast fortress
in Ohio, near the town of Newark.  It is situated on an extensive plain, at the junction of
two branches of the Muskingum.  At the western extremity of the work stood a circular fort,
containing twenty-two acres, on one side of which was an elevation thirty feet high, partly
of earth and partly of stone.  The circular fort was connected by walls of earth with an octagonal
fort containing forty acres, the walls of which were ten feet high.  At this end were eight
openings or gateways about fifteen feet in width, each protected by a mound of earth on the
inside.  From thence four parallel walls of earth proceeded to the basin of the harbour, others
extending several miles into the country, and others on the east joined to a square fort containing
twenty acres, not four miles distant.  From this latter fort parallel walls extended to the
harbour, and others to another circular fort one mile and a half distant, containing twenty-six
acres, and surrounded by an embankment from twenty-five to thirty feet high.  Further north
and east the elevated ground was protected by intrenchments.  Traces of other walls have been
found, apparently connecting these works with those thirty miles distant.  When we come to
reflect that there were many hundreds of similar forts, some of which were of equal size, and
others even of still greater magnitude, we cannot help believing that an enormous population,
considerably advanced in the arts of civilisation, must at one time have existed in the country,
over which for ages past the untutored savage has roamed in almost a state of nature.  And
now these wild tribes are rapidly disappearing before the advancement of a still greater multitude,
and a far more perfect civilisation.  Whether these ancient races were the ancestors of the
present Indians or not, it is difficult to determine, as are the causes of their disappearance.
It is possible that, retreating southward, they established the empires of Mexico and Peru,
or, overcome by more savage tribes, were ultimately exterminated.

PART ONE, CHAPTER TWO.

NORTH AMERICA CONSIDERED AS DIVIDED INTO FOUR ZONES, WITH THE VARIOUS OBJECTS OF INTEREST FOUND
IN EACH.

The North American continent may be divided into four zones or parallel regions, which, from
the difference in temperature which exists between them, present a great variety both in their
fauna and flora.

THE FIRST ZONE.

Commencing on the east, where the Greenland Sea washes the coast of Labrador, and Hudson Strait
leads to the intricate channels communicating with the Arctic Ocean, we have on the first-named
coast a low and level region, which rises inland to a considerable elevation, and then once
more sinks on the shores of Hudson Bay.  West of that bay there is a wide extent of low country,
intermixed with numerous lakes and marshes; and then along the Arctic shore is a wild, barren,
treeless district, rising at length into the mountainous region of the Arctic highlands.  Amid
them numerous rapid streams find their way into the Arctic Ocean.  Again they sink into the
basin of the Mackenzie River, which separates the in from the northern end of the Rocky Mountains.
Hence westward to the Pacific is a broad highland region, rising into the lofty range of the
Sea Alps.

THE SECOND ZONE.

THE FERTILE BELT OF RUPERT'S LAND.

The next Zone we will consider as commencing at the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.  Westward extends
an elevated region, rising in many places to a considerable height, and forming the water-shed
of the rivers which flow on the south side into the Saint Lawrence, and on the north into Hudson
Bay.  Proceeding up the Saint Lawrence, we arrive at a great lake district, which embraces
Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Superior, to the extreme west.  On the north-western
shores of that lake we find an elevated district with several small lakes and streams flowing
through valleys.  This is the water-shed also of two systems. The streams to the east, flowing
into Lake Superior, ultimately enter the Saint Lawrence; while those to the west make their
way into Lake Winnipeg, the waters of which, after flowing through a variety of channels, fall
into Hudson Bay.  To the west of this water-shed range the first lake we meet with is known
as the Lac des Milles Lacs.  Two rivers flow from it, expanding here and there into small lakes,
till another expanse of water is reached called Rainy Lake.  This in the same way communicates
by two streams with the still larger Lake of the Woods, the whole region on both sides being
thickly wooded.  From the Lake of the Woods flows the broad and rapid Winnipeg River, which
finally falls into Lake Winnipeg.  This large and long lake is connected with several others
of smaller size,--Lake Winnipegoos and Manitoba Lake to the west of it.  Into the southern
end of Lake Winnipeg flows the Red River, which rises far-away in the south in the United States,
taking an almost direct northerly course.  Towards the north, about twenty miles from the lake,
is situated the well-known Selkirk settlement.  To the west of the Red River commences a broad
belt of prairie land which extends here and there, rising into wooded heights and swelling
hills, with several large rivers flowing through it, to the very base of the Rocky Mountains.
As we advance westward we find it extending considerably to the north, where the large and
wide river Saskatchewan, rising in the Rocky Mountains, flows eastward into Lake Winnipeg.
Along the southern border of this region the Assiniboine River, also of considerable size,
flows into the Red River at Fort Garry, in the Selkirk settlement.  The prairie country indeed
extends further than the Red River, up to the Lake of the Woods.  The name of the Fertile Belt
has been properly given to it.  Commencing at the Lake of the Woods, it stretches westward
for 800 miles, and averages from 80 to upwards of 100 miles in width.  The area of this extraordinary
belt of rich soil and pasturage is about 40,000,000 of acres.  Including the adjacent fertile
districts, the area may be estimated at not less than 80,000 square miles, or considerably
more fertile land than the whole of Canada is supposed to contain.  It rises gradually towards
the west, so that the traveller is surprised to find how speedily he has gained the passes
which lead him over the Rocky Mountains into the territory of British Columbia on their western
side-- often indeed before he has realised the fact that he has crossed the boundary-line.
The Fertile Belt is considerably more to the south than the British Islands, though, as the
western hemisphere is subject to greater alternations of heat and cold than the eastern, there
is a vast difference in temperature between the summer and winter.  While in winter the whole
region is covered thickly with snow, in summer the heat is so great that Indian-corn and other
cereals, as well as all fruits, ripen with great rapidity.  The whole of this fertile region,
which now forms part of the Canadian Dominion, is about to be opened to colonisation; and through
it will be carried the great high road which will connect the British provinces on the Pacific
with those of the Atlantic.

ANIMAL LIFE ON THE FERTILE BELT.

Throughout this fine region range large herds of buffalo,--not extending their migrations,
however, beyond its northern boundary.  Here, too, are found two kind of small deer--the wapiti,
and the prong-horned antelope. Hares--called rabbits, however--exist in great numbers.  Porcupines
are frequently found.  The black bear occasionally comes out of the neighbouring forests, while
a great variety of birds frequent the lakes and streams, whose waters also swarm with numerous
fish.  The white fish found in the lakes are much esteemed, and weigh from two or three to
seven pounds.  There are fine pike also.  Sturgeon are caught in Lake Winnipeg and the Lower
Saskatchewan of the weight of 160 pounds.  Trout grow to a great size, and there are gold-eyes,
suckers, and cat-fish. Unattractive as are the names of the two last, the fish themselves are
excellent.  Among the birds, Professor Hind mentions prairie-hens, plovers, various ducks,
loons, and other aquatic birds, besides the partridge, quail, whip-poor-will, hairy woodpecker,
Canadian jay, blue jay, Indian hen, and woodcock.  In the mountain region are bighorns and
mountain goats; the grizzly bear often descends from his rugged heights into the plains, and
affords sport to the daring hunter.  The musk-rat and beaver inhabit the borders of the lakes.
The cariboo and moose frequent the Fertile Belt, though the musk-ox confines himself to the
more northern regions.  Wolves have been almost exterminated in the neighbourhood of the Red
River settlement.  The half-breeds and Indians possess peculiarly hardy and sagacious horses,
which are trained for hunting the buffalo.  Their dogs are large and powerful, and four of
them will draw a sleigh with one man over the snow at the rate of six miles an hour.  Herds
of cattle, as well as horses and hogs, are left out during the whole winter, it being necessary
only--should a thaw come on, succeeded by a frost--to supply them with food; otherwise, unable
to break through the coating of ice thus formed, they are liable to starve.

The farmers of the Red River settlement grow wheat, barley, oats, flax, hemp, hops, turnips,
and even tobacco, though Indian-corn grows best, and can always be relied on.  Wheat, however,
is the staple crop of Red River.  It is a splendid country for sheep pasturage, and did easier
means of transporting the wool exist, or could it be made into cloth or blankets in the settlement,
no doubt great attention would be given to the rearing of sheep.

THE THIRD ZONE--THE DISMAL SWAMP IN THE UNITED STATES.

Returning again to the east coast, about the latitude of Chesapeake Bay and Cape Hatteras,
we find a low level region known as the Atlantic plain, running parallel to the coast, on which
the long-leaved or peach-pines flourish.  This region is generally called the Pine Barrens.
Wild vines encircle the trees, and among them are seen the white berries of the mistletoe.
In winter these Pine Barrens retain much of their verdure, and constitute one of the marked
features of the country. Amid them are numerous swamps or morasses.  One of great size, extending
to not less than forty miles from north to south, and twenty-five in its greatest width, is
called the Great Dismal Swamp.

The soil, black as in a peat-bog, is covered with all kinds of aquatic trees and shrubs; yet,
strange to say, instead of being lower than the level of the surrounding country, it is in
the centre higher than towards its margin; indeed, from three sides of the swamp the waters
actually flow into different rivers at a considerable rate.  Probably the centre of the morass
is not less than twelve feet above the flat country around it.  Here and there some ridges
of dry land appear, like low islands, above the general surface.  On the west, however, the
ground is higher, and streams flow into the swamp, but they are free from sediment, and consequently
bring down no liquid mire to add to its substance.  The soil is formed completely of vegetable
matter, without any admixture of earthy particles.  In many even of the softest parts juniper-trees
stand firmly fixed by their long tap roots, affording a dark shade, beneath which numerous
ferns, reeds, and shrubs, together with a thick carpet of mosses, flourish, protected from
the rays of the sun.  Here and there also large cedars and other deciduous trees have grown
up.  The black soil formed beneath, increased by the rotting vegetation, is quite unlike the
peat of Europe, as the plants become so decayed as to leave no traces of organisation.  Frequently
the trees are overthrown, and numbers are found lying beneath the surface of the soil, where,
covered with water, they never decompose.  So completely preserved are they, that they are
frequently sawn up into planks.  In one part of the Dismal Swamp there is a lake seven miles
in length, and more than five wide, with a forest growing on its banks.  The water is transparent,
though tinged with a pale brown colour, and contains numerous fish.  The region is inhabited
by a number of bears, who climb the trees in search of acorns and gumberries, breaking off
the boughs of the oaks in order to obtain the acorns; these bears also kill hogs, and even
cows.  Occasionally a solitary wolf is seen prowling over the morass, and wild cats also clamber
amid its woods.  Even in summer, the air, instead of being hot and pestiferous, is especially
cool, the evaporation continually going on in the wet spongy soil generating an atmosphere
resembling that of a region considerably elevated above the level of the ocean.  Canals have
been cut through this swamp.  They are shaded by tall trees, their branches almost joining
across, and throwing a dark shade on the water, which itself looks almost black, and adds to
the gloom of the region.  Emerging from one of these avenues into the bright sunlit lake, the
aspect of the scenery is like that of some beautiful fairyland.

FOSSIL FOOTMARKS OF BIRDS.

A considerable way to the north of this region, on the banks of the Connecticut River, are
beds of red sandstone, on the different layers of which are found the footmarks of long extinct
birds.  The beds in some parts are twenty-five feet in thickness, composed of layer upon layer;
and on each of these layers, when horizontally split, are found imprinted these remarkable
footmarks.  This result could only have been produced by the subsidence of the ground, fresh
depositions of sand having taken place on the layers, on which the birds walked after the subsidence.
They must have been of various sizes,--some no larger than a small sand-piper, while others,
judging from their footprints, which measure no less than nineteen inches, must have been twice
the size of the modern African ostrich.  The distances between the smaller measure only about
three inches, but in the base of the largest, called the Ornithichnites Gigas, they are from
four to six feet apart.  In some places where the birds have congregated together none of the
steps can be distinctly traced, but at a short distance from this area the tracks become more
and more distinct.  Upwards of two thousand such footprints have been observed, made probably
by nearly thirty distinct species of birds, all indented on the upper surface of the strata,
and only exhibiting casts in relief on the under side of the beds which rested on such indented
surfaces.  In other places the marks of rain and hail which fell countless ages ago are clearly
visible.  Sir Charles Lyell perceived similar footprints in the red mud in the Bay of Fundy,
which had just been formed by sandpipers; and on examining an inferior layer of mud, formed
several tides before, and covered up by fresh sand, he discovered casts of impressions similar
to those made on the last-formed layer of mud.  Near the footsteps he observed the mark of
a single toe, occurring occasionally, and quite isolated from the rest.  It was suggested to
him that these marks were formed by waders, which, as they fly near the ground, often let one
leg hang down, so that the longest toe touches the surface of the mud occasionally, leaving
a single mark of this kind.  He brought away some slabs of the recently formed mud, in order
that naturalists who were sceptical as to the real origin of the ancient fossil ornithichnites
might compare the fossil products lately formed with those referable to the feathered bipeds
which preceded the era of the ichthyosaurus and iguanodon.

THE BIG-BONE LICK.

We will now cross the Alleghanies westward, where we shall find a thickly-wooded country. 
As we proceed onwards, entering Kentucky, we reach a spot of great geological interest, called
the Big-bone Lick.

These licks exist in various parts of the country.  They are marshy swamps in which saline
springs break out, and are frequented by buffalo, deer, and other wild animals, for the sake
of the salt with which in the summer they are incrusted, and which in winter is dissolved in
the mud. Wild beasts, as well as cattle, greedily devour this incrustation, and will burrow
into the clay impregnated with salt in order to lick the mud.  In the Big-Bone Lick of Kentucky
the bones of a vast number of mastodons and other extinct quadrupeds have been dug up.

This celebrated bog is situated in a nearly level plain, bounded by gentle slopes, which lead
up to wide-extended table-lands.  In the spots where the salt springs rise, the bog is so soft
that a man may force a pile into it many yards perpendicularly.  Some of these quaking bogs
are even now more than fifteen acres in extent, but were formerly much larger, before the surrounding
forest was partially cleared away.  Even at the present day cows, horses, and other quadrupeds
are occasionally lost here, as they venture on to the treacherous ground.  It may be easily
understood, therefore, how the vast mastodons, elephants, and other huge animals lost their
lives.  In their eagerness to drink the saline waters, or lick the salt, those in front, hurrying
forward, would have been pressed upon by those behind, and thus, before they were aware of
their danger, sank helplessly into the quagmire.  It is supposed that the bones of not less
than one hundred mastodons and twenty elephants have been dug up out of the bog, besides which
the bones of a stag, extinct horse, megalonyx, and bison, have been obtained.  Undoubtedly,
therefore, this plain has remained unchanged in all its principal features since the period
when these vast extinct quadrupeds inhabited the banks of the Ohio and its tributaries.  Here
and there the Big-bone Lick is covered with mud, washed over it by some unusual rising of the
Ohio River, which is known to swell sixty feet above its summer level.

Passing on through wide-spreading prairies, we cross the mighty stream of the Mississippi to
a slightly elevated district of broad savannahs, till we reach a treeless region bordering
the very foot of the Rocky Mountains.  Through this region numerous rivers pass on their way
to the Mississippi.  Leaving at length the great western plain, we begin to mount the slopes
of the Rocky Mountains, when we may gaze upwards at the lofty snow-covered peaks above our
heads.  Hence, crossing the mighty range in spite of grizzly bears and wilder Indians, we descend
towards the bank of the Rio Colorado, which falls into the Gulf of California, and thence over
a mountainous region, some of whose heights, as Mount Dana, reach an elevation of 13,000 feet,
and Mount Whitney, 15,000 feet.

THE FOURTH ZONE.

The southernmost of the four zones begins on the coast of Florida, passes for hundreds of miles
over a low or gently sloping country toward the great western plains which border the Rocky
Mountains into Texas; its southern boundary being the Gulf of Mexico.  Through this region
flow numerous rivers, the queen of which is the Mississippi.  The western portion is often
wild and barren in the extreme, inhabited only by bands of wild and savage Indians.  The Rocky
Mountains being passed, there is a lofty table-land, and then rise the Sierras de los Nimbres
and Madre; beyond which, bordering the Gulf of California, is the wild, grandly picturesque
province of Sonora, with its gigantic trees and stalactite caves.

PART ONE, CHAPTER THREE.

THE PRAIRIES, PLAINS OF THE WEST, AND PASSES OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.

To obtain, however, a still more correct notion of the appearance of the continent, we must
take another glance over it.  We shall discover, to the north, and throughout the eastern portion
where civilised man has not been at work dealing away the trees, a densely-wooded region. Proceeding
westward, as the valley of the Mississippi is approached the underwood disappears, and oak
openings predominate.  These Oak Openings, as they are called, are groves of oak and other
forest-trees which are not connected, but are scattered over the surface at a considerable
distance from one another, without any low shrub or underbrush between them.

THE PRAIRIES.

Thus, gradually, we are entering the prairie country, which extends as far west as the Grand
Coteau of the Missouri.  This prairie region is covered with a rich growth of grass; the soil
is extremely fertile, and capable of producing a variety of cereals.  Over the greater portion
of the prairie country, indeed, forests of aspens would grow, did not annual fires in most
parts arrest their progress.  Here and there numbers have sprung up.  The true prairie region
in the United States extends over the eastern part of Ohio, Indiana, the southern portion of
Michigan, the southern part of Wisconsin, nearly the whole of the states of Illinois and Iowa,
and the northern portion of Missouri, gradually passing--in the territories of Kansas and Nebraska--into
that arid and desert region known as The Plains, which lie at the base of the Rocky Mountains.

The Grand Coteau de Missouri forms a natural boundary to these arid plains.  This vast table-land
rises to the height of from 400 to 800 feet above the Missouri.  Vegetation is very scanty;
the Indian turnip, however, is common, as is also a species of cactus.  No tree or shrub is
seen; and only in the bottoms or in marshes is a rank herbage found. Across these desert regions
the trails of the emigrant bands passing to the Far West have often been marked: first, in
the east, by furniture and goods abandoned; further west, by the waggons and carts of the ill-starred
travellers; then by the bones of oxen and horses bleaching on the plain; and, finally, by the
graves, and sometimes the unburied bodies, of the emigrants themselves, the survivors having
been compelled to push onwards with the remnant of their cattle to a more fertile region, where
provender and water could be procured to restore their well-nigh exhausted strength.  Oftentimes
they have been attacked by bands of mounted Indians, whose war-whoop has startled them from
their slumbers at night; and they have been compelled to fight their way onwards, day after
day assailed by their savage and persevering foes.

Civilised man is, however, triumphant at last, and the steam-engine, on its iron path, now
traverses that wild region from east to west at rapid speed; and the red men, who claim to
be lords of the soil, have been driven back into the more remote wilderness, or compelled to
succumb to the superior power of the invader, in many instances being utterly exterminated.
Still, north and south of that iron line the country resembles a desert; and the wild Indian
roams as of yore, like the Arab of the East--his hand against every man, and every man's hand
against him.

Among the dangers to which the traveller across the prairie is exposed, the most fearful is
that of fire.  The sky is bright overhead; the tall grass, which has already assumed a yellow
tinge from the heat of summer, waves round him, affording abundant pasture to his steed.  Suddenly
his guides rise in their stirrups and look anxiously towards the horizon. He sees, perhaps,
a white column of smoke rising in the clear air.  It is so far-off that it seems it can but
little concern them.  The guides, however, think differently, and after a moment's consultation
point eagerly in the direction of some broad river, whose waters flow towards the Mississippi.
"Onward! onward!" is the cry.  They put spurs to their horses' flanks, and gallop for their
lives.  Every instant the column of smoke increases in width, till it extends directly across
the horizon. It grows denser and denser.  Now above the tall grass flashes of bright light
can be seen.  The traveller almost fancies he can hear the crackling of the flames as they
seize all combustible substances in their course.  Now they surround a grove of aspens, and
the fierce fire blazes up more brightly than ever towards the sky, over which hangs a dark
canopy of smoke.  Suddenly a distant tramp of feet is heard.  The very ground trembles.  A
dark mass approaches--a phalanx of horns and streaming manes.  It is a herd of buffaloes, turned
by the fire purposely ignited by the Indians.  The guides urge the travellers to increase their
speed; for if overtaken by the maddened animals, they will be struck down and trampled to death.
Happily they escape the surging herd which comes sweeping onward--thousands of dark forms pressed
together, utterly regardless of the human beings who have so narrowly escaped them.  The travellers
gallop on till their eyes are gladdened by the sight of the flowing waters of a river.  They
rush down the bank.  Perchance the stream is too rapid or too deep to be forded. At the water's
edge they at length dismount, when the Indians, drawing forth flint and steel, set fire to
the grass on the bank.  The smoke well-nigh stifles them, but the flames pass on, clearing
an open space; and now, crouching down to the water's edge, they see the fearful conflagration
rapidly approaching.  The fire they have created meets the flames which have been raging far
and wide across the region.  And now the wind carries the smoke in dense masses over their
heads; but their lives are saved--and at length they may venture to ride along the banks, over
the still smouldering embers, till a ford is reached, and they may cross the river to where
the grass still flourishes in rich luxuriance.

While, on one side of the stream, charred trees are seen rising out of the blackened ground,
on the other all is green and smiling.  These fearful prairie fires, by which thousands of
acres of grass and numberless forests have been destroyed, are almost always caused by the
thoughtless Indians, either for the sake of turning the herds of buffaloes towards the direction
they desire them to take, or else for signals made as a sign to distant allies.  Sometimes
travellers have carelessly left a camp-fire still burning, when the wind has carried the blazing
embers to some portion of the surrounding dry herbage, and a fearful conflagration has been
the result.

Mr Paul Kane, the Canadian artist and traveller, mentions one which he witnessed from Fort
Edmonton.  The wind was blowing a perfect hurricane when the conflagration was seen sweeping
over the prairie, across which they had passed but a few hours before.  The night was intensely
dark, adding effect to the brilliancy of the flames, and making the scene look truly terrific.
So fiercely did the flames rage, that at one time it was feared the fire would cross the river
to the side on which the fort is situated, in which case it and all within must have been destroyed.
The inmates also had had many apprehensions for the safety of one of their party, from whom,
with his Indians, Mr Kane had parted some time before, and who had not yet arrived.  For three
days they were uncertain of his fate, when at length their anxiety was relieved by his appearance.
He had noticed the fire at a long distance, and had immediately started for the nearest bend
in the river.  This, by great exertion, he had reached in time to escape the flames, and had
succeeded in crossing.

THE BARREN PLAINS IN THE FAR WEST.

On the prairies of the east the eye ranges over a wide expanse of waving grass, everywhere
like the sea.  As, crossing the plains, we proceed west towards the vast range of the Rocky
Mountains, the country gives evidence of the violent and irregular disturbances to which it
has been subjected.  Wild rocky ridges crop out from the sterile plains of sand; and for hundreds
of miles around the country is desert, dry, and barren. Even the vegetation, such as it is,
is of the same unattractive character.  The ground here and there is covered with patches of
the grey gramma grass, growing in little cork-screw curls; and there is a small furzy plant,
the under sides of the leaves of which are covered with a white down, while occasionally small
orange-coloured flowers are seen struggling into existence.

There are insects, however.  Ants swarm in all directions, building cones a foot in height.
Grasshoppers in myriads, with red wings and legs, fly through the air--the only bright objects
in the landscape. Sometimes the reddish-brown cricket is seen.  Even the Platte River, which
flows through this region, partakes of its nature.  It seems to consist of a saturated solution
of sand: when a handful is taken up, a grey mud of silex remains in the palm.  Dry as this
gramma grass appears, it possesses nutritive qualities, as the animals which feed on it abundantly
prove.

Storms break over these plains with tremendous fury: the thunder roars, the lightning which
flashes from the clouds illumines earth and sky with a brightness surpassing the cloudless
noon.  Then again utter darkness covers the earth, when suddenly a column of light appears,
like the trunk of some tall pine, as the electric fluid passes from the upper to the lower
regions of the world.  The next instant its blazing summit breaks into splinters on every side.
Occasionally fearful hail-storms sweep over the plains; and at other times the air from the
south comes heated, as from a furnace, drying up all moisture from the skin, and parching the
traveller's tongue with thirst.

Here and there are scattered pools of water containing large quantities of salts, soda, and
potash, from drinking which numbers of cattle perish.  The track of emigrants is strewn for
many miles with bleaching heads, whole skeletons, and putrefying carcasses;--the result of
the malady thus produced, in addition to heat and overdriving.  Even the traveller suffers
greatly, feeling as if he had swallowed a quantity of raw soda.

Yet often in this generally desert region, where the rivers wind their way through the plain,
or wide pools of pure water mirror the blue sky, scenes of great beauty are presented.  Nothing
can surpass the rosy hues which tinge the heavens at sunrise.  Here game of all sorts is found.
The lakes swarm with mallards, ducks, and a variety of teal.  Herds of antelopes cross the
plain in all directions, and vast herds of buffalo darken the horizon as they sweep by in their
migrations.

THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.

At length a blue range, which might be taken for a rising vapour, appears in the western horizon.
It is the first sight the traveller obtains of the long-looked-for Rocky Mountains; yet he
has many a weary league to pass before he is among them, and dangers not a few before he can
descend their western slopes.  At length he finds himself amid masses of dark brown rocks,
not a patch of green appearing; mountain heights rising westward, one beyond the other; and
far-away, where he might suppose the plains were again to be found, still there rises before
him a region of everlasting snow.  For many days he may go on, now climbing, now descending,
now flanking piles of rocks, and yet not till fully six days are passed is he able to say that
he has crossed that mountain range.  Indeed, the term "range" scarcely describes the system
of the Rocky Mountains.  It is, in fact, a chain, composed of numerous links, with vast plains
rising amid them.

PARKS.

These ranges in several places thin out, as it were, leaving a large tract of level country
completely embosomed in snowy ridges in the very heart of the system.  These plains are known
as "parks."  They are found throughout the range.  Several of them are of vast extent,--the
four principal ones forming the series called, in their order, "North," "Middle", "South,"
and "Saint Louis" Parks.  Portions of them, thoroughly irrigated, remain beautifully green
throughout the year, and herbage over the whole region is abundant.  Sheltered from the blasts
to which the lower plains are exposed, these parks enjoy an equable climate; and old hunters,
who have camped in them for many seasons, describe life there as an earthly paradise.  They
abound in animals of all sorts.  Elk, deer, and antelope feed on their rich grasses.  Hither
also the puma follows its prey, and there are several other creatures of the feline tribe.
Bears, wolves, and foxes likewise range across them. In some of them herds of buffalo pass
their lives; for, unlike their brethren of the plain, they are not migratory.  It is doubtful
whether or not they are of the same species, but they are said to be larger and fiercer.

The appropriate designation of the Rocky Mountain-system is that of a chain.  On crossing one
of its basins or plateaux, the traveller finds himself within a link such as has just been
described.  A break in one of these links is called a "pass," or "canon."  As he passes through
this break he enters another link, belonging to another parallel either of a higher or lower
series.  In some of the minor plateaux between the snowy ridges no vegetation appears.  Granite
and sandstone rocks outcrop even in the general sandy level, rising bare and perpendicularly
from 50 to 300 feet; as a late traveller describes it, "looking like a mere clean skeleton
of the world."  Nothing is visible but pure rock on every side.  Vast stones lie heaped up
into pyramids, as if they had been rent from the sky.  Cubical masses, each covering an acre
of surface, and reaching to a perpendicular height of thirty or forty feet, suggest the buttresses
of some gigantic palace, whose superstructure has crumbled away with the race of its Titanic
builders.  It is these regions especially which have given the mighty range the appropriate
name of the Rocky Mountains.

THE SAGE COCK.

In some spots, the limitless wastes are covered by a scrubby plant known as mountain sage.
It rises from a tough gnarled root in a number of spiral shoots, which finally form a single
trunk, varying in circumference from six inches to two feet.  The leaves are grey, with a strong
offensive smell resembling true sage.  In other places there appear mixed with it the equally
scrubby but somewhat greener grease-wood--the two resinous shrubs affording the only fuel on
which the emigrant can rely while following the Rocky Mountain trail.

These sage regions are the habitation of a magnificent bird--the Sage Cock.  He may well be
called the King of the grouse tribe.  When stalking erect through the sage, he looks as large
as a good-sized wild turkey--his average length being, indeed, about thirty-two inches, and
that of the hen two feet.  They differ somewhat, according to the season of the year.  The
prevailing colour is that of a yellowish-brown or warm grey, mottled with darker brown, shading
from cinnamon to jet-black. The dark spots are laid on in a longitudinal series of crescents.
The under parts are a light grey, sometimes almost pure white, barred with streaks of brown,
or pied with black patches.  In the elegance of his figure and fineness of his outlines he
vies with the golden pheasant. His tail differs from that of the grouse family in general by
coming to a point instead of opening like a fan.  On each side of his neck he has a bare orange-coloured
spot, and near it a downy epaulet.  His call is a rapid "Cut, cut, cut!" followed by a hollow
blowing sound.  He has the partridge's habit of drumming with his wings, while the hen-bird
knows the trick of misleading the enemy from her young brood.  He seldom rises from the ground,
his occasional flights being low, short, and laboured. He runs with great speed, and in his
favourite habitat dodges and skulks with rapidity, favoured by the resemblance of his colour
to the natural tints of the scrub.  Though sometimes called the Cock of the Plains, he never
descends into the plains, being always found on the higher mountain regions.

When the snow begins to melt, the sage hen builds in the bush a nest of sticks and reeds artistically
matted together, and lays from a dozen to twenty eggs, rather larger than those of the domestic
fowl, of a tawny colour, irregularly marked with chocolate blotches on the larger end. When
a brood is strong enough to travel, the parents lead their young into general society.  They
are excessively tame, or bold.  Often they may be seen strutting between the gnarled trunk
and ashen masses of foliage peculiar to the sage scrub, and paying no more attention to the
traveller than would a barnyard drove of turkeys; the cocks now and then stopping to play the
dandy before their more Quakerly little hens, inflating the little yellow pouches of skin on
either side of their necks, till they globe out like the pouches of a pigeon.

WINTER SCENE AMONG THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.

Descending the precipitous slopes of the Rocky Mountains on the west, we enter on a vast plain
no less than 2000 miles in length, though comparatively narrow--the great basin of California
and Oregon.  Its greatest width, from the Sierra Nevada to the Rocky Mountains, is nearly 600
miles, but is generally much less.  The largest lake found on it is 4200 feet above the level
of the sea, and is connected with the Salt Lake of Utah.  The mean elevation of the plain is
about 6000 feet above the sea.  A mountain-chain runs across it, and through it flows the large
Colorado River, amidst gorges of the most picturesque magnificence.

If the scenes we have described are stern and forbidding in summer, how much more so are they
in winter, when icy blasts blow through the canons, and masses of snow cover the ground.  From
one of the outer spurs on the east, let us take a glance over the region.  Behind us rises
the chain of the Rocky Mountains, the whole intermediate country, as well as the mountains
themselves, except where the precipitous rocks forbid it, being covered thickly with snow.
Rugged peaks and ridges, snow-clad and covered with pines, and deep gorges filled with broken
rocks, everywhere meet the eye.  To the east, the mountains gradually smooth away into high
spurs and broken ground, till they join the wide-spreading plains, generally stretching far
as the eye can reach, and hundreds of miles beyond--a sea of barrenness, vast and dismal. 
A hurricane blows clouds of white snowy dust across the desert, resembling the smoke of bonfires,
roaring and raving through the pines on the mountain-top, filling the air with snow and broken
branches, and piling it in huge drifts against the trees.

The perfect solitude of this vast wilderness is appalling.  From our lofty post on the mountain-top,
we obtain a view over the rugged and chaotic masses of the stupendous chain, and the vast deserts
which stretch away far from its eastern base; while on all sides are broken ridges and chasms
and ravines, with masses of piled-up rocks and uprooted trees, with clouds of drifting snow
flying through the air, and the hurricane's roar battling through the forest at our feet adding
to the wildness of the scene, which is unrelieved by the slightest vestige of animal or human life.

THE HORNED FROG.

We must now pass in review some of the numerous animals which inhabit these regions.  In some
of the mountain plateaux, among the cactuses and sand-heaps, we find that singularly-made animal
known vulgarly as the Texan toad or horned frog--a name which in no way properly belongs to
him, as he is more nearly related to the lizards and salamanders.  He lives as contentedly
on the hot baked prairies of Texas, as amongst their snow-surrounded heights; though, from
his appearance, we should expect to see him basking under a semi-tropical sun, rather than
in this region.  Yet here he lives, and must often have to spend much of his time under the
snow.  These toads, as the creatures are called, have brown backs, white bellies, small twinkling
black eyes, set in almond-shaped slits, enclosed by two dark marks of the same shape.  This
has the effect of enlarging the eye, and giving it a soft look like that of the antelope. 
The two retro-curved horns, which rise out of bony sockets above the eyes, add still more to
this odd resemblance.

The skin of the back and the long stiff tail, instead of being warted like the true toad's
upper surface, is set with thorny excrescences. That of the lower surface is a dry tough tissue,
almost horny.  Whether this armour is given him to defend himself from the rattlesnake, it
is difficult to say.  The creature itself is of a peaceable disposition; and so unwilling is
he to fight, that he will allow himself to be taken in the hand, and if placed on it directly
after capture, he will not attempt to get away.  It is very easy to catch him in the first
place, for his movements over the loose sand of his haunts are scarcely faster than those of
a land tortoise.

The trappers and other scattered inhabitants of this region describe a fish with hands as frequenting
the brooks and pools.  Though there are, no doubt, some curious fish, it is questionable how
far these creatures possess the members ascribed to them.

FUR-TRAPPERS OF THE FAR WEST.

The fur-trapper of America is the chief pioneer of the Far West.  His life spent in the remote
wilderness, with no other companion than Nature herself, his character assumes a mixture of
simplicity and ferocity.  He knows no wants beyond the means of procuring sufficient food and
clothing.  All the instincts of primitive man are constantly kept alive. Exposed to dangers
of all sorts, he becomes callous to them, and is as ready to destroy human as well as animal
life as he is to expose his own.  He cares nothing for laws, human or divine.  Strong, active,
hardy, and daring, he depends on his instinct for the support of life.

The independent trapper possesses traps and animals of his own, ranges wherever he lists through
the country, and disposes of his peltries to the highest bidder.  There are others employed
by the fur companies, who supply them with traps and animals, and pay a certain price for the
furs they bring.

The independent trapper equips himself with a horse and two or three mules--the one for the
saddle, the others for his packs--and a certain number of traps, which he carries in a leather
bag, with ammunition, a few pounds of tobacco, and dressed deerskins for his mocassins and
repairing his garments.  His costume is a hunting-shirt of dressed buckskin, ornamented with
long fringes; pantaloons of the same material, decorated with porcupine quills and long fringes
down the outside of the leg.  He has mocassins on his feet, and a flexible felt hat on his
head. Over his left shoulder and under his right arm hang his powder-horn and bullet-pouch,
with flint, steel, and other articles, in a bag.  A belt round the waist secures a large knife
in a sheath of buffalo hide to a steel chain, as also a case of buckskin, containing a whetstone.
In his belt is also stuck a tomahawk, a pipe-holder hangs round his neck, and a long heavy
rifle is slung over his shoulder.

Arrived on the hunting-ground, as soon as the ice has broken up he follows the creeks and streams,
keeping a lookout for the signs of beavers.  As soon as he discovers one, he sets his trap,
secured to a chain fastened to a stake or tree, baiting it with the tempting castoreum.  He
is ever on the watch for the neighbourhood of Indians, who try to outwit him, though generally
in vain, to steal his traps and beavers.  His eye surveys the surrounding country, and instantly
detects any sign of his foes.  A leaf turned down, the slightly pressed grass, the uneasiness
of the wild animals, the flight of birds, all tell him that other human beings are in the neighbourhood.
Here, after the hunt, from all quarters the hardy trappers bring in their packs of beaver to
meet the purchasers, sometimes to the value of a thousand dollars each.  The traders sell their
goods at enormous profits; and the thoughtless trapper, indulging in the fire-water from which
he has long abstained, is too often induced to gamble away the gold for which he has risked
life and gone through so many hardships. When all is gone, he gets credit for another equipment,
and sets off alone, often to return and repeat the same process, although the profits of one
or two successful hunts would enable him to stock a farm and live among civilised men.

Wonders of Nature.--Mammoth Cave of Kentucky.

There are many other wonders of Nature in different parts of North America well worthy of more
notice than we can give them.  The most remarkable, perhaps, is the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky.
The entrance to it is situated near Green River, midway between Louisville and Nashville.

A lonely road leads to the entrance, from which, as we approach it in summer, we find a peculiarly
chilly air issue forth.  The sombre gloom of the entrance does not prepare us for the enormous
hall within; long avenues leading into vast chambers, the smaller, thirty feet in height, at
least, with an area of half an acre, and, as we get lower and lower, increasing in height.
Upwards of eighteen miles of the cavern have been explored, and it may possibly be of still
greater extent.  To give an idea of the height of one of the chambers, we may add that the
rocks from above have fallen, and a hill has been formed one hundred feet in elevation.  Many
of the halls are ornamented with the most magnificent stalactites.  One of them is appropriately
called Martha's Vineyard, in consequence of having its tops and sides covered with stalactites
which resemble bunches of grapes.

Several streams pass through the cavern, down the sides of which rush numerous cataracts. 
Some of these streams, which are of considerable depth and width, are inhabited by shoals of
eyeless fish, the organs of sight being superfluous in a region doomed to eternal night.  The
atmosphere of this huge cave is peculiarly dry, and is supposed to be extremely serviceable
to persons afflicted with pulmonary complaints.

To visit any considerable portion of the cavern would occupy us at least a couple of days.
It is calculated there are no less than two hundred and twenty-six avenues, forty-seven domes,
numerous rivers, eight cataracts, and twenty-three pits,--many of which are grand in the extreme.
Some of the rivers are navigated by boats, and, as may be supposed, they have obtained appropriate
names.  Here we find the Dead Sea and the River Styx.  One of the streams disappears beneath
the ground, and then rises again in another portion of the cavern.  But after all, as naturalists,
the little eyeless fish should chiefly claim our attention.

OIL SPRINGS.

As coal was stored up for the use of man, formed in ages past from the giant vegetation which
then covered the face of the earth, so the Creator has caused to be deposited in subterranean
caverns large quantities of valuable oil, which not only serves man for light, but is useful
to him for many other purposes.

Whether that oil was produced from animal or vegetable substances, appears, even now, a matter
of dispute.  Some naturalists suppose that vast numbers of oil-giving creatures had been assembled
in the districts in which these oil wells are now found, and the oil was pressed out of them
by a superincumbent weight of rock.  Others assert that the same result might be produced from
a vast mass of oil-giving vegetation having been crushed by a similar process.  Be that as
it may, in several parts of the States, as well as in Canada, enormous pits exist full of this
curious oil.  It is obtained by boring in the ground in those spots where the oil is likely
to be found.  Often, however, the speculator, after spending time and capital in the experiment,
finds that no oil appears at his call.

In some spots, where it was first discovered, after the boring was completed, some hundreds
of tons flowed up so rapidly, that it was difficult to find casks sufficient to preserve the
produce.  The whole region round is impregnated with the odour of the oil.  Long teams of waggons
come laden with casks of oil on the roads approaching the wells. Sheds for repairing the casks,
and storing the oil, are ranged around. Every one gives indubitable signs by their appearance
of their occupation, while rock-oil, as it is called, is the only subject of conversation in
the neighbourhood.

MAMMOTH TREES AND CAVERNS OF CALAVERAS.

Gigantic as are the trees found in many of the eastern forests of America, they are far surpassed
by groves of pines discovered a few years back in the southern parts of California.  They are
found in small groves together--in some places only three or four of the more gigantic in size;
in others, as many as thirty or forty, one vying with the other in height and girth.  In one
grove, upwards of one hundred trees were found, of great size, twenty of which were about seventy-five
feet in circumference.  One of these trees, of greater size than its companions, was sacrilegiously
cut down.  Its height was 302 feet, and its circumference, at the ground, 96 feet.  As it was
impossible to cut it down, it was bored off with pump-augers.  This work employed five men
for twenty-two days.  Even, after the stem was fairly severed from the stump, the uprightness
of the tree and breadth of its base sustained it in its position, and two days were employed
in inserting wedges and driving them in; but at length the noble monarch of the forest was
forced to tremble, and then to fall, after braving the battle and the breeze for nearly three
thousand winters.

Many of the trees have received appropriate names.  One has fallen, and has been hollowed out
by fire.  Through it a person can ride on horseback for sixty feet.  Its estimated height,
when standing, was 330 feet, and its circumference, 97 feet.  Another of these giants is known
as Hercules.  It is 320 feet high, and 95 feet in circumference. Perhaps the most beautiful
group is that of three trees known as the Three Graces.  Each of them measures 92 feet in circumference
at the base; and in height they are nearly equal, measuring 295 feet.  Time was when, perhaps,
the whole forest consisted of trees of the same size; but many have been destroyed by fire,
and the time may come when none of those now standing will remain.  The name of Wellingtonia
has been given to the species.

In the same region are numerous magnificent stalactite caverns, which equal in beauty, if not
in size, those of the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky.

There are several waterfalls, unsurpassed for picturesque beauty.

Had we time, we might pay a visit also to the gold-mines of California, and observe the way
they are worked; but we should be prevented from giving that attention to the animal creation
which is our present object.

PART ONE, CHAPTER FOUR.

GENERAL SURVEY OF THE ZOOLOGY OF NORTH AMERICA.

Having thus obtained a bird's-eye view of the physical features of North America, we will take
a rapid survey of its zoology before we more minutely inspect the individuals of which it consists.

In a region of extent so vast as the continent of America, reaching from the Arctic Circle
at one end far-away towards the Antarctic Ocean at the other--with dense forests, under a tropical
sun, in some parts; open plains, lofty mountains, or a network of rivers and streams, vast
lakes and marshes, in others--we shall find all varieties of form in the animal kingdom.  This
gives to its study an especial interest.  While the larger number of its members are especially
local, confined in narrow spaces between two streams, others range beyond 50 degrees and 60
degrees of latitude.  The puma wanders across the plains of Patagonia, and ravages the flocks
of the settlers on the western prairies of the United States.  The reindeer feeds on the moss-covered
moors of the Arctic islands, and is chased by the hunters far south among the defiles of the
Rocky Mountains.  Vast herds of bison darken the plains of New Mexico, and reach the upper
waters of the Saskatchewan.  The same wild fowl which hatch their young among the ice-surrounded
cliffs of Northern Greenland are found sporting in the lakes of Central America; while some
of the smallest of the feathered tribes, the gem-like humming-birds, have been seen flitting
through the damp mists of Tierra del Fuego, sipping the sweets of Alpine flowers high up amid
lofty peaks of the Andes, and appearing on the hill-sides in sight of Lake Winnipeg, on the
north of Rupert's Land.

However, as we proceed in our survey, we shall be able to note such, and many other interesting
facts connected with the zoology of the districts we visit.

We shall find in the northern portion of the continent, extending nearly as far south as the
sixtieth degree of latitude, and even beyond that parallel, several animals which are identical
with those inhabiting the same latitudes in Europe and Asia.  The Polar or white bear, the
sovereign of the Arctic world, ranges entirely round the Circle; and makes his way across the
icy seas over the rugged snow-clothed rocks, so that he belongs as much to Europe and Asia
as to America.  The cunning wolverene, the ermine, the pine-marten, the Arctic fox and common
weasel, also inhabit the same latitudes of the three continents.  Among the herbivorous quadrupeds,
there are several which have made their way across the frozen ocean.  The American elk, though
called the moose, is identical with the same animal found in Asia and Europe; so is the reindeer,
known here as the cariboo.  Both, indeed, are Arctic animals, though they migrate to southern
latitudes when the severer cold and depth of snow prevents them from obtaining the moss and
lichens on which they feed.  The little Polar hare ranges round the Arctic Circle; but there
is one animal, the musk-ox, which, being truly an Arctic quadruped, is unknown either in Asia
or Europe, and therefore belongs exclusively to America.

Of the feathered tribes, the larger number of individuals, as might be supposed, are common
to the northern portions of the three continents. Among these are the golden eagle, the white-headed
or sea eagle, the osprey, the peregrine falcon, the gyrfalcon, the merlin goshawk, the common
buzzard, rough-legged buzzard, hen-harrier, long-eared owl, short-eared owl, great snowy owl,
and Tengmalm's owl.  Nearly all the ducks and other swimming families, as might be expected,
are also identical, as they can make their way with ease round the Circle, and find the same
food and conditions of life.  The waders, however, are generally distinct from those of Europe,
as are the grouse inhabiting the same parallels of latitude.  Only one or two have been found
in Europe, as well as in America.

We must now take a glance at the animals which are distinctly American. In the first place,
there are three bears--the savage grizzly of the Rocky Mountains; the cunning black bear; and
the bear of the Barren Grounds.  The beaver might take the first rank among American animals,
for his sagacity, if not for his size.  Then comes the Canada otter; the vison or minx; the
clever little tree-loving raccoon; the American badger, differing from his European relative;
and the pekan.  There are several varieties of wolves, differing in size and somewhat in habits,
but all equally voracious.  There are several species of foxes, and no less than thirty of
lemmings, marmots, and squirrels, all of which are to be found within the more northern latitudes
of the New World.  There are three hares--known as the American, the prairie, and the little
chief hares--which range over the northern continent.  Of the large animals we have the wapiti,
a species of deer; two species of the black-tailed deer; a long-tailed deer; and the prong-horned
antelope; also the wild goat; the bighorn sheep of the Rocky Mountains; and last, though not
least, the American bison, familiarly known as the buffalo-- the inhabitant of the wide-spreading
plains and prairies extending from the Arctic Circle to Mexico.

Among the land birds, especially the birds of prey, there are several which are spread over
the greater part of the northern continent, some indeed being found also in great numbers in
South America.  These are the turkey vulture, the black vulture, the little rusty-crowned falcon,
the pigeon hawk, slate-coloured hawk, red-tailed buzzard, American horned owl, little American
owl, and five other species of falcons.  The perchers are less widely distributed.

There are, however, numerous families of insectivorous birds peculiar to America, which either
permanently inhabit the more genial portions of the continent, or pay annual visits to those
regions where the richest fruits abound and insect life prevails, affording them an abundant
banquet.  These migrating birds, as the winter draws on, take their departure southward to
the warmer climate of Mexico, where they find abundance of food.  As the summer returns, and
the fruits of the orchard, the corn of the field, and wild berries ripen, and insects increase
in numbers, vast flocks of warblers, woodpeckers, maize-birds, fly-catchers, thrushes, hang-nests,
pigeons, blue-birds, and others return from their southern pilgrimage, to feed on the minute
creatures which now people the plains, the hill-sides and forests, and on the abundant productions
of the earth, enlivening the forests with their varied plumage, and delighting man by their
melodious notes.

The number of gallinaceous birds is extremely limited.  America can, however, boast of its
native wild turkey--one of the most magnificent game-birds in existence.  There is also the
pinnated or Cupid Grouse. The Barren Grounds of Kentucky, and a few other districts, are inhabited
by the ruffle grouse, which is also often called the pheasant.  It ranges to a considerable
distance northward, and Dr Richardson found it even on the borders of the Polar regions.  There
is likewise a small-sized partridge, which is improperly called the quail.

With the exception of the golden plover, few of the wading birds resemble those of Europe.
The snipe, the woodcock, the curlew, most of the sandpipers, together with the coot and the
water-hen, are distinct from those of Europe, and are not only peculiar to America, but few
of them have been found to the south of the line.  One of the most magnificent birds is the
American flamingo, which is of a more beautiful and intense scarlet than that of Europe, and
fully as tall; another bird, the wood-ibis, has the same form as the glossy ibis of southern
Europe.  In Carolina and Florida is found the magnificent scarlet ibis, but it seldom makes
its way to the northern parts of the Union.  There are several large and beautiful species
of herons.  Although most of the duck tribe range throughout the continent, there are some--such
as the summer or tree duck of South Carolina--which range from the States to the warmer shores
of the southern provinces, while the celebrated canvas-back duck, so highly prized at table,
is found chiefly in the temperate parts of the continent.  The rest of the duck tribe inhabit
the northern regions, only quitting them for the United States during the severity of winter.

PART ONE, CHAPTER FIVE.

DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS ANIMALS--RUMINANTS.

THE MOOSE, OR ELK.

We shall not introduce the animals we are about to inspect according to a systematic classification,
but bring them forward as they appear to the eye of the traveller or sportsman, giving the
largest and the most important the first place.  Our object is rather to view the characteristic
animals of each region we visit than to attempt a scientific examination of the whole animated
kingdom of the world--a task which must be left to those who have far more time at their disposal
than we possess.

We will begin, therefore, with the animals belonging to the ruminantia-- the eighth in natural
order; taking next the carnivora--the fifth; and the smaller rodentia--the sixth; while the
birds and reptiles will follow in due course.  Among these, however, we shall select only the
most notable and curious; for although North America does not teem with animal life in the
same degree as the southern half of the continent, were we to attempt to introduce all those
existing in it we could give but a meagre account of each.

Without further preface, therefore, we will commence our survey with the elk.

The monarch of the American pine-forests--the superb moose or elk-- ranges from the mouth of
the Mackenzie River to the shores of the Atlantic, at the eastern extremity of Nova Scotia,
and passing the great lake region, is found even as far as the State of New York.  Observe
him as he stands with huge palmated horns ready for action, his vast nostrils snuffing up the
scent coming from afar; his eyes dilated, and ears moving, watching for a foe; his bristly
mane erect; his large body supported on his somewhat thick but agile limbs, standing fully
six feet six inches in height at the shoulder, above which rise the head and antlers.  The
creature's muzzle is very broad, protruding, and covered with hair, except a small moist, naked
spot in front of the nostrils. He has a short, thick neck, the hair thick and brittle.  The
throat is somewhat maned in both sexes.  So large is the cavity of the nose, that a man may
thrust his arm right into it.  The inter-maxillaries are very long, and the nasals short. 
He differs from the European elk only by having much darker hair,--the coat of the male, when
in its prime, at the close of the summer, being completely black.  Under the throat the males
have a fleshy appendage termed the bell, from which grow long black hairs.  The bristles on
his thick muzzle are of a lighter colour than those of the coat, being somewhat of a reddish
hue.  The neck and shoulders are covered with very fine soft wool, curiously interwoven with
the hair.  Out of this the Indians manufacture soft, warm gloves. The moose hair is very brittle
and inelastic.  It is dyed by the Indians, and employed for ornamenting numerous articles of
birch-bark. The moose is of cautious and retiring habits, generally taking up his abode amid
the mossy swamps found round the margins of the lakes, and which occupy the low ground in every
direction.  Here the cinnamon fern grows luxuriantly, while a few swamp maple saplings and
mountain ash trees occur at intervals, and afford sufficient food to the moose.

It is to these regions the bull retires with his consort, and remains for weeks together, claiming
to be the monarch of the swamp; and should he hear the approach of a distant rival, he will
crash with his antlers against the tree stems, making sudden mad rushes through the bushes,
the sound of his blows reverberating to a distance.  He has also a curious custom of tearing
up the moss over a considerable area, exposing the black mud by pawing with the fore-feet.
He continually visits these hills, and in consequence a strong musky effluvia arises from them.
The Indian hunter, by examining them, can ascertain without fail when they were last visited
by the animal.  He utters loud sounds both by day and night, described by the Indians in their
guttural voices as "quoth, quoth," but occasionally becoming sharper and more like a bellow
when he hears a distant cow.  The cow utters a prolonged and strangely wild call.  This is
imitated by the Indian hunter through a trumpet composed of rolled-up birch-bark, when his
dogs are in chase of the animal; and the bull being by this means attracted towards him, becomes
more easily his victim.

During the early part of the year, and the summer, the antlers are growing; but this process
ceases early in September, when the moose has got rid of the last ragged strip of the deciduous
skin against the young larch-trees and alder-bushes.  He now stands ready to assert his claims
against all rivals.  At this season the bulls fight desperately; often the collision of the
antlers of huge rivals, driven with mighty force by their immense and compact necks, is heard
to a great distance, like the report of a gun on a still autumnal evening.  They probably approach
from different directions, regardless of the rugged ground, the rocks, and fallen trees in
their course, bellowing loudly, and tearing up the ground with their horns.  Now they catch
sight of each other, and rush together like two gladiators.  Now butting for some time till
their antlers become interlocked, perhaps both fall struggling to the ground. Frequently portions
of skeletons, the skulls united by firmly-locked antlers, have been found in some wilderness
arena, where a deadly fight has occurred.  A magnificent pair of horns thus interlocked is
to be seen in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.  Terrible must have been the fate
of the combatants, illustrating Byron's lines:--

  "Friends meet to part;
  Love laughs at faith:
  True foes once met,
  Are joined till death."

Captain Hardy says he has twice heard the strange sound emitted by the moose, which, till he
became acquainted with its origin, was almost appalling.  It is a deep, hoarse, and prolonged
bellow, more resembling a feline than a bovine roar.  Sometimes the ear of the hunter is assailed
by a tremendous clatter from some distant swamp or burned wood. It is the moose, defiantly
sweeping the forest of pines right and left among the brittle branches of the ram pikes, as
the scaled pines hardened by fire are locally termed.  When, however, the moose wishes to beat
a retreat in silence, his suspicions being aroused, he effects the process with marvellous
stealth.  Not a branch is heard to snap, and the horns are so carefully carried through the
densest thickets, that a rabbit would make as much noise when alarmed.  He will also, when
hard-pressed, take the most desperate leaps to avoid his foes.

Though he seldom or never attacks human beings when unassailed, he will do so occasionally
when badly wounded, if nearly approached.  An old Indian hunter had one day followed up a moose,
and wounded the animal, when it turned on him.  There being no tree near, he jammed himself
for safety between two large granite boulders which were at hand.  The aperture, however, did
not extend far enough back to enable him to get altogether out of the reach of the infuriated
bull, which set on him with its fore-feet, and pounded him so severely that several of his
ribs were broken; indeed, for several years afterwards he was nearly bent double by the severe
beating he had received.

In the summer, when the plague of flies commences, the moose takes to the water to avoid their
bites.  There are several species--one termed the moose-fly--which are equally annoying to
the hunter.  The animal strives to free himself from their irritation by running among bushes
and brambles; and should he reach a lake, he will plunge into the water, allowing only his
nostrils and mouth to remain above the surface. Sometimes, indeed, he will dive altogether,
and is frequently known to hide himself from his pursuers by remaining for a long time below
the water.  He also feeds upon the tendrils and shoots of the yellow pond-lily, by reaching
for them under water.  An Indian, on one occasion, was following the track of a moose, when
it led him to the edge of a little round pond in the woods, whence he could find no exit of
the trail.  After waiting for some time, he beheld the head of the animal rising above the
surface in the very middle of the pond.  While hastening for his gun, which he had left at
a little distance, the moose made for the opposite shore, and emerging from the water, regained
the shelter of the forest ere he could get round for a shot.  The animals have been known also
to visit the seashore, and one was seen swimming off to an island over a mile distant, which
he reached in safety.

The moose feeds chiefly on the leaves of young shoots and bushes, or the smaller trees--the
red and other maples, the white birch, the balsam, fur, poplar, and mountain ash; and occasionally,
as has been said, on the roots of the yellow pond-lily, with a bite now and then at a tussock
of broad-leaved grass growing in the dried bogs.  To get at the foliage beyond the reach of
his muzzle, he frequently charges a young tree and rides it down, till he has brought the tempting
leaves within his reach.

The horns of the animal begin to sprout in April, the old pair having fallen some time before.
In the middle of this month the coat is shed, when the animal for some time afterwards presents
a very rugged appearance.  The cow towards the end of May produces one or two calves, generally
near the margin of a lake, or in one of the densely-wooded islands, where they are secure from
the attacks of the bull moose, who, cruel tyrant that he is, often destroys them.  Rarely more
than two are born at a time.

Besides its human foes, the moose is attacked occasionally by the bear. Captain Hardy describes
coming upon the traces of a recent struggle between a young moose and one of these animals.
"The bear had evidently stolen through the long grass upon the moose, and had taken him at
a disadvantage in the treacherous bog.  The grass was very much beaten down, and deep furrows
in the soil below showed how energetically the unfortunate moose had striven to escape from
his powerful assailant. There was a broad track plentifully strewed with moose hair, showing
how the moose had struggled with the bear, to the wood, where, no doubt, the affair ended,
and the bear dined."

As the winter approaches, the cows, with the young bulls and calves, congregate in small parties
on the open "barrens" and hill-sides.  When the snow comes thickly down, they form what is
called a yard; and in Canada, where its depth is very great, they have to remain in it during
the whole winter, feeding round the area on the young wood of deciduous trees.  In Nova Scotia,
however, they migrate to other localities when they have consumed the more tempting portions
of food in the yard.  In the morning and afternoon they are found feeding, or chewing the cud;
but at noon, when they lie down, they are difficult to approach, as they are then on the alert,
employing their wonderful faculties of scent and hearing to detect the faintest taint or sound
in the air, which might indicate the approach of danger.  The snapping of a little twig, the
least collision of a rifle with a branch, or crunching of the snow under the mocassins, will
suffice to arouse them.  Curiously enough, however, they are not alarmed by any sound, even
the loudest, to which they have been accustomed.  The hunter has, therefore, to approach the
yard with the greatest possible caution, in order to get a shot.

We will, however, start off on a moose hunt, in autumn, with a practical Indian hunter.  The
air of the autumnal night is frosty and bracing. The moose are moving rapidly from place to
place.  Night is drawing on. The last fluttering of the aspens dying away, leaves that perfect
repose in the air which is so necessary to the sport.  The moon rises, shedding a broad and
silvery light through the forest.  Mysterious sounds greet our ears.  The Indian hunter is
provided with his trumpet of birch-bark, in the form of a cone, about two feet in length. 
He shelters himself behind the edge of the banks, a clump of bushes, or rocks; and now he emits
the cry of the cow moose, so exactly, that the male animal is easily deceived by it.  He waits:
there is no response.  An interval of fifteen minutes elapses; still no reply is heard.  Again
the Indian sends his wild cry pealing through the wood.  Presently a low grunt, quickly repeated,
comes from some distant hill; and the snapping of branches and falling trees attests the approach
of the bull.  The hunter is now doubly careful; kneeling down, and thrusting the mouth of his
call into some bushes close by, he utters a lower and more plaintive sound.  At length an answer
reaches his ears.  The snapping of the branches is resumed; and presently the moose is seen
stalking into the middle of the moonlit "barren."  Our weapons are ready; and as the magnificent
animal stands looking eagerly around in the woodland amphitheatre, a rifle ball, laden with
death, brings him to the ground.

In some districts the Indians employ another method of calling.  They conceal themselves in
a swamp, in the midst of some damp mossy valley, during a dark night.  One holds a torch of
birch-bark with a match ready for lighting.  The hunter calls, and the moose approaches more
readily than towards the open "barren."  When the creature is within distance of the deadly
rifle, the match is applied to the torch, which, flaring up, illuminates the swamp, and discovers
the startled moose standing amidst the trees, and incapable apparently of flight.  The Indians
declare that he is fascinated by the light; and though he may walk round and round it, he will
not leave the spot, and thus presents an easy mark to the hunter's rifle.

Let us set forth on an expedition to "creep" moose, which may be described as a similar mode
of hunting to stalking.  The ground we select is among the "barrens" before described.  It
is strewed with dead trees in all directions, amid which briars and bushes have grown up, and
conceal their sharp, broken limbs, and the rough granite rocks scattered in all directions.
Here, collecting wood for burning, we form our camp, and sit round the blazing fire, on which
a well-filled frying-pan is hissing, while we are covered by our blankets to protect ourselves
from the pattering rain-drops.  Our suppers over, we stretch ourselves for repose, and gradually
fall asleep, as the snapping of the logs on the fire, the pattering of the rain, and the hootings
of the owls in the distant forest become less and less distinct.  Our Indian brings us notice
in the morning that two moose have passed close to the camp during the night.  However, in
spite of the plaintive call from the treacherous bark trumpet, they will not approach, having
been forewarned of danger by the smell of our camp-fire.  We make our way amid the bushes,
already leafless, except that here and there are seen bunches of dwarf maples with a few scarlet
leaves of autumn still clinging to them. Presently our companion whispers, "Down--sink down!
slow--like me!"  A magnificent bull appears about five hundred yards off.  The wind is blowing
from him to us.  The Indian utters the usual call; but the moose does not answer, having already
a companion close at hand.  Presently he lies down in the bushes, and we worm ourselves slowly
and laboriously towards the edge of the alder swamp.  Gently lowering ourselves into the swamp,
we creep noiselessly through the dense bushes, their thick foliage closing over our heads.
It is an anxious moment!--the slightest snapping of a bough, the knocking of a gun-barrel against
a stem, and the game is off.  "We must go back," whispers the Indian.  "Cannot get near enough
on this side.  Too open!"  The difficult task of retreating is performed without disturbing
the moose.  Another half-hour is then employed in creeping like snakes through the wet bushes.
At length, as we reach the edge of the swamp, the great animal rises directly facing us, gazing
steadily towards us.  We fire.  A headlong stagger follows the report; and the creature, turning
round, is hidden from sight behind a clump of bushes.  The Indian at the same time fires at
a large cow moose who has, unknown to us, been lying close to the bull.  We dash forward a
few paces.  On the other side the great bull suddenly rises in front of us and strides on into
thicker covert.  Another shot, and he sinks lifeless at our feet.

The Cariboo, or Reindeer.

We have before mentioned the extensive tracts existing in North America, which, from their
desolate appearance, are appropriately called "Barrens."  Far as the eye can reach the whole
ground is seen strewn with boulders of rock and fallen trees, scattered round in the wildest
confusion.  Here and there charred stumps rise from the green-sward; in some spots clumps of
spruce are seen, against which the white stems of the graceful birch stand out in bold relief;
while the bank of some stream, or the margin of a lake, is marked by fringing thickets of alder.
In many parts are moist, swampy bogs, into which the sportsman sinks ankle-deep at every step.
The ground, however, is everywhere thickly carpeted by a luxuriant growth of a species of lichen.
It possesses wonderfully nutritive qualities; so much so, that large quantities of alcohol
have lately been extracted from it, as well as from other lichens growing in sub-arctic regions.
It is the chief food of the cariboo, which animal frequents these desolate-looking "barrens."

Visiting one of these "barrens," we may perchance fall in with several of the noble-looking
animals known in Europe and Asia as the reindeer, though we must look sharp to recognise them;
for so similar are they in colour to the rocks and general features of the ground, that only
the keen eye of the Indian can easily detect them, especially when they are lying down.  Should
we approach them on the weather-side, or should the slightest noise be made, they will quickly
detect us.  Up they spring, and after a brief stare, make off in graceful bounds at a rapid
rate. Now, having got beyond danger, they drop into a long swinging trot, and proceed in single
file across the "barren," till they enter the line of forest in the far distance.

The cariboo of North America is a strongly-built, thickset animal, compared to the more graceful
of his relatives.  He carries on his head a pair of magnificent antlers, varying greatly in
different specimens-- some palmating towards the upper ends, others with branches springing
from the palmated portions.  In most instances there is but one developed brow antler, the
other being a solitary curved prong.  The back of the cariboo is covered with brownish hair,
the tips of which are of a rich dun grey, whiter on the neck than elsewhere.  The nose, ears,
and outer surface of the legs and shoulders are of a brown hue.  The neck and throat are covered
with long, dullish white hair, and there is a faint whitish patch on the side of the shoulders.
The rump and tail are snowy-white, while a band of white runs round all the legs, joining the
hoofs.

As winter approaches, the hair grows long, and lightens considerably in hue.  Frequently, indeed,
individuals may be seen in a herd with coats of the palest fawn colour--almost white.  The
muzzle is entirely covered with hair.  The fur is brittle, and though in summer it is short,
in winter it is longer and whiter, especially about the throat.  The hoofs are broad, depressed,
and bent in at the tip.  The full-grown bucks shed their horns, and it is seldom that they
are seen in a herd after Christmas.  The female reindeer, however, retains hers during winter.
Several theories have been advanced to account for this.  There seems no doubt, however, that
the object is to enable the female to protect her fawns from the males, who are apt to attack
the young and destroy them.

The cariboo is gregarious, and males, females, and young herd together at all seasons; and
by this provision of Nature the females are able to defend the young, who would otherwise be
subjected to injury.  In another respect these animals are wonderfully provided for the mode
of existence they are compelled to pursue.  Not only have they to cross wide snow-covered districts,
but frequently to pass across frozen expanses of water.  To enable them to do this in the winter,
the frog of the foot is almost entirely absorbed, and the edges of the hoof, now quite concave,
grow out in sharp ridges, each division on the under surface presenting the appearance of a
huge mussel-shell, and serving the office of natural skates.  So rapidly does the shell increase,
that the frog does not fill up again till spring, when the antlers bud out. With this singular
conformation of the foot, it has a lateral spread; and an additional assistance for maintaining
a foothold on slippery surfaces is given by numerous long, stiff bristles which grow downward
at the fetlock, curving over entirely between the divisions.  The cariboo is thus enabled to
proceed over the snow, to cross frozen lakes, or ascend icy precipices, with an ease which
places him, when in flight, beyond the reach of all enemies, except perhaps the nimble and
untiring wolf.

The cariboo is essentially a migratory animal.  There are two well-defined periods of migration,
in the spring and autumn.  Throughout the winter it appears also seized with an unconquerable
desire to change its residence.  One day it may be found feeding quietly through the forests
in little bands, and the next, perhaps, all tracks show a general move in a certain direction.
The animals join the main herd after a while, and entirely leaving the district, travel toward
new feeding-grounds.  Though often found in the same woodlands as the moose, they do not enjoy
each other's company.  In severe winters the cariboos travel to the southernmost limits of
their haunts, and even sometimes enter the settlements.  Not being aquatic, like the moose,
to avoid the flies in summer they ascend the mountain ranges, where they can be free from their
attacks.  The hunter, however, follows them, and their speed being of no avail among the precipices,
many are shot.  During most of the year the flesh of the animal is dry and tasteless; but it
possesses a layer of fat, two or more inches thick, which is greatly esteemed. This, with the
marrow, is pounded together with the dried flesh, and makes the best kind of pemmican--a food
of the greatest value to the hunter.  The cariboo lives in herds, sometimes only of ten or
twenty, but at others consisting of thirty or more individuals.  They range across the whole
width of the continent, being found in great numbers to the west of the Rocky Mountains, especially
at the northern end of British Columbia.  Although specifically identical with the reindeer
of Europe, it has never yet been trained by Indians or Esquimaux to carry their goods or draw
their sleighs, as in Lapland and along the Arctic shores of Asia.

The Wapiti, or Canadian Stag.

In the wilder parts of the Southern States of the Union, herds of the magnificent Canadian
stag or wapiti--popularly called the elk--range amid the woods and over the prairies.  Sometimes
three or four hundred are found in one herd, always led by an old buck, who exacts from them
the strictest obedience--compelling them to halt or move onward as he judges necessary.  Now
the superb herd of long-horned creatures are seen to wheel to the right or left, now to advance
or retreat at the signal he issues.

The wapiti is indeed a grand animal, growing to the height of the tallest ox, and endowed with
wonderful activity, as well as power.  See him as he dashes through the forest, his branched
horns separating in serpentine curves, six feet from tip to tip, laid close over his back as
he makes his way amid the trees.  His head is of a lively, yellowish-brown hue, the neck covered
with reddish and black hairs, the latter of considerable length, descending in a thick bunch
below it. They are among the fiercest of the deer tribe.  The bucks often enter into desperate
contests with each other, battling--with their huge horns--the fight frequently ending only
with the death of the weaker rival.  Sometimes their horns have become so inextricably interlocked,
that both have fallen to the ground, and, unable to rise, have perished miserably.  They will
frequently, when wounded, attack their human assailants; and the bold hunter, if thus exposed
with rifle unloaded to their fierce assaults, will rue the day his weapon failed to kill the
enraged quarry at the first shot.

The wapiti, when pursued, will boldly plunge into the lake or broad river, and breast the rapid
current to avoid his foes; or will occasionally, if hard-pressed, attack the bold hunter who
ventures to follow in his light canoe.

His cry is a sharp whistling sound, which rings through the air far and wide on a calm day.
He feeds on the branches of the trees and grass, and in winter scrapes, with his powerful fore-feet,
deep into the snow, to obtain the lichens and dry herbage which grow beneath.  His flesh for
several months in the year is dry and coarse, but his hide is much prized by the Indians, who
manufacture from it a leather of a peculiarly soft character, which retains that quality after
being wet,--instead of turning hard, as is the case with that manufactured from other deerskins.
A remarkable feature of the wapiti is that the horns differ in form almost as greatly as do
those of the branches of trees, no two specimens being found with them exactly alike.

The Karjacou, or Virginian Deer.

The most graceful of the deer tribe, the karjacou, scours in large herds across the prairies,
frequently entering the haunts of man.  Yet so easily is it scared that it takes to flight
at the very appearance of a human being.  Curiously enough, however, it will again return to
its favourite feeding-grounds, even though the hunter's rifle may lay low many of the herd.
It is about the size of the fallow-deer, and of a light brown hue.  Its horns are slender,
and have numerous branches on the interior sides, but are destitute of brow antlers.

Let us watch a herd startled by our approach.  Away they spring, leaping into the air, turning
their heads in every direction to ascertain the cause of their alarm, and then rush off at
full speed; but in a short time, if they are not followed, we may see them return, especially
as night draws on, and crouch down in their accustomed sleeping-places. Should a salt lake
be near, they will come in vast numbers to lick up with their tongues the saline particles
adhering to the surrounding stones, where the salt has crystallised from the evaporation of
the water.

They are at all times thirsty, and they require constant draughts of pure water, to obtain
which they are sure to visit the nearest stream or spring as night is about to close over the
scene.  Wherever the tenderest herbage grows upon the plain, there the karjacou comes to crop
it during summer.  In winter he finds an abundant supply of food from the buds and berries,
or fallen fruits; or, when snow is on the ground, he eats the string moss hanging in masses
from the trees.  He willingly takes to the water, and will cross a lake or broad river, swimming
at a rapid rate with his whole body submerged, his head alone appearing above the surface;
thus he will often baffle his pursuers, even though they may follow him with a boat.  He has
been known, indeed, when hard-pressed near the sea-coast, to plunge into the ocean, and buffeting
the waves, to make his way far from the land, rather than be captured.

His flesh affords the Indian a large portion of his winter supply of food, while his skin is
manufactured into clothing, the leather from it being especially soft and pliable.  From the
settlers in the western provinces he receives little mercy, as, without hesitation, he leaps
their fences, banqueting on their growing corn or vegetables; and, after doing all the mischief
in his power, by his activity generally again makes his escape.  No animal surpasses in beauty
the young fawn, the fur of which is of a ruddy brown tint, ornamented with white spots arranged
in irregular lines, merging occasionally into wide stripes.

Like others of his tribe, the male is excessively combative when meeting others of his own
species; and a story is told of three animals thus encountering each other in a desert, when
all their horns becoming entangled, they remained fixed, unable to separate, till they sank
together on the ground, their skulls and skeletons afterwards being discovered, thus giving
evidence of the combat and its fatal result.

The Antelope.

No animal of the American wilds surpasses the antelope in beauty.  The little creatures congregate
in herds of many thousands, though, from the exterminating war waged against them by the Indians,
they have greatly decreased in numbers.  The size of the antelope is about that of the common
red-deer doe; the colour somewhat between buff and fawn, shaded here and there into reddish-brown,
and a patch of pure white on the hind-quarters.  This gives rise to the expression of the hunter,
when he sees it flying before him, that the creature is "showing its clean linen."  The ears
are placed far back on the head, are very long, and curved so much that at a distance they
appear like horns, while the horns themselves appear as if coming out of the animal's eyes;
they are long and slender, curving slightly backwards, and have no branches, except a little
bud, which is developed when the creature is about two years old.  The chief peculiarity of
the animal is its lack of a dewlap.

The feet have no rudimentary hoofs like the deer, yet this want in no way interferes with its
speed.  Often the creature may be seen for a moment browsing not fifty yards off, the next
it has dwindled to a mere speck, and is in another lost to sight.  They do not leap like deer,
but run with level backs, as sheep do, their legs glancing faster than sight can follow.  In
vain the hunter attempts to follow the rapid movements of the creatures on horseback.  Perhaps
they will let him approach to within a short distance, and then away they float on a line at
right-angles to their former retreat.  To come up with them, indeed, as an American writer
observes, is as hopeful an undertaking as trying to run down a telegraphic message.  The only
way to get near them is by a stratagem.  They are not afraid of horses, and the hunter, by
walking behind his horse, may often approach a herd without being discovered, provided the
wind blows from them.  He then pickets his horse with a sharp stake, and sinking down in the
grass he ties a bright-coloured handkerchief to the end of his ramrod; he then crawls forward
on hands and knees, dragging his rifle, till he approaches still nearer, when he remains concealed,
and lifts his flag in the air.  The antelopes, on catching sight of it, stop browsing, and
raising their heads, peer towards it, exhibiting no signs of fear.  For a moment he drops his
flag; the beautiful creatures then resume their repast, but their curiosity gets the better
of their prudence.  Again they look forward, when the flag is once more raised and waved slowly
backward and forward. The antelopes have now their curiosity excited to the utmost; for a moment
they stop irresolute, then advance a few steps snuffing the air. Once more the flag sinks out
of sight; they seem to be asking each other what is the cause of the strange sight they have
seen.  Again it is raised; they draw nearer and nearer, till they are within range of the hunter's
deadly rifle; he fires, and almost to a certainty one of the beautiful animals springs into
the air and tumbles head-foremost on the ground.  For a moment the survivors run off from their
fallen friend, but seldom go far.  Once more they return within easy rifle-shot of the hunter.
Unless, however, he requires the meat, he must be greatly lacking in right feeling if he slaughters
uselessly so beautiful an animal.  The antelope becomes so easily confused, that when met on
the prairies it frequently runs headlong into the midst of the travellers. The creatures are
often killed by being surrounded, when the whole herd are driven into an enclosed spot and
become the easy prey of the hungry hunters.

The Bighorn, or Mountain Sheep.

Amid the almost inaccessible peaks of the Rocky Mountains, herds of animals with enormous horns
may be seen leaping from rock to rock, sometimes descending at one spring from a height of
twenty or thirty feet--when, the Indians assert, they invariably alight on their horns, and
by this means save their bones from certain dislocation.  They are bighorns, or mountain sheep,
and are considered the chief game of these regions.  The animals appear to partake both of
the nature of the deer and of the goat.  They resemble the latter more especially in their
habits, and in frequenting the most lofty and inaccessible regions, whence, except in the severest
weather, they seldom descend to the upland valleys.  In size the bighorn is between the domestic
sheep and the common red-deer of America, but is more strongly built than the latter.  It is
of a brownish-dun colour, with a somewhat white streak on the hind-quarters.  The tail is shorter
than that of the deer, and tipped with black.  As the age of the animal increases, the coat
becomes of a darker tinge.  The horns, of the male especially, are of great size, curving backwards
about three feet in length, and twenty inches in circumference at the roots.

Frequently on the highest spot one of the band is stationed as a sentinel, and whilst the others
are feeding he looks out for the approach of danger.  They have even more acute sight and smell
than the deer.  On an alarm being given the whole herd scampers up the mountain, higher and
higher, every now and then halting on some overhanging crag and looking down oh the object
which may have caused them alarm; then once more they pursue their ascent, and as they bound
up the steep sides of the mountains throw down an avalanche of rocks and stones.

Occasionally the young lambs are caught and domesticated by the hunters in their mountain homes,
when they become greatly attached to their masters, amusing them by their merry gambols and
playful tricks. Attempts have been made to transport them to the States; but although milch-goats
have been brought to feed the lambs, they have suffered by the change from the pure air of
the mountains to the plains, or they have not taken kindly to their foster-mothers, and have
invariably perished on the journey.

The creatures reach a height of three feet six inches at the shoulders, while the horns are
of about the same length.  In colour they vary greatly, changing according to the season of
the year.

The Bison, commonly called the Buffalo in America.

Throughout the wide-extending prairies of North America, from north to south to the east of
the Rocky Mountains, vast herds of huge animals-- with shaggy coats and manes which hang down
over the head and shoulders reaching to the ground, and short curling horns, giving their countenances
a ferocious aspect--range up and down, sometimes amounting to ten thousand head in one herd.
They commonly go by the name of buffaloes, but are properly called bisons.  Clothed in a dense
coat of long woolly hair, the buffalo is well constituted to stand the heats of summer as well
as the cold of the snowy plains in the northern regions to which he extends his wanderings.

Let us look at him as he stands facing us on his native plains, his red eyes glowing like coals
of fire from amid the mass of dark brown or black hair which hangs over his head and neck and
the whole fore part of his body.  A beard descends from the lower jaw to the knee; another
huge bunch of matted hair rises from the top of his head, almost concealing his thick, short,
pointed horns standing wide apart from each other.  As he turns round we shall see that a large
oblong hump rises on his back, diminishing in height towards the tail: that member is short,
with a tuft of hair at the tip.  The hinder part of the body is clothed with hair of more moderate
length, especially in summer, when it becomes fine and smooth, and soft as velvet.  From his
awkward, heavy appearance, when seen at a distance, it would not be supposed that he is extremely
active, capable of moving at a rapid rate, and of continuing his headlong career for an immense
distance.  So sure of foot is he, also, that he will pass over ground where no horse could
follow, his limbs being in reality slender, and his body far more finely proportioned than
would be supposed till it is seen stripped of its thick coating of hair. While his thick coat
protects him from the cold, he is also provided with a broad, strong, and tough nose, with
which he can shovel away the snow and lay bare the grass on which he feeds.  Sometimes, however,
when a slight thaw has occurred, and a thin cake of ice has been formed over the snow, his
nose gets sadly cut, and is often seen bleeding from the effects of his labours.  It is said
that when a herd comes near the settlements, the domesticated calves, and even the horses,
will follow the buffalo tracks, and graze on the herbage which they have disclosed and left
unconsumed.

The flesh of the buffalo, especially that of the cow, is juicy, and tender in the extreme.
The most esteemed portion is that composing the hump on its back, which gives it so strange
an aspect.  It is indeed frequently killed merely for the sake of this hump, and the tongue
and marrow-bones.  Sometimes, also, when parched with thirst, the hunter kills a buffalo to
obtain the water contained within certain honeycombed cells in its stomach.  The buffalo is
provided with this reservoir, in which a large quantity of pure water can be stored, that it
may traverse, without the necessity of drinking, the wide barren plains where none can be obtained.
Vast numbers, without even these objects in view, are wantonly slaughtered, and the chief part
of the flesh utterly wasted, by the thoughtless Indians of the plain, who have thereby deprived
themselves of their future support.  Many tribes depend almost entirely for their subsistence
on the buffalo, of which the flesh is prepared in several ways.  When cut up into long strips,
and dried in the sun till it becomes black and hard, it will keep for a long time. It is also
pounded with the fat of the animal, and converted into pemmican--an especially nutritious food,
which, if kept dry, will continue in good order for several years.

The prairie Indians make use of the hide for many purposes.  They scrape off the hair and tan
it, when it serves them for coverings for their tents.  It is also carefully dressed, when
it becomes soft and impervious to water.  It is then used for clothing.  Some of the tribes
also form their shields from it.  The hide is pegged down on the ground, when it is covered
with a kind of glue.  In this state it greatly shrinks and thickens, and becomes sufficiently
hard to resist an arrow, and even to turn aside an ordinary bullet which does not strike directly.

The buffalo is especially a gregarious animal, and is found in herds of immense size, many
thousands in number.  Their dark forms may often be seen extending over the prairie as far
as the eye can reach, a mighty moving mass of life.  Onward they rush, moved by some sudden
impulse, making the ground tremble under their feet, while their course may be traced by the
vast cloud of dust which floats over them as they sweep across the plain.  They are invariably
followed by flocks of wolves, who pounce on any young or sick members of the herd which may
be left behind.  They range throughout the whole prairie country, from the "Fertile Belt,"
which extends from the Red River settlement to the Rocky Mountains in British Central America,
to Mexico in the south.  The bulls are at times excessively savage.  They often quarrel among
themselves, and then, falling out of the herd, they engage in furious combats, greatly to the
advantage of the pursuing wolves.  In the summer, the buffalo delights in wallowing in mud.
Reaching some marshy spot, he throws himself down, and works away till he excavates a mud-hole
in the soil.  The water from the surrounding ground rapidly drains into this, and covers him
up, thus freeing him from the stings of the gnats and flies which swarm in that season.

The buffalo is hunted on horseback both by whites and by Indians, though the sport is one in
which a considerable amount of danger must be braved.  Let us set off from a farm in the Western
States, on the border of the prairie.  We have one or two nights to camp out before we reach
the buffalo grounds.  Mounting our horses by break of day, after an early breakfast, we ride
on with the wind in our faces, and at length discover across the plain a number of dark objects
moving slowly.  They are buffaloes, feeding as they go.  We see through our field-glasses that
there are calves among them.  It is proposed that some of our party should ride round, so as
to stampede the herd back towards us, and thus, by dividing them, enable us to get in the centre.
We wait for some time, when we see a vast mass of hairy monsters come tearing over a hill towards
us.  We have shot several of the bulls, but our object is to secure their calves and cows.
As the herd approaches us, it swings round its front at right-angles, and makes off westward.
We dash forward, and divide it into two parties.  We also separate, some of our hunters following
one part of the herd, the others the remainder.  The enthusiasm of our horses equals our own.
Away we go; nothing stops us. Now we plunge with headlong bounds down bluffs of caving sands
fifty feet high,--while the buffaloes, crazy with terror, are scrambling half-way up the opposite
side.  Now we are on the very haunches of our game; now before us appears a slippery buffalo
wallow.  We see it just in time to leap clear, but the next instant we are in the middle of
one. Our horses, with frantic plunges, scramble out; and on we go.  We get closer and closer
to the buffaloes, when a loud thundering of trampling hoofs sounds behind us.  Looking over
our shoulders, there, in plain sight, appears another herd, tearing down on our rear.  For
nearly a mile in width stretches a line of angry faces, a rolling surf of wind-blown hair,
a row of quivering lights burning with a reddish-brown hue--the eyes of the infuriated animals.
Should our horses stumble, our fate will be sealed.  It is certain death to be involved in
the herd. So is it to turn back.  In an instant we should be trampled and gored to death. 
Our only hope is to ride steadily in the line of the stampede, till we can insinuate ourselves
laterally, and break out through the side of the herd.  Yet the hope of doing so is but small.

On we rush rapidly as before, when suddenly, to our great satisfaction, the herd before us
divides into two columns, to pass round a low hill in front.  Still on we go, pushing our horses
up the height.  We reach the summit, the horses panting fearfully, and the moisture trickling
in streams from their sides.  But now the rear column comes on.  They see us, not fifty rods
off, but happily pay no attention to us.  We dismount, facing the furious creatures.  Should
they not divide, but come over the hill, in a few moments we must be trampled to death.  The
herd approaches to within a hundred yards of the hill.  We lift our rifles and deliver a couple
of steadily aimed bullets at the fore-shoulders of the nearest bulls.  One gives a wild jump,
and limps on with three legs; the other seems at first unhurt; but just as they reach the foot
of the mound, they both fall down.  The whole host are rushing over them.  We rapidly reload.
The fate of their comrades, however, sends a panic into the hearts of the herd.  Another falls
just when they are so close that we could have sprung on their backs.  At that moment they
divide, and the next we are standing on a desert island, a sea of billowing backs flowing round
on either side in a half-mile current of crazy buffaloes.  The herd is fully five minutes in
passing us.  We watch them as they come, and as the last laggers pant by the mound we look
westward and see the stampeders halting.  We soon understand the cause.  They have come up
with the main herd.  Yes, there, in full sight of us, is the buffalo army, extending its deep
line as far as the western horizon.  The whole earth is black with them. From a point a mile
in front of us, their rear line extends on the north to the bluffs bounding the banks of the
river on which we had camped. On the south it reaches the summits of some distant heights fully
six miles away.  When it is known that with our field-glasses we can recognise an object the
size of a buffalo ten miles distant, and that the mass extends even beyond the horizon, some
idea may be formed of the immense number of animals congregated in the herd.  To say that there
are ten thousand, would be to give a very low estimate of their numbers.

The same writer from whose work the above is taken, describes an extraordinary instance of
friendship exhibited by a buffalo bull for one of his comrades.  (Generally speaking, the buffalo,
even in the pairing season, will forsake the wounded cow, and the cow will not stay one moment
to protect her hurt calf.)  He was out hunting on one occasion, when, having been for some
time unsuccessful, and being anxious to retrieve his character by bringing home some meat to
camp, he caught sight of two fine buffalo bulls on a broad meadow on the opposite side of a
stream.  Dismounting from his horse, he took steady aim at the nearest buffalo, which was grazing
with its haunches towards him.  The ball broke the animal's right hip, and he plunged away
on three legs, the other hanging useless.  He leaped on his horse, put spurs to its flanks,
and in three minutes was close on the bull's rear.  To his astonishment, and the still greater
surprise of the two old hunters who came after him, the unhurt bull stuck to his comrade's
side without flinching.  He fired another shot, which took effect in the lungs of the first
buffalo.  The second moved off for a moment, but instantly returned to his friend.  The wounded
buffalo became distressed, and slackened his pace.  The unwounded one not only retarded his,
but coming to the rear of his friend, stood, with his head down, offering battle. "Here indeed
was devotion which had no instinct to inspire it.  The sight was sublime!  The hunters could
no more have accepted the challenge of the brave creature, than they could have smitten Damon
at the side of Pythias.  The wounded buffalo ran on to the border of the next marsh, and, in
attempting to cross, fell headlong down the steep bank, and never rose again.  Not till that
moment, when courage was useless, did the faithful creature consider his own safety in flight.
The hunters took off their hats as he walked away, and gave three parting cheers as the gallant
buffalo vanished beyond the fringing timber."

The half-breed hunters of Rupert's Land make two expeditions in the year in search of buffaloes--one
in the middle of June, and the other in October.  They divide into three bands, each taking
a separate route, for the purpose of falling in with the herds of buffaloes.  These bands are
each accompanied by about five hundred carts, drawn by either an ox or a horse.  They are curious
vehicles, roughly formed with their own axes, and fastened together with wooden pins and leather
thongs, not a nail being used.  The tires of the wheels are made of buffalo hide, and put on
wet.  When they become dry, they shrink, and are so tight that they never fall off, and last
as long as the cart holds together.  The carts contain the women and children, and provisions,
and are intended to bring back the spoils of the chase.  Each is decorated with some flag,
so that the hunters may recognise their own from a distance.  They may be seen winding off
in one wide line extending for miles, and accompanied by the hunters on horseback.  These expeditions
run the danger of being attacked by the Sioux Indians, who inhabit the prairies to the south.
The camps are therefore well surrounded by scouts, for the purpose of reconnoitring either
for enemies or buffaloes.  If they see the latter, they make a signal by throwing up handfuls
of dust; if the former, by running their horses to and fro.

Mr Paul Kane, the Canadian artist, describes one of these expeditions which he joined.  On
their way they were visited by twelve Sioux chiefs, who came for the purpose of negotiating
a permanent peace; but whilst smoking the pipe of peace in the council lodge, the dead body
of a half-breed, who had gone to a distance from the camp, was brought in newly scalped, and
his death was at once attributed to the Sioux.  Had not the older and more temperate half-breeds
interfered, the young men would have destroyed the twelve chiefs on the spot: as it was, they
were allowed to depart unharmed.  Three days afterwards, however, the scouts were observed
making the signal of enemies being in sight.  Immediately a hundred of the best-mounted hastened
to the spot, and concealing themselves behind the shelter of the bank of a stream, sent out
two of their number as decoys, to expose themselves to the view of the Sioux. The latter, supposing
them to be alone, rushed upon them; whereupon the concealed half-breeds sprang up and poured
in a volley which brought down eight.  The others escaped, though several must have been wounded.

Two small herds having been met with, of which several animals were killed, the scouts one
morning brought in word that an immense herd of bulls was in advance about two miles off. 
They are known in the distance from the cows by their feeding singly, and being scattered over
the plain,--whereas the cows keep together, for the purpose of protecting the calves, which
are always kept in the centre of the herd.

We will start at daybreak with our friend, and a half-breed as a guide. Six hours' hard riding
brings us to within a quarter of a mile of the nearest herd.  The main body stretches over
the plains as far as the eye can reach, the wind blowing in our faces.  We should have liked
to have attacked them at once, but the guide will not hear of it, as it is contrary to the
law of his tribe.  We therefore shelter ourselves behind a mound, relieving our horses of their
saddles to cool them.  In about an hour one hundred and thirty hunters come up, every man loading
his gun, looking to the priming, and examining the efficiency of his saddle-girths.  The elder
caution the less experienced not to shoot each other,--such accidents sometimes occurring.
Each hunter then fills his mouth with bullets, which he drops into the gun without wadding;
by this means loading more quickly, and being able to do so whilst his horse is at full speed.
We slowly walk our horses towards the herd.  Advancing about two hundred yards, the animals
perceive us, and start off in the opposite direction, at the top of their speed.  We now urge
our horses to full gallop, and in twenty minutes are in the midst of the stamping long-haired
herd.  There cannot be less than four or five thousand in our immediate vicinity,--all bulls;
not a single cow amongst them.  The scene now becomes one of intense excitement,--the huge
bulk thundering over the plain in headlong confusion, while the fearless hunters ride recklessly
in their midst, keeping up an incessant fire but a few yards from their victims.  Upon the
fall of each buffalo the hunter merely throws, close to it, some article of his apparel to
denote his own prey, and then rushes on to another.  The chase continues for about one hour,
extending over an area of about six square miles, where may be seen the dead and dying buffaloes
to the number of five hundred.  In spite of his horsemanship, more than one hunter has been
thrown from his steed, in consequence of the innumerable badger-holes in which the plains abound.
Two others are carried back to camp insensible.  We have just put a bullet through an enormous
bull.  He does not fall, but stops, facing us, pawing the earth, bellowing, and glaring savagely.
The blood is streaming from his mouth, and it seems as if he must speedily drop.  We watch
him, admiring his ferocious aspect, combating with death. Suddenly he makes a dash towards
us, and we have barely time to escape the charge; when, reloading, we again fire, and he sinks
to the ground.

The carts bring in the slaughtered animals to the camp, when the squaws set to work, aided
by the men, to cut them up, and prepare them for drying and for making pemmican.  The women
are soon busily employed in cutting the flesh into slices, and in hanging them in the sun on
poles. The dried meat is then pounded between two stones till the fibres separate.  About fifty
pounds of it is put into a bag of buffalo skin, with about forty pounds of melted fat, which,
being mixed while hot, forms a hard and compact mass.  Hence its name, in the Cree language,
of pemmican--pemmi signifying meat, and kon fat--usually, however, spelt pemmican.  One pound
of pemmican is considered equal to four pounds of ordinary meat,--and it keeps for years, perfectly
good, exposed to any weather.

The prairie Indians obtain buffaloes by driving them into huge pounds, where they are slaughtered.
The pounds, however, can only be made in the neighbourhood of forests, from whence the logs
for their formation can be obtained.  The pound consists of a circular fence about 130 feet
broad.  It is constructed of the trunks of trees laced together with withies, with outside
supports about 5 feet high.  At one side an entrance is left about 10 feet wide, with a deep
trench across it, on the outside of which there is a strong trunk of a tree placed, about a
foot from the ground.  The animals, on being driven in, leap over this, clearing the trench,
which of course prevents them from returning.  From the entrance two rows of bushes or posts,
which are called "dead men," diverge towards the direction from which the buffaloes are likely
to come.  They are placed from 20 feet to 50 feet apart, and the distance between the extremities
of the two rows at their outer termination is nearly two miles.  Behind each of these "dead
men" an Indian is stationed, to prevent the buffaloes when passing up the avenue from breaking
out.  Meantime, the hunters, mounted on fleet horses, range the country to a distance of eighteen
or twenty miles in search of a herd. The buffalo has an unaccountable propensity which makes
him endeavour to cross in front of the hunter's horse.  They will frequently, indeed, follow
a horseman for miles in order to do so.  He thus possesses an unfailing means, by a dexterous
management of his horse, of conducting the animals into the trap prepared for them.  The men
also conceal themselves in hollows and depressions in the ground, so as to assist in turning
the herd, should they attempt to escape in that direction.  And now some three or four hundred
head of shaggy monsters are driven to the expanded mouth of the avenue.  The horsemen follow
in their rear, and prevent them turning back.  Meantime the Indians stationed behind the "dead
men" rise, shaking their bows, yelling, and urging them on.  Thus they proceed, madly rushing
on, the passage growing narrower and narrower, while they, pressed together, are unable to
see the danger ahead.  The foremost at length reach the fatal ditch, and leaping over, enter
the pound, the rest madly following.  "The animals now begin to gallop round and round the
fence, looking for some means of escape; but women and children on the outside, keeping perfectly
silent, hold their robes before every orifice, till the whole herd is brought in.  They then
climb to the top of the fence, and the hunters, who have followed closely in the rear of the
buffaloes, spear and shoot with bows and arrows or firearms at the bewildered animals, rapidly
becoming frantic with fear and terror in the narrow limits of the pound.  A dreadful scene
of confusion and slaughter then ensues.  The older animals toss the younger.  The shouts and
screams of the Indians rise above the roar of the bulls, the bellowing of the cows, and the
moaning of the calves. The dying struggles of so many powerful animals crowded together, create
a revolting scene, dreadful for its excess of cruelty and waste of life."  [Hind.]

In consequence of this wholesale and wanton destruction, the buffalo has greatly diminished;
and the Indians agree in the belief that their people, in like manner, will decrease till none
are left.  It is computed that for many years past no less than 145,000 buffaloes have annually
been killed in British territory; while on the great prairies claimed by the United States
a still greater number have been slaughtered.  In one year--1855--on the British side of the
boundary, there were 20,000 robes of skins received at York Factory alone; and probably not
fewer than 230,000 head of buffalo were slaughtered in the previous year.  This number would
have been sufficient to sustain a population of a quarter of a million.  Yet so vast a number
of the animals are left to rot on the ground, that in all probability not more than 30,000
Indians fed on the flesh of the slaughtered buffaloes.

The civilised fur-traders, however, with greater forethought, take means to preserve the flesh
of the animals they kill in the neighbourhood of the forts, so that it may last them through
the summer.  For this purpose they dig a square pit capable of containing seven or eight hundred
carcasses.  As soon as the ice in the river is of sufficient thickness, it is cut with saws
into square blocks, of a uniform size, with which the floor of the pit is regularly paved.
The blocks are then cemented together by pouring water in between them, and allowing it to
freeze into a solid mass.  In like manner the walls are built up to the surface of the ground.
The head and feet being cut off, each carcass, without being skinned, is divided into quarters;
and these are piled in layers in the pit, till it is filled up, when the whole is covered with
a thick coating of straw, which is again protected from the sun and rain by a shed.  In this
manner the meat is preserved in good condition through the whole summer, and is considered
more tender and better flavoured than when freshly killed.

Even in the winter the buffalo continues to range over the plains in a far northern latitude.
Mr Kane mentions seeing a band, numbering nearly ten thousand, at the very northern confines
of the Fertile Belt, where the snow was very deep at the time.  They, however, had never before
appeared in such vast numbers near the Company's establishments. Some, on on that occasion,
were shot within the gates of Fort Edmonton. They had killed with their horns twenty or thirty
horses, in their attempt to drive them from the patches of grass which the horses had laid
bare with their hoofs.  They were probably migrating northward, to escape the human migrations
so rapidly filling up the southern and western regions which were formerly their pasture-grounds.

The Cree Indians use dogs to draw their sleighs.  They are powerful, savage animals, having
a good deal of the wolf about them.  They are considered as valuable as horses, as everything
is drawn over the snow by them.  When buffaloes have been killed in winter, the dead animals
are drawn in by them to the camp; and two can thus easily drag a large cow buffalo over the
snow.  The sleigh or cariole used in these regions is formed of a thin flat board about eighteen
inches wide, bent up in front, with a straight back behind to lean against.  The sides are
made of fresh buffalo hide, with the hair completely scraped off, and which, lapping over,
entirely covers the front part, so that a person slips into it as into a tin bath.  Each carries
but one passenger.  The driver, on snow-shoes, runs behind to guide the dogs.  Each sleigh
is drawn by four dogs, their backs gaudily decorated with saddle-cloths of various colours,
fringed, and embroidered in the most fantastic manner, and with innumerable small bells and
feathers.  Two men run before on snow-shoes to beat a track, which the dogs instinctively follow.
A long cavalcade of this description has a very picturesque appearance.

While thus travelling, our friend Mr Kane caught sight of a herd of buffaloes, which did not
perceive the approach of the party till the foremost sleigh was so near as to excite the dogs,
who rushed furiously after them, notwithstanding all the efforts of the drivers to keep them
back.  The spirit of the hunt was at once communicated through the whole line, and the entire
party were in an instant dashing along at a furious rate after the buffaloes.  The frightened
animals made a bold dash at length through a deep snow-bank, and attempted to scramble up the
steep side of the river, the top of which the foremost one had nearly reached, when, slipping,
he rolled down and knocked over those behind, one on the top of the other, into the deep snow-drift,
from which men and dogs were struggling in vain to extricate themselves.  It would be impossible
to describe the wild scene of uproar that followed.  One of the sleighs was smashed, and a
man nearly killed; but at length the party succeeded in getting clear, and repairing the damage.

In some districts, where the buffaloes can with difficulty be approached, the Indians employ
a stratagem to get them within reach of their arrows or rifles.  One of the Indians covers
himself in a wolf's skin, another with a buffalo skin.  They then crawl on all-fours within
sight of the buffaloes, and as soon as they have engaged their attention, the pretended wolf
jumps on the pretended calf, which bellows in imitation of the real one.  The buffaloes are
easily deceived in this way, as the bellowing is generally perfect, and the herd rush on to
the protection of their supposed young, with such impetuosity that they do not perceive the
cheat till they are quite close enough to be shot.

On one occasion Mr Kane and his Indian companion fell in with a solitary bull and cow.  On
this they made a "calf," as the ruse is called.  The cow attempted to spring towards them,
but the bull, seeming to understand the trick, tried to stop her by running between them. 
The cow now dodged and got round him, and ran within ten or fifteen yards of the hunters, with
the bull close at her heels, when both men fired, and brought her down.  The bull instantly
stopped short, and, bending over her, tried to help her up with his nose--evincing the most
persevering affection for her; nor could they get rid of him, so as to cut up the cow, without
shooting him also, although at that time of the year bull flesh is not valued as food when
the female can be obtained.  This, and another example which has been given, show that these
animals are capable of great affection for each other.

The Indians also occasionally approach a herd from leeward, crawling along the ground so as
to look like huge snakes winding their way amid the snow or grass, and can thus get sufficiently
near to shoot these usually wary animals.

PART ONE, CHAPTER SIX.

RODENTS.

THE BEAVER.

Of all mammals, the beaver is the most especially fitted to enjoy a social life.  When in captivity
and away from its kind, it appears to possess but a small amount of intelligence; it forms
no attachments to its human companions, and is utterly indifferent to all around it.  But in
its native wilds, associated with others of its race, what wondrous engineering skill it exhibits,
and how curious are its domestic arrangements!

It is essentially a hard worker.  Other animals sport and play and amuse themselves.  What
young beavers may do inside their lodges, it is difficult to say; but the elders, from morn
till night, and all night long, labour at their various occupations, evidently feeling that
they were born to toil, and willingly accomplishing their destiny.

The beaver has fitly been selected as the representative animal of Canada, on account of its
industry, perseverance, and hardihood, and the resolute way in which it overcomes difficulties.
Certain conditions of country are necessary to its existence, and when it does not find these
ready formed, by a wonderful provision of Nature its instinct enables it to produce them by
its own exertions.  Where it can find rivers, brooks, and swampy lakes which maintain an even
level throughout the year, the beaver has a tolerably idle life; but as in most districts the
levels of rivers and lakes are apt to sink at various seasons if left to themselves,--whenever
an emigrant party of beavers have fixed on a new locality, they set to work to dam up the stream
or outlet of the lake, to prevent a catastrophe which might bring ruin and destruction on their
new colony.  In Nova Scotia, as well as in other parts of North America, large level spaces
are found covered with a rich alluvial soil, from which spring up waving fields of wild grass.
From this the human settler draws an abundant supply of hay for his stock in winter, and ought
to feel deeply indebted to the persevering beaver for the boon. They are known as "wild meadows,"
and are of frequent occurrence in the backwoods.  It is evident that they were formed by the
following process:--They are found in valleys through which, in ages past, a brook trickled.
A party of beavers arriving, and finding an abundance of food on the side of the hills, would
set to work to form a dam of sufficient strength to keep back the stream, till a pond was created,
on the edge of which they might build their dome-shaped habitations.  Extensive spaces in the
woods were thus inundated, and the colony of beavers lived for long years on the banks of their
artificial lakes.  They, however, lacking forethought, like many human beings, did not sufficiently
look to the future.  In process of time the trees, being destroyed, decayed and fell; while
the soil, washed down from the surrounding hills, filled up the pond constructed by the industrious
animals, and they were compelled to migrate to some other region, or were destroyed.  The dam
being thus left unrepaired, the water drained through it, and the level space was converted
into the rich meadow which has been described. Beavers' houses, however, are seen in all directions,
sometimes on the banks of these artificial ponds, at others by the sides of large lakes or
rivers.  Though varying in size, they all greatly resemble a huge bird's-nest turned upside
down.  Some are eight feet in diameter, and three feet in height; while others are very much
larger, being no less than sixteen to twenty feet in diameter, and nearly eight feet in height
on the outside, and perfectly circular and dome-shaped.  The walls and roofs of these lodges,
as they are called, are several feet in thickness, so that the measurement of the interior
chamber is little more than half that of the exterior.  Several beavers inhabit a large lodge.
Their beds, which are separated one from the other, are arranged round the walls, a space in
the centre being left free.  The exterior also presents a very rough appearance, consisting
of sticks apparently thrown loosely together, and entirely denuded of their bark, as also of
branches of trees and bushes closely interwoven and mixed with stones, gravel, or mud.  They
are close to the banks, almost overlapping the water, into which the front part is immersed.
The bottom of the stream or lake is invariably deepened in the channel approaching the entrance,
thus ensuring a free passage below the ice into the structure.  The tunnel is from two to three
feet long.  In the inner part of the hut the materials are laid with greater care, and more
firmly bound together-- with mud and grass--than on the outer.  Even in one of the larger houses
the chamber--for there is but one--is only between two and three feet in height, though as
much as nine feet in diameter.  It slopes gently upwards from the water.  Inside there are
two levels: the lower one may be called the hall.  On this the animals shake themselves when
they emerge from the subaqueous tunnel; and when dry, clamber up to the upper story, which
consists of an elevated bed of boughs running round the back of the chamber.  It is thickly
covered with dry grass and thin shavings of wood.  The whole of the interior is smooth, the
ends of the timbers and brushwood which project inwards being evenly gnawed off. There are
always two entrances--the one serving for summer, and letting in the light; while another sinks
down at a deeper angle, to enable the owners during winter to get below the water.  Beavers
are especially clean animals, and allow no rubbish to remain in their abode; and as soon as
they have nibbled off the bark from the sticks, they carry them outside, and place them on
the roof of their hut, to increase its thickness, or let them float down the stream.

During the summer they are employed all day in ranging the banks and cutting provisions for
their winter consumption, all their architectural occupations being carried on at night.  Their
winter stock of food consists of short lengths of willow and poplar,--the bark of which only,
however, they eat.  These they sink with mud or stones in some quiet pool near their lodge,
and when required for food they dive down below the ice and bring up as many as are required
for family consumption. Besides their lodge, they form in the neighbourhood a long burrow sufficiently
broad to enable them to turn with ease.  The entrance is at a considerable depth below the
surface of the water, and extends from ten to twenty feet into the bank.  This burrow serves
as a safe retreat, should their house be broken into, and thither they immediately fly when
their permanent abode is attacked.  In summer they regale themselves on the roots of the yellow
lilies, as well as on other succulent vegetation, and any fruits the country affords.

But it is time that we should get a look at the curious animal itself. We may paddle gently
in a birch-bark canoe over a calm lake, and conceal ourselves among the tall grass in some
quiet cove where the yellow water-lilies float on the tranquil surface.  Through the still
air of evening, the sound of the distant waterfall reaches our ears.  Wood ducks fly by in
vast numbers; the rich glow of the evening sky, still suffused with the gorgeous hues of the
setting sun, is reflected on the mirror-like expanse of water.  Watching with eager eyes, we
see at length the water breaking some forty yards away, and the head and back of an animal
appears in sight.  Now another, and then a third, come into view.  After cautiously glancing
around, the creatures dive, with a roll like that of a porpoise, but shortly appear again.
Our Indian, pushing the light canoe from amid the grass, paddles forward with eager strokes.
One of our party fires, and misses, the echoes resounding from the wood-covered shores, and
from island to island, till lost in the distance; but the cautious animals, forewarned, take
good care not to appear again during that evening.  We find that our only prospect of examining
them is by trapping one in the usual Indian fashion, which we will by-and-by describe.

Mr Beaver, as the Indians are fond of calling the animal, has a body about three feet long,
exclusive of the tail, which is a foot more.  He wears on his back a coat of long shining hair,
generally of a light chestnut colour, but sometimes of a much darker hue, occasionally perfectly
black.  Below the hair, next the skin, is a fine, soft, greyish-brown wool.  He may be known
at once by his broad horizontal flattened tail, which is nearly of an oval form, but rises
into a slight convexity on its upper surface, and is covered with scales.  His fore-feet are
armed with nails, and serve for the purpose of hands-- indeed, he vies with the monkey in the
use he can make of them.  The hind-feet are webbed, and with these--together with his tail,
which acts as a rudder--he is enabled to swim rapidly through the water.  The beaver is a rodent,
with a short head and broad blunt snout, and his incisor teeth are remarkably large and hard,
enabling him to bite through wood with wonderful ease and rapidity.  So great is their hardness,
that formerly the Indians were accustomed to use them as knives for cutting bone and fashioning
their horn-tipped spears.

The beaver, it has been said, always chooses banks by the side of a lake or river of sufficient
depth to escape being frozen to the bottom, even during the hardest frost.  Thus, he can at
all times obtain a supply of water, on which his existence depends; indeed, the bark on which
he lives requires to be moistened before it becomes fit for food.  When instinct teaches a
colony of beavers that the water is not of sufficient depth to escape freezing throughout,
they provide against the evil by making such a dam as has been mentioned, across the stream,
or the outlet of the lake, at a convenient distance from their habitations. The plan of these
dams varies according to the character of the lake or stream.  If the current is but slight,
they build the dam almost straight; but where the water runs at a rapid rate, it is almost
always constructed with a considerable curve, the convex side towards the stream.  Frequently,
in such cases, if there is any small island in the centre, it is taken advantage of, and the
dam is built out to it from either bank.  They make use of a variety of materials; employing
driftwood when it can be obtained, to save themselves the trouble of cutting down trees.  This
they tow to the spot, and sink it horizontally with mud and stones.  They also employ pieces
of green willows, birch, and poplars, intermixing the whole with mud and gravel, in a manner
which contributes greatly to the strength of the dam.  They observe, however, no order or method
in the work, placing their materials as they can obtain them, except that they make the dam
maintain its regular sweep, and form all parts of equal strength.  They carry the mud and stones
in their fore-paws; and in one night will collect as much as amounts to many thousands of their
little loads.  When driftwood is not to be found, they obtain the timber they require from
the groves skirting the lake or pond.  To do this, they squat on their hams, and rapidly gnaw
through the stems of trees from six to twelve or fourteen inches in diameter, with their powerful
incisors.  Sometimes a tree will not fall prostrate, the boughs being caught by its neighbours.
But the beaver is not to be disappointed; he sets to work and gnaws away a little above the
first place, thus giving it a fresh start, in order that the impetus may disengage it from
the branches which keep it up. The tree being cut up, the beavers, uniting, tow the pieces
down to the dam.  They then plunge into the water and bring up the mud and small stones with
which to keep it sunk.  A long constructed dam, by being frequently repaired with fresh mud,
becomes at length a solid bank, capable of resisting a heavy rush, either of water or ice;
and as the willow, poplar, and birch generally take root and shoot up, they by degrees form
a regularly planted hedge, which in some places becomes so tall that birds have been known
to build their nests among the branches. These beaver dams also form bridges, over which two
or three men may pass abreast, and lead their horses, without risk of breaking through. So
rapidly do the members of the industrious community labour, that even the most serious damage
to their dams, or habitations, is quickly repaired.  They always carry the mud and stones in
their fore-paws, pressed against their chins, but they drag the wood with their teeth.

The creature does not employ its broad tail, as was once supposed, to plaster down its mud-work,
nor does it use it as a vehicle for transporting materials; its sole object being to guide
it when in the water, and as a counterpoise, by moving it in an upward direction, to the tendency
it would otherwise have of sinking head-foremost.  The creatures cover the outside of their
houses every autumn with fresh mud as soon as the frost becomes severe.  By this means it freezes
as hard as stone, and prevents their common enemy, the wolverene, disturbing them during the
winter.  From the beaver being seen to flap its tail when moving over its work, but especially
when about to plunge into the water, has arisen the idea that it uses this member as a trowel.
This custom it preserves even when it becomes tame and domesticated, particularly when suddenly
startled.

The beaver, says Captain Hardy, travels a long distance from his house in search of materials,
both for building and food.  He mentions having seen the stumps of some trees which had been
felled, at least three-quarters of a mile from the beaver lodges.  Its towing power in the
water, and that of traction on dry land, is astonishing.  The following account shows the coolness
and enterprise of the animals, described by a witness to the fact:--The narrator having constructed
a raft for the purpose of poling round the edge of the lake to get at the houses of the beaver,
which were built in a swampy savannah, otherwise inaccessible, it had been left in the evening
moored at the edge of the lake, close to the camp, and about a quarter of a mile from the nearest
beaver's house, the poles lying on it.  Next morning, on going down to the raft, the poles
were missing; so, cutting fresh ones, he started with the Indians towards the beaver village.
On reaching their abodes, one of the poles was found deposited on the top of the houses.

In a community of beavers there are frequently some who appear to do no work, and are called
by the Canadian trappers Les paresseux, or Idlers.  They live apart from the rest, taking up
their abodes in long tunnels, which they excavate.  Several inhabit the same burrow; and being
males, the idea is that they have been conquered in the combats which take place among the
males when seeking their mates, and thus, like monks of old, have retired from the world,--or
perhaps it may be only for a period, till they have regained sufficient courage and strength
to sally forth, and commence a happier existence with the partner of their choice.  They are
far more careless of their safety than the other beavers, and are thus easily caught by the
trappers.

The body of the beaver contains a curious odoriferous substance, called by the trappers barkstone,
but more scientifically "castor," or "castoreum."  It is contained in two little bags about
the size of a hen's egg, and is of a brownish, unctuous consistency.  At one time it was supposed
to possess valuable medicinal properties.  It is now, however, chiefly employed by perfumers.
The beavers themselves are strangely attracted by this substance, and when scenting it at a
distance will invariably make their way to it.  It is said that the inhabitants of a particular
lodge go forth, and having rid themselves of their superabundant castoreum at a little distance,
return home; when the beavers of another lodge, scenting the castoreum, proceed to the same
spot, and covering it over with a layer of earth and leaves, deposit their own castoreum upon
the heap.  After a time, the former beavers go through the same process; and this is continued
until a mound of three or four feet in height has been raised.  It is difficult to account
for the object of this strange proceeding.  It was not, however, till of late years that the
sagacious Indians discovered that the castoreum was a certain bait for the animals themselves.
Formerly, the bait they employed was a piece of green aspen, beaten up, and placed near the
trap.  At length an Indian tried whether a male might not be caught by adding some of the castoreum.
By that time steel traps had been introduced, instead of the clumsy wooden traps before used.
Not only were the males caught, but the females also; and the trappers were now able with their
steel traps to catch vast numbers of the infatuated animals.  It is said that the creatures,
when perceiving the scent, will sit upright, snuffing about in every direction, and squealing
with excitement.  The younger animals, however, are those chiefly caught. The old ones are
often too cunning; and it is affirmed that, instead of touching the bait, they will cover up
the trap with mud and stones till a mound has been raised, and then, depositing their superabundant
castoreum upon it, take their departure.

We must conclude our account by again quoting Captain Hardy.  Of the infatuation of this animal
for castoreum he saw several instances.  "A trap was fastened by its steel chain to a stake,
to prevent the beaver, when caught, taking it away.  It slipped, however, and the beaver swam
away with the trap, and it was looked upon as lost.  Two nights afterwards he was again taken
in a trap, with the other fast on his thigh.  Another time a beaver, passing over a trap to
get the castoreum, had his hind-leg broken.  With his teeth he cut the broken leg off, and
went away.  It was supposed that he would not come again; but two nights afterwards he was
found fast in a trap--in each case tempted by the castoreum.  The stake was always licked,
or sucked, clean.  The substance seems to act as a soporific, as the creatures, after tasting
it, always remain a day without coming out of their houses.  So wary generally are the beavers,
that a trapper is always careful not to leave his scent on the spot.  To avoid this he frequently
cuts down a tree, and walks on its branches towards the edge of the path, afterwards withdrawing
it, and plentifully sprinkling water around."

The Indians and Canadian voyageurs eat the flesh of the beaver, esteeming it, when roasted
with the skin on--the hair having been singed off--the most dainty of dishes.  Early in this
century, when beaver fur was much in demand for the manufacture of hats, upwards of 120,000
skins were exported from Quebec alone in one year.  The warfare long waged against the unfortunate
rodents now goes on with somewhat diminished activity.  A change of fashion--the substitution
of silk for beaver--has probably saved them from utter extermination.  The scientific name
of their tribe, Castor, was long a popular term for a hat; but now that their fur has ceased
to be employed as formerly, the term itself appears to have gone out of use.

THE MUSK-RAT, OR MUSQUASH.

Voyaging along the margin of a lake, we may see on the shores numbers of little flattened oval
nests composed of reeds and sedges, while numerous holes in the bank, with quantities of shells,
chiefly of the fresh-water mussel, scattered round, show the entrance to the habitations of
the musquash, or ondatra, called also the musk-rat.  As evening approaches, the creatures may
be seen in fine balmy weather gambolling on the surface, swimming rapidly here and there, or
now and then diving below, apparently fearless of the passing canoe.  The little sedge-built
hut of the water-rat is constructed much in the same way as the beaver's larger mansion.  The
creature itself looks somewhat like the beaver, and some of its habits are also similar.  It
is rather more than two feet in total length, of which measurement about ten inches is occupied
by the tail.  The upper part of the body is of a dark brown colour, tinged in parts with a
reddish hue, while the lower part is ashy grey.  Its tail is flattened, but vertical.  Like
the beaver, it is furnished with an undercoat of soft downy fur.  Its safety has been provided
for by its peculiar colour, which is so like that of the muddy bank on which it dwells, that
a keen eye can alone detect it.  Its hinder feet are webbed, the imprint on the soft mud being
very similar to that of a duck.  With the exception of the flesh of the water-mussel, its food
is vegetable.  It is a great depredator in gardens, which it has been known to plunder of carrots,
turnips, and maize--the stalks of which it cuts close down to the ground.

It is sought-for on account of its fur, which is very valuable.  The traps are set close to
a tree, and when one of the creatures is caught, its companions will instantly attack it and
tear it to pieces. Generally, however, in its struggles to get free, it carries the trap under
the surface, and is thus drowned.

Audubon, the naturalist, gives us an interesting description of them:--"They are very lively,
playful animals, when in their proper element--the water--and on a calm night, in a sequestered
pool, may often be seen crossing and recrossing in every direction, leaving long ripples in
the water behind them, while others stand for a few moments on tufts of grass, stones, or logs,
and then plunge over, one after the other, into the water.  At the same time others are feeding
on the grassy bank, dragging off the roots of various kinds of plants, or digging underneath
the edge.  These animals seem to form a little community of social playful creatures, who only
require to be unmolested in order to be happy."

It has been proposed to acclimatise these little rodents in England, under the idea that thus
a valuable addition to the bank fauna of sluggish English streams would be obtained.

PRAIRIE-DOGS.

Vast cities, with regularly laid streets, are often met with in extensive level spots on the
prairie.  The inhabitants are, however, not men, but creatures the size of a guinea-pig--rodents--a
species of marmot.  In their habit of associating together in communities, they put us in mind
of the industrious beaver; but they are idle little fellows, evidently liking play better than
work.  Their heads are not unlike those of young terrier-pups, and their bodies are of a light
brown colour.  They have little stumpy tails, which, when excited, they constantly jerk up
and twist about in a curious fashion.  Their habitations are regular cones raised two or three
feet above the ground, with a hole in the apex, which is vertical for the depth of two or three
feet, and then descends obliquely into the interior.  From the peculiar yelp or short squeaky
bark which they give, the hunters call them prairie-dogs.

In each separate community, which consists of many thousand individuals, there is a president
dog, who seems to have especial charge of the rest. As a stranger approaches, the creatures
who are out of their houses scamper back as fast as their legs will carry them, and concealing
all but their heads and tails, utter loud barks at the intruder.  This done, the greater number
dive out of sight with a curious somersault, their little tails whisking in the air.  The chief
dog, and perhaps two or three other sentinels with him, remain on the tops of their houses
barking lustily till the enemy gets within a few paces of them, when they also disappear, and
the town remains silent and deserted.  The traveller who wishes to observe their habits, by
lying concealed and silent for a few minutes, may see after a time some little fellow pop his
head out of his house, when he gives a few barks.  It serves as a signal to the rest that danger
has disappeared, and immediately the others emerge from their houses and begin to frisk about
as usual.

The holes of these curious creatures are shared by two very different species of guests, one
of which, at all events, must prove most, unwelcome.  One of these is a little owl, which may
be seen sitting in front of the burrows or flying about near the ground; or, when the sun sinks
low, hopping through the town, and picking up the lizards and chameleons which everywhere abound.
He can apparently do no harm to the inhabitants, if he fails to benefit them.  The other inmates
are rattlesnakes, who, regardless of any objections which may be raised by the dogs, take possession
of their holes, and when the sun shines lie coiled up at their sides, now and then erecting
their treacherous heads and rattling an angry note of warning, should a thoughtless pup by
any chance approach too near.  The Indians suppose that all three creatures live on the most
friendly footing; but as the rattlesnakes when killed have frequently been found with the bodies
of the little prairie-dogs in their insides, their object in establishing themselves in the
locality seems very evident.

The poor little dog, indeed, leads a life of constant alarm, with numerous enemies ever on
the watch to surprise him.  Hawks and eagles, hovering high in air, often pounce down and carry
off unfortunate members of the community in their powerful talons.  The savage cayote, or prairie-wolf,
when pressed by hunger during the winter, frequently attacks the dome-shaped habitation of
the little animal, and with claws and teeth tears to pieces the walls, plunging his nose into
the passage which he has opened, and working his way down till he seizes the trembling little
inmate, who in vain retreats to the inmost recesses of his abode.

It has been supposed that the prairie-dog hibernates; but this is not the case, though he lays
in a store of provision for winter consumption--he being as lively at that period as at any
other, though he wisely prefers keeping within the house while the icy blasts blow across the
plains.  The creature is especially tenacious of life, and even when shot through the body
will manage to gain his burrow at rapid speed.  He does not run into it, but, like the rabbit,
he makes a jump in the air, turns what looks like a somersault, and, flourishing his hind-legs
and whisking his tail, disappears as if by magic.  In an instant afterwards, however, his little
sparkling eyes and nose may be seen above the ground; and if no stranger is in sight, he, with
the rest of the community, will commence gambolling and frisking about, forgetful of his numerous
foes and previous alarm.  It is very difficult to obtain a specimen of the prairie-dog, as,
even if mortally wounded, he generally tumbles into his hole before being captured.  The inhabitants
of the plain, however, manage to catch the animal alive by dragging a cask of water to one
of their holes which does not communicate with the rest of the village.  They then pour the
water down the hole, either drowning the creature or compelling him to come out.  He is very
soon reconciled to a state of captivity, and after two days appears on the most intimate terms
with his captors.  Even when turned loose again the creatures will not leave the neighbourhood
of the house, but burrow under the foundation, making themselves quite at home, and fearlessly
come out to be fed when summoned by a whistle.  They become, indeed, very interesting and pretty
little pets.

We shall meet with a similar animal on the pampas of South America, and which has also the
companionship of a little owl.

There are several other species of marmot in America.  One is called the Quebec Marmot, which
lives a solitary life, making an almost perpendicular burrow in dry ground at a distance from
water.

The beautiful little, often-tamed Woodchuck, is another American marmot. It makes a deep burrow
in the sides of hills, lining the chamber at the inner end with dry leaves and grass.  It may
frequently be seen by the traveller running rapidly along the tops of fences, as if to keep
company with him--now getting ahead, then stopping and looking back to see if he is coming,
and then going on again, till, growing tired of the amusement, it gives a last stare and then
scampers back the way it has come.

THE PORCUPINE.

Unattractive as the fretful porcupine appears when considered as a means of satisfying man's
hunger, it is hunted throughout North America for the sake of its flesh, which forms an especially
dainty dish, not only in the opinion of the Indians, but in that of every European who has
partaken of it.  The creature dwells in small caverns, either under a pile of boulders, or
amid the roots of large trees; but it also, with its sharp claws, easily climbs up the trunks,
and may sometimes be seen reposing on their very summits, where it feeds on the bark of the
young branches, or the berries when they become ripe.

The Canadian porcupine is also known as the cawquaw or urson.  It is nearly four feet long
altogether, the head and body measuring upwards of three feet, while the tail is about three
inches in length.  It is less completely defended with spines than the porcupines of other
countries-- part of its body being covered with long, coarse brown hair, which almost conceals
the deeply-set, short, pointed quills, except those on the head, hind-quarters, and tail. 
The spines are about three inches long.  When the animal is brought to bay, it sets them up
in a fan-like shape, and presents a formidable row of points turned towards its opponent. 
When attacked, it defends itself with its thick, muscular tail; and wherever it strikes, it
leaves a number of its easily-detached quills, with barbed points, sticking firmly in its opponent's
body. These spines are of a dull white colour, the points being dark.  Awkward as the porcupine
looks, it can gallop along at considerable speed; and when surprised, generally escapes to
its rocky den--or if it gains a tree, scrambles up the trunk at a rapid rate.  A broad trail
leads to the porcupine's den, by which it is easily discovered, as also by the ordure outside
the entrance.  A number of these paths lead from the den to its feeding-ground: in the autumn
to a beech grove, on the mast or nuts of which it revels; and in the winter-time, to some tall
hemlock or spruce trees.  The Indian hunter also discovers it by the marks of its claws on
the bark; and should he be unfortunate in his search for larger game, he seldom fails to obtain
a roast of porcupine.  The creature is hunted by the Indians with little dogs, which seem to
take great delight in the sport, and, in spite of the formidable weapons of their opponents,
will rush in and draw them out of their dens without injury to themselves.  Even the settlers'
dogs exhibit the same strong fancy for hunting porcupines, but are not so successful in coming
off without injury; indeed, they often issue from the combat covered over with spines sticking
in their flesh.

Captain Hardy gives us an anecdote of the extraordinary fancy the Indian dogs have for hunting
porcupines.  One of these dogs was quite blind; and yet, if the porcupine "treed," the little
animal would sit down beneath, occasionally barking to inform his master where lodged the fretful
one.  Another dog was not to be beaten when once on a porcupine. If the animal was in its den,
in he went, and, if possible, would haul it out by the tail; if not strong enough, his master
would fasten a handkerchief round his middle, and attach to it a long twisted withe. The dog
would go in, and presently, between the two, out would come the porcupine.

By the end of the "fall," the animal becomes loaded with fat, from feeding on the berries found
in the "barrens."  Its cry is a plaintive, whining sound, not very dissimilar to that of a
calf moose.  The female produces two at a birth early in the spring.  The porcupine can easily
be tamed; and Audubon mentions one which was so entirely domesticated, that it would come voluntarily
to its master, and take fruit or vegetables out of his hand, rubbing against him as does an
affectionate cat.  The same animal, however, showed considerable courage.  On one occasion
it was attacked by a ferocious mastiff.  One morning the dog was seen making a dash at some
object in the corner of the fence.  This proved to be the tame porcupine, which had escaped
from its cage.  The dog seemed regardless of all its threats, and probably supposing it to
be an animal not more formidable than a cat, sprang at it with open mouth.  The porcupine seemed
to swell up, in an instant, to nearly double its size; and as the dog sprang upon it, dealt
him such a sidewise blow with the tail, as to cause the mastiff to relinquish his hold instantly,
and set up a howl of pain.  His mouth and nose were full of quills.  He could not close his
jaws, but hurried, open-mouthed, off the premises.  Although the servants instantly extracted
the spines from the mouth of the dog, his head was terribly pierced, and it was several weeks
before he recovered.  The porcupine, however, suffered severely from the combat; and as the
hot weather came on, showed great signs of distress, and finally died of heat.

The quills of the porcupine are brilliantly stained by the Indians with a variety of colours,
and are extensively used by their squaws in ornamenting with fanciful patterns the birch-bark
ware which they sell to the white settlers.

PART ONE, CHAPTER SEVEN.

CARNIVORA.

THE BLACK BEAR.

Several species of the bear tribe inhabit America; the two most numerous of which are the black
bear, or musquaw, and the far-famed ferocious grizzly bear of the Rocky Mountains.  The black
bear is found generally among the forests and plains of the east, though the grizzly also descends
from his mountain fastnesses, and makes his way through the low country to a considerable distance
from his usual abode.  Although the black bear has not obtained the same character for fierceness
as his grizzly relative, he often proves a formidable opponent when attacked by human foes,
and is also dreaded on account of his depredations among their flocks and herds.  He is, indeed,
a monstrous and powerful animal, often reaching six feet in length from the muzzle to the tail--the
tail being only about two inches long--while he stands from three to three and a half feet
in height at the shoulder.  He is covered with a smooth and glossy coat of thick hair, without
any wool at the base.  He does not always wear a black suit; sometimes he puts on a brown one.
When his coat is perfectly black, he has a cinnamon patch on his muzzle.  He varies, too, in
shape.  Occasionally he is long and low, at others his body is short,--and he has great length
of limb.  Under ordinary circumstances, he restricts himself to a vegetable diet, but is very
fond of a small species of snail which feeds on the prairie grass; and, like others of his
relatives, he is greatly addicted to honey.  As his feet are furnished with strong sharp claws,
he is able to make his way up the trunks of trees to reach his favourite food.  In this object
he displays great perseverance and acuteness.  However high up it may be, or in positions most
difficult of access, he will manage to reach the combs containing the sweet repast.  Should
the comb be hidden away in the hollow of some aged tree, with an entrance too small for admitting
his huge paw, he sets to work with his teeth, and gnaws away the wood till he has formed a
breach of sufficient size to allow him to put it in.  He is utterly regardless of the assaults
of the tiny inhabitants of the comb; and scooping out their honey and young together with his
fore-paws, devours the whole mass.  He will sometimes, when pressed by hunger, break into the
settler's barn and carry off sheep, pigs, and small cattle into the neighbouring woods; and
so cunning is he, that it is not often he is overtaken, or entrapped in the snare laid for
his capture.

The Indians of Nova Scotia call him Mooin, which reminds us of Bruin. The Indians throughout
the country pay great respect to the bear, having, like the Esquimaux, a high opinion of his
intellectual powers, and believing that he is in some way related to them, and possessed of
an almost human spirit.  Still, they do not scruple to kill him; but as soon as the breath
is out of his body, they cut off his head, which they place ceremoniously within a mat decorated
with a variety of ornaments. They then blow tobacco-smoke into the nostrils, and the chief
hunter, praising his courage, and paying a variety of compliments to his surviving relatives,
expresses regret at having been compelled to deprive him of life, and his hope that his own
conduct has been altogether satisfactory to Mr Mooin, and worthy of the renown they have both
attained.

The musquaw hibernates, like other bears of northern regions, and is very particular in selecting
a dry cave for his long winter's nap.  At the "fall," he is especially fat, having lived for
some time on the beech-mast, blue-berries, and other fruits which grow in great profusion in
the forest.  He then weighs 500 pounds, and even 600 pounds.  The chief part of the fat lies
along the back, and on either side, as in the flitch of the hog.  There is no doubt that it
is by the absorption of this fat throughout his winter fast of four months that he is enabled
to exist--at this time evaporation being at a stand-still.  Having at length selected a cavern,
or the hollow of a decayed tree, for his lair, he scrapes out all the dead leaves, till the
ground is perfectly clean and smooth.  It must be deep enough to prevent the snow from drifting
into it, and free from any water trickling down from above.  He objects especially to a habitation
which has been occupied by the porcupine, that animal being far from cleanly in its habits.
Perhaps also he has an objection to the quills with which the creature is furnished, from their
being likely to produce disagreeable wounds.  He forgets, perhaps, that the rubbish he has
scraped out will betray his abode to the hunter--which it assuredly does.  The Indian, on discovering
this indubitable sign of Mooin's abode, takes steps to arouse him and plant a bullet in his
head, or to batter out his brains with his axe.  Mooin, however, in spite of his usual sagacity,
ignorant that his abode may be discovered, perhaps already overcome with a strange desire to
sleep, crawls in for his winter's snooze.  He is frequently accompanied by a partner, who will
add to his warmth and comfort.  He there lies down with his fore-paws curled round his head
and nose, which he pokes underneath his chest.  Here he remains asleep till the warm sun of
March or April tempts him to crawl out in search of food to replenish his empty stomach and
strengthen his weakened frame.  Madam Mooin is generally, at this time, employed in the pleasing
office of increasing her family.  Her young cubs, when born, are curiously small, helpless
little beings, not larger than rats.  Generally there are two of them, and they are born about
the middle of February.  She manages to nourish them without taking any food herself till March
or April, when she also, like her better half, sallies forth in search of provender.  The young
creatures grow but slowly, and do not attain their full size till they are about four years
old.  Even when about a couple of months old, the little cubs are not much larger than a retriever
puppy of the same age.

The musquaw finds great difficulty at first in satisfying the cravings of his appetite.  He
searches for the cranberries in the open bogs, and is driven even to eat the rank marshy grass.
As the snow disappears, he seeks for wood-lice and other creatures in rotten trunks.  Hungry
as he is, he labours very patiently for his food.  The prehensile form of his lips enables
him to pick up with wonderful dexterity even the smallest insect or berry.  As the ice breaks
up in the lakes, he proceeds thither to fish for smelts and other small fish, which he catches
with wonderful dexterity with his paws, throwing them out rapidly behind him.  When, however,
pressed by hunger, and unable to obtain the smaller creatures for food, he will attack young
deer if he can take them by surprise; but as he can seldom do this, he is often tempted into
the neighbourhood of settlements.  Here he lies in wait for the cattle as they wander through
the woods to their spring pastures; and when once he has taken to this dangerous proceeding,
he is said to continue it.  On catching sight of a herd, should it not be accompanied by a
human being, he drives the animals into some boggy swamp, and there singling out a victim,
he jumps on its back, and deals it a few tremendous blows across the head and shoulders, till
the poor animal becomes an easy prey.  He then drags it off into the neighbouring wood, and
devours it at his leisure.  This habit is often the cause of his destruction.  On any remainder
of the animal being found, the aggrieved settler sets off, rifle in hand and axe in his belt,
to punish the aggressor.  The bear, he well knows, will revisit the carcass.  So cunning, however,
is Bruin, and conscious of guilt, that he is constantly on the watch, as he returns, for an
enemy. He creeps up, accordingly, looking on either side, his caution increasing as he approaches
his prey.  The hunter, therefore, to outwit him, seeks his trail in the direction in which
he has retreated, and conceals himself near it, but at some distance from the carcass.  He
waits till the sun is setting, when he is almost sure to see the bear come tripping nimbly
along, not yet thinking it necessary to employ caution.  At this moment a rifle-bullet, placed
in his head, deprives him of his intended feast and his life at the same time.

The black bear possesses wonderful strength--said to be fully equal to that of ten men.  Experiments
have been tried, in which so many persons have attempted to drag off a cask baited with molasses,
or other sweet stuff, secured to a rope, when the bear has carried it away with perfect ease,
in spite of their united efforts to draw it from him.

The most dangerous time to attack a she-bear is in the spring; when she is accompanied by her
cubs.  If she has time, she will lead them off to a place of safety; but if not, she will chase
the intruder from her domains--and woe betide him if he cannot manage to escape her claws!
Bears are easily taken in traps, baited with small bundles of sticks smeared with molasses.
They are hunted in the "fall," when they have become fat with the ample supply of blue and
whortle berries or beech-mast on which they have been feeding.  To obtain the beech-mast, Bruin
will frequently climb a tree, and sometimes, like the orang-outang of Eastern seas, will build
a rough platform for himself among the upper branches, where he can lie concealed and munch
his food at leisure.  The most certain way to obtain the animal in this case is to cut down
the tree and shoot him as he reaches the ground, for, as may be supposed, he is in no amiable
mood when thus disturbed, and, unless speedily killed, would attempt to wreak a fearful vengeance
on his assailants.  The black bear springs on his prey in the same way as does the tiger or
panther of the southern part of the continent.  He thus frequently kills the young moose, though
the full-grown animal is too active and powerful to be thus caught.  He will even attack horses
in the same way, though the latter animal often receives him with a furious kick.

In the summer, the black bears unite and hunt in gangs, making the forest resound with their
fearful snarling and loud moaning cries.  They give warning to the hunter to pile fuel on his
camp-fire, and to take his rifle in hand, for, strong in numbers, they will not hesitate to
approach him, and, if pressed by hunger, to make an assault on his camp.

THE GRIZZLY BEAR.

The most dreaded inhabitant of the Rocky Mountains and their neighbourhood, is the savage grizzly,
frequently called by the hunters Old Ephraim.  Even the bravest hunter, when making his way
through this wild region, finds it necessary to call all his courage and hardihood to his aid,
when he sees one of these huge monsters sitting upon its hind-legs prepared for a rush towards
him, and uttering a loud, harsh sound, like a person breathing quickly.  Should he not wish
for a contest, his best plan is to face the monster boldly, moving slowly on, but ever keeping
his eyes fixed on the animal.  The bear will, in most cases, after watching him attentively
for some time, turn round and gallop off.  If, however, he should lose his presence of mind,
and attempt to fly--or should he fail, when he fires, to shoot the monster through the brain--in
all probability he will quickly be torn to pieces.

The grizzly frequently attains a length of nine feet, and weighs from 700 to 800 pounds.  His
head, in proportion to his muzzle, is very large.  He has a long, narrow muzzle, somewhat flattened,
with large, powerful, canine teeth.  His eyes are small, and deeply sunk in his head.  His
tail is so short, that it is completely concealed by the surrounding hair.  He possesses remarkably
long feet, which, in the full-grown animal, are eighteen inches in length; and they are armed
with sharp and powerful claws five inches long, and so extremely sharp, that they cut into
the flesh like knives.  He can also use them separately like fingers, so that he can grasp
a dry clod of earth and crumble it to dust as a human being could do with his hand.  He can
also, with them, dig into the ground; and when the weight of his body is not too great, they
enable him to climb trees, although not with the speed of his black brother of the plains.
As acorns form a portion of his food, it is said that he will climb a tree and shake the boughs
vehemently to make them fall, when he descends and revels on the fruit his ingenuity has thus
obtained.  The hunter who has to fly for his life may however escape from a bear,--when the
monster is filled out with autumn food, and cannot manage to raise his huge body from the ground,--
by climbing a tree.

The grizzly varies much in colour.  Sometimes his fur is of a dullish brown, freckled over
with grizzly hairs; while other specimens are entirely of a steely grey.  In all cases, the
grizzly hairs give a somewhat white appearance to the surface of the fur.  When the animal
is young, his fur is of a rich brown, and often very long and thick, and much finer than that
of the adult animal.  When the creature walks, he swings his body in an odd fashion, rolling
his head, at the same time, from side to side, which gives him a remarkably awkward look. 
Although the grizzly occasionally satisfies himself with vegetable diet, he will also attack
and devour any animals he can kill.  He does not hesitate to assault the powerful bison; and
on overtaking a herd, he will spring without hesitation on the largest bull, and, with the
tremendous strokes of his powerful paws, speedily bring it to the ground, when he will without
difficulty drag the enormous carcass off to his lair, to devour it at his leisure.  All other
animals stand in awe of the grizzly; and even the largest pack of hungry wolves will not venture
to attack him, nor indeed will they touch his carcass after he has succumbed to the rifle of
the hunter.  Horses especially are terror-stricken when they scent or see a grizzly; and not
until they have been carefully trained, will they even allow the skin of one to be placed on
their backs.

The grizzly employs his claws both in digging for roots and in burying any large animal he
may have killed, to preserve the carcass till he requires it for another meal.  An anecdote
is given of a hunter who, pursued by one of these monsters, took advantage of this propensity
to save his life.  His rifle was unloaded.  Of course he had not wounded the bear, or his stratagem
would have been in vain.  Throwing himself on the ground, the hunter closed his eyes, and stretching
out his limbs, feigned to be dead.  It must have been a fearful moment when he felt the bear
lift up his body in his claws to carry him away to the neighbourhood of his lair.  The bear
having dug a hole, placed him in it, and covered him carefully with leaves, grass, and bushes.
An Indian, or hardy backwoodsman, could alone have existed under such circumstances.  The hunter
waited anxiously till he heard loud snores proceeding from the cavern.  Then, slipping up,
like Jack the Giant-killer from the castle of the ogre, he scampered off as fast as his legs
could carry him.

Mr Kane--the Canadian artist--mentions meeting a grizzly when in company with an old, experienced
half-breed hunter, Francois by name. Francois, however, declined firing, alleging that the
risk was greater than the honour to be obtained--his own character for bravery having been
long established.  Young hunters might do so for the sake of proudly wearing the claws--one
of the ornaments most esteemed by an Indian chief--round his neck.  Although Kane's gun had
two barrels, and Francois had his rifle, they knew it was ten chances to one they would not
kill him in time to prevent a hand-to-hand encounter.  The bear walked on, looking at them
now and then, but seeming to treat them with contempt.

Some years before this, a party of ten Canadian voyageurs, on a trade excursion in the neighbourhood
of the mountains, were quietly seated round a blazing fire, eating a hearty dinner of deer,
when a large, half-famished bear cautiously approached the group from behind a chestnut-tree.
Before they were aware of his presence, he sprang across the fire, seized one of the men, who
had a well-finished bone in his hand, round the waist with his two fore-paws, and ran about
fifty yards on his hind-legs with him before he stopped.  The hunter's comrades were so thunderstruck
at the unexpected appearance of such a visitor, and his sudden retreat with "pauvre" Louisson--the
man who had been carried off--that they for some time lost all presence of mind, and, in a
state of confusion, were running to and fro, each expecting in his turn to be kidnapped in
a similar manner.  At length Baptiste Le Blanc, a half-breed hunter, seized his gun, and was
in the act of firing at the bear, when he was stopped by some of the others, who told him that
he would inevitably kill their friend, owing to the position he was then in.  During this parley,
Bruin, relaxing his grasp of the captive, whom he kept securely under him, very leisurely began
picking the bone the latter had dropped.  Once or twice Louisson attempted to escape, which
only caused the bear to watch him more closely.  On his making another attempt, the bear again
seized him round the waist, and commenced giving him one of those dreadful embraces which generally
end in death.  The poor fellow was now in great agony, and gave way to the most pitiful screams.
Observing Baptiste with his gun ready, anxiously watching a safe opportunity to fire, he cried
out, "Tire! tire! mon cher frere, si tu m'aimes!  A la tete! a la tete!"  This was enough for
Le Blanc, who instantly let fire, and hit the bear over the right temple.  He fell; and at
the same moment dropped Louisson.  He gave him an ugly claw along the face, however, which
for some time afterwards spoiled his beauty. After he had tired, Le Blanc darted to his companion's
side, and with his couteau de chasse quickly finished the sufferings of the man-stealer, and
rescued his friend from impending death.  On skinning the bear, scarcely any meat was found
on his bones, showing that it was in a fit of hungry desperation that he had thus made one
of the boldest attempts at kidnapping over heard of in the legends of ursine courage.

WOLVES.

There are several species of wolves in North America: one, a large, black animal, which inhabits
the forests; and another, much smaller, which hunts the bison and deer in vast packs across
the prairie, and is called the prairie-wolf.  Like the wolf of Europe, the black wolf is a
fierce, dangerous creature, and equally cowardly.  When driven into the corner of a hut, as
has sometimes occurred, or when caught in a trap, he will not attempt to defend himself against
any person who may enter to destroy him.  Audubon mentions an instance of this.  A farmer with
whom he was staying having lost a number of his animals by wolves, dug several pitfalls in
the neighbourhood of his farm.  Three large wolves were found in the morning in one of these
traps.  The farmer, instead of shooting them from above, boldly descended into the trap, and
seizing the creatures one by one by the hind-legs, severed the chief tendon, thus preventing
their escaping.  He afterwards killed and skinned them at his leisure, their skins being of
sufficient value to repay him for the loss of his cattle.

The prairie-wolves are considerably smaller than their brethren of the woods.  They travel
in large packs, a solitary one being seldom seen. Their skins are of no value.  The Indians
will not waste their powder upon them, and they therefore multiply so greatly, that some parts
of the country are completely overrun by them.  They are, however, caught by; pitfalls covered
over with switches baited with meat.  They destroy a great number of horses, particularly in
the winter season, when the latter get entangled in the snow.  In this situation, two or three
wolves will often fasten on one animal, and speedily, with their long claws, tear it to pieces.
The horses, however, often bravely defend themselves; and Mr Goss mentions finding near the
bodies of two of these animals, which had been killed the night before, eight wolves lying
dead and maimed around,--some with their brains scattered, and others with their legs or ribs
broken.

Let us watch from an ambush the manoeuvres of a pack of savage cayotes-- the name given to
one species of wolf--while hunting their prey.  Our ears are first assailed by a few shrill,
currish barks at intervals, like the outpost firing of skirmishing parties.  These are answered
by similar barks from the opposite direction, till the sounds gradually approximate on the
junction of the different bands.  The horses, sensible of the approach of danger, begin to
paw the ground, snort, toss up their heads, look wildly about them, and exhibit other symptoms
of fear.  We prepare our guns ready for action.  Three or four stallions take the lead, and
wait, with comparative composure, for the approach of the enemy.  The allies at length enter
the field in a semicircular form, with their flanks extended, for the evident purpose of surrounding
their prey.

They are between three and four hundred strong.  The horses, from experience, know well their
object, and, dreading an encounter with so numerous a force, instantly turn round and gallop
off in a contrary direction.  Their flight is the signal for the wolves to advance.  The brutes,
uttering a simultaneous yell, charge after the fugitives, still preserving their crescent form.
Two or three horses, much out of condition, are quickly overtaken, when they commence kicking
at the advance-guard of the enemy; but though several of the wolves receive severe blows, they
will, it is evident--being reinforced by others-- quickly despatch the unfortunate horses.

It is time for us to emerge from our concealment and fire a volley at the enemy's centre, by
which several are brought down.  The whole battalion of cowards instantly wheel about, and
fly towards the hills in the utmost disorder; while the horses, hearing the sound, come galloping
up to us for protection, and by their neighing express their joy and gratitude at our timely
interference.

LYNXES.

Although lynxes are not so numerous in America as wolves, they are equally destructive, and
individually more daring--attacking deer and smaller animals when they can take them at a disadvantage.
They seldom fly, as wolves do, on the first approach of man.  In size, the largest does not
exceed the dimensions of an English mastiff.  The Canadian lynx is frequently termed the Peeshoo,
and sometimes "Le Chat" by the French Canadians.  His coat is covered with long hairs of a
dark grey hue, besprinkled with black, the extremities of which are white, with dark mottlings
here and there on the back.  Sometimes the fur is of a ruddy chestnut tinge, and the limbs
are darker than the rest of the body-- which is about three feet long.  The animal possesses
powerful limbs, and thick, heavy feet, furnished with strong, white claws.  When moving over
the ground it leaps in successive bounds, its back being slightly arched, and all its feet
pitching at the same time.  It also swims well, and can cross rivers and lakes a couple of
miles broad.  Strong as it is, it appears it is easily killed by a blow on the back with a
slight stick.  It ranges throughout the greater part of the continent, and is shot or trapped
for the sake of its fur, which is of considerable value.

THE WOLVERENE, OR GLUTTON.

The wolverene, or glutton, carries off the palm for cunning from all the other animals.  It
is also more ferocious and daring for its size than even the huge grizzly, while for voracity
it is unsurpassed.  In appearance, it is somewhat similar to a young bear.  It is of a brownish-black
colour, with a black muzzle and eyes of a dark hue, the space between them being of a brown
tint.  The paws are also quite black, contrasting with the ivory whiteness of the claws.  It
possesses large and expanded paws, to enable it to pass over frozen snow; indeed, so large
are they, that its footsteps are often mistaken for the tracks of the bear.  In one of its
habits it resembles Mr Bruin, having the custom, when it finds an animal which it cannot devour
at one meal, of carrying off the remainder and hiding it in some secure place.

The glutton moves at a somewhat slow pace, and appears rather deficient in agility; but at
the same time he is persevering and determined, and will range over a wide extent of country
in search of weak or dying animals, stealing unawares upon hares and birds, etcetera.  When
he takes a fancy to some larger quadruped as it lies asleep, he springs upon it, tearing open
the neck and throat.  He is supposed to prefer putrid flesh, and the odour which proceeds from
him would lead us to suppose that such is the case.  The trappers look upon him with especial
hatred, as, with his usual cunning, he seeks out their hoards of provisions in cache, and destroys
their marten-traps.  He himself is so sly that he is seldom caught in a snare.  When he finds
one, he approaches it from behind, and pulling it to pieces from the outside, carries off the
bait.  The marten-hunter will go forth and set a line of traps, extending to upwards of forty
miles in length or circumference. The wolverene, observing what he is about, follows at a distance,
carefully pulling the traps to pieces as he leaves them behind, and eating off the heads of
the partridges or other birds which have been used as bait, declining all the time to run his
nose into danger.  When a sable or marten is entrapped, he tears out the dead animal and carries
it away.  It is even supposed that he will attack a hibernating bear in his den, and manage
to kill him before Bruin has aroused himself sufficiently for his defence.

The wolverene is the fur-trapper's greatest foe, and, as may be supposed, he has no mercy shown
him.  The cunning creature, moreover, in spite of his cleverness, sometimes gets caught.  Mr
Paul Kane, in one of his journeys across the country, had left a cache composed of logs built
together, something like a log-house, but not very closely fitted. Impelled by hunger after
a long journey, he and his companion on their way back reached their cache, and began throwing
off the heavy logs which covered the top and concealed it.  The Indian, hearing a great disturbance
within, called to Mr Kane to fetch the guns.  Just as he got up, a fine fat wolverene jumped
out, but was immediately shot down. The creature must have been starved and desperately thin
to have squeezed himself through the openings between the logs, and no doubt, impelled by hunger
and the smell of the meat inside, had not thought much of a slight squeeze.  When, however,
he was once in, and had enjoyed a few good meals, he could not get out again, and the idea
of starving himself as long as the meat lasted did not appear to have occurred to him.

The disappointment to the hungry travellers was very great, as but little food was left, and
that was mangled, torn, and tossed about in the dirt by the animal.

THE RACCOON.

To obtain a satisfactory sight of the raccoon, we must set out into the forest by torchlight,
accompanied by dogs, with fowling-piece in hand. As he remains during the day in some hollow
tree, it is rarely we can get a good view of him.  Even if by chance found on the ground, he
ascends the tree so rapidly, that he is stowed away before our rifle can reach the shoulder.
The well-trained dog, however, quickly finds him when roving about the woods at night.

Let us accompany Audubon on a 'coon hunt.  Our native companions have gone before with the
dogs, who are baying at the raccoon in an open part of the forest.  On our coming up, a singular
scene presents itself to us.  The flare of our torch seems to distress him.  His coat is ruffled,
and his rounded tail seems thrice its ordinary size.  His eyes shine like emeralds.  With foaming
jaws he watches the dogs, ready to seize by the snout each who comes within reach.  His guttural
growlings, instead of intimidating his assailants, excite them the more.  He seizes one, however,
by the lip.  It is a dangerous proceeding, for, while thus far victorious, the other curs attack
him in flank and rear, while their companion yells pitifully.  The raccoon will not let go,
but the other dogs, seizing him fast, worry him to death.  Yet to the last he holds tightly
the dog's lip.

While we stand gazing at the poor animal, all around is, by the flare of the torch, rendered
trebly dark and dismal.  It is a scene for a skilful painter.

The raccoon is about the same size as a small fox, and though somewhat like it, has also rather
an ursine appearance.  He has a tufted tail marked with black and white bands.  The head tapers
somewhat like that of the fox, but the ears are short and slightly rounded, the forehead broad,
and the nose sharp.  The fore-legs being shorter than the hinder, when he stands the tail end
of his body is lifted higher than the front, and consequently his back appears curved.  He
walks like the dog, putting the tips of his toes to the ground; but when he stops he lays his
feet flat.

He receives no mercy from the farmers, for he is of a sanguinary and savage disposition, and
commits great havoc among domestic as well as wild birds, always destroying far more than he
requires; merely eating off their heads, or lapping up the blood which flows from their wounds.
He commits occasionally ravages in sugar-cane or Indian-corn plantations; and, climbing with
ease, catches birds, and devours their eggs.  He resembles the squirrel in his movements; and,
like that animal, when eating, sits on his hind-legs, and uses his fore-feet to carry his food
to his mouth.  A story is told of a young tame raccoon let loose in a poultry-yard, when, his
natural disposition overcoming his civilised manners, he sprang on a cock strutting in a dignified
fashion among the hens, and fixed himself on its back.  The bird, surprised at so unusual an
attack, began scampering round the yard, the hens scattering far and wide in the utmost confusion.
Still the little animal kept his seat, till he managed to get hold of the unfortunate cock's
head in his jaws, and before the bird could be rescued, had crunched it up--still keeping his
seat, in spite of the dying struggles of his victim; and probably, had he not been bagged,
would have treated all the feathered inhabitants of the yard in the same fashion.  When out
hunting on his own account, he often hides himself among the long reeds on the bank of a lake
or stream, and pouncing out on the wild ducks as they swim incautiously by, treats them as
he does the domestic fowls on shore.

He partakes considerably of the cunning of the fox, yet, like that animal, is frequently outwitted.
A raccoon after a long chase managed to reach a tree, which he quickly climbed, with the aid
of his claws, snugly ensconcing himself in the deserted nest of a crow.  In vain the hunters
sought for him, till his long, annulated tail, which he had forgotten to coil up within the
nest, was seen pendent below it; and the poor raccoon was quickly brought to the ground by
a rifle ball.

He has gained the name of the lotor, or the washer, in consequence of his habit of plunging
his dry food into water before eating it.  He also drinks a large quantity of water.  When
moistening his food, he grasps it with both his fore-paws, moving it violently backwards and
forwards, as a person does washing clothes in a stream.  The German naturalists call him the
washing-bear.  Though savage and bloodthirsty in his wild state, he is frequently tamed; but
he is somewhat capricious in temper, and not easily reconciled when offended.  It is curious
that he should, when domesticated, change his usual custom of sleeping in the daytime and wandering
about at night; but this he does, remaining quiet all night, and making his appearance among
the inmates of the house as soon as the sun sheds its light abroad.  Though in his wild state
a fit member for a temperance society, he will when in captivity, as if to recompense himself
for his hard lot, drink fermented liquors of all sorts--the stronger and sweeter the better.
An old writer on American animals says, in reference to this propensity, that if taken young
it is easily made tame, but "is the drunkenest creature alive, if he can get any liquor that
is sweet and strong."  The same writer states that the cunning raccoon often catches crabs
by inserting one of his feet into their holes, and dragging them out as soon as they seize
hold of it.

THE AGOUAHA, OR CRAB-EATING RACCOON.

In the Southern States we find another species of raccoon, somewhat larger than the former,
who is addicted to eating molluscs and crustaceans, whether marine or terrestrial.  It is said,
also, that when other means fail of obtaining food, he seats himself on a branch hanging low
down over some quiet pool, and using his flexible tail as a fishing-line, waits patiently till
its end is caught hold of by a snapping turtle or other inhabitant of the water, when, whisking
it up, he tears open the creature's shell and devours the luscious flesh with aldermanic relish.
The fur is generally of a blackish-grey hue, washed with a tinge of yellow.  A blacker tint
prevails on the head, neck, and along the spine.  His tail, in proportion to the size of his
body, is shorter than that of the common raccoon, and is marked with six black rings, upon
a blackish-yellow ground.

THE ERMINE.

When we see the judge seated in his richly trimmed robe of ermine-- emblem of purity--or call
to mind the regal robes of a proud monarch, we are apt to forget that the fur which we so much
admire is but that of the detested stoat, turned white during his abode amid the winter's snow
of a northern clime.  He is not unlike the weasel, especially when clothed in his darker summer
dress, but with a less ruddy hue.  The edges of the ears and the toes always remain white.

He is considerably larger than the weasel, measuring upwards of fourteen inches, including
the tail--which is about four inches long, the tip almost black.  He is a bold hunter, and
follows and destroys the hare, and other animals of equal size.  It is said, even, that several
together will venture to attack a man.  They are caught in America by traps, which, giving
the animal a sudden blow, kill it without injuring the skin.

The winter coat of the ermine is produced by the whitening of the fur, and not, as was once
supposed, by the substitution of white for dark hairs.  Probably one cause of this change of
hue may be that the energies of the creature concentrate themselves on the vital organs, to
enable it to resist the extreme low temperature of the icy regions it inhabits, and cannot
thus spare a sufficient amount of blood for the formation of the colouring matter which tinges
the hair.  Human beings as well as animals become weaker as they increase in age; and it has
been observed that their hair also loses its colour, in consequence of such energies as they
possess being required to assist the more important functions of nature.  This corroborates
the correctness of the former remark.

The ermine, like other species of its genus, has the faculty of ejecting a fluid of a strong
musky odour.  It is abundant, not only in the barren grounds of the Hudson Bay territories,
but is also found in Norway and Siberia.

When the fur is used for robes, or similar purposes, the black tuft at the end of the tail
is sewn on at regular distances to the skin, giving to the ermine fur the appearance we are
all familiar with.

THE PINE-MARTEN.

The pine-marten, a species of weasel, obtains its name from being found amid pine-forests,
and from its habit of climbing the trunks of pines in search of prey.  It is a fierce and savage
creature, choosing to live alone, away from the haunts of man.  It is from eighteen to twenty
inches in length--with a tail measuring about ten inches--and is covered with long bushy hair.
Moving without difficulty among the branches, it seizes many an unfortunate bird in its deadly
gripe before its victim can take to flight--robbing also the nest of the eggs within it.

It is common in Europe, as well as in America; but in the cold regions of the Hudson Bay Company
it is hunted for the sake of its skin, which is, when blanched during the winter's cold, scarcely
inferior to that of the celebrated sable.

When pursued and overtaken, it stands at bay, exhibiting its teeth, erecting its hair, arching
its back, and hissing like a cat.  It forms its burrows in the ground, the female producing,
a litter of from four to seven.  Like other animals of its tribe, it emits a peculiar musky smell.

THE OTTER.

In winter, along the steep banks of the frozen streams, smooth and shining tracks may be readily
detected.  They are produced by otters, which have a curious habit of sliding downwards for
their amusement-- much as human beings are accustomed to do in Canada in their toboggans. To
do this, they lie on their bellies, with their fore-legs bent backwards, and giving themselves
an impetus with their hind-legs, down they glide, at a swift rate, upon the ice.  This sport
they will continue for some time, climbing up again to the top of the bank, and repeating the
process over and over again.  They are also accustomed to pass through the woods from lake
to lake, making a direct track in the snow.  These tracks are easily known.  Then comes a broad
trail, as if made by a cart-wheel.  This is formed by the animal throwing itself on its belly,
and thus sliding along over the surface for several yards. These places are called "otter rubs."

There are two species of otter in North America--one on the east, and the other on the Pacific
slope--differing slightly from each other.  The former is considerably larger than that of
the Old World, measuring, from the nose to the tip of the tail, sometimes from four and a half
to five feet.  Like most other water animals, it possesses two sorts of hair: the one is long
and shining, and of a rich brown colour, except on the throat, which is of a dusky white; the
other is very fine and soft, lying next the skin, and serving to protect it from the extremes
of heat and cold.  It has excessively sharp, short teeth, which enable it to hold fast the
fish, on which it chiefly feeds.  Its body is elongated and much flattened, and the tail, which
is of great length, is also flat and broad.  The legs are short and strong, and so loosely
jointed that it can turn them in any direction when swimming.

The habitations of otters are formed in the banks of rivers or lakes, and are not altogether
of an artificial character, as they prefer occupying any deserted hollow or natural crevice
to the trouble of digging burrows for themselves.  Though they are very playful animals, and
delight apparently in sport, they are somewhat of a savage disposition, and must be taken very
young to be domesticated.  They are cautious, timid animals, and can seldom be approached unawares.
They eat all sorts of fresh-water fish, such as trout, perch, eels, and suckers; and will also
devour frogs.  Occasionally they may be observed on a rocky islet of some lone stream, resting
after a banquet, or about to plunge into the water in chase of one of the finny tribe, which
their keen eyes detect swimming by.  They are trapped, in Canada, by steel traps, which are
submerged close to the bank below their "rubs."  They make a peculiar whistling sound, which
the Indian can imitate perfectly, and thus frequently induces them to approach.  Their skins
are manufactured into muffs and trimmings and caps, such as are usually worn in winter by Canadians.

An otter, when attacked, will defend itself with desperation, snapping furiously at the Indian,
and then shaking its head violently as a dog does when destroying a rat.  Their bite is severe--sufficient
indeed to snap off a man's finger--and when once its jaws are closed, no power is capable of
making it relinquish its grasp.  The Canadians do not attempt to tame the otter; but the persevering
Chinese not only contrive to domesticate the species found in their country, but teach them
to capture fish for their benefit.

THE SKUNK.

Rambling amid the woods, even in the neighbourhood of settlements, we may occasionally come
upon a curious little animal, with a party-coloured coat and bushy tail, and an amiable and
gentle appearance.  The creature appears to be in no way timid, and will very likely await
our approach.  As we draw near it, however, it is apt to turn round and erect its bushy tail
perpendicularly.  Let us beware of what we are about, for, in a moment, the creature may send
over us a shower of a substance so horribly odious, that not only may we be blinded and sickened
by the effluvium, but our clothes will be made useless, from the difficulty of getting rid
of the odour.

The creature is the skunk, and is about the size of a cat.  It possesses short round ears,
black cheeks, and a white stripe extending from the nose to the back.  The upper part of the
neck and the whole back are white, divided by a black line.  Below, it is black, as are the
legs; and it has a full tail of coarse black hair, occasionally tipped with white.  Its legs
are short, and it does not possess much activity.  Its feet are armed with claws, somewhat
like those of the badger.

It appears to use this horrid effluvium--which is generated in glands near the tail--as a means
of defence.  All other animals have a due horror of it.  Anything which it touches is tainted:
provisions are destroyed; and clothes, though often washed, will retain the smell for many
weeks.  At one time this substance was used for medicinal purposes. The mode of defence bestowed
on the skunk is somewhat similar to that employed by the cuttle-fish, which emits a dark liquor
when pursued. Those who have once smelt the horribly fetid odour of the skunk will not easily
forget it.

THE PEKAN, OR WOOD-SHOCK.

Still keeping to the lakes and streams, we may often fall in with a creature of curious habits,
which, unlike those just described, lives almost entirely among the branches of the trees.
In shape it is somewhat like a weasel, and is the largest of the tree martens.  It is known
as the wood-shock or pekan, and is also called the black cat, and fisher.  This last term is
inappropriate, as it is not in any way piscivorous.  It is of a dark brown hue, with a line
of black shining hair reaching from the neck to the extremity of the tail.  The under parts
are lighter; some entirely white.  It possesses also a very large, full, and expressive eye.

Though spending its time among the trees, hunting for its prey, it forms a burrow in the ground
for its usual habitation.  It lives upon squirrels and rabbits, as well as grouse and other
birds and their eggs. Not only does it venture to attack the well-armed porcupine, but it kills
the animal, and eats it up, quills and all.  The difficulty of accomplishing this appears very
great, but there are numerous instances in which pekans have been killed, when their bodies
were found full of quills, from which they did not appear to have suffered.  They eat up, indeed,
both the flesh and bones of the porcupine--the latter being so strong that a small bird cannot
crack them.  Mr Downs, the naturalist of Nova Scotia, states that he has frequently found porcupine
quills in the stomach of the fisher.

The animal is hunted for the sake of its skin, which is of some value-- as also for amusement,
especially by boys, as the creature is not sufficiently formidable to cause any great danger
to them or their dogs. It is about four feet long, including the tail, which measures about
eighteen inches.

THE MINK.

Another denizen on the shores of the fresh-waters of Canada is the mink, called also the smaller
otter, and sometimes known as the water pole-cat.  It may be seen swimming about the lakes,
preferring generally the still waters in autumn to the more rapidly-flowing currents of spring.
It somewhat resembles the otter, and differs in shape slightly from the marten or ferret. 
Its teeth, however, are more like those of the pole-cat than the otter; while its tail does
not possess the muscular power of the latter animal.

Like the otter, it lives upon fish and frogs, but will occasionally make a marauding expedition
into poultry-yards.  Its general colour is a dark reddish-brown, approaching in some specimens
almost to black on the head; while there is a patch of white, varying in size, under the chin.
It is trapped by the settlers both in self-defence and on account of its fur, which is of considerable
value, and greatly resembles sable--a good skin often fetching four or five dollars.

MARSUPIALS, OR POUCHED ANIMALS:--THE VIRGINIAN OR COMMON OPOSSUM.

The opossum, with its prehensile tail, marsupial pouch, and cunning ways, stands alone for
its singularity among all the animals of the American continent.  Many of the tribe are found
in South America; but the Virginian opossum, the size of a full-grown cat, is larger than all
its relatives.  The head and body measure about twenty-two inches; and the tail, fifteen. 
It is covered with a light grey hair of wool-like softness, short on the face and body, but
long on the legs.  The base end of the tail is thick and black, and is covered with small scales.
So powerful is this member that the opossum can hold on with it to the bough of a tree, and
even when desperately wounded it does not let go. Its face is long and sharpened, the mouth
very determined, and armed with numerous sharp teeth.  It has thin, naked, round, and blackish
ears, edged with a border of white.  It has short legs, the feet being armed with claws, and
the interior toes of the hind-feet are flat and rounded.

It has the power of emitting a disagreeable odour when chased or alarmed.  When pursued, it
makes for the nearest tree; and should it discover the approach of a hunter and his dogs when
already up a tree, instead of taking to flight, it lies close along the branch, endeavouring
to hide itself.  When moving amidst the boughs, it swings itself from branch to branch by means
of its tail; and it may be observed at times hanging down, with its eyes wide open, on the
look-out for any birds which may incautiously alight on the bough above, or pass within its grasp.

It is very voracious, feeding on small quadrupeds and birds of all sorts; while it does not
disdain to prey off a brood of young cotton rats and mice, and devours insects and a variety
of reptiles.  When unable to find sufficient food in the forest, or too lazy to look for it,
it will, without hesitation, make a raid into the farmer's poultry-yard, and carry off or kill
his fowls, and eat up any eggs it may find.  The opossum does not always indulge in animal
diet,--for he climbs fruit-trees to carry off their luscious productions; and for the sake
of obtaining maize, of which he is especially fond, he will climb the tallest stems, and bite
them across, so as to bring the heavy ear to the ground.  He will also clamber to some higher
branch, and hang down, in search of the fruit growing on the boughs incapable of bearing his
weight.

The quality for which he is chiefly noted is his habit of feigning death.  Frequently he is
brought to the ground, when there he lies, every limb relaxed, evidently as dead as can be.
The knowing hunter will, however, keep his glance on the creature.  If he withdraws it for
a moment, its eyelids will be seen slowly opening; and should he turn his head for even the
shortest space, the creature will be on its feet, stealing away through the underwood.  Though
so perfectly an adept at "'possuming," before attempting to practise its usual ruse it will
make every effort to escape from its pursuers.  When chased alone by a dog, it will content
itself by scrambling up a tree, and sitting quietly on a branch, out of reach, looking down
on its canine assailant with contempt as it runs barking furiously below it.  The opossum is
thus said to be "treed;" and before long, the barking of the dog brings his master to the spot,
when the opossum has to fly for its life to the highest branch it can reach.  It is easily
captured by the rudest style of trap, into which it will walk without hesitation.  When "feigning
'possum," it will submit to be knocked about, and kicked and cuffed, without giving the slightest
sign of life.  The flesh of the opossum is white, and considered excellent--especially in the
autumn, when, after feeding amply on the fruits, beech-nuts, and wild berries, of which it
is especially fond, it is very fat.

The female opossum builds a warm nest of dry leaves and moss, sometimes in the hollow of a
rotten tree, or beneath its wide-spreading roots. She has been known occasionally to take possession
of a squirrel's nest; and at other times, that of the Florida rat.  When her young--generally
thirteen to fifteen appearing at a time--are born, they are extremely small--not an inch in
length, including the tail--and weighing only four grains.  After a couple of weeks or so,
she places them in her pouch, when they grow in size and strength, and in about four weeks
may be seen with their heads poked out surveying the world, into which they begin to wander
at the end of five or six weeks.  When first-born, they are the most helpless of little creatures,
being both deaf and blind.

The larger number of opossums, however, are to be found in South America, where we shall have
an opportunity of further examining them.

PART ONE, CHAPTER EIGHT.

THE FEATHERED TRIBES OF NORTH AMERICA.

THE BALD OR WHITE-HEADED EAGLE.

The white-headed eagle takes precedence among the feathered tribes of America,--because he
stands first in natural order, and has been selected by the people of the United States as
their heraldic emblem. Their choice was, by-the-by, objected to by Benjamin Franklin, on the
plea "that it is a bird of bad moral character, and does not get his living honestly."  There
was justice in the remark, for the bald eagle is a determined robber, and a perfect tyrant.
He is, however, a magnificent bird, when seen with wings expanded, nearly eight feet from tip
to tip--and a body three and a half feet in length--his snowy-white head and neck shining in
the sun, and his large, hooked, yellow beak open as he espies, afar off, the fish-hawk emerging
from the ocean with his struggling prey.  Downward he pounces with rapid flight.  The fish-hawk
sees his enemy approaching, and attempts to escape; but, laden with the fish he has just captured,
in spite of the various evolutions he performs, he is soon overtaken by the savage freebooter.
With a scream of despair he drops the fish.

The eagle poises himself for a moment, as if to take more certain aim, then, descending like
a whirlwind, snatches it ere it reaches the water.

The plumage of the bald eagle is of a chocolate-brown, inclining to black along the back, while
the bill and upper tail-coverts are of the same white hue as the head and neck.  He and his
mate build their nest in some lofty tree amid a swamp; and repairing it every season, it becomes
of great size.  Its position is generally known by the offensive odour arising from the number
of fish scattered around, which they have let drop after their predatory excursions.  The nest
is roughly formed of large sticks, moss, roots, and tufts of grass.  They commence making fresh
additions to their nest early in the year; and the female deposits her eggs in January, and
hatches the young by the middle of the following month.  Robbers as they are, the white-headed
eagles exhibit great parental affection, tending their young as long as they are helpless and
unfledged; nor will they forsake them even should the tree in which their nest is built be
surrounded by flames.  Wilson, the American naturalist, mentions seeing a tree cut down in
order to obtain an eagle's nest.  The parent birds continued flying clamorously round, and
could with difficulty be driven away from the bodies of their fledgelings, killed by the fall
of the lofty pine.

Audubon gives us an account of a savage attack he once witnessed made by an eagle and his mate
on a swan:--The fierce eagle, having marked the snow-white bird as his prey, summons his companion.
As the swan is passing near the dreaded pair, the eagle, in preparation for the chase, starts
from his perch on a tall pine, with an awful scream, that to the swan brings more terror than,
the report of the largest duck-gun.  Now is the moment to witness the display of the eagle's
power.  He glides through the air like a falling star, and comes upon the timorous quarry,
which now, in agony and despair, seeks by varied manoeuvres to elude the grasp of his cruel
talons.  Now it mounts, now doubles, and would willingly plunge into the stream, were it not
prevented by the eagle, who, knowing that by such a stratagem the swan might escape him, forces
it to remain in the air by his attempts to strike it with his talons from beneath.  The swan
has already become much weakened, and its strength fails at sight of the courage and swiftness
of its antagonist. At one moment it seems about to escape, when the ferocious eagle strikes
with his talons the under side of its wing, and with an unresisted power forces the bird to
fall in a slanting direction upon the nearest shore. Pouncing downwards, the eagle is soon
joined by his mate, when they turn the body of the luckless swan upwards, and tear it open
with their talons.

Along all the coasts of North America, as also at the mouths of the chief rivers, the white-headed
eagle is found watching for his prey.  An instance is mentioned of one of these savage birds
being entrapped, and falling a victim to his voracity.  Having pursued a wild duck to a piece
of freshly-formed ice, he pitched upon it, and began tearing his prey to pieces, when the mass
on which he stood continuing to freeze, his feet became fixed in the ice.  Having vainly endeavoured
with his powerful wings to rise in the air, he ultimately perished miserably.

THE WILD TURKEY.

The wild turkey, acknowledged to be the finest of game-birds, ranges throughout the forests
of the more temperate portions of America.  It is the parent of the valued inhabitant of our
poultry-yards; and in its wild state utters the same curious sounds which it does in captivity.
This superb bird measures about four feet in length.  Its plumage, banded with black, gleams
with a golden brown hue, shot with green, violet, and blue.  Its head is somewhat small, and
a portion of its neck is covered with a naked warty bluish skin, which hangs in wattles from
the base of the bill, forming a long fleshy protuberance, with hairs at the top.

The bird, in the States, is commonly known as Bubbling Jock, and is called "Oocoocoo" by the
Indians.  The female builds her nest in some dry, secluded spot, guarding it carefully, and
never approaching it by the same path twice in succession.  When first her young are hatched,
she leads them through the woods, but returns at night to her nest. After a time she takes
them to a greater distance, and nestles them in some secluded spot on the ground.  At this
time they are frequently attacked by the lynxes, who spring upon them, knocking them over with
their paws.

The wild turkey wanders to a great distance from the place of its birth. "About the beginning
of October the male birds assemble in flocks," says Audubon, "and move towards the rich bottom-lands
of the Ohio and Mississippi.  The females advance singly, each with its brood of young, then
about two-thirds grown, or in union with other families, forming parties often amounting to
seventy or eighty individuals--shunning the old cocks, who, when the young birds have attained
this size, will fight with, and often destroy them by repeated blows on the head.  When they
come upon a river, they betake themselves to the highest eminence, and often remain there a
whole day; for the purpose of consultation, it would seem, the males gobbling, calling, and
making much ado,--strutting about as if to raise their courage to a pitch befitting the emergency.
At length, when all around is quiet, the whole party mount to the tops of the most lofty trees,
whence, at a signal--consisting of a single cluck--given by the leader, the flock takes flight
for the opposite shore.  On reaching it, after crossing a broad stream, they appear totally
bewildered, and easily fall a prey to the hunter, who is on the watch for them with his dogs."

THE OCELLATED TURKEY.

A still more magnificent species of turkey than the one just described inhabits Honduras. 
It may be distinguished from the common turkey by the eye-like marks on the tail and upper
wing-coverts.  The naked skin of the head and neck, too, is of a delicate violet-blue, covered
with numerous pea-looking knobs arranged in a cluster upon the crown.  This is of a pale buff-orange,
while there is a row of similar marks over the eye, and others scattered about the neck.  The
wattle hanging from the neck is of a light orange at the tip.  The greater wing-coverts are
of a rich chestnut, the feet and legs being of a lake colour.  It is somewhat smaller than
the wild turkey of the States.

THE CANVAS-BACK DUCK.

The celebrated canvas-back duck, allied to the English pochard, makes its appearance among
the numerous rivers in the neighbourhood of Chesapeake Bay about the middle of October, as
well as in other parts of the Union.  It is at that time, however, thin; but soon grows fat,
from the abundance of its favourite food.  It is from two to three feet across the wings. 
Its glossy black beak is large.  The head and part of the neck are of a rich glossy reddish-chestnut
tint, with black breast. The wing-coverts are grey, and the rest of the body white, marked
with a number of transverse wavy lines.

It is especially esteemed at table--and those who have eaten it at the hospitable boards of
Americans will acknowledge its excellence; though when, on several occasions, some braces of
these birds have been sent to England, they have failed to elicit the admiration due to their
merits-- in consequence, it is said, of not being accompanied by an American cook.

THE SUMMER DUCK.

The most beautiful of the duck tribe which visits the States is the summer or tree duck of
Carolina.  It bears a strong resemblance in plumage and habits to the celebrated mandarin duck
of China.  The birds are found perching on the branches of trees overhanging ponds and streams--a
habit not usual in the duck tribe--where they may be seen, generally a couple together, the
male in his superb garments of green, purple, chestnut, and white, contrasting with the homely
plumage of his mate.

THE PINNATED GROUSE, OR PRAIRIE HEN.

On the open "barrens," where a few tufts of stunted brushwood are alone found, the remarkable
pinnated grouse may be seen in great numbers running over the ground.  Their backs are mottled
with black, white, and chestnut-brown; and the male has two finely ornamented feathers on the
neck, streaked with black and brown.  It has also a slight crest on the head, of orange colour,
hanging over each eye in a semicircular form; and naked appendages, which hang down from each
side of the neck, and can be filled at the will of the bird by air, so that when puffed out
they are like two small yellow oranges.  As the breeding season approaches the males appear,
uttering strange cries, puffing out these wattles, ruffling their feathers, and erecting their
neck-tufts, as if wishing to appear to the greatest advantage before their mates.  They occasionally
engage in combats with each other, but their encounters are not often of a bloody description.

They form their nests rudely of grass and leaves, under the shelter of a bush or thick tuft
of long grass.  The hen lays about fifteen eggs of a brownish-white colour.

The most remarkable feature in the history of these birds is the way in which they assemble,
as winter approaches, in vast numbers, to obtain protection from the biting force of the north-west
winds which sweep over the Missouri country, by huddling close together.

"As evening draws near," says Mr Webber, who has observed their habits, "they approach the
spot they have fixed on, in the usual manner, by short flights, with none of that whirring
of wings for which they are noted when suddenly put up; but they make ample amends for their
previous silence when they arrive.  From the pigeon-roost there is a continuous roar, caused
by the restless shifting of the birds, and sounds of impatient struggling, which can be distinctly
heard for several miles.  The numbers collected are incalculably immense, since the space occupied
extends sometimes for a mile in length, with a breadth determined by the character of the ground.
The noise begins to subside a few hours after dark.  The birds have now arranged themselves
for the night, nestled as close as they can be wedged, every bird with his breast turned to
the quarter in which the wind may be prevailing. This scene is one of the most curious that
can be imagined, especially when we have the moonlight to contrast with their dark backs. 
At this time they may be killed by cart-loads, as only those in the immediate neighbourhood
of the slain are apparently disturbed.  They rise to the height of a few feet, with a stupified
and aimless fluttering, and plunge into the snow within a short distance, where they are easily
taken by the hand.  They will, if disturbed when they first arrive at a resting-place, change
it; but after the heavy snows have fallen, they are not easily driven away by any degree of
persecution.  By melting the snow with the heat of their bodies, and by trampling it down,
they then form a kind of sheltering-yard, the outside walls of which defend them against the
winds."

They have, besides human foes, numberless enemies among the foxes, wolves, hawks, and other
birds.  The fecundity of the survivors, however, keeps pace with the many fatalities to which
they are liable.

THE RUFFED GROUSE, OR AMERICAN PHEASANT.

"This elegant species," writes Wilson, "is known throughout North America.  Its favourite places
of resort are high mountains, covered with the balsam-pine and hemlock."  It prefers the woods--being
seldom or never found in open plains.  They are solitary birds; generally being seen in coveys
of four or five, and often singly, or in pairs.

The stranger wandering through the forest is surprised to hear a peculiar sound, very similar
to that produced by striking two full-blown ox-bladders together, but much louder.  It is caused
by the ruffed grouse, who, amusing himself by drumming, is little aware that it will bring
the cruel sportsman towards him.  The bird produces it when standing on an old prostrate log.
He lowers his wings, erects his expanded tail, and inflates his whole body something in the
manner of the turkey-cock, strutting and wheeling about with great stateliness. After a few
manoeuvres of this kind he begins to strike with his stiffened wings, in short and quick strokes,
which become more and more rapid, till they run into each other.  The sound then resembles
the rumbling of distant thunder, dying away gradually on the ear.

The hen is an affectionate mother, and takes every means, when a stranger approaches her nest,
to lead him away from the spot.

Wilson describes observing a hen-pheasant depart from this usual custom. He came suddenly upon
one with a young bird in her company.  The mother fluttered before him for a short time, when
suddenly darting towards the young one, she seized it in her bill, and flew off along the surface
of the ground through the woods, with great steadiness and rapidity, till she was beyond his
sight, leaving him in much surprise at the incident. He searched round, but could find no other
birds.

Here was a striking instance of something more than "blind instinct"--by the adoption of the
most simple and effectual means for the preservation of her solitary young one--in this remarkable
deviation from the usual manoeuvres of the bird when she has a numerous brood.

The ruffed grouse is of a rich chestnut-brown, mottled with brown and grey; while on each shoulder
are the curious ruffs, or tufts, from which he obtains his name, of a rich velvety black, glossed
with green.  The skin beneath them is bare; the tail is grey, barred with blackish-brown.

Another species of grouse, smaller than the two former, inhabits Canada.

PASSENGER-PIGEONS.

Flights of locusts are often seen passing through the air, like vast clouds, obscuring the
sky.  The passenger-pigeon of America appears in almost equal numbers.  The accounts of their
vast nights would be incredible, were they not thoroughly well authenticated.

They are beautiful birds; the males being about sixteen inches in length, the females slightly
smaller, and usually of less attractive plumage.  The head, part of the neck, and chin of the
male bird, are of a slaty-blue colour; the lower portions being also of a slate colour, banded
with gold, green, and purplish-crimson, changing as the bird moves here and there.  Reddish-hazel
feathers cover the throat and breast, while the upper tail-coverts and back are of a dark slaty-blue.
Their other feathers are black, edged with white; and the lower part of the breast and abdomen
are purplish-red and white.  The beak is black, and the eyes of a fiery orange hue, with a
naked space round them of purplish-red.

Its chief food is the beech-mast; but it also lives on acorns, and grain of all sorts--especially
rice.  It is calculated that each bird eats half a pint of food in the day; and when we recollect
their numbers, we may conceive what an immense amount must be consumed.

The female hatches only one bird at a time, in a nest slightly made of a few twigs, loosely
woven into a sort of platform.  Upwards of one hundred nests have been found in one tree, with
a single egg in each of them; but there are probably two or three broods in the season.  In
a short time the young become very plump, and so fat, that they are occasionally melted down
for the sake of their fat alone.  They choose particular places for roosting--generally amid
a grove of the oldest and largest trees in the neighbourhood.

Wilson, Audubon, and other naturalists, give us vivid descriptions of the enormous flights
of these birds.  Let us watch with Audubon in the neighbourhood of one of their curious roosting-places.
From right to left, far as the eye can reach, the breadth of this vast procession extends,
teeming everywhere, equally crowded.  An hour passes, and they rather increase in numbers and
rapidity of flight. The leaders of this vast body sometimes vary their course, now forming
a large band of more than a mile in diameter; those behind tracing the exact route of their
predecessors.  Now they once more change their direction--the column becoming an immense front,
sweeping the heavens in one vast and infinitely extended line.  Suddenly a hawk makes a sweep
on a particular part of the column, when almost as quick as lightning that part shoots downwards
out of the common track; but soon again rising, advances at the same rate as before.

We will now hurry on towards their breeding place, a forest on the banks of the Green River
in Kentucky, fully forty miles in length, and more than three in width.  In the neighbourhood
are assembled a large number of persons, with horses, waggons, guns, and ammunition; and a
farmer has brought three hundred hogs to be fattened on the refuse pigeons.  As the vast flight
arrives at the spot, thousands are knocked down by men with long poles.  Some place pots of
sulphur under the trees; others are provided with torches of pine-knots; and the rest have
guns.  The birds continue to pour in.  The fires are lighted; and a magnificent, as well as
almost terrifying, sight presents itself.  The pigeons arrive by thousands, alighting everywhere,
one above another, till solid masses, as large as hogsheads, are formed on the branches all
around.  Here and there the perches give way with a crash, and falling to the ground, destroy
hundreds of the birds beneath, forcing down the dense groups with which every stick is loaded.
The pigeons continue coming, and it is past midnight before there is any sign of a decrease
in their numbers.  The ground in all directions is strewed with branches broken by the weight
of the birds which have pitched on them.  By sunrise, the enormous multitude have taken their
departure, while wolves, foxes, and other animals who had assembled to feast on the bodies
of the slain, are seen sneaking off.

Audubon describes the flight of one of these almost solid masses of birds pursued by a hawk;
now darting compactly in undulating and angular lines, now descending close to the earth, and
with inconceivable velocity mounting perpendicularly, so as to resemble a vast column, and
then wheeling and twisting within their continued lines, resembling the coils of a gigantic
serpent.  Their assemblages greatly surpass in numbers those of the pinnated grouse already
described.

HUMMING-BIRDS.

A considerable number of these gem-like members of the feathered tribe make their appearance
in summer, even as far north as Canada, and on the sides of the hills rising out of the "Fertile
Belt," within sight of Lake Winnipeg,--a region where snow covers the ground for so many months
in the year.  The most common, as well as the most beautiful, species of these minute birds,
is the ruby-throated humming-bird--a name given to it on account of the delicate metallic feathers
which glow with ruby lustre on its throat, gleaming in the sunshine like gems of living fire.
From the tip of the bill to that of the tail it measures about three and a half inches.  The
belly is green, and the upper part of the neck, back, and wing-coverts, are of a resplendent
and varied green and gold. The breast and lower parts are white, the wings purplish-brown,
and the tail partly of the same colour, with the two middle tail-feathers of vivid green.

In the warm climate of the more southern States, the beautiful little ruby-throat is found
throughout the winter; and as the summer draws on, the heat in the northern States suiting
its delicate constitution, it migrates in large flocks, appearing in the middle States towards
the end of April.  Tiny as they are, they pass through the air at a rapid rate, and may be
seen moving in long undulations, now rising for some distance at an angle of about forty degrees,
then falling in a curve.  Their long flights are performed at night, it is supposed, as they
are found feeding leisurely at all times of the day.  Small as they are, from their rapid flight
and meteor-like movements they do not fear the largest birds of prey; for even should the lordly
eagle venture into their domains, the tiny creatures will attack him without fear: and one
has been seen perched on the head of an eagle, at which it was pecking furiously away, scattering
the feathers of the huge bird, who flew screaming through the air with alarm, to rid himself
of his tiny assailant.

As they fly, the ruby feathers of their throats may be seen changing, according to the light,
now into a greenish gold colour, now into a deep brown, again to flash forth with the brilliancy
of precious gems.  Often they may be observed flying round the deep, cup-shaped calix of the
scarlet trumpet-flower, which with its rich foliage clings in clusters round the gnarled stem
of some withered oak, clothing it with a verdure not its own.  Into these deep and capacious
tubes the ruby-throat, with its long bill, probes, and draws forth either the sweets it produces,
or picks up the multitude of flies entangled in the nectar.

Although the ruby-throat ventures thus far north, it is very susceptible of cold, and returns
southward immediately the summer green of the forest gives place to the golden tints of autumn.
Brave and high-spirited as is the little bird, it is easily tamed; and Mr Webber, the naturalist,
after many attempts, succeeded in securing several of the species.  The first he caught did
not flutter, or make the least attempt to escape, but remained quietly in his hand; and he
saw, when he opened it, the minute creature lying on his palm, perfectly motionless, feigning
most skilfully to be dead; indeed, actually playing "'possum." For some time he watched it
with breathless curiosity, when he saw it gradually open its bright little eyes to ascertain
whether the way was clear, and then close them slowly as it caught his glance upon it.  When
a mixture of sugar, water, and honey was brought, and a drop placed on the point of its bill,
it came very suddenly to life, and in a moment was on its legs, drinking with eager gusto of
the refreshing draught from a silver tea-spoon.

The nest of the ruby-throat is of a most delicate nature; the external parts being formed of
a little grey lichen found on the branches of the trees, glued together by the saliva of the
bird, and neatly arranged round the whole of the nest, as well as to some distance from the
spot where it is attached to the branch or stem itself.  The interior is lined with a cottony
substance; and the innermost, with the silky fibres obtained from various plants.  Within this
little nest the female humming-bird lays two white and nearly oval eggs; generally raising
two broods in the season.  In one week, says Audubon, the young are ready to fly, but are fed
by the parents for nearly another week.  They receive their food direct from the bill of their
parents, who disgorge it in the manner of canaries and pigeons.  It is my belief that no sooner
are the young able to provide for themselves than they associate with other broods, and perform
their migrations apart from the old birds, as I have observed twenty or thirty young humming-birds
resort to a group of trumpet-flowers, when not a single old bird was to be seen.

The plumage of the female is in most respects like that of the male, except that she is not
possessed of the brilliant feathers on the throat which especially distinguish him.

Although there are several other species of humming-birds which live permanently in the Southern
States of the Union, or migrate northward in summer, we cannot now inspect them.  We shall
have, however, many opportunities of examining a number of the species when we come to visit
South America.  Although the number of birds and the variety of their species inhabiting North
America is very great, except those we have mentioned, they do not in general possess any very
interesting peculiarity, which might tempt us to linger longer amongst them, and we will therefore
wander on and inspect some of the curious reptiles which inhabit various parts of the American
States and Canada.

THE COW-BIRD.

The well-known spring visitor to the woods of England,--the cuckoo,--is undoubtedly destitute
of family affection, as are others of its relatives; but this is not the case with the whole
tribe.  As the spring advances, from the sylvan glades of Pennsylvania a curious note, constantly
repeated, is heard, resembling the word "cow-cow."  It is the note of a bird, and from the
sound it resembles it is generally known as the "cow-bird."  It is also called the "yellow-billed
cuckoo."  It is in no respect behind any of its neighbours of the grove in conjugal and parental
affection, for it builds its nest, hatches its own eggs, and rears its own young, Wilson assures
us.  It is about a foot in length, clothed in a dark drab suit with a silken greenish gloss.
A ruddy cinnamon tints the quill-feathers of the wings; and the tail consists partly of black
feathers tipped with white, the two outer ones being of the same tint as the back.  The under
surface is a pure white.  It has a long curved bill of a greyish-black above, and yellow beneath.
The female differs from the male in having the central tail-feathers of a drab colour, while
the under part of her body is of a greyish tinge.

Early in the spring the males frequently engage in desperate battles. After these contests
are decided, the couples, pairing, begin building their nests, generally among the horizontal
branches of an apple-tree. It is roughly formed of sticks and twigs.  On this bed the eggs,
three or four in number, of a uniform greenish-blue, are placed.  While the female is sitting,
the male is generally not far off, and gives the alarm by his notes should any person approach.
The female sits so close, that she may almost be reached by the hand, and then suddenly precipitates
herself to the ground, feigning lameness--to draw away the intruder from the spot--fluttering
her wings, and tumbling over in the manner of a partridge, woodcock, and some other birds.
Both parents unite in collecting food for the young.  This consists, for the most part, of
caterpillars, particularly such as infest apple-trees.  They are accused, and with some justice,
of sucking the eggs of other birds,--like the crow, blue jay, and other pillagers.  They also
occasionally eat various kinds of berries; but from the circumstance of their destroying numbers
of very noxious larvae, they prove themselves the friend of the farmer, and are well deserving
of his protection.

THE BLUE-BIRD.

While the robin redbreast cheers us in England during winter with its song, the beautiful little
blue-bird performs the same office with its rich sweet notes to the inhabitants of the United
States; arriving from Mexico, and still further off regions, as soon as the first signs of
approaching spring appear--even before the snow has melted away. Associating fearlessly with
human beings, it holds the same place in their affections as the robin.

It is about seven inches long--a rich azure-blue covering the whole upper surface of the head
and neck, while the quill-feathers of the wing and tail are jet-black.  The throat, breast,
and sides are of a ruddy chestnut, the lower portion of the body being white.  It builds its
nest in the hollow of a decayed tree, sheltered from the rain and cold, and there deposits
from four to six eggs at a time, generally rearing two, and sometimes three broods in the season.
Its food consists chiefly of spiders and small worms, and soft fruits and seeds.

It is a hardy little bird, and makes its way through all parts of the United States; sometimes,
indeed, remaining through the whole winter, when it takes shelter in some warm hollow beneath
the snow, from whence, when the sun shines forth, it comes out to enjoy its warmth, and to
sing a few cheerful notes.  It is especially interesting to watch it take care of its nest
and young; perching near them and singing merrily, occasionally flying off to procure a caterpillar
for their gaping mouths.

So confiding is the blue-bird, that when a box with a hole in it is arranged in some convenient
situation near a house, it will at once take possession, building its nest in it, and never
failing to utter its sweet music in acknowledgment of the boon.

THE SNOW-BIRD.

As the cold winter approaches, large flocks of little birds about six inches in length, with
snow-white breasts and slaty-brown or blue backs, make their appearance in the neighbourhood
of villages and farmhouses; sometimes, indeed, coming into towns as familiarly as sparrows.
Their habits are very like those of sparrows; and when the snow deepens, they mix with them,
searching together for the seeds in the sheltered corners of the fields, and along the borders
of creeks and fences.  They differ from the snow-bunting of the far north, with which they
must not be confounded.  In the summer they make their way to the northern regions in large
flocks, and build their nests together, being of a very sociable disposition.

THE CAROLINA PARROT.

While viewing the birds of North America, we cannot pass by the well-known, handsome Carolina
parrot, which is, notwithstanding its common name, a species of macaw.  Large numbers of these
beautiful birds are seen winging their way in compact bodies through the Southern States, flying
with great rapidity and uttering a loud outrageous scream, not unlike that of the red-headed
woodpecker.  Sometimes their flight is in a direct line, but generally they perform a variety
of elegant and serpentine meanders in their course through the air.  Often they may be seen
pitching on the large sycamore-trees, in the hollow trunks of which, as also among the branches,
they generally roost-- frequently forty and more together.  Here they cling close to the side
of the tree, holding fast by claws and bill.  No creatures can be more sociable, and they may
be observed scratching each other's heads and necks, and always nestling closely together.

Their plumage is mostly green washed with blue, but the forehead is of a reddish-orange--as
are the shoulders, head, and wings, while the neck and back of the head are of a bright golden
yellow.  The wing-coverts are yellow tinged with green.  The bird is about twenty-one inches
long. The female is much like the male.  She makes her nest in the hollows of trees.

The Carolina parrot exhibits great amiability of disposition, and is easily tamed, becoming
much attached to those who treat it kindly.  It also exhibits the most extraordinary affection
for its own race.  Wilson the naturalist, having obtained one while on a journey to the Far
West, brought it home upwards of one thousand miles in his pocket.  It quickly learned to know
its name, and would immediately come when called. Procuring a cage, he placed the parrot under
a piazza, where, by its call, it soon attracted the passing flocks of its relatives.  Numerous
parties frequently alighted on the trees immediately above, keeping up a constant conversation
with the prisoner.  One of these was wounded and captured.  Poll evinced the greatest pleasure
on meeting with this new companion.  She crept close up to it, chattering in a low tone of
voice, as if sympathising in its misfortune, scratching its head and neck with her bill--at
night, both nestling as closely as possible to each other, sometimes Poll's head being thrust
amongst the plumage of the other. The stranger, however, died, and Poll appeared restless and
inconsolable for several days.  On a looking-glass, however, being procured, the instant she
perceived her image all her former fondness seemed to return, so that she could scarcely absent
herself from it for a moment. It was evident she was completely deceived.  Often when evening
drew on, as also during the day, she laid her head close to that of the image in the glass,
and began to dose with great composure and satisfaction.

On another occasion several of these birds were shot down, when the whole flock swept rapidly
round their prostrate companions, and settled on a low tree within twenty yards of them.  Although
many were killed, the rest, instead of flying away, continued looking down at their dead companions
with manifest signs of sympathy and concern.

They render the farmer great service, by eating the cockle-burs which grow on the rich alluvial
soil of Carolina.  This prickly fruit is apt to come off on the wool of the sheep, which, in
some places, it almost completely destroys.  The bird also lives on the beech-nut and seeds
of the cypress.  The head--with the brains--and intestines of the Carolina parrot are said
to be poisonous to eat; but how far such is the case seems to be a matter of doubt.

Its chief abode is along the shores of the Mississippi, and it reaches the neighbourhood of
Lake Michigan; but eastward of the Alleghany Mountains it is seldom met with further north
than the State of Maryland.  Far more hardy than the generality of the parrot tribe, a flock
has been seen facing a snow-storm along the banks of the Ohio.

PART ONE, CHAPTER NINE.

REPTILES.

TORTOISES:--THE LETTERED TERRAPIN.

Taking the reptiles in their natural order, we must begin with the tortoises.  There is a group
of these slow-moving reptiles called terrapins in North America.  One of the most common is
the lettered terrapin, which inhabits rivers, lakes, and even marshes, where it lives on frogs
and worms.  It is especially detested by the angler, as it is apt to take hold of his bait,
and when he expects to see a fine fish at the end of his line, he finds that a little tortoise
has hold of it.

The back is of a dark brown, the edges being ornamented with scarlet marks, like some Eastern
alphabet in form.

THE CHICKEN TORTOISE.

Large numbers of these little tortoises, about ten inches in length, are seen basking together
on the logs or stones on the borders of lakes or streams.  The slightest noise arouses them,
when they slip off, splashing in all directions into the water.  They swim with their little
heads above the surface at a rapid rate, bearing a strong resemblance to water-snakes.  The
creature takes its name from the similarity of its flesh to that of a chicken.  It is consequently
in great requisition as food.

THE SALT-WATER TERRAPIN.

Another species--the salt-water terrapin--lives in the salt marshes and ponds.  It is brown
above, and generally yellow below--the lower jaw furnished with a sort of hook.  The sides
of the head are white, sprinkled with black spots.

THE BOX TORTOISE.

The peculiarity of this creature is that it can draw its head within its shell, so that, as
few creatures would wish to swallow such a morsel whole, it has no enemy except man to fear.
It might, to be sure, run the risk of being carried off by an eagle and let drop on a hard
rock, if the savage king of birds ever does perform such a feat; but though stories are frequently
told of his doing so, their truth is greatly doubted.

The box tortoise lives on shore among the pine-forest lands, away from water, to which it seems
to have an especial dislike.  It is frequently called, therefore, the pine terrapin.  It is
one of the smallest of its tribe--being little more than six inches long--and varies very greatly
in its colour.  Its head is remarkable for having a somewhat broad hook at the end of the upper
jaw--the lower jaw being slightly hooked.

THE MUD TORTOISE.

The mud tortoise is smaller than the box, being scarcely four inches in length.  It can, however,
move with considerable speed, and is seen floundering about in the ponds and muddy places,
where it searches for aquatic insects, and sometimes even fish, on which it lives.  It also
vexes the angler by taking hold of his hook, and remaining so quietly sucking in the bait,
that only when he hauls it up, and the tortoise begins to pull and kick violently about, does
he discover his mistake.

It is remarkable for exuding a strong musky odour, from which circumstance it has obtained
the name of "stink-pot."

THE ALLIGATOR TERRAPIN.

This giant of its tribe, from the great likeness it bears to the alligator, has appropriately
been called after the huge saurian.  It has a large head covered with a hard wrinkled skin,
and a long thick neck, over which are scattered a number of projecting tubercles.  On the shell
of the adult animal there is a depression along the centre, which leaves a sort of keel on
each side of the central line.

The creature is exceedingly voracious, feeding on fish, reptiles, or any animal substance.
It generally inhabits stagnant pools or sluggish streams, living mostly at the bottom.  Occasionally,
however, it rises to the surface, and elevating the tip of its pointed snout above the water,
floats along with the current.  Sometimes, indeed, it lands, and makes its way to some distance
from the river; but its motions are very awkward, not a little resembling those of the alligator.

A considerable number are taken by strong hooks, and, as the flesh is esteemed for food, are
sold in the market.

THE SNAPPING TURTLE.

Although the last-named creature is sometimes called the snapping turtle, the animal to which
the name appropriately applies is a very different creature.  Its other name is the fierce trionyx.

It belongs to the family of tortoises, popularly called soft turtles. Its flattened head is
rather oval, with horny jaws, and hanging fleshy lips, the mouth lengthened into a cylindrical
snout.  It has an extremely long neck, which it can contract at will; short, wide feet; and
toes connected by strong webs.  It is the most savage and formidable of its tribe; being terribly
destructive, not only among fish, but smaller quadrupeds, birds, and reptiles, which it can
capture.  For this object it lies in wait till they come down to drink, or till some water-fowl
flies too close to its haunt.  It is said even to capture and eat young alligators.

Though devouring so many other creatures, the snapping turtle is often eaten himself; being
hooked and drawn on shore by the fishermen.  It fights, on such occasions, and struggles ferociously,
darting its head here and there, endeavouring to seize the hands of its captors with its formidable
jaws.

It possesses extraordinary tenacity of life; and even after the head is cut off, the body,
it is asserted, will crawl for a short way over the ground.

LIZARDS:--THE SIX-LINED TARAGUINA.

We shall find several lizards in various parts of America--the greater number in the Southern
States.  The first we meet with is the six-lined taraguina, belonging to the family of teguexins,
which are remarkable for the many-sided shields which cover their heads, and the double collar
on the throat.  This little creature is much smaller than the rest of its family--being only
about eleven inches in length--of a darkish green or brown colour, with six narrow yellow streaks
along its body, one of which on each side reaches from the eye to the middle of the tail. 
The lower part is of a silvery white hue, with a bluish tinge in some parts.

It is an excessively lively, active animal, living in dry and sandy places, where it may be
found searching for insects.  As it is very timid, it takes to flight at the slightest sound,
and is not easily caught.

THE GLASS SNAKE.

As the spring comes on, and the warm sun bursts forth, a formidable snake-like creature, nearly
three feet in length, is often seen frequenting the plantations of the sweet potato, or coiled
up beneath the roots of an old tree; its keen eye watching for any small reptile or insect
which may be passing.  The head is small in proportion to the body, and of a pyramidal form--mottled
at the sides with black and green, the jaws edged with yellow.  Its abdomen is bright yellow;
and the upper part of the ear is marked with numerous lines of black, green, and yellow.

Altogether, it has a very venomous look about it; but is truly one of the most harmless of
creatures, not being a snake at all, though it goes by the name of the glass snake.  It is
in reality a lizard; though--not having the vestige of limbs--it is appropriately called the
lizard-snake.  It has, however, eyelids; and the tongue is not sheathed at the base, as is
the case with serpents; while its solid jaw-bones do not enable it to open its mouth, as they
are capable of doing.  It has a tail, twice the length of its body, from which it can with
difficulty be distinguished.

Its peculiar characteristic is its extraordinary fragility--arising from the muscles being
articulated quite through the vertebras.  If struck with a switch, the body is easily broken
in two or more parts. Sometimes, indeed, the creature breaks off its own tail, by a remarkable
habit it possesses of contracting the muscles with great force.  The common English blind-worm
breaks to pieces in a similar manner.

THE ANOLIS.

Among the true lizards is a pretty little creature known as the green Carolina anolis.  It
is especially daring; not only refusing to run away at the approach of man, but will enter
houses, and run about the room in search of flies.  It is very active, climbing trees, and
leaping from branch to branch in its search for insects, of which it destroys great numbers.
It is about seven inches long--mostly of a beautiful green above, with white below; and it
has a white throat-pouch, which generally appears with a few bars of red upon it, but when
inflated the colour spreads over the whole surface.

Mr Gosse describes one which he saw running about among the branches of a sassafras, just as
it had seized a grasshopper.  He caught the creature, which was then of a green hue; but, on
placing it on an old log, the colour changed to a brownish-black.  He was told, that if placed
on a green leaf it would again become green.  In a short time, after remaining in the sunshine,
it changed once more to green.  Again it became almost black; and shutting it up in a desk,
after half an hour he was no less surprised than delighted to see the lizard of a brilliant
green, the line down the back only being blackish.

When the animal is excited, the pouch, swelling out, becomes of a crimson colour.  It is covered
with excessively small--scarcely perceptible--scales.

These little creatures are at times very quarrelsome, and will fight together, frequently both
the combatants losing their tails in the contest; while their pouches swell out as they leap
at each other and struggle furiously.

THE CROWNED TAPAYAXIN.

This is the scientific name of a creature generally known under the title of the horned-toad,
though really a lizard.  Its head is of a light brown, marked with dark spots, the under part
being of a dull yellow; and is armed with long conical spines, set round the edge and pointing
backwards.  The back is covered with shorter and stouter spines, of a triangular shape, extending
to the very point of the tail-- also armed with a strong row of spines, which gives it a completely
toothed appearance.  The colour of this curiously covered back is grey, with irregular bands
of chestnut-brown across it.

Formidable as it looks, it is not only harmless, but never retaliates when attacked, and remains
perfectly quiet when taken in the hand.  It is also easily tamed, and learns to know its owner,
and to take food from his hand--preferring little red ants, though it eats readily beetles,
flies, and other insects.  From its small, rounded form, and the mode of sitting, it has in
all likelihood gained its common name of the horned-toad.

SNAKES:--THE RATTLESNAKE.

Throughout North America there are no small number and variety of venomous snakes.  The rattlesnakes
are perhaps the most numerous, frequenting all parts of the country, though they generally
keep to the uninhabited portions.  They are found on the northern shores of Lake Superior--though
the ground is covered for several months in the year with snow--and often appear in the regions
to the west, in the same latitude, up to the Rocky Mountains.  They would render some districts
uninhabitable, were it not for the signal-giving rattles with which they are armed.  Even quadrupeds
are alarmed at the sound, and endeavour to make their escape from them; and horses, it is said,
lately arrived from Europe, show the same dread of these deadly serpents as do those born in
the country, so that nothing will induce them to pass within striking distance of the creatures.

The wanderer through the forest starts back with dismay as he comes suddenly upon one of these
venomous reptiles, and hears its ominous rattle when too near to escape.  He must muster all
his nerve, and strike it with his stick as it springs; for a wound from its fangs will, as
he knows, bring certain death, far-away from human aid.

The rattlesnake, like others of its tribe in cold regions, hibernates in winter; and as the
autumn comes on, seeks some convenient crevice in which to pass the cold season--generally
in the neighbourhood of marshy ground, where it can cover itself up in the masses of a peculiar
species of moss growing in such situations.  The reptiles are here, during the winter, frequently
hunted out and destroyed.  At that time, too, their bite is much less dangerous than in the
summer--the amount of venom appearing to decrease with the increase of cold.

THE BANDED AND MILITARY RATTLESNAKES.

Besides the common rattlesnake, there is another known as the banded rattlesnake, and a third
species called the small, or military rattlesnake.  The latter is more dreaded, from being
of less size, and not so easily killed as the former.  The sound made by its rattle is extremely
feeble, so that it cannot be heard at any great distance. However, as we shall pay more attention
to the serpent tribe when we visit South America, where the rattlesnake is also found, we will
wait till then to inspect the formation of its rattle, and its other peculiarities.

THE CORN SNAKE.

There are many more harmless than venomous snakes in North America.  One of the handsomest
of its tribe is the corn snake, belonging to the family of the Colubrinae.  As it avoids the
daylight, though very common, it is not often seen in a wild state.

It is, however, frequently tamed by the inhabitants of farmhouses--when it makes itself perfectly
at home, and is even of more service than a cat in devouring rats and mice; though occasionally,
if a young chicken come in its way, it may gobble it up.  This it can easily do, as it is of
great size--varying from five to six feet in length.  The colours of its body are remarkably
brilliant; the general tint being a rich chestnut red, with large patches of a still brighter
and deeper red edged with black running along each side, and a second row of smaller spots
of golden yellow, alternated with larger ones.  The lower portion of the body is silvery white,
checkered with black.

THE THUNDER SNAKE.

No fiercer-looking member of the snake family exists in North America-- with its mottled head,
and black and white body, four feet at least in length--than the quarrelsome thunder snake.
From the chain-like markings on its body, it is sometimes called the chain snake; and by others
the king snake, on account of its tyrannical disposition.

Though fangless, it is fierce and bold, and has been known to attack, kill, and eat a rattlesnake;
indeed, it will assault any member of its family, if not of its own species, even though but
little smaller than itself.  It feeds on small quadrupeds, birds, and reptiles; and few human
beings who see it moving amid the shady places it inhabits, would fail to get out of its way
as quickly as possible.

THE CHICKEN SNAKE.

The bright golden brown chicken snake--marked with narrow stripes along the back, and from
four to seven feet in length--in spite of its beautiful and fangless mouth, is an unwelcome
visitor in farmhouses when it comes as a stranger, for it is apt to carry off fowls from their
roost--as well as their eggs--and will eat up a brood of ducklings without ceremony.

However, as it is of an amiable disposition, it can easily be tamed; and then, having learned
good manners, it becomes a favourite, and recompenses its protectors by killing the rats and
mice which frequent their premises.

THE MILK OR HOUSE SNAKE.

The beautiful blue house snake--four feet in length, with rows of spots on its side--is often
mistaken for the corn snake, its habits being very similar.  The lower part of the body is
of a silvery white, tesselated with oblong marks of black.  The ignorant fancy that it sucks
the milk from the udders of the cows, and hence its name; though, probably, it has no objection
to a little milk, if it finds it in a pan.  Its object, however, in entering houses and farms,
is to search for mice and insects, on which it in reality feeds, never interfering with the
cows or other animals.

THE BLACK SNAKE.

In many parts of the country, the black snake, on account of its rapid movements, is called
the "racer."  Though fangless, it often, in consequence of the way in which it rustles its
tail among the dry herbage, making a sound similar to that of the rattlesnake, gives no small
alarm to the wanderer among the brushwood near the edges of streams or ponds.  It is also frequently
encountered in the fields or on the roads.

It is generally from five to six feet in length; of a blue-black above, and an ashy grey below.
It climbs trees in search of birds or their eggs; and if interrupted in its employment, will
turn its rage against the intruder.  Sometimes, it is asserted, it will, to his horror, leap
down and give him a bite; though the only injury likely to arise is that to his nervous system
from fright.  Its bite is, indeed, perfectly harmless; and it does good service in hunting
rats which live in the outbuildings, being able to climb walls and insinuate itself into the
most intricate passages when chasing them.

THE COACH-WHIP SNAKE.

The last snake we will mention is the coach-whip snake, belonging to the family of Dryadidae.
No serpent can surpass it in the rapidity of its movements, as, with its lithe, black body--between
five and six feet in length--and whiplike tail, it makes its way amid the grass in pursuit
of its prey.  It seems literally to fly over the ground with the speed of lightning.

It is curiously like the thong of a whip, being very long in proportion to its girth, with
a remarkably small head and neck; its smooth scales-- so arranged as greatly to resemble the
plaited leather of a whip--of a polished brown-black hue increasing the resemblance.

When about to seize its prey, it darts forward with open mouth, grasping the animal; in an
instant it winds its lithe body and tail round and round it, so as to make escape impossible.
It will thus attack birds of prey of considerable size, and come off victorious.

Travellers unacquainted with the reptiles which haunt the wilds of America, on first seeing
a whip-snake rapidly approaching, will, with sensations of alarm, urge on their steeds to escape--for
it appears fully capable of springing up and inflicting mortal injury; but, from having no
fangs, it is unable to harm any one.  From the delicacy of its colour, the elegance of its
form, and the rapidity and gracefulness of its movements, it cannot fail to be admired.

FROGS:--THE BULL FROG.

We shall find no small number of the frog race throughout America. Worthy of being the president
of his nation is that enormous batrachian, the bull frog, both from his size, the power of
his notes, and his hardihood and endurance.  If we visit at night the neighbourhood of some
pool or marsh, we shall soon learn to know the sound of his voice, especially when perhaps
he and five hundred of his family are, with their heads half out of the water, amusing themselves
in the performance of a concert, each striving to outdo his neighbour in the loudness of his
tones.  He is a first-rate swimmer; and when driven out of the hole in which he passes the
warm hours of the day, he plunges into the water, and skims along the surface some distance
before he dives below it. Only on such occasions, or when, perhaps, a dark thunder-cloud shrouds
the sky, does he appear in the daytime, and give utterance to his notes.

He feeds on snails and water creatures; sometimes on crayfish and other crustaceans; and occasionally,
if a duckling or young chicken come in his way, he will not scruple to take them into his capacious
maw.

His ordinary size is from six to seven inches; but specimens have been met with which have
measured nineteen--and even twenty--inches, from the nose to the extremity of their feet. 
He has a smooth black skin above, with a greenish hue on the head, and lower part of the body
greyish-white--the throat being white, dotted with green.  He can take enormous leaps; and
is so admirable a swimmer, that specimens have been known to exist in the water without once
landing for several years.

THE SOLITARY FROG.

Inland, where no water is to lie found, we shall meet with a creature of an olive colour--the
back covered with tubercles--and with a blunt nose. It might easily be mistaken for a toad,
though it is a veritable frog. Even in winter, before the snow has disappeared, we may see
the hardy little creature making its way over the frozen surface of the ground. At the breeding
season, however, it returns, like other frogs, to the water.  It resides for the chief part
of the year in sandy districts, in which it forms burrows, about six inches in depth, by means
of a flat, sharp-edged spur, with which it is furnished.  Into these burrows it makes its way
backwards, very much as a crab crawls into its hole when seeking shelter from danger.  There
it sits, with its head poked out, watching for passing prey.

THE SAVANNAH CRICKET FROG.

Both in the Northern and Southern States we shall find a merry little creature, with a voice
greatly resembling that of the cricket.  Living near the borders of stagnant pools, it frequently
takes its seat on the large leaves of water-lilies and other aquatic plants; being able, by
curious discs on its toes, to crawl easily over their smooth surfaces.

It is among the smallest of its tribe, measuring only one and a half inches in length.  It
is of a greenish-brown, variegated with streaks of green and white, the under surface being
of a yellowish-grey, tinged with pink, and the legs banded.  Its body is slender, with the
hind-legs very long, enabling it to take enormous leaps to escape danger.

THE CHANGEABLE TREE FROG.

Throughout all parts of the continent we shall find a curious little toad, about two inches
in length, which possesses the nature of the chameleon--in being able to change its colour
according to the tints of the object on which it rests.  By this means, so completely does
it assimilate its hue to the ground, that it often escapes observation. The changes of colour
it thus rapidly passes through are indeed remarkable.  From a nearly perfect white, it can
assume every intermediate shade to a dark brown.  It has a very toad-like look, and possesses
skin glands which secrete an acrid fluid.  Thus it is able, when attacked, to defend itself,
as well as escape observation.

It may frequently be found on old plum-trees, where it climbs in search of the insects which
there congregate.  We shall frequently hear its voice, especially before rain, for it is a
noisy creature.  It has a liquid note, sounding like "el" frequently repeated, and then ending
with a sharp, short monosyllable.

It leaves its arborial habitation during the breeding season, and makes its way to the nearest
pools, where it joins in the concerts of its relatives.

It hibernates during winter, burrowing beneath the damp ground.

THE SPOTTED EFT.

Related to the salamanders, we shall find a curious creature in Pennsylvania, and other parts
of the States, known as the spotted eft, or ambystome.  It has a thick, convex head, with a
rounded muzzle; and is of a deep violet-black colour above, and purplish-black below, the sides
being ornamented with a row of large yellow spots.  Unlike other newts, it deposits its eggs
in small packets under damp stones.  There is another similar creature with mole-like habits,
which burrows under the ground, found in various parts of the States.

THE MENOPOMA.

Another of the same order--a formidable and savage creature--is the menopoma, inhabiting the
Ohio, Alleghany, and other rivers of the south, frequently, from its propensities, called the
young alligator.  It is also known as the "ground puppy," the "mud devil," and other well-deserved,
if not complimentary names.

It is about two feet in length; but the teeth, for its size, are small. In appearance, it is
ugly in the extreme; and as, from its voracious habits, it devours a number of fish, and bites
fiercely when captured, it is especially hated by the fishermen, who believe it to be venomous,
and treat it as seamen do the detested shark.

The above names have been given to it in consequence of its voracity, and its being found generally
in muddy bottoms.

THE CONGO SNAKE.

In digging into the mud, sometimes a number of snake-like creatures, between two and three
feet long, are turned up--which have hidden themselves away, often three feet below the surface--in
the Southern States.  On examination, however, they will be found to have legs, though small
and feeble, with only two toes on each foot.  They are of a blackish-grey above, and a lighter
hue beneath.

Another species of congo snake is found with three toes,--hence the name of three-toed congo
snake is given to it.

THE NECTURUS.

Related to the curious eyeless proteus, found in the celebrated cavern of Adelsberg, is an
animal very much larger, called the necturus, inhabiting the waters of the Mississippi, and
several southern lakes. It is a creature nearly three feet in length, with a thick body, and,
being designed to live in daylight, possesses eyes.  It is between a fish and a reptile, as
it is furnished with large, well-tufted gills; and, at the same time, has four legs, and four
toes on each foot, though it is destitute of claws.

It is of an olive-brown colour dotted with black, and a black streak reaching from one end
of the body to the termination of the somewhat thick, short tail.

THE SIREN, OR MUD EEL.

Another curious batrachian, the mud eel, is found in Carolina, in marshy situations.  Its total
length is about three feet.  The head is small, as is the eye, while on each side of it are
three beautifully plumed gill-tufts.  It has no hind-legs; while the front pair are very small,
and do not aid it in moving along the ground.  This it does in the wriggling fashion of an
eel; indeed, when discovered in the soft mud in which it delights to live, the creature, at
the first glance, would be taken for an eel.  It has many of the habits of that animal, living
on worms and insects; indeed, it is difficult to say whether it should be classed with eels
or batrachians.  It is, however, a true amphibian, respiring either in the water by means of
branchiae, or in the air by means of lungs.  It approaches, in the structure of its head, to
the salamanders, though much less so in its general form and proportions.

The curious "axolotl," which we shall meet with in Mexico, belongs to a closely allied genus.

GRASSHOPPERS, OR LOCUSTS.

When travelling across the prairies, we may, at times, when gazing upwards at the sky, see
what appears to be a vast cloud approaching from the horizon.  It is produced by infinite swarms
of locusts, or grasshoppers, as they are called in North America.  [From Professor Hind's "Red
River Exploring Expedition."]  About noon they appear to lessen perceptibly the rays of the
sun.  The whole horizon wears an unearthly ashy hue, from the light reflected by their transparent
wings. The air is filled as with flakes of snow.  The clouds of insects, forming a dense body,
cast a glimmering, silvery light from altitudes varying from 500 to 1000 feet.  The sky, as
near the sun as its light will allow us to gaze, appears continually changing colour, from
blue to silvery white, ashy grey, and lead colour, according to the numbers in the passing
clouds of insects.  Opposite to the sun, the prevailing hue is a silvery white, perceptibly
flashing.  Now, towards the south, east, and west, it appears to radiate a soft, grey-tinted
light, with a quivering motion.  Should the day be calm, the hum produced by the vibration
of so many millions of wings is quite indescribable, and more resembles the noise popularly
termed "a ringing in one's ears," than any other sound.  The aspect of the heavens during the
period that the greatest flight is passing by is singularly striking.  It produces a feeling
of uneasiness, amazement, and awe, as if some terrible unforeseen calamity were about to happen.

When the grasshoppers are resting from their long journeys, or in the morning when feeding
on the grass and leaves, they rise in clouds as we march through the prairie; and when the
wind blows, they become very troublesome, flying with force against our faces, and into the
nostrils and eyes of the horses, filling every crevice in the carts. Fortunately, comparatively
few take flight on a windy day, otherwise it would be impossible to make headway against such
an infinite host in rapid motion before the wind, although composed individually of such insignificant
members.  The portions of the prairie visited by the grasshoppers wear a curious appearance.
The grass may be seen cut uniformly to one inch from the ground.  The whole surface is covered
with the small, round, green exuviae of these destructive invaders. They frequently fly at
an enormous height above the earth.  An engineer engaged in the Nebraska survey, mentions that,
when standing on the summit of a peak of the Rocky Mountains, 8500 feet above the level of
the plains in Nebraska--being 14,500 feet above that of the sea--he saw them above his head
as far as their size rendered them visible.

Grasshoppers are excellent prognosticators of a coming storm.  They may be seen at times descending
perpendicularly from a great height, like hail--a sign of approaching rain.  At this time the
air, as far as the eye can penetrate, appears filled with them.  Early in the morning they
commence their flight, and continue it till late in the afternoon, when they settle round the
traveller in countless multitudes, clinging to the leaves of the grass, as if resting after
their journey.

They are fearful depredators.  Not only do they destroy the husbandman's crops, but so voracious
are they, that they will attack every article left even for a few minutes on the ground--saddle-girths,
leather bags, and clothing of all descriptions, are devoured without distinction.  Mr Hind
says that ten minutes sufficed for them to destroy three pairs of woollen trousers which had
been carelessly thrown on the grass.  The only way to protect property from these depredators
is to pile it on a waggon or cart out of reach.

Two distinct broods of grasshoppers appear--one with wings not yet formed, which has been hatched
on the spot; the other, full-grown invaders from the southern latitudes.  They sometimes make
their appearance at Red River.  However, Mr Ross, for long a resident in that region, states
that from 1819, when the colonists' scanty crops were destroyed by grasshoppers, to 1856, they
had not returned in sufficient numbers to commit any material damage.  Their ravages, indeed,
are not to be compared to those committed by the red locust in Egypt; and yet Egypt has ever
been one of the chief granaries of the world.

PART TWO, CHAPTER ONE.

MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA.

MEXICO.

If we glance over Mexico, we shall see that the country is, like the continent of which it
forms a part, of a triangular shape,--the eastern portion bounded by the Gulf of Mexico, low
and flat sandy deserts or noxious marshes being spread over it, and with a narrow belt of level
land at the base of the mountains on the Pacific shore.  A series of terraces broken by ravines
form the sides of a vast table-land,--six thousand feet above the plain,--which stretches from
north to south throughout the interior, separated here and there by rocky ridges into smaller
plateaux; while vast mountains in several parts rise from their midst--that of Popocatepetl,
the highest in Mexico, reaching to a height of 17,884 feet, with Orizaba, almost of equal elevation,
and several mountains not much inferior to them, their snowy summits seen from afar, through
the clear atmosphere of that lofty region.  Several are active volcanoes; the most curious
being that of Jorullo, surrounded by miniature mountains emitting smoke and fire, and presenting
the wildest scene of utter desolation.  They form pinnacles of the great range of the Andes
and the Rocky Mountains.  From the midst of the great table-land of Anahuac, flows towards
the north the river of Santiago, its course exceeding four hundred miles, passing in its way
through the large lake of Chapala.  Some of these table-lands are even eight thousand feet
above the sea.  The most lofty is so cold, that during the greater part of the day the thermometer
varies between 42 degrees and 46 degrees.  The great table-land to the east of the Sierra Madre
has an elevation which varies from three thousand to six thousand feet.  To the west of that
sierra, is the region of Sonora; while eastward, across the Rocky Mountains, is the great valley
of New Mexico, watered by the Rio Grande del Norte, which has a course of nearly fourteen hundred
miles.

We have thus, in Mexico, a region of elevated plateaux with numerous lofty mountains, steep
and broken hill-sides, with deep valleys, watered by numerous streams, and a wide extent of
low, level country under the rays of a tropical sun.  These several regions possess a great
difference in climate, and a corresponding variation in their productions, and, in most instances,
in the animals which inhabit them. The domestic animals introduced by the Spaniards, have multiplied
greatly, so that vast herds of cattle and horses run wild on the table-lands and lower tracts.
Sheep also abound, especially on the northern table-lands.  The buffalo makes his way to the
great plains bordering the Red River and Arkansas; while deer, in large herds, abound on the
higher plains.  They are followed, as elsewhere, by packs of wolves and foxes or wild dogs;
while the puma makes himself at home here, as he does in Southern America.  The bear takes
possession of many a mountain cavern; the beaver and otter inhabit the banks of the streams
and lakes; the raccoon is found in the woods; and the antelope bounds across the plains.

We know more about the feathered tribes than the mammalia of Mexico. There are upwards of one
hundred and fourteen species of land birds, one half of which are unknown in other parts of
the world.  Still, out of this entire number of species, only one new genus--which connects
the family of the tyrant-shrikes with that of the caterpillar-catchers--has been discovered.
There are two species of this genus, in both of which the males differ greatly from the females.
In this intermediate region we find numerous genera which exist both in Northern and, Southern
America intermixed.  Several South American birds have found their way into Mexico,--as the
mot-mots and trogons, the harpy and carracara eagles, the hang-nest, the true and red tanagers,
parrots, parrakeets, macaws, creepers, crest-finches, and the fork-tailed and even-tailed humming-birds.
Of the genera peculiar to North America,--but which are unknown in the South,--found in Mexico,
are the fan-tailed wagtails, titmice, and worm-eating warblers--blue robins, ground-finch and
sand-finch, crescent-starlings and ground-woodpecker.  The sand-finch is, however, found in
the Brazils.  Vast numbers of aquatic birds frequent the lakes and marshes of the table-lands
of the interior, as well as the rivers and shores of the coast, nearly the whole of which are
well known in the United States, the greater number also inhabiting the Arctic regions.

Among the reptiles, there is one curious creature, peculiar to the country, allied to the siren
of Carolina.  It is the axolotl, which partakes of the form of a fish, and abounds in many
of the lakes in Mexico.  It is much esteemed as an article of food by the inhabitants of the
neighbourhood.

We cannot speak of Mexico without having our minds drawn to the time of the Aztec monarchy,--when
sumptuous palaces, enormous temples, fortresses, and other public edifices covered the face
of the country. In the midst of the territory, on the western shore of the large lake of Tezcuco,
stood the city of Tenochtitlan, the superb capital of the unfortunate Montezuma, on the site
of which has arisen the modern Mexico.  Though its glory has long passed away, the enormous
ruins which still remain attest its past grandeur.  Vast pyramids, on a scale and of a massiveness
which vie with those of Egypt, still rear their lofty heads in great numbers throughout the
country; while the ruins of other buildings prove that the architecture of Mexico in many points
resembled that on the banks of the Nile.  Some of these pyramids might rather be called towers.
They consist of a series of truncated pyramids placed one above another, each successive one
being smaller than the one on which it immediately rests--thus standing in reality upon a platform
or terrace.  The great pyramidal tower of Cholula is of this character, resembling somewhat
the temple of Belus, according to the description given of it by Herodotus.  It reaches a height
of 177 feet, and the length of each side of its base is 1440 feet.  In its neighbourhood are
two other pyramids--teocalles, as they are called--of smaller dimensions.  These temples, or
teocalles, were very numerous, and in each of the principal cities there were several hundreds
of them.  The top, on which was a broad area, was reached by a flight of steps.  On this area
were one or two towers forty or fifty feet high, in which stood the images of the presiding
deities.  In front of the towers was the stone of sacrifice, and two lofty altars, on which
fires were kept burning, inextinguishable as those in the temple of Vesta.  In the great temple
of Mexico there were said to be six hundred of these altars, the fires from which illuminated
the streets through the darkest night.

Deeply interesting as is the subject of the architecture and the remarkable state of civilisation
of the Aztecs, we must not dwell longer upon it, except to mention the cyclopean roads and
bridges, constructed of huge blocks of stone, and carried on a continuous level, across valleys,
which still remain.  There are also, in various parts of the country, excavations, rock-hewn
halls, and caverns, generally dome-shaped, the centre apartment lighted through an aperture
in the vault.  They somewhat resemble the cyclopean fabric near Argos, called the Treasury
of Atreus.  Not only the buildings, but the hieroglyphics, of the Aztecs, so closely resemble
those of the Egyptians, that there appears every reason to suppose they were derived from the
same source.

Among the natural curiosities of Mexico, one of the most remarkable is that of the rock-bridge
in the valley Icononzo, which might, from its form--until closely examined--be mistaken for
a work of art.

The great mass of the population of Mexico consists of the descendants of those tribes which
inhabited the country at the time of the Spanish invasion.  The language most extensively spoken,
as well by the civilised as the savage tribes, is still that of the Aztecs.  The people of
pure European blood are supposed not to amount to thirty thousand. About a quarter of the population
consists of Creoles, descendants of Europeans and Indians known as Mestizos, while there is
a small number of Mulattoes, and another race, the Zambos--descendants of Africans and Indians.

Mexico has long been in a chronic state of revolution.  From a province of Spain it became
an independent empire; afterwards a republic; and once more, under the unfortunate Maximilian,
it was placed under imperial rule, finally to fall into a far greater state of anarchy than before.

Before we quit Mexico, a remarkable result of hydraulic action must be mentioned, found on
the sea-coast of that region.  It is known as the buffadero.  At the termination of a long
rugged point, the water of the ocean, forced by a current or the waves, is projected through
a fissure or natural tube in the rock, forming a beautiful jet d'eau many feet in height.

BIRDS OF MEXICO:--THE SCARLET TANAGER.

Among the winter inhabitants of Mexico, one of the handsomest is the scarlet tanager--a small
bird, being only six or seven inches in length. It migrates north in the spring, generally
making its appearance in the United States about the end of April, where it remains till the
breeding season is over.

The colour of the male bird is a brilliant scarlet, with the exception of the tail and wings,
which are deep black.  The tail is forked, and has a white tip.  This gay plumage is, however,
only donned during the summer, for when it returns to Mexico in the autumn, its body is covered
with a number of greyish-yellow feathers, giving it a mottled appearance.  Its note is powerful,
but not particularly musical.

Wilson describes it as a remarkably affectionate bird.  Having captured a young one, it was
placed in a cage high up on a tree.  The father bird discovered it, and was seen to bring it
food, roosting at night on a neighbouring bough.  After continuing to do so for three or four
days, he showed by his actions and voice that he was trying to make the young one come out
and follow him.  So distressed did he appear, that at last the kind-hearted naturalist set
the prisoner at liberty, when it flew off with its parent, who, with notes of exultation, accompanied
its flight to the woods.

THE ANIS, OR SAVANNAH BLACKBIRD.

The farmers of Mexico and the Southern States of America whose fields are frequented by the
anis, are much indebted to that handsome and somewhat conspicuous bird.  It is of a black hue
glossed with green, equalling a pigeon in size--its long tail adding to its apparent length.
Its chief food consists of grasshoppers, locusts, and small lizards, but it rids cows of the
ticks and other parasitic insects which fasten on their backs, where they cannot be rubbed
off.  So conscious are the cattle of the service thus rendered them, that they will lie down
to allow the blackbird to perform the operation at its ease.  It is even asserted that, should
the cow neglect to place herself in a suitable attitude, the blackbird will hop about in front
of her nose, and allow her no peace till she does as required.

Large flocks of these birds appear together, uttering deafening cries. When fired at, even
though many of them are killed, the survivors hover to a short distance, regardless of the
danger in which they are placed. They build remarkably large nests; sometimes, indeed, several
pairs of birds build one together--much in the same way as do the sociable weaver-birds of
Africa--where they live together on friendly terms.

It resembles another African bird in its habit of picking off ticks from the backs of oxen,
the same duty being performed by the South American goatsucker.

MASSINA'S TROGON--THE MEXICAN TROGON.

These birds are remarkable for their beautiful plumage.  The first measures about fourteen
inches in length.  The crown of the head, back, and chest are of a deep, rich green; the ear-coverts
and throat, glossy black; the breast and abdomen, of a rich scarlet.  A grey tint covers the
centre of the wings, which are pencilled with jet-black lines.  The quill-feathers are also
black, each being edged with white; and the bill is a light yellow.  The females differ considerably
from the males. They are shy and retiring birds, and their habits, consequently, are difficult
to study.

The Mexican trogon is much smaller than the former, being only a foot in total length, of which
the tail occupies nearly eight inches.  Few birds are more beautifully adorned than the male
trogon.  The head is of a bright yellow; the upper surface of the body, with the chest, being
of a rich, glossy green; while the whole under surface is a bright scarlet. The throat and
ear-coverts are black, and a white band of a crescent shape surrounds the throat.  The wings
are nearly entirely black.  The tail is partly black, the two central feathers being green,
tipped with black.  The females and young males differ greatly, but their plumage is still
very handsome.

THE RESPLENDENT TROGON.

The resplendent trogon is a native of Mexico, and, like all its congeners, is fond of hiding
its beauty in the dark glades of the rich tropical forests.  Its skin is remarkably delicate,
and so thin that it has been compared to wet blotting-paper; while the plumage is so lightly
set, that when the bird is shot, the feathers will fall freely from their sockets, through
the force of the blow.

The colour of the adult male bird is a rich golden green, on the crest, head, neck, throat,
chest, and shoulder-plumes.  The breast and under parts shine with as bright a scarlet as the
uniform of an English guardsman; the central feathers of the tail are black, and the exterior
white, with black bars.  The resplendent plumes which overhang the tail are seldom less than
three feet in length, so that the total length of this gorgeous bird will frequently reach
four feet.  The bill is of a light yellow.

This species of trogon feeds chiefly on vegetable diet.  We may add that in old times its long
plumes were among the insignia of Mexican monarchy, and none but members of the "blood royal"
were permitted to wear its gorgeous feathers.

REPTILES:--THE RHINOPHRYNE.

The tongues of frogs, instead of pointing outwards, are directed towards the throat.  This
species differs from the rest of its tribe, by having its tongue free and pointing forwards.
Its rounded head sinks completely into the body, the muzzle being abruptly truncated, so as
to form a circular disc in front.  So extremely small is the gape, that it would not be supposed,
if separated from the body, to have belonged to a frog.  On each side of the neck there is
a gland, deeply sunk, and almost concealed by the skin.

The body of this curious creature is extremely short and thick, and its feet are half webbed.
At the end of each of the hinder feet is a flat, oval, horny spur--its only means of offence
and defence, as it possesses no teeth in its head.

It is of a slaty-grey colour, with yellow spots on the sides and back. Occasionally the latter
unite, so as to form a jagged line along the back.

THE AXOLOTL.

Among the batrachians found in Mexico is the curious axolotl, which frequents the great lake
on which the chief city is built, as well as numerous other lakes, some at a considerable elevation
above the ocean. It is between eight and ten inches long, of rather a dark greyish-brown colour,
thickly covered with black spots.  Those who have seen a newt in its larva state, may form
a correct idea of the gills which project from either side of the head.

Naturalists differ in opinion as to whether it is really an adult batrachian, or merely the
larva of some much larger creature.  In many localities it is very plentiful; and the flesh
being eatable and of a delicate character, the creature is sold in great numbers in the markets.

Being furnished with both kinds of respiratory organs, it can breathe equally well on land
or in the water.  It has a broad, flat head, blunt nose, and eyes situated near the muzzle.
Though living so much in the water, its toes are not connected by intermediate membranes--indeed,
they appear only to be intended for service on shore--its tail, nearly as long as its body,
serving as a propeller in the water.

PART TWO, CHAPTER TWO.

CENTRAL AMERICA.

Leaving the continent of North America, which may be said to terminate at the southern end
of Mexico, we enter that extremely irregular portion of land which, now widening, now narrowing
again, stretches in a south-easterly direction till it unites with the southern half of the
American continent at the Isthmus of Panama.  We find in Central America three marked centres
of elevation.  The first we reach is the great plain, nearly 6000 feet above the level of the
sea, on which the city of Guatemala is situated.  Numerous volcanic peaks rise from its midst;
from it also flow several large rivers, some falling into the Gulf of Mexico, others eastward
into the Gulf of Honduras, while smaller streams send their waters westward into the Pacific
Ocean.  The banks of these rivers are mostly covered with the richest tropical vegetation--the
scenery of the river Polochie in Guatemala being especially beautiful. Another high plain occupies
the centre of Honduras, and extends into the northern part of Nicaragua.  From it also rise
numberless streams, some emptying themselves into the Caribbean Sea, and others into the Lakes
of Nicaragua and Managua.  Further south rises the volcano of Cartago. Here the Cordilleras
resume their general character of a vast mountain barrier, but once more sink down into low
ridges as the chain passes through the Isthmus of Panama.

As in South America, the Cordilleras run close along the Pacific coast. In consequence, the
rivers which flow from their heights have a long course on the Atlantic side, and have carried
down a large quantity of alluvial soil.  Here, too, rain falls in greater or lesser quantities
throughout the year.  The vegetation is consequently rank, and the climate damp, and proportionately
unhealthy.  As the trade-winds blow from the north-east, the moisture with which they are saturated
is condensed against the mountainsides, and flows backwards towards the Atlantic.  The Pacific
slope is, therefore, comparatively dry and salubrious--as indeed are also the elevated table-lands
of the interior.

The whole region is subject to earthquakes, and numberless volcanoes rise in all directions.
In the low ridge which separates the Lake of Nicaragua from the Pacific are several volcanic
hills, most of them active; while further to the north-west, in the district of Conchagua--
scarcely more than one hundred and eighty miles in length--there are upwards of twenty volcanoes.
The two most lofty are found in the Guatemala range--that of Fuego being upwards of 12,000
feet in height, and that of Agua, 18,000 feet.

Many parts of the interior of the country have been but very partially explored, and are, indeed,
almost unknown.  Of the purely native tribes, most of them have become mingled with Spaniards
or negroes.  Parts of the coast are inhabited by mixed races of Caribs, who have migrated from
Saint Vincent, one of the Leeward islands.  These Caribs are known as the Black and Yellow
Caribs--the former being the descendants of the survivors of the cargo of an African slaver,
wrecked in the neighbourhood of that island.  The descendants of the Spaniards are the dominant
race, and they have divided the country into various republics, though the greater portion
is still in almost as savage a condition as when first discovered.

HONDURAS AND THE MOSQUITO COUNTRY.

The English have, however, a settlement in Honduras; and there is an Indian state forming the
eastern portion of Nicaragua, under the government--if so it can be called--of a native king.
His territory is known as the Mosquito Country, from the name of the chief native tribe over
which he rules.

The climate is very similar to that of the West Indies.  On the lower lands a variety of tropical
productions can be brought to perfection, while in the high regions cereals of various sorts
are abundantly produced.

FAUNA.

The fauna partakes partly of the character of that of the equatorial regions of South America,
and of the semi-tropical districts of Mexico. There are several varieties of ant-eaters, similar
to those found in the valley of the Amazon, while the grey squirrel of more northern latitudes
skips playfully amid the forests of the interior.  In the woods and wide savannahs are two
or more varieties of deer--one resembling the European deer in colour, but of less size, and
adorned with large antlers.  The other is of a lighter and browner tint, possessing short,
smooth-pointed horns.  The peccary is common in the valleys and low ground along the coast;
while the waree, or wild hog, runs in large droves in many districts.  The tapir, similar to
that of the southern continent, also frequents the seashore and banks of the rivers; and another
species, peculiar to the region, is said to have been discovered lately.  There are numerous
varieties of monkeys, among which are the brown, the horned, and the little, playful capuchin.
The raccoon, as elsewhere, is common, and is noted for its thieving propensities.  It lives
chiefly on animal food.  There is an interesting little opossum of about ten feet in length,
of a grey colour, with a somewhat large head, and a long and very flexible tail--the feet being
provided with sharp claws.  When the young leave the mother's pouch, she can place them on
her back, to which they cling, while she scrambles amid the forest boughs.  Besides the great
ant-eater, there is the smaller striped ant-eater, and the little ant-eater.  There is a curious
creature, called the quash, resembling the ichneumon, which possesses a peculiarly fetid smell,
and is known for its powerful, lacerating teeth.  There are several species, also, of the armadillo,
distinguished as the three-banded, eight-banded, and nine-banded.  The paca is also very plentiful,
and becomes easily domesticated.  It reaches two feet in length, and its thick, clumsy form,
of a dusky brown colour, may be seen scampering through the woods. The agouti, or Indian cony,
or rabbit, frequents the same region as the paca, and is about the size of an ordinary hare.
It does not, however, run in the same way, but moves by frequent leaps.  The jaguar ranges
through the whole of this part of the continent, and is remarkable for its large size and great
strength.  Not only does it frequently kill full-grown cattle, and drag them to its lair far-away
in the woods, but, if irritated, it does not hesitate to attack human beings.  The tiger-cat,
or ocelot, which much resembles a common cat, but is considerably larger, is also found in
the forest; but at the sight of man it takes to flight, and is, therefore, less frequently
seen than its fiercer relatives.  The puma also makes its way from one end of the country to
the other; but though destructive to cattle, it is said here, as elsewhere, to fly from the
face of man.  The savage wolf, the cayote, is frequently met with.

A considerable number of the birds of South America, or of allied species, are found in many
parts of the country.  This is the home of the resplendent trogon, called the quetzal--the
imperial bird of the Quiches.  It, however, has but a limited range, being found only in the
mountains of Merendon in Honduras, and in the department of Quezaltenango in Guatemala.  There
are numerous varieties of the parrot tribe, many of them of the most magnificent description
with regard to their colouring.  Here, also, the forests are adorned with the gay plumage of
the red and blue macaws, as also by a toucan with a yellow tail.  It is remarkable not only
for its bright colour, but for its curious pendent nests, of which frequently fifty are seen
hanging together from the branch of a single tree.  Among the birds of prey, the ever-present
turkey-buzzard and other vultures, hawks, owls, and sea-eagles, are common; as is the Mexican
jay, the ring-bird, the rice-bird, swallow, and numerous varieties of humming-birds.  Among
the water birds are the pelican, the muscovy, and black duck; the spoon-bill, plover, curlew,
teal, darter; while herons, ibises, and cranes, are found in great numbers on the shores of
the lagoons and rivers.  In the interior of the country the splendid Honduras turkey, as well
as the curassow, and several varieties of the wood-pigeon and dove, as also the partridge,
quail, and snipe, exist in abundance.

Of the reptile tribes, alligators of great size are found in nearly all the lagoons and rivers.
There is an infinite variety of lizards,--the most noted of which is the iguana, which frequently
attains a length of four feet;--and its flesh is here, as in other parts of the continent,
esteemed.  There are many varieties of serpents, some of which are harmless.  Of the venomous
species, there are the golden snake, the whip-snake, and the tamagas--the bite of which is
considered deadly.  So is also that of the corral.  It is of the most brilliant colour, covered
with alternate rings of green, black, and red.  To this last may be added the rattlesnake and
the ordinary black snake.  Most of these snakes are found in the lower region near the sea-coast.

In all the rivers and lakes, tortoises and turtles of several kinds are abundant.  The land
turtle reaches a foot in length.  Its shell is of a dark colour.  It is eaten, but is not esteemed
of so good a quality as the sea turtle.  The coasts are frequented by various species of sea
turtle, known as the green, the hawks-bill--which affords the best tortoise-shell to commerce--and
the trunk-turtle, which is larger than either of its two relatives.  From its flesh is extracted
a kind of oil, which is of considerable value.

The hawks-bill turtle, which gains that name from its narrow, sharp, and curved beak, like
that of a hawk, is also called the imbricated turtle, because its scales overlap each other
at their extremities, as tiles are placed on the roofs of houses.

The green or edible turtle is of great size, weighing often six hundred pounds, and being upwards
of five feet in length.  It gains its name from its rich fat, which is of a green colour; and
its flesh is considered very much superior to that of all its relatives.

The variety and kinds of Crustacea are almost numberless, from the largest lobster to the smallest
crab.  Two species--the mangrove crab, and the white and black land crab--are found near the
mouths of the rivers and in all the lagoons; while the curious soldier crabs, which seem as
much at home in one element as in the other, inhabit in vast numbers the trees which lie rotting
half submerged in the water.  At certain times they may be found making their way into the
interior, to return afterwards to the ocean.

The neighbourhood of the ocean, and the rivers and lakes of the interior, swarm with an endless
variety of fish; while the huge manatee, or sea-cow, is found in most of the rivers.

THE MAHOGANY-TREE.

The most valuable production of the forests of this part of the world is the mahogany-tree
of Honduras, well-deserving, from its magnificent foliage and vast size, to be called the king
of the forest.  It is remarkably slow of growth, its increase during half a century being scarcely
perceptible.

The life of the mahogany-cutter is wild in the extreme, yet he carries on his occupation in
a systematic manner.  Parties, or gangs, are formed, consisting of fifty men, with a captain,
or hunter, attached to each.  The business of the hunter is to search out the mahogany-trees
fit for cutting.  To do this, he makes his way through the thick forest to the highest ground
in the neighbourhood he can find, and then climbs one of the tallest trees.  From thence he
surveys the surrounding country in search of the foliage, which presents a yellow, reddish
hue, assumed by the mahogany--tree at that season of the year--about August. Having thus discovered
a spot on which a number of the sought-for trees grow, he descends, and as rapidly as possible
leads his party to it, lest any others on the search should be before them.  Huts are now built,
roofed with long grass, or the branches of the thatch-palm.  His furniture consists of a hammock
swung between two posts, and a couple of stones on which his kettle is supported.  Stages,
on which the axemen stand, are erected round the trees, which are cut down about ten or twelve
feet from the ground.  The trunk is considered most valuable, on account of the size of the
wood it furnishes; but the branches are also of value, from their grain being closer and more
variegated.

While one party is employed in cutting down the trees, another is engaged in forming a main
road to the nearest river, with others from the various spots where the axemen are at work
leading to it.  This operation is concluded by the end of December.  The trees are now sawn
into logs of various lengths, and are squared by the axe, in order to lessen their weight,
and to prevent them from rolling in the truck. When the dry weather sets in--about April or
May--trucking commences. The trucks are drawn by seven pair of oxen.  Each is accompanied by
two drivers, sixteen men to cut food for the cattle, and twelve to load the trucks.  In consequence
of the hot sun during the day; trucking is always carried on at night.  A wild scene is presented
while the trucks are moving from the forest, each accompanied by several men carrying torches,
the drivers cracking their whips and uttering their shouts. Thus they go on till they reach
the river's brink, when the logs--each marked with the owner's initials--are thrown into the
water, and the trucks return for a fresh load.  When the rains commence, the roads are impassable,
and all trucking ceases.

As the rivers are swelled by the rains, the mahogany-logs are floated away, followed by the
gangs in flat-bottomed canoes, called pit-pans. Their crews are employed in liberating the
logs from the branches of the overhanging trees and other impediments, till they are stopped
by a beam placed near the mouth of the river.  The logs of each owner are now collected into
large rafts, in which state they are floated down to the wharves of the proprietors.  Here
they are newly smoothed, and made ready for shipping to England.

Many other valuable woods come from this region.  Rosewood is common on the northern coast
of Honduras.  The bushes which produce gum-arabic abound in all the open savannahs on the Pacific
slope.  In the forest is found the copaiba-tree, producing a healing liquid.  Here also are
found the copal-tree, the palma-christi, the ipecacuanha--the root of which is so extensively
used in medicine--the liquid amber, as well as caoutchouc.  Here the vast ceiba, or silk-cotton-tree,
is abundant, from which canoes are frequently hollowed out.  Indeed, a considerable number
of the trees found on the banks of the Orinoco and Amazon here also come to perfection.

HUMMING-BIRDS:--THE SLENDER SHEAR-TAIL.

Central America is the home of several beautiful species of those minute members of the feathered
tribe--the humming-birds.  Among them is found the slender shear-tail, which will be known
by its deeply-forked black tail, its wings of purple-brown, and its body of deep shining green,
changing to brown on the head, and bronze on the back and wing-coverts. The chin is black,
with a green gloss; the throat is of a deep metallic purple; while a large crescent-shaped
mark of huff appears on the upper part of the chest.  There is a grey spot in the centre of
the abdomen, and a buff one on each flank, the under tail-coverts being of a greenish hue.

The female differs greatly from her consort.  Her tail is short, the central feathers being
of a golden green; the exterior ones rusty-red at their base, and black for the greater part
of their length, with white tips.  The upper part of her body is also of a golden green; the
lower of a reddish-buff.

THE RUFUS FLAME-BEARER.

The beautiful little rufus flame-bearers belong to the genus Phaethornis.  They are known by
their long, graduated tails, all the feathers of which are pinnated--the two central ones extending
far beyond the others.  "They may be seen early in the year, darting, buzzing, and squeaking
in the usual manner of their tribe, engaged in collecting sweets in all the energy of life,
appearing like breathing gems--magic carbuncles of glowing fire--stretching out their glorious
ruffs, as if to emulate the sun itself in splendour.  The female sits towards the close of
May, when the males are uncommonly quarrelsome and vigilant, darting out as the stranger approaches
the nest, looking like angry coals of brilliant fire, returning several times to the attack
with the utmost velocity, at the same time uttering a curious, reverberating, sharp bleat,
somewhat similar to the quivering twang of a dead twig, and curiously like the real bleat of
some small quadruped. At other times the males may be seen darting high up in the air, and
whirling about each other in great anger and with much velocity.

"The nests are funnel-shaped, measuring about two and a quarter inches in depth, and one and
three-quarters in breadth at the upper part, composed of mosses, lichens, and feathers woven
together with vegetable fibres, and lined with soft cotton."

This description is given by Mr Nuttal the naturalist, and quoted by Audubon.

PRINCESS HELENA'S COQUETTE.

This beautiful little gem--a native of Vera Paz, in Guatemala--is adorned somewhat after the
fashion of the Birds of Paradise, its head being ornamented with six long, green, hair-like
feathers, three on either side of the body.  The upper part is of a coppery bronze colour,
a band of buff crossing the lower end of the back.  The face is green; and the throat is adorned
with emerald feathers surrounded with others long and white.  These start from the neck, being
edged with blue-black. Beautifully adorned as is the male, the hen-bird possesses neither crest
nor neck-plumes, her colour being of a dull, bronze-green, and greyish-white sprinkled with
green on the under part of the body.

THE SPARKLING-TAIL HUMMING-BIRD.

The little sparkling-tail is one of the boldest and most familiar of its tribe, being seen
flitting from flower to flower among the gardens in Guatemala, and remaining with perfect confidence
even while people are moving about near it.  It is one of the smallest of its tribe--the nest
being also of a proportionate size, formed of various delicate fibres, such as spider's webs
and cottony down, and covered with lichens. Within it the female lays two eggs, scarcely larger
than peas, of a delicate, almost transparent, pearly white.  This nest is secured to a slight
twig by spider's webs.

The general colour of the male is bronzed green above, with a crescent-shaped white mark on
the lower part of the back.  It has a rich metallic blue throat, changing in certain lights;
and the wings are of a dark purple-brown.  The tail is composed of feathers of different tints--the
two central of a rich, shining green; the next, green, marked with bronze; and the outer, dark
brown, with triangular white spots on the inner web.

The whole length of the bird, with its forked tail, is about four inches.  The hen has a shorter
tail, the feathers purple-black, bronzed at the base, and most of them tipped with white and
ringed with buff. The upper part of the body is of a rich bronzed green; and the lower, a rusty-red.

Many other beautiful humming-birds appear throughout different parts of Mexico and Central
America; but we may grow weary even when examining caskets of the most brilliant gems; and
we shall have many others to describe when we reach the southern part of the continent.

LOCUSTS.

Insect life is as active in Central America as in other parts of the tropics.  The most dreaded
insect is the locust, which makes periodical attacks on the plantations, and in a single hour
the largest fields of maize are stripped of their leaves, the stems alone being left to show
that they once existed.  This creature is called by the natives the "chapulin," or langosta.
They make their first appearance as little wingless things, swarming over the ground like ants,
when they are called "santones."  In order to destroy them, the natives dig long trenches,
into which they are driven, when, unable to leap out, they are easily buried and destroyed.
Still, vast numbers escape, when they appear in enormous columns, darkening the air, and as
they sweep onwards, destroy every green thing in their course.  They cover the ground on every
side, then rising in clouds, fill the atmosphere with their multitudes, causing the trees to
appear brown, as if seared by fire.  Frequently, as their hosts sweep onwards, they are seen
falling like flakes in a snow-storm from a dark cloud.  Every device that the farmer can think
of is employed to prevent their settling: sulphur is burned, drums beaten, guns fired, and
other noises made.  Often, by such means, a plantation is preserved from destruction; but when
the columns once alight, no device avails to save the plantation from speedy desolation.

This locust or grasshopper is generally from two and a half to four inches in length, but specimens
sometimes appear five inches long; and it may be conceived what an enormous amount of food
such monsters must consume.

PART TWO, CHAPTER THREE.

RUINS OF CENTRAL AMERICA.

In all parts of Central America are found numerous signs that the country was, in bygone days,
inhabited by a numerous population far more advanced in civilisation than the tribes which
peopled it when first discovered by Columbus and his companions.  In Yucatan and Chiapas, especially,
ruins of numerous houses exist, with elaborately carved monuments and large buildings, bearing
a remarkable resemblance to those of Egypt and Babylon.  Throughout Nicaragua and other districts
many remains--such as tombs, monuments, and edifices--are found, as well as carved rocks, which
were probably the work of a people of still greater antiquity than those who inhabited the
first mentioned region.

Dr Seeman describes some rocks near the town of David, in Chiriqui, on which characters are
engraved similar, or indeed absolutely identical, with inscriptions which have been found in
the northern parts of the British Islands.  The rock is fifteen feet high, nearly fifty feet
in circumference, and rather flat on the top.  Every part--especially the eastern portion--is
covered with incised characters about an inch or half an inch deep.  The first figure on the
left hand side represents the radiant sun, followed by a series of heads with some variation.
These heads show a certain resemblance to one of the most curious characters found on the British
rocks.  They are followed by scorpion-like and other fantastic figures.  The tops of the stones
on either side are covered with a number of concentric rings and ovals, crossed with lines.
He considers them to be symbols full of meaning, and recording ideas held to be of vital importance
to the people who used them, and whose names have become a matter of doubt.

In the district of Chontales, a vast number of ancient tombs are met with in almost every direction.
They are found in plains having a good drainage, such as was generally selected by the Indians
for the sites of their villages.  These tombs are of different heights and sizes.  Some are
about twenty feet long by twelve feet wide, and eight feet above the ground.  In one which
was opened was found a round pillar seven feet high and eighteen inches across, which was standing
upright in the centre of the tomb.  There was a hand-mill for grinding corn--in shape like
those still in use in the country--a knife ten inches long, a hatchet like a reaping-hook,
and a tiger's head of natural size,--all of stone.  In some instances gold ornaments have been
found, but not in sufficient numbers to induce the people to destroy the relics.

The Indians inhabiting Nicaragua in ancient days did not apparently construct any large temples
or stone buildings, as some other natives of Central America have done.  They, however, formed
stone figures of considerable size, which remind us greatly of those which exist in Easter
Island in the Pacific.  These stone figures, often of colossal dimensions, are of two different
descriptions--the one having a mild, inoffensive expression of countenance; while the others,
presenting a combination of both human and animal, have invariably a wild, savage look, apparently
for the purpose of terrifying the beholders.  The first, it is supposed, are the idols which
the ancient Nicaraguans worshipped before the Aztec conquest of their country; while the latter
were introduced when the people had been taught to engage in the bloody rites practised by
the Mexicans.

These stone monuments, though similar, as has been remarked, to those of Easter Island, and
to others found far-away across the Pacific, are strong corroborative proofs that America was
first peopled by tribes who made their way by various stages from the continent of Asia, though,
at the same time, that long ages have passed away since they first left that far-distant region--the
cradle of the human race.  The Indian priests, like the Druids of old, appear to have chosen
the hill-tops and mountainsides, shady groves and dark ravines, for the sites of their temples
or places of worship.

From the midst of Lake Managua, in Nicaragua, rises the volcanic island of Momotombita, towering
in a perfect cone towards the blue sky.  In the midst of a natural amphitheatre on the slope
of the mountain were discovered a large number of statues (fifty or more), arranged in the
form of a square, their faces looking inwards.  Many were cast down, but others stood erect,
though all apparently had been more or less purposely mutilated.  Some of the figures represent
males, but others are undoubtedly those of females.  They are cut in black basalt of intense
hardness.  The features of the face of one, which has been conveyed to the Museum at Washington,
are singularly bold and severe in outline.  The brow is broad, the nose aquiline, while the
arms and legs are rudely indicated.  Other curious idols have been dug up in the neighbourhood
of the town of Leon.  The Spanish priests, anxious to put down the ancient idolatry from the
time of their arrival in the country, have taken pains to destroy these idols, and many have
been mutilated and others buried by their orders.

In the island of Zapetero, rising out of Lake Nicaragua, there are a still greater number of
statues--some from eight to twelve feet in height, and others of still greater magnitude--elaborately
carved out of hard stone.  Sometimes they are placed round mounds which have evidently served
the purpose of altars, on which human sacrifices probably were offered.  One of the most interesting
which has been brought to light is twelve feet high, sculptured from a single block, and representing
a human figure seated on a high pedestal, the stone at the back of the head being cut in the
form of a cross.  The limbs are heavy, and the face large and expressive of great complacency.

Some of the idols represent an animal, apparently a tiger, springing upon the head and back
of a human figure.  One--also at the Washington Museum--represents a man squatted on his haunches,
with one hand at his side, and the other placed on his breast.  The head is erect, and the
forehead encircled by a fillet, much carved.  The features are unlike most others--indeed,
it seems as if each one had its individual characteristic.  A jaguar appears on the back of
this statue, its fore-paws resting upon the shoulders, and its hind ones upon the hips, while
it grasps in its mouth the back part of the head of the figure.

Although many of the figures represent human beings, others are those of animals.  One, a jaguar,
is seated on its haunches, the head thrown forward, the mouth open,--the attitude and expression
being that of great ferocity.  It is very boldly sculptured.  Another, a very well proportioned
human figure, is seated on a square throne raised five feet from the ground.  It is remarkable
for having on its head another monstrous head, representing some fierce animal.  The heads
of several of the idols are thus surmounted.  These symbolical heads were probably introduced
with the same object as those which were so general among the Egyptian idols.

In the midst of this collection of idols are two or more oblong stones, on the sides of which
are hieroglyphical inscriptions.  In the centre are hollow places, probably designed to receive
the blood of the victims.

It is remarkable that the heads of many of the figures are surmounted with cross-shaped ornaments
similar to the one discovered at Palenque by Mr Stevens.  One of these crosses--which no doubt
had their origin in Babylon, where they are well-known symbols--was set up by the Spaniards
in the convent-church of Tonala, and there venerated.

The Mexicans possessed a symbol called the Tonacaquahutl, or "tree of life," which was represented
with branches somewhat in the form of a cross, surmounted by a bird.  This symbol also appears
on a tablet discovered by Mr Stevens at Palenque.  In various parts of the country terra cotta
figures have been dug up.  Some of them are rude, but others are extremely artistic; and though
not equally graceful, resemble much, in the form of the limbs, many Egyptian figures.  Among
them is a figure from the island of Ometepe, which represents an alligator upon the back of
a human figure, which apparently originally surmounted a large vase.

Mounds similar to those found in the valley of the Mississippi have been discovered in Honduras.
But by far the most interesting remains are those of Palenque, in Chiapas; of Copan, in Honduras;
and of Uxmal and Chi-chen, in Yucatan.  Here are extensive ruins of cities, containing the
remains of pyramids, and the walls of massive buildings, broken columns, altars, statues, and
numberless sculptured fragments, showing that a large population inhabited this country, and
that the people had attained a considerable knowledge of the arts, though, at the same time,
they seem to have been sunk in the grossest idolatry.

In the western part of Honduras, adjoining the province of Guatemala, are extensive ruins,
which stretch for more than two miles along the banks of the river Copan.  The outer walls,
which run north and south along the margin of the stream, are from sixty to ninety feet high;
while other walls, of a similar character, surround the principal ruins. Within these walls
are extensive terraces and pyramidal buildings, massive stone columns, idols, and altars covered
with sculpture.  The numerous terraces and pyramids are also walled with cut stone, and ornamented
with carved heads of gigantic proportions, and colossal idols of solid stone from ten to fifteen
feet in height.  The altars in front of the statues are of single blocks of stone, many of
them richly carved, but all differing from each other.  One of the most remarkable altars stands
on four globes cut out of the same stone.  It is six feet square and four feet high, its top
covered with hieroglyphics, while each side represents four individuals.  The figure is sitting
cross-legged, in the Oriental fashion, and the head-dresses are remarkable for their curious
and complicated forms.  All have breastplates, and each holds some article in his hand.

From these carvings we read, though indistinctly, some of the characteristics of the people.
From the absence of all weapons of war, however, we may suppose them peaceable, though grossly
idolatrous, and, from being unwarlike, easily subdued.

On entering the town, after some adventures, Mr Stevens made his way to an area, which he ascertained
to be a square, with steps on all sides, almost as perfect as those of the Colosseum.  He ascended
the steps, which were ornamented with sculptures, till he reached a broad terrace, one hundred
feet in height, overlooking the river.  The whole terrace was covered with trees, among which
were two gigantic cotton-trees of about twenty feet in circumference, extending their roots
fifty to one hundred feet round, and which had, in many places, displaced the stones. Among
other ornaments were rows of gigantic heads, which, no doubt, were intended to represent those
of apes; for amongst the fragments were the remains of the body of a colossal ape, strongly
resembling in outline and appearance one of the four monstrous animals which once stood in
front of the obelisk of Luxor, and which, under the name of Cynocephali, were worshipped at
Thebes.  This fragment was about six feet high.

No verbal description can give a correct idea of the elaborate workmanship of the numberless
idols.  One, described by Mr Stevens as the most beautiful in Copan, he considers equal to
the finest Egyptian sculpture; and thinks, indeed, it would be impossible, with the best instruments
of modern times, to cut stones more perfectly.  They are generally from twelve to fourteen
feet in height, about four wide, and two or three deep.  On the front is, in all cases, a human
head, with arms and hands, surrounded by the most intricate carving.  Frequently other smaller
heads appear below the large one.  In many instances the legs and feet, as well as the body,
are represented.  The backs and sides are covered with the most elaborate hieroglyphics, deeply
carved-- the whole forming a mass of rich ornamentation.  Before several of the idols stand
altars, also carved in the same finished way.

The most interesting figure--which, unlike all the others, is remarkable for its simplicity--is
that of a human being, bearing on its head a heavy cross-like crown.  It cannot fail to remind
those acquainted with the idols of Babylon of the Triune God represented in the sculptured
stones of those far-famed ruins.

STONE QUARRIES.

Some two or three miles from the ruins are the quarries, from which the stones for the buildings
and statues of Copan are evidently taken.  Here still exist huge blocks of stone, in different
degrees of preparation. Near a river was found a gigantic block, much larger than any in the
city, which was probably on its way thither, to be carved and set up, when the labours of the
workmen were arrested.  It is difficult to conjecture how these vast masses were transported
over the irregular and broken surface of the country, and particularly how one of them was
set up on the top of a mountain two thousand feet in height.

A place of this name was captured by Hernandes de Chaves at the time when its now broken monuments,
ruined terraces, walls, and sculptured figures, were entire, and were all richly painted; and
it seems strange that Europeans could have beheld its wonders without spreading the report
of them throughout the civilised world, yet no account of this strange city was extant till
it was visited by Mr Stevens.

PALENQUE.

Still more curious and interesting than the last described city, are the ruins of Palenque,
in the province of Chiapas, bordering upon Yucatan. One of the chief structures of this ancient
city stands on an artificial elevation 40 feet high, 310 feet in length, and 260 feet in width.
The sides were originally covered with stones, which have been thrown down by the growth of
trees.  On the summit are the ruins of a building, known as the Palace, about 25 feet in height,
with a front measuring 228 feet by 180 feet deep.  In front were, originally, fourteen doorways,
with intervening piers, covered with human figures, hieroglyphics, and carved ornaments.  The
walls are of stone, laid with mortar and sand; and the whole is covered by stucco, nearly as
hard as stone, and richly painted.  On each side of the steps are gigantic human statues carved
in stone, with rich head-dresses and necklaces.

In one of the buildings is a stone tower of three stories, thirty feet square at the base,
and rising far above the surrounding walls.  The walls are very massive, and the floors are
paved with large square stones.  In one of the corridors are two large tablets of hieroglyphics.

There are numerous other buildings, all standing on the summits of similar pyramids.  In several
of the buildings the roofs still remain, and preserve the stuccoed ornamentation with which
the walls are adorned.  The colours, in many of them, are still bright; and could the hieroglyphics
with which they are surrounded be read, they would probably give as clear a history of the
departed inhabitants as do those found in the tombs on the banks of the Nile.  The most remarkable
figures are the bas-reliefs, in stucco, representing a woman with a child in her arms--which
forcibly remind us of the statues in ancient Babylon representing the goddess mother and son
(the same worshipped in Egypt under the names of Isis and Osiris; in India, even to this day,
as Isi and Iswara; and also in China, where Shingmoo, the holy mother, is represented with
a child in her arms, and a glory round her head).  It is impossible, looking at these figures,
to suppose otherwise than that they were derived from the same source whence the idols of Egypt,
Greece, and pagan Rome had their origin.

RUINS OF QUICHE.

In the north-east of Guatemala are the ruins of another city, the capital of the province of
Quiche.  It is surrounded by a deep ravine, which forms a natural foss, leaving only two very
narrow roads as entrances, guarded by the castle of Resguado.  The palace of the kings, which
stood in the centre of the city, surpasses every other edifice, competing in magnificence with
that of Montezuma in Mexico.  It was constructed of hewn stones, of various colours.  So large
was the city, that it could send no less than seventy-two thousand fighting men to oppose the
Spaniards.  The whole palace is now, however, completely destroyed, and the materials have
been carried away to build a village in the neighbourhood.  The most conspicuous portion of
the ruins remaining is called El Sacrificatorio.  It is a quadrangular stone structure, rising
in a pyramidal form to the height of thirty-three feet.  At the corners are four buttresses
of cut stone.  Steps lead up on the eastern side.  On the top it is evident that an altar was
once placed, for the sacrifice of human victims, which struck even the Spaniards with horror.
The whole was in full view of the people who collected round the base.  The ruins differ entirely
from Copan and Palenque.  Here no statues, carved figures, or hieroglyphics are seen. It is
therefore supposed that these cities are of a much older date, and built by another race.

UXMAL.

The most magnificent and perfect remains in the country are those of Uxmal, about fifty miles
south of Merida, the principal city of Yucatan. Here, amid the dense forest, are found walls
of considerable elevation, with very extensive buildings,--the walls still standing to their
full height, and even the roofs, in some places, perfect.  The largest building--supposed to
be the palace of the sovereign--stands on the uppermost of three terraces, each walled with
cut stone.  It is 322 feet in length, 39 broad, and 24 high.  The front has thirteen doorways;
the centre of which is 8 feet, 6 inches wide, and 8 feet, 10 inches high. The upper part is
ornamented with sculpture in great profusion, of rich and curious workmanship.  The walls are
covered with cement; and the floors are of square stones, smoothly polished, and laid with
as much regularity as that of the best modern masonry.  The roof forms a triangular arch, constructed
with stones overlapping, and covered by a layer of flat stones.  It is remarkable that the
lintels of the doorways are of wood, known as Sapote wood.  Many of them are still hard and
sound, and in their places; but others have been perforated by wormholes, their decay causing
the fall of the walls.

Two other large buildings, facing each other, are embellished with sculpture, the most remarkable
features of which are two colossal serpents, which once extended the whole length of the walls.
Further on are four great ranges of edifices, placed on the uppermost of three terraces.  The
plan of these buildings is quadrangular, with a courtyard in the centre.  The walls are, like
the others, ornamented with rich and intricate carving, presenting a scene of strange magnificence.
One of the buildings is 170 feet long, and is remarkable for the two colossal entwined serpents
which run round it, and encompass nearly all the ornaments throughout its whole length.  These
serpents are sculptured out of small blocks of stone, which are arranged in the wall with great
skill and precision.  One of the serpents has its monstrous jaws distended; and within them
is a human head, the face of which is distinctly visible in the carving.

The most tastefully ornamented edifice is know as the "House of the Dwarf."  It stands on the
summit of a lofty mound, faced with stone, nearly ninety feet high, the building itself being
seventeen feet high. Its purpose it is difficult to divine.

Scattered throughout the ruins are a number of dome-shaped subterraneous chambers, from eight
to ten feet deep, and from twelve to twenty in diameter.  The floor is of hard matter, and
the walls and ceilings of plaster.  A circular hole at the summit of each, barely large enough
to admit a man, is the only opening into them.  It is not known whether they were used as cisterns,
or for granaries, like those of Egypt.

OTHER RUINS.

The whole country to the south of Uxmal is covered with ruins.  At a place called Labra, there
is a tower richly ornamented, forty feet in height, which stands on the summit of an artificial
elevation.  In another place there is one forty-five feet high; along the top of which, standing
out from the wall, is a row of deaths' heads--or perhaps monkeys' heads--and underneath are
two lines of human figures, greatly mutilated.

At Kewick, a short distance from Labra, are numerous other ruins, mostly remarkable for the
simplicity of their architecture and the grandeur of their proportions.  It is still uncertain
whether these cities were inhabited by the unhappy people conquered by the Spaniards, or whether
they were built by a race which, from some unknown cause, had already passed away.  We see
how completely the Mexicans and Peruvians, after the conquest, sunk from their comparatively
high state of civilisation into barbarism; and such might have been the case with the inhabitants
of these cities.  Their origin will probably for ever afford matter for speculation.

The different cities vary in their style of architecture almost as much as as they do from
those of Assyria or Egypt; but when we come to examine the sculptures, we may be able to trace
a much stronger resemblance.  The statues of the woman and child, the cruciform ornaments,
the serpents and gigantic heads of apes, as well as those of the typical heads of savage animals
surmounting the heads of the statues, are all to be found on the banks of the Nile, and were
probably derived from the same central source.  While the tribes who proceeded westward peopled
Egypt, others, among whom a similar system of idolatry prevailed, may have migrated towards
the east, and finally made their way across the Pacific to the shores of America.

PART THREE, CHAPTER ONE.

SOUTH AMERICA.

SCENES OF ANCIENT DAYS.

Time was when a rocky island, against which dashed the surges of the Atlantic on the east and
of the Pacific on the west, rose in solitude from the wide-extending ocean where now the highlands
of Guiana appear above the surrounding plains.  Not another spot of dry land was to be found--so
geologists affirm--between that point and the hills of Canada on the north, or for thousands
of miles southward towards the pole, over that portion of the globe's surface now occupied
by the vast continent of America.  Then, by slow degrees, the mountains of Brazil, with their
mines of glittering gems, appeared above the surface of the waters, amid which huge reptile-like
whales, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and cetiosaurs buffeted the billows, and vast saurians,
lizards, and alligators, rivalling the elephant in bulk, and twice his length--such as the
megalosaurus, the iguanodon, and teleosaurus--crawled along the slimy shores; while giant birds,
with wide-spreading feet, stalked across the newly-formed plains, or flew shrieking, with wings
of prodigious expanse skimming the glittering sea,--the lords paramount of this lower world.
At length the earth, convulsed by mighty throes in the far-away west from north to south, began
to cast up a long line of rocky heights, now to sink, now to rise once more above the surface,--
till by degrees Pelion piled on Ossa--the vast chain of the Cordilleras rose towards the skies,
forming a mighty barrier between the two great oceans.

On the eastern side, the waves of the Atlantic, beating continuously, brought down into the
shallow sea the debris from the newly-formed rocks, gradually filling up the spaces between
the already created islands; and the streams, running down from the mountain heights, formed
the plan of the three great river-systems of the continent--the Orinoco in the north, the Amazon
in the centre, and La Plata in the south.

The Almighty Creator appears always to have worked by mechanical means in preparing the globe
for the habitation of man.  There came then a glacial period.  Ponderous blocks of ice, resting
not only on the mountainsides, but extending over the plains, and acting the part of mighty
mill-stones, ground into impalpable powder the pieces of detached rock of which the lower surface
was composed, till a soil was formed capable of producing a wondrous and varied vegetation
to clothe that Amazonian valley.

[The continent, Professor Agassiz supposes, extended at that time between 200 and 300 miles
further east than it does at present; but the waters from the rapidly-melting mass of ice,
forcing a passage towards the ocean, carried a large portion away, leaving only certain tracts
which now appear in the form of islands at the mouths of the Amazon and Orinoco.]

The work has been accomplished--the land prepared for its future inhabitants!  Mighty torrents
fall from the lofty mountains, meandering through the vast Amazonian plain.  The age of winter
has passed away. The earth, warmed by the fires beneath and the hot sun above, steams with
vapour.  Lofty trees rise from the alluvial soil.  A dense mass of underwood springs up; creepers
innumerable hang from the boughs; countless multitudes of insects have been called into existence--
termites, ants, and beetles--feeding on the leaves and herbage, and on the giant trunks themselves.
It might seem, numerous and voracious as they are, that they must quickly destroy the clothing
of verdure which covers the soil.  But they are not destined thus to triumph over the wonderful
work of the Creator's hand.

A law has been framed by which all things are beautifully and wonderfully balanced.  Monstrous
animals have been created to place bounds on their too great increase.  Huge, awkward-looking
beasts covered with shaggy hair, with thick, short limbs, and powerful, sharp claws bent inwards
on soft pads--compelling them to move on the edge of their paws--are busy with the clay-formed
nests of the insects, dashing them asunder, and devouring their active builders--taking in
whole armies at a mouthful.

See yonder huge creature, its body the size of a rhinoceros, covered with a coat of armour,
a convex oval shield, formed of hexagonal plates wonderfully fitted to each other!  It is an
armadillo, the precursor of a race still abounding in the land, though of diminutive form compared
to its mighty predecessor.  See how, with powerful jaws, it crunches up a fallen tree, perforated
through and through by ants,--grinding the papery partitions of the dry wood, licking in and
chewing between its wonderful cylinder teeth the whole mass into a black pulp!

"But lo! here are mightier creatures yet.  See the vast mylodon, the scelidothere, and the
still more colossal megathere!  Ponderous giants these.  The very forests seem to tremble under
their stately stride. Their immense bulk preponderates behind, terminating in a tail of wonderful
thickness and solidity.  The head is mean, and awakens no terror.  The eye lacks lustre, and
threatens no violence, though the whole form betokens vast power; and the stout limbs are terminated
by the same thick, in-bent, sharp, hoofed claws.  One of them approaches that wide-spreading
locust-tree.  He gazes up at the huge mud-brown structures that resemble hogsheads affixed
to the forks of the branches, and he knows that the luscious termites are filling them to overflowing.
His lips water at the tempting sight.  Have them he must; but how? That heavy stern-post of
his was never made for climbing.  Yet, see! he rears himself up against the tree.  Is he about
to essay the scaling? Not he.  He knows his powers better.  He gives it one embrace--one strong
hug, as if to test its thickness and hold upon the earth.  Now he is digging away below, scooping
out the soft soil from between the roots; and it is marvellous to note how rapidly he lays
them bare with those great shovel-like claws of his.  Now he rears himself again; straddles
wide on his hind-feet, fixing the mighty claws deep in the ground; plants himself firmly on
his huge tail, as on the third foot of a tripod, and once more grasps the tree.  The enormous
hind-quarters, the limbs and the loins, the broad pelvis and thick spinal cord, supplying abundant
nervous energy to the swelling muscles inserted in the ridged and keeled bones, all come into
play as a point d'appui for the Herculean effort."  [Gosse's "Natural History."]

"And now conceive the massive frame of the megathere convulsed with the mighty wrestling, every
vibrating fibre reacting upon its bony attachments with the force of a hundred giants.  Extraordinary
must be the strength and proportions of the tree if, when rocked to and fro to right and left
in such an embrace, it can long withstand the efforts of its assailant.  It yields!  The roots
fly up.  The earth is scattered wide upon the surrounding foliage.  The tree comes down with
a thundering crash, cracking and snapping the great boughs like grass. The frightened insects
swarm out at every orifice, but the huge beast is in upon them.  With his sharp hoofs he tears
apart the crusty walls of the earth-nests, and licks out their living contents--fat pupae,
eggs, and all--rolling down the sweet morsels, half sucking, half chewing, with a delighted
gusto that repays him for all his mighty toil.  While this giant is absorbed in his juicy breakfast,
see! there lounges along his neighbour the macrauchen--equally massive, equally heavy, equally
vast, equally peaceful.  The stranger resembles the huge rhinoceros, elevated on much loftier
limbs.  But his most remarkable feature is the enormously long neck, like that of the camel,
but carried to the altitude of that of the giraffe.  Thus he thrusts his great muzzle into
the very centre of the leafy trees, and gathering with his prehensile and flexible lip the
succulent twigs and foliage, he too finds abundance of food for his immense body in the teeming
vegetation without intruding on the supply of his fellows."  [Owen on the "Mylodon."]

Emerging from the water appears a great head, with little piggish eyes set wide apart, with
immense muzzle and lips, and broad cheeks armed with stiff projecting bristles--the sluggish
toxodon.  The creature opens its cavernous mouth to seize a floating gourd; and now it tears
up the great fleshy arum roots from the clay bank, and grinding them to pulp, sinks below to
masticate its meal.  Numberless other curious creatures are roaming through the forest, or
feeding on the banks; many others, having run their destined course, disappear from the face
of the globe, to be replaced by a new creation of far less magnitude--the mild llama, the savage
jaguar, the nimble monkey with prehensile tail, the ant-eater, arborial and terrestrial; the
diminutive sloth, thick-skinned tapir, alligators, turtles, and manatees; lizards, serpents;
the beautiful denizens of the air with superb plumage, numerous species of humming-birds, gorgeous
butterflies and beetles, vieing in their shining hues with the rich gems hidden within the
bowels of the earth.

It is of these, and of many others in wonderful variety; as well as of their master--man--in
his savage state; and of the curious trees and shrubs, whose fruits afford him and the lower
orders abundant nourishment, that some outline sketches will now be given.

PART THREE, CHAPTER TWO.

A GENERAL VIEW OF SOUTH AMERICA.

Three separate mountain-systems exist in South America:--that of the Andes on the west, Guiana
and Venezuela on the north, and the serras of Brazil in the centre.  The surface of the remainder
of the continent is occupied by vast level, or undulating tracts of different elevations. The
chief portion of the region through which the Amazon flows, but slightly raised above its surface,
is covered with the richest and most varied vegetation to be found on any part of the globe,
extending on either side of its course, as also along the shores of the Atlantic, north and
south, for many hundreds of miles.  Here enormous trees of many descriptions, of varied shapes
and heights, grow in wonderful profusion.  The candelabra, sumaumera, the manicaria, and raphia,
with their enormous leaves, and other palms innumerable, tower towards the sky.  To the south
of the Orinoco is another thickly-wooded region, known as the Silvas; which, united to the
woods of Guiana and those of Brazil, Eastern Peru and Bolivia, form one enormous forest.  From
the north bank of the last-named river, the ground gently rises towards the interior at the
rate of five feet in a mile.  At a distance of one hundred miles from its hanks, at a slightly
increased elevation, appears a sandy terrace--the greater portion barren, though in some places
bearing grasses, and supplying water to the wide-extending plains below. This barren region,
which occupies the most northern part of South America, is called the Llanos Altos.  A far
wider and more level country extends between the base of the Andes and the banks of the Orinoco,
at a height of between two hundred and five hundred feet.  Not a stone or rock, not even a
pebble, is to be seen on these vast plains.  So level are they, that the currents of the rivers
crossing them are almost imperceptible, and are frequently sent back towards their sources
when met by strong winds.  They are covered with grass, which affords pasturage to large herds
of wild cattle--the only other species of vegetation being a few bushes growing on the banks
of the streams; while here and there, scattered at considerable distances apart, a few tall
palm-trees are seen, reminding the traveller of the deserts of Arabia.

In the southern part of the continent are the treeless plains of the Pampas, extending from
about 20 degrees south latitude for a distance of fully two thousand miles into Patagonia,
and averaging in width five hundred miles.  Stretching, as do these plains, across a large
portion of the South Temperate Zone, they present great varieties of climate. The northern
portion is watered by the River La Plata and its tributaries.  To the south of Buenos Ayres
the rivers are fewer and of less extent.  The north-western Pampas consist of slightly undulating
and dry plains, though interspersed with vast tracts on which lofty thistles rear their heads--useful,
however, as fuel to the inhabitants. Further on, to the west, is a wide-extending pastoral
district; and yet beyond, reaching to the foot of the Cordilleras, the soil is well-suited
for agriculture.  The pastoral region is almost a dead level, with large shallow salt-lakes,--one
of them measuring fifty miles in length by twenty in width.  Scarcely a tree is to be found
throughout this region, and but few permanent water-courses.  To the north extends a salt desert
for upwards of one hundred miles, with a width of two hundred miles.  It is crossed by the
River Salado, which, rising in the Cordilleras, falls into the Plata, to the south of which
rises a number of step-like terraces, sterile during the heats of summer, but covered with
verdure after the rains of spring.  Huge boulders, brown grass growing in tufts, and low spine-covered
bushes, diversify the surface.  In this inhospitable region transitions from heat to cold are
very great.  Now the traveller is panting under the intense heat of the sun's rays; and anon
an icy blast rushes across the plain, compelling him to draw close around his body his thick
poncho, for protection against its chilling influences.

Further to the south are found large swamps and lagoons, one of them having an area of one
thousand square miles, its surface covered with aquatic plants.  In the rainy season, the rivers,
overflowing their banks, inundate the plains--leaving behind, however, a thick deposit of fertilising
soil, from which, as elsewhere, rich crops are capable of being produced.  Further on, to the
south, the Pampas, over which the yet savage and untamed Patagonians roam, and hunt the huanacu
and ostrich, is generally higher and drier.

The South American continent, it will thus be seen, consists of several distinctly different
descriptions of country:--the long line of the Cordilleras, with their snow-capped peaks and
their lofty punas or high table-lands, and the narrow strip of arid soil at their western base;
the three separate mountain-systems of Venezuela, Guiana, and the Brazils; the mighty forests
bordering the great rivers and their tributaries, to which must be added the wooded heights
of the inter-tropical regions, where tall trees, including several palms, flourish at an elevation
of many thousand feet above the level of the ocean; and lastly, the wide-extending regions
of the Llanos and the Pampas.  These, as might be supposed, present great varieties of animal
life--though scarcely so great as might have been expected, when it is remembered that they
extend from 10 degrees north to 50 degrees south latitude.  Several species indeed are found
far to the north of the equator, and also near the southern end of the continent.  But to give
an idea of these different regions, they must be described in detail.

PART THREE, CHAPTER THREE.

VALLEY OF THE AMAZON.

Standing on the eastern spur of the Andes, between 3 degrees and 4 degrees south of the equator,
the eye of the traveller may see in imagination a vast valley, clothed with a dense forest,
stretching towards the far-distant Atlantic.  Behind him, on the west, tower the lofty peaks
of the Cordilleras; on his left, in a northerly direction, appear the mountains and highlands
of Venezuela and Guiana; while to the south rise the serras and table-lands of the Brazils.
It is the Valley of the Amazon, in which more than half of Europe might be contained. Down
the centre flows a mighty stream, the tributaries of which alone contain a bulk of water greater
than all the European rivers put together.

Upwards of five hundred miles away to the south of the spot where the traveller stands, is
the little lake of Lauricocha, near the silver-mines of Cerro de Pasco in Peru, just below
the limit of perpetual snow--14,000 feet above the level of the sea.  This lake has the honour
of giving birth to the mighty stream: its waters forming the River Tunguragua, which, roaring
and foaming in a series of cataracts and rapids through rocky valleys, flows northerly till
it reaches the frontier of Ecuador.  It then turns suddenly to the east, which direction it
maintains, with a slightly northerly inclination, for two thousand miles--its volume greatly
increased by numerous large streams, each of which is by itself a mighty river--till, attaining
a width which may vie with that of the Baltic, it rushes with such fierce force into the Atlantic
as to turn aside on either hand the salt-waters of the ocean.  Thus the seaman approaching
the shore of South America, when still out of sight of land, may lower his bucket and draw
up the fresh-water which, it may be, has issued forth weeks before from the sides of the Andes.
The whole length of the river, following its main curves, is but little under three thousand
miles, while the tributaries from north to south stretch over seventeen hundred miles.

The basin of the Amazon may be considered like a shallow trough lying parallel to the equator,
the southern sides having double the inclination of the northern, the whole gently sloping
eastward.  The channel of the river lies rather to the north of the basin, some hills rising
directly above its waters; while the falls of several rivers to the south are two hundred miles
above their mouths.  Two thousand miles from its mouth the depth of the river is never less
than eighteen feet, while many of its tributaries at their embouchures are of equal depth;
and at the junction of the great rivers the hollows of its bed attain a depth of twenty-four
fathoms.  At Tabalingua, two thousand miles from its mouth, it is a mile and a half broad;
and lower down, at the entrance of one of its tributaries--the Madeira--it measures three miles
across.  Still further to the east its sea-like reaches extend to the north for ten miles,
with still wider lake-like expanses, so that the eye of the voyager can scarcely reach the
forest-covered banks on the opposite side; while if the River Para is properly considered one
of its branches, its measurement from shore to shore, across a countless number of islands,
is one hundred and eighty miles--equal to the breadth of the widest part of the Baltic.

After receiving the waters of numerous streams, many of which flow for considerable distances
parallel with its shores, and are united by a network of channels, it is joined by its most
considerable northern tributary--the Rio Negro.  This stream, rising in the mountains of Venezuela,
and passing amidst the Llanos, robbing the Orinoco of part of its waters, has already, before
it reaches the Amazon, flowed for a course of one thousand five hundred miles.  It is called
the Negro from its black colour.  It is here not less than nineteen fathoms deep, and three
thousand six hundred paces broad.  The next great affluent is the Yapura, which, rising in
the mountains of New Granada, takes a south-easterly course for one thousand miles, its principal
mouth entering the Amazon opposite the town of Ega; but it has numberless small channels, the
streams of which, two hundred miles apart, flow into the great river.  The upper part of the
Amazon is frequently called the Solimoens, which name it retains as far south as the mouth
of the River Negro.

About sixty miles further east, its largest southern affluent--the gigantic Madeira--unites
its milky waters with the turbid stream of the main river.  One branch, the Beni, rises in
the neighbourhood of the ancient Cuzco in Peru, near Lake Titicaca, its whole extent from the
centre of the province of Bolivia being nearly the length of the Amazon itself.  At its mouth
it is two miles wide and sixty-six feet deep; and five hundred miles up it is a mile wide.
Numerous islands are found in its course: for nearly five hundred miles it is navigable for
large vessels, when a cataract intervenes.  Were it not for this, there would be a free navigation
from the centre of the province of Bolivia to the ocean, embracing islands the size of many
of the Old World provinces, and widening into broad lakes.  The monarch of waters flows on
between its low forest-clothed banks till, four hundred miles from its mouth, it reaches the
Strait of Obydos, where it is narrowed to two thousand paces.  Through this channel its waters
rush with immense force, calculated at five hundred thousand cubic feet in one second--sufficient
to fill all the streams in Europe, and swell them to overflowing.  No plummet has hitherto
sounded the depth of its bed at this point, the force of the stream probably rendering the
operation almost impracticable.

Its last two great tributaries are the Tapajos, six times the length of the Thames, and the
Xingu, twice that of the Rhine; while further east a narrow channel unites it with the River
Para, into which flows the broad stream of the Tocantins.  This river, rising in the Minas-Geraes,
six hundred miles from Rio Janeiro, is one thousand six hundred miles long, and ten miles wide
at its mouth.  Opposite to Para is the large island of Marajo; and if Professor Agassiz is
right in supposing that the continent once extended much further to the east than it now does,
this island may properly be considered in the centre of the mouth of the river, and the River
Para might then properly be called one of its true embouchures.  But only a few of the streams
which feed the Amazon have been named.  Numberless other rivers swell its waters, united to
it by countless channels which form a wonderful network throughout the whole region, joining
also many of the main rivers together, with the intricate navigation of which the natives alone
are acquainted.

These curious water-paths, or igarapes, as they are called, are often so narrow that the branches
of the lofty trees meet overhead, enabling the traveller in his canoe to proceed for miles
together sheltered from the noonday sun.  Here and there a glimpse of the sky can be discovered
through the umbrageous foliage overhead, while birds of gay plumage flit to and fro, or sit
perched on the branches uttering their strange and varied cries.  In the intervals, or sometimes
forming the termination of the water-path, numerous pools of various sizes exist--some a few
yards across, others expanding into lakes--filled mostly by the overflowing of the main river
during the rainy season.  They are the habitations of a great variety of fishes.  Here several
species of turtles and alligators swarm in vast numbers; electric eels, too, abound in them,
as well as many of the other curious water-creatures of that region.  Water-fowl and various
other aquatic birds dwell on their banks, while on the surface of their placid waters float
the wide-spreading leaves and magnificent blossoms of the Victoria Regia, as also of other
lilies and water-plants.

SCENES ON THE AMAZON.

The chief feature of the Lower Amazon is the vast expanse of smooth water, of a pale yellowish-olive
colour, bearing on its bosom detached masses of aquatic grass floating down like islands, sometimes
mixed with huge trees, their branches and roots interlocked, and often carrying among them
wild animals, which, unconscious of their character, have there taken refuge from their foes,
or have ventured thither in search of prey.  The timid stag and fierce jaguar are sometimes
thus entrapped and carried out to sea.  At even and morn flocks of parrots and large and yellow
macaws, fly backwards and forwards, uttering their wild and hoarse cries; herons and rails
frequent the marshes on its banks; while all night long the cries of gulls and terns are heard
over the sandy banks where they deposit their eggs, while they may be seen during the day sitting
in rows on floating logs gliding down the stream, motionless and silent, as if contemplating
the scenery.  There are divers and darters, too, in abundance.  Now and then a huge manatee
comes gliding by, its cow-like head rising to breathe the upper air; while dolphins, porpoise-like,
rear their backs above the surface, or leap half out of the water as they swim up the stream.
On the low banks, huge alligators with open jaws are basking in the sun, or leisurely swimming
across the river.

THE RAINY SEASON.

This magnificent region enjoys a perpetual summer, its various fruits coming to maturity, according
to their character, at different periods throughout the year.  It has, however, its wet and
dry seasons.  The rain occurs at one time in the Upper Amazon, and at another in the Lower,--greatly
swelling the volume of water in the main stream, which, unable to find its way towards the
ocean, rushes through the countless channels and igarapes, overflowing the lower portions of
a vast district called the Gapo.  The waters begin to rise in February, and progress inch by
inch until the middle of June, gradually swelling the rivers and lakes, when, these becoming
filled, the lower lands and sand-banks are overflowed even far-away in the interior.  The forests
are traversed by numerous gullies, which in the dry season are wide dells, but now become transformed
into broad creeks, through which canoes can proceed to great distances under the shade of the
lofty trees.

At this period of the year the inland pools are frequented by swarms of turtle, as well as
alligators, and shoals of fish which leave the main river; while the flocks of wading birds
migrate northerly, thus greatly dispersing the food on which the natives depend for their existence.
The fishermen who have been employed during the dry months in catching turtle and fish on the
sand-banks return to their villages, though some employ themselves in collecting the Brazil-nut
and wild cacao, which are now ripe.

About the first week in June, the flood has risen sometimes to the height of forty feet above
the usual level of the river, when it now begins to subside.  The rains, however, do not fall
continuously, though very heavy at times.  Several days of beautiful sunny weather generally
intervene.  The fine season begins with a few days of brilliant weather--the rays of the sun
breaking forth among the passing clouds. Towards the middle of July the sand-banks again appear,
flocks of gulls and other water birds fly by, and the gaily-plumaged inhabitants of the forest
come forth into full activity and life.

STORMS.

The navigation of the Amazon is not free from danger.  Fierce storms arise; black clouds gather
over the blue expanse, suffused anon with a lurid yellow tinge, and the fierce whirlwind howls
along the river-banks, tearing the placid stream into masses of foam; the tall trees bend before
the blast, and huge branches are wrenched off and hurled into the water.  The long-legged waders
and other water birds, unable to face it, throw themselves on the ground, and cling with claws
and beak to the sand to escape being carried helplessly away.

THE POROROCCA.

Sometimes, too, the destroying pororocca--a vast wave rising across the whole width of the
stream, to the height of twelve or fifteen feet-- sweeps up the stream.  Advancing noiselessly
over the deeper portions of the river-bed, it rises into an angry billow, with a fearful roar
when passing over a shallow, or meeting any impediment in its course.  A French traveller describes
an island where he and his companions had rested on their voyage down the stream.  They had
happily gone over to the mainland on the previous evening, when, as they stood on the shore,
the pororocca was heard approaching.  Onward it came till the island was reached, when, with
an angry roar, it burst into masses of foam, and swept over the devoted spot, carrying in its
fierce embrace not only the whole mass of vegetation, but overturning the foundations of the
island itself, so that in a few seconds not a vestige remained.  Sometimes, too, the higher
banks of the Upper Amazon, crowned by lofty trees, are worn away by the rapid current, increased
during the rainy season, continually passing beneath them, till the upper portions, deprived
of their support, fall over with a terrific roar into the stream, dragging with them their
neighbours.  The earth trembles with the concussion, the waters hiss and foam and rush furiously
over the impediments in their course.  Sometimes miles of the bank thus give way, the sound
being heard far up and down the stream.  Occasionally a canoe and its crew-- who, to avoid
the current, have been toiling close along the bank--have been thus overwhelmed; while others,
descending, unaware of the obstruction, have been dragged by the furious whirlpool thus formed
amid the tangled branches, and destroyed.

PART THREE, CHAPTER FOUR.

CHARACTER OF VEGETATION ON THE BANKS.

A dense vegetation, though somewhat varied in character, rises like a lofty wall of verdure
along the banks of the mighty stream, from the base of the Andes to its mouth in the Atlantic.
There, where the influence of the sea-breeze is felt, the ever-present mangrove of the tropics
forms a thick belt round the shores of its numberless islands. Higher up, various palms of
many graceful forms appear, interspersed with numberless other trees, some bearing huge pods
a yard long, others vast nuts and other curious fruits,--the banks below fringed either with
giant grasses and broad-leaved bananas, or here and there with the large wide heart-shaped
leaves of the aninga growing on the summit of tall stems, or in other places with the murici
of a lower growth close to the water's edge.  Among the most remarkable is the white-stemmed
cecropia, the lofty massaranduba, or cow-tree, often rising to the height of one hundred and
fifty feet; the seringa, or india-rubber tree, with its smooth grey bark, tall erect trunk,
and thick glossy leaves.  The assai-palm, with its slender stem, its graceful head and delicate
green plumes, is at first more numerous than any other.  Now appears the miriti, or mauritia--one
of the most beautiful of its tribe, with pendent clusters of glossy fruit, and enormous spreading
fan-like leaves cut into ribbons; the jupati, with plume-like leaves forty feet and upwards
in length, graceful in the extreme, starting almost from the ground.  Here is seen also the
bussu, with stiff entire leaves, also of great length, growing upright from a short stem, close
together, and serrated along their edges.  Higher up still, while the palms become less numerous,
other trees take their places.  Among them appears conspicuous the majestic sumaumera, its
flat dome rounded, but not conical, towering high above the forest.  The branches of this tree
are greatly ramified and knotty, and the bark is white.  Conspicuous, too, is the taxi, with
brown buds and white flowers; while the margin of the water is thickly fringed by a belt of
arrow-grass, or frexes--so called by the Portuguese--six feet in height.  Its name is given
in consequence of being used by the Indians in making arrows for their blowpipes.

Amid this wonderful mass of forest vegetation grows an intricate tracery of lianas and climbing
sipos, some running round and round the trees, and holding them in a close embrace; others
hanging from branch to branch in rich festoons, covered with starlike flowers, or dropping
in long lines to the ground,--often to take root and shoot upwards again round a neighbouring
stem, or drooping like the loose cordage of a ship swinging in the breeze.  Often they form
so dense and impenetrable a thicket from the ground upwards that a way must be cleared with
an axe to proceed even a short distance from the banks towards the inner recesses of the forest.

THE GAPO.

On the Gapo, or submerged lands, however, a considerable difference in the vegetation appears.
The palms are here often more numerous than in other parts.  This is the region where the cacao-tree
and prickly sarsaparilla grow.  Here the underwood is less dense, the sipos retiring to weave
their tracery among the upper branches alone.  Though during the dry season the vegetation
springs up with wonderful rapidity, it is swept away by the next overflow.

Here the lovely orchis tribe adorn the gloomy shades with their brilliant flowers.  Among the
most beautiful is the oncidium, of a yellow hue, often seen--apparently suspended in air between
the stems of two trees--shining in the gloom, as if its petals were of gold.  In reality it
grows at the end of a wire-like stalk a yard and a half long, springing from a cluster of thick
leaves on the bark of a tree; others have white and spotted blossoms, growing sometimes on
rotten logs floating on the water, or on moss and decayed bark just above it.  Still more magnificent
is the Flor de Santa Ana, of a brilliant purple colour, emitting a most delicious odour.

Peculiar and strange is this region of the Gapo.  When the waters are at their height it can
be traversed in all directions.  The trees which grow on it, and the animals which here have
their abodes, appear to differ from those of other districts.

Let us accompany the naturalist Wallace, in his canoe, through a district of this description;
now forcing our way under branches and among dense bushes, till we get into a part where the
trees are loftier and a deep gloom prevails.  Here the lowest branches of the trees are level
with the surface of the water, many of them putting forth flowers. As we proceed we sometimes
come to a grove of small palms, the leaves being now only a few feet above us.  Among them
is the maraja, bearing bunches of agreeable fruit, which, as we pass, the Indians cut off with
their long knives.  Sometimes the rustling of leaves overhead tells us that monkeys are near,
and we soon see them peeping down from among the thick foliage, and then bounding rapidly away.
Presently we come out into the sunshine, on a lake filled with lilies and beautiful water-plants,
little bladder-worts, and the bright blue flowers and curious leaves with swollen stalks of
the pontederias.  Again we are in the gloom of the forest, among the lofty cylindrical trunks
rising like columns out of the deep water; and now there is a splash of fruit falling around
us, announcing that birds are feeding overhead, and we discover a flock of parrakeets, or bright
blue chatterers, or the lovely pompadour, with its delicate white wings and claret-coloured
plumage. Now, with a whir, a trogon on the wing seizes the fruit, or some clumsy toucan makes
the branches shake as he alights above our heads.

This region, as might be supposed, is not destitute of inhabitants. Several tribes of Indians
dwell within it all the year round.  Among them are the Purupurus and Muras tribes, who, spending
most of their time in their canoes, in the dry season build small huts on its sandy shores;
and when the waters overflow it, form rafts, which they secure between the trees, sleeping
in rude huts suspended from the stems over the deep water, and lighting their fires on masses
of mud placed on their floating homes.  They subsist entirely on fish, turtle, and manatee.

Several species of trogons are peculiar to this submerged region.  The curious black umbrella-bird
is entirely confined to it, as is also the little bristle-tailed manakin.  Several monkeys
visit it during the wet season, for the sake of its peculiar fruits; and here the scarlet-faced
urikari has its home.

For miles and miles together the native traverses this region in his canoe, passing through
small streams, lakes, and swamps, scraping the tree trunks, and stooping to pass between the
leaves of the prickly palms, now level with the water--though raised on stems forty feet high--while
everywhere round him stretches out an illimitable waste of waters, but all covered with the
lofty virgin forest.  In this trackless maze, by slight indications of broken twigs or scraped
bark, he finds his way with unerring certainty.

"This curious region," says Wallace, "extends from a little above Santarem to the confines
of Peru, a distance of about 1700 miles; and varies in width on each side of the river from
one to ten or twenty miles."

TRIP UP AN IGARAPE INTO THE INTERIOR.

Let us leave the mighty stream, and wander amidst the picturesque windings of an igarape, into
the depths of the forest, with Professor Agassiz.  Passing into its narrow entrance, the lofty
trees arching overhead shelter the voyager in his light canoe from the glaring heat of the
noonday sun.  The air is cool and refreshing.  Not a ripple stirs the water, save that caused
by the paddles of the Indian crew.  Clumps of the light and exquisitely graceful assai-palm
shoot up everywhere on either side from the denser forest.  Here and there the drooping bamboo
dips its feathery branches into the water, covered sometimes to their very tips with the purple
of convolvuli; yellow bignonias carry their golden clusters to the very summits of some of
the more lofty trees; while white-flowering myrtles and orange-coloured mallows border the
stream.  Life abounds in this quiet retreat.  Birds and butterflies are numerous on the margin
of the water.  Crabs of every variety of colour and size sit on the trunks of decaying logs,
watching for their prey,-- to make their escape, however, with nimble feet, when pursued.

Or let us start before daylight, on a calm morning, along the banks of a larger tributary,
to proceed towards the heights of the Sierra Erere. As dawn begins to redden the sky, large
flocks of ducks and of a small Amazonian goose may be seen flying towards the lake.  Here and
there we see a cormorant, seated alone on the branch of a dead tree; or a kingfisher poises
himself over the water, watching for his prey. Numerous gulls are gathered in large companies
on the trees along the river-shore.  Alligators lie on its surface, diving with a sudden splash
at the approach of the canoe.  Occasionally a porpoise emerges from the water, showing himself
for a moment, and then disappearing.  Sometimes a herd of capybaras, resting on the water's
edge, are startled at our approach.

There sits, on the branch of an imbauba, rolled-up in its peculiar attitude, a sloth, the very
picture of indolence, with its head sunk between its arms.  The banks, covered in many places
with the beautiful capim-grass, afford excellent pasturage for cattle.

Now we turn into an inner stream, or igarape, often having to make our way with difficulty
amid islands of capim-grass.  Now we pass through a magnificent forest of the beautiful fan-palm--the
miriti--overshadowing many smaller trees and innumerable shrubs, bearing light conspicuous
flowers.  Among them are numerous Leguminosae--one of the most striking, the fava, having a
colossal pod.

The whole mass of vegetation is interwoven with innumerable creepers, amid which the flowers
of the bignonia, with their open trumpet-shaped corollas, are conspicuous.  The capim is bright
with the blossoms of the mallow growing in its midst, in some places edged with the broad-leaved
aninga--a large aquatic arum.  Through these forests, where animal life is no less rich and
varied than the vegetation, our canoe glides silently for hours.

The sedgy grasses on either side are full of water birds.  One of the most common is a small
chestnut-brown wading bird--the jacana--whose toes are immensely long in proportion to its
size, enabling it to run over the surface of the aquatic vegetation as if it were solid ground.
It is their breeding season--January.  At every turn of the boat we start them up--usually
in pairs.  Their flat, open nests generally contain five flesh-coloured eggs, streaked in zig-zag
with dark brown lines.  Among the other waders are a snow-white heron, another ash-coloured,
and a large white stork.  The ash-coloured herons are always in pairs--the white always singly,
standing quiet and alone on the edge of the water, or half hidden in the green capim.  The
trees and bushes are full of small warbler-like birds.  The most numerous and interesting is
one which builds a very extraordinary nest, considering the size of the bird.  It is known
among the country people by the name of pedreiro, or the forneiro--both names referring to
the nature of its habitation.  This singular nest is built of clay, and is as hard as stone--pedra;
while it is the shape of the mandioca oven--forno--in which the country people prepare their
farina.  It is about a foot in diameter, and stands edgewise upon the branch or crotch of a
tree. Among the smaller birds are bright tanagers, and a species resembling the canary.  Humming-birds
are scarce, though here and there a few appear; while countless numbers of parrots and parrakeets
fly overhead in dense crowds, at times drowning every other sound with their noisy clatter.

Birds of prey are not wanting.  Among them is the red hawk, about the size of a kite--and so
tame, that even when a canoe passes under the branch on which he is sitting, he does not fly away.

Among the most striking are the gallinaceous birds.  The commonest is the cigana, to be seen
in groups of fifteen or twenty perched on trees overhanging the water, and feeding upon berries.
At night they roost in pairs; but in the daytime are always in larger companies.  In appearance
they have something of the character of both the pheasant and peacock, and yet do not closely
resemble either.  With the exception of some small partridge-like gallinaceous birds, the representatives
of this family in Brazil belong to types which do not exist in any other parts of the world.
Here the curassow, the jacu, the jacami, and the unicorn resemble as much the bustard and other
ostrich-like birds as the hen and pheasant.

The most numerous insects to be met with are dragonflies; some with crimson bodies, black heads,
and burnished wings; others with large, green bodies, crossed by blue bands.

THE CAMPOS.

Although the forests cover generally the whole length and breadth of the Amazonian Valley,
there are here and there, on the higher ground, open dry plains with scanty vegetation,--the
ground in the water-courses or gullies, formed of clay, being baked by the heat of the sun
into slate-like masses.  One of these spots we now reach.  The most prominent plants of this
sandy or clayey region are clusters of cacti and curua palms--a kind of stemless, low palm,
with broad leaves springing, vase-like, from the ground.  Here also grow wild pineapples; and
in broad sunlight numerous humming-birds delight to sport and feed upon the blossoms of the
various plants which find no room to bloom in the darker shades of the forest.

GEOLOGY OF THE AMAZONIAN VALLEY.

Professor Agassiz remarks that no formation--known to geologists-- resembling that of the Amazon
exists on the face of the earth.  Its extent is stupendous.  It stretches from the Atlantic
shore through the whole width of Brazil into Peru, to the very foot of the Andes--one vast
extent of red sandstone, capped by a yellow-ochred clay; not only along the banks of the main
river, but forming the sides of those of its tributaries, to their far-off sources, probably
over the whole basin of the Paraguay and the Rio de la Plata.  How are these vast deposits
formed? is the question.  The easiest answer, he observes, and the one which most readily suggests
itself, is that of a submersion of the continent at successive periods--to allow the accumulation
of these materials--and its subsequent elevation.  This explanation is rejected, for the simple
reason that the deposits show no signs whatever of a marine origin.  No sea-shells, or remains
of any marine animal, have as yet been found throughout their whole extent--over a region several
thousands of miles in length, and from five to seven hundred miles in width.  It is evident,
he considers, that this basin was a fresh-water basin, these deposits fresh-water deposits.
It is true that calcareous layers thickly studded with shells have been found interspersed
with the clay; but though supposed to be marine fossils, he recognised them for what they really
are--fresh-water shells of the family of the Naiades. As their resemblance is very remarkable,
the mistake as to their true zoological character is natural: indeed, many travellers have
confounded some fresh-water fishes from the Upper Amazon of the genus of Pterophyllum with
the marine genus Platax.  He considers that the immense glacier which probably existed at the
same time that ice, thousands of feet thick, covered the centre of Europe, must have been formed
in this valley, and then, ploughing its bottom over and over again, and grinding all the materials
beneath it into a fine powder, must ultimately have forced its way through the colossal sea-wall
which it had built up eastward into the Atlantic.

A DAY AND NIGHT ON THE AMAZON, WITH THEIR SIGHTS AND SOUNDS.

Day is beginning to dawn, the birds are astir, the cicada have begun their music; flocks of
parrots and macaws, and other winged inhabitants of the forest, pass by in numbers, seeking
their morning repast; beautiful long-tailed and gilded moths like butterflies fly over the
tree-tops.  Rapid is the change from the dark night.  The sky in the east assumes suddenly
the loveliest azure colour, across which streaks of thin white clouds are painted.  The varied
forms of the numberless trees, imperceptible during the gloom of night, now appear, the smaller
foliage contrasting with the large glossy leaves of the taller trees, or the feathery, fan-shaped
fronds of palms.  For a time the fresh breeze blows, but flags under the increasing power of
the sun, and finally dies away, the heat and electric tension of the atmosphere becoming almost
insupportable.

The heat increases as the day draws on.  Languor and uneasiness seize on every one;--even the
denizens of the forest betray it by their motions. By this time every voice of bird or mammal
is hushed.  Only in the trees is heard at intervals the whir of the cicada.  The leaves, so
soft and fresh in the early morn, now become lax and drooping.  The flowers shut their petals.
The natives, returning to their huts, fall asleep in their hammocks, or, seated on mats in
the shade appear too languid even to talk.  White clouds now appear in the east, and gather
into cumuli, with an increasing blackness along their lower portions.  The whole eastern horizon
becomes rapidly black, the dark hue spreading upwards. Even the sun is at length obscured.
Then the rush of a mighty wind is heard through the forest swaying the tree-tops.  A vivid
flash of lightning bursts forth, then a crash of thunder, and down streams the deluging rain.
The storm soon ceases, leaving the bluish-black motionless clouds in the sky till night.  Meantime
all nature is refreshed, but heaps of flower petals and leaves are seen under the trees.

Towards evening life revives again.  The noises of the forest animals begin just as the sun
sinks behind the trees, leaving the sky above of the intensest shade of blue.  The briefest
possible twilight commences, and the sounds of multifarious life come from every quarter. 
Troops of howling monkeys, from their lofty habitations among the topmost branches--some near,
some at a distance--fill the echoing forest with their dismal noise; flocks of parrots and
blue macaws pass overhead, the different kinds of cawing and screaming of the various species
making a terrible discord.  Added to them are the calls of strange cicada--one large kind perched
high on the trees setting up a most piercing chirp. It begins with the usual harsh jarring
tone of its tribe, rapidly becoming shriller, until it ends in a long and loud note resembling
the steam whistle of a locomotive engine.  A few of these wonderful performers make a considerable
item in the evening concert.  The uproar of beasts, birds, and insects lasts but a short time;
the sky quickly loses its intense hue, and the night sets in.  Then begin the tree-frogs--Quack,
quack!  Drum, drum!  Hoo, hoo!  These, accompanied by melancholy night-jars, keep up their
monotonous cries till late at night.

The night, however, is not given over to darkness.  In every forest path, across the calm waters
of the igarapes, along open spaces, in the village as well as in spots remote from man's abode,
the whole air is full of bright and glittering lights of varied hue; now darting here, now
there, like meteors flashing through the sky--now for a moment obscured, to burst forth again
with greater brilliancy.  Beautiful as is the English glow-worm, the fire-flies and fire-beetles,
the elaters of the tropics, far surpass them in brilliancy.  Their light is redder and more
candle-like, and being alternately emitted and concealed, each of the tiny vermilion flames
performing its part in the aerial mazy dance, the spectacle is singularly beautiful.  In the
marshy districts is seen the large elater, which displays both red and green lights; the red
glare, like that of a lamp, alternately flashing on the beholder, then concealed as the insect
turns his body in flight, but the ruddy reflection on the grass beneath being constantly visible
as it leisurely pursues its course.  Now and then a green light is displayed, and then the
mingling of the two complementary colours, red and green, in the evolutions of flight, surpasses
description.  Even the brilliant elaters, however, will scarcely enable the traveller to find
his way amid the darkness through the forest.

Wallace describes a midnight walk he was compelled to take.  He was barefooted, every moment
stepping on some projecting root or stone, or treading sideways on something which almost dislocated
his ankles.  Dull clouds could just be distinguished in the openings amid high-arched, overhanging
trees, but the pathway was invisible.  Jaguars, he knew, abounded, deadly serpents were plentiful,
and at every step he almost expected to feel a cold gliding body under his feet, or deadly
fangs in his leg.  Gazing through the darkness, he dreaded momentarily to encounter the glaring
eyes of the jaguar, or to hear his low growl in the thicket.  To turn back or stop were alike
useless.  Unpleasant recollections of the fangs of a huge dried snake's head he had just before
examined, would come across his memory; and many a tale of the fierceness and cunning of the
jaguar would not be forgotten.  Suddenly he found his feet in water, and then he had to grope
for a narrow bridge it was necessary to cross.  Of its height above the water, or the depth
of the stream, he was utterly ignorant.  To walk along a plank four inches wide, under such
circumstances, was a nervous matter.  He proceeded, however, placing one foot before the other,
and balancing steadily his body, till he again felt himself on firm ground.  Once or twice
he lost his balance, but happily he was only a foot or two from the ground and water below--though,
had it been twenty it would have been all the same.  Half-a-dozen such brooks and bridges had
to be passed, till at length, emerging from the pitchy shade upon an open space, he saw two
twinkling lights, which told him that the village was ahead.

But we were describing a tropical day.  Night is over.  The sun rising again in the cloudless
sky, the cycle is completed--spring, summer, and autumn, as it were, in one tropical day. 
The days are more or less like this throughout the year.  A little difference exists, between
the dry and wet seasons.  The periodical phenomena of plants and animals do not take place
at about the same time in all the species, or in the individuals of any given species, as they
do in temperate countries. The dry season here is not excessive, nor is there any estivation,
as in some tropical countries.  In these forests the aspect is the same or nearly so every
day in the year--budding, flowering, fruiting, and leaf-shedding, are always going on in one
species or other.  The activity of birds and insects proceeds without interruption, each species
having its own breeding-times.  The colonies of wasps, for instance, do not die off annually,
leaving only the queens, as in cold climates, but the succession of generations and colonies
goes on incessantly.  It is never either spring, summer, or autumn, but each day is a combination
of the three.  With the day and night always of equal length, the atmospheric disturbances
of each day neutralise themselves before each succeeding morning.  With the sun in its course
proceeding midway across the sky, and the daily temperature the same within two or three degrees
throughout the year, how grand in its perfect equilibrium and simplicity is the march of nature
under the equator!

"Oppressive, almost fearful, is the silence and gloom of the Brazilian forest," says Bates.
"The few sounds of birds are of that pensive or mysterious character which intensifies the
feeling of solitude, rather than imparts a sense of life and cheerfulness.  Sometimes, in the
midst of the stillness, a sudden yell or scream will startle one.  This comes from some defenceless
fruit-eating animal, which is pounced upon by a tiger-cat or stealthy boa-constrictor.  Morning
and evening howling monkeys make a most fearful and harrowing noise, under which it is difficult
to keep up one's buoyancy of spirit.  The feeling of inhospitable wildness which the forest
is calculated to inspire, is increased tenfold under this fearful uproar.  Often, even in the
still hours of mid-day, there is a sudden crash, resounding afar through the wilderness, as
some great bough or entire tree falls to the ground. Sometimes a sound is heard like the clang
of an iron bar against a hard hollow tree, or a piercing cry rends the air.  These are not
repeated, and the succeeding silence tends to heighten the unpleasant impression which they
make on the mind.  The natives believe it is the curupira-- the wild man of the forest--who
produces all the noises they are unable to explain.  He is a mysterious being,--sometimes described
as a kind of orang-outang, covered with long shaggy hair, and living in trees; at others, he
is said to have cloven feet and a bright red face.  He has a wife and children, who, as well
as himself, come down to the plantations to steal the mandioca."

Such is a faint outline of some of the more prominent features of the great Amazonian Valley--the
most interesting portion of the southern half of the New World.  No verbal descriptions can
do justice to the reality--although drawn, as some of the above are, by master hands.  We will
next range along the mighty Cordilleras to the ancient kingdom of the Incas, looking down on
the Pacific shores; and then, again descending from the mountain heights, take a brief glance
at the debased human beings who people the valley, and pass in review the more interesting
of the countless wild creatures which inhabit its forests and waters.  Afterwards we will traverse
Venezuela, Guiana, the rest of the Brazils, and the wide-spreading level regions to the south
of that vast country, the river-bound province of Paraguay, the territories of the Argentine
Republic, the wild district of the Gran Chaco, the far-famed Pampas, and the plains of Patagonia.

PART THREE, CHAPTER FIVE.

THE CORDILLERAS.

The voyager sailing from the Atlantic into the Pacific Ocean passes a dark granite headland
rising nearly three thousand feet out of the water, and which may be distinctly seen at a distance
of sixty miles. It is Cape Horn--the southern end, broken off by the Strait of Magellan, of
that range of mighty mountains which runs in a northerly course along the western coast of
South America, rising into lofty pinnacles--the summits of many covered with perpetual snow--sinking
at length only at the northern extremity, where the narrow Isthmus of Panama unites the two
continents.  Again it gradually rises in Mexico, and runs on under the name of the Rocky Mountains,
at a less elevation and a greater distance from the sea, till it sinks once more into the snow-covered
plains of the Arctic region.  We must, however, confine ourselves to the South American portion
of the range.  For the entire distance its summits are distinctly seen from the ocean, many
at a distance of upwards of a hundred miles.  Between their base and the shores of the Pacific
there is, however, a level tract, in some parts consisting of arid plains, from fifteen to
fifty miles in width.  In crossing them the traveller finds not a drop of water to quench his
raging thirst, nor a blade of grass to feed his weary steed.  Among the rocky caverns of those
mountain heights the savage bear has its abode, the mighty condor takes its flight from their
rugged peaks into the blue ether, and the cold-looking llama, the vicuna, and alpaca find ample
pasturage.  In the lower, the fierce jaguar ranges amidst its forests of graceful palm-trees,
the terrible alligator dwells on the banks of its streams, and the anaconda watches for its
prey; while bananas, yams, mandioc, and all the fruits of a tropical clime, attain perfection.
This mighty range, however, does not run its length in one distinct line, but separates; in
some parts with deep valleys between them, like that of the Puncu of Avisca, while at others
there are vast table-lands; again, however, to unite and spread out into numerous rugged sierras.

The western portion of these ranges is properly the Cordilleras; while the eastern, which slopes
towards the wide-extending plains of Brazil, forms the true Andes.  The southern portion skirts
the bleak shores of Patagonia in a single sierra, for a distance of nearly one thousand miles,
in some parts rising to the height of seven thousand feet above the ocean.  Entering Chili,
the mountains rise higher and higher, till they culminate in the mighty peak of Aconcagua,
the most lofty height of the whole range.

At the boundary-line of Bolivia the chain separates into two portions, enclosing the great
table-land of Desuguadero, thirteen thousand feet above the sea.  At one end of this lofty
region is the city of Potosi, rising above the clouds--the highest in the world, erected amid
the groans and tears of the hapless natives compelled to labour at its far-famed silver-mines.
At the other is found Cuzco, the ancient capital of the Incas.  Between them lies the Lake
of Titicaca, the centre of bygone Peruvian civilisation.

Running still parallel with the coast, and looking down upon the modern city of Lima, the range
passes through Peru till it again divides in three portions at the confines of the equator,
where it once more forms two lines, which rise in that magnificent congregation of mountains
which surround the famous Valley of Quito.  Here no less than twenty-one volcanoes rear their
lofty summits, many of them crowned with perpetual snow, amid which Chimborazo and Cotopaxi
are pre-eminent.

To the north of the equator, the Cordilleras again form one vast ridge, and passing through
New Granada, spread out like the branches of a palm through Venezuela and along the northern
shores of the continent washed by the Caribbean Sea.

The whole of this vast range, from Cape Horn to Panama, gives evidence of the hidden fires
which glow beneath its base, and by which it was originally created.  Fifty-one volcanoes are
found along the line.  Of the twenty which surround the Valley of Quito, three are active,
five dormant, and twelve are supposed to be extinct.  By far the larger number rise out of
the eastern range; indeed, the western contains only one active volcano, but out of it tower
the peerless Chimborazo, and Pichincha with its deep crater.  The whole region is subject to
terrific earthquakes, which have from time to time shaken down its cities, caused huge waves
to flow over the level land, and destroyed countless thousands of its inhabitants.  Chimborazo
was long supposed to be the most lofty mountain on the globe.  It is 21,420 feet high; but
Aconcagua in Chili rises to the height of 23,200 feet.  Several of the summits of the Himalayan
range in Asia are over 25,000 feet; and Kilima Njaro, the most lofty peak in Africa, is about
the same altitude as Chimborazo. Chimborazo, for solitary grandeur--and from the excessive
steepness of its sides, which has prevented the foot of man from reaching its summit--stands,
however, unrivalled.

From the lofty heights over which we have thus rapidly passed, numberless streams take their
rise, rushing and foaming down their steep sides to feed those mighty rivers which, flowing
across the continent, seek an outlet in the far-distant Atlantic.  On the western side, comparatively
few and insignificant rivers cross the narrow plains into the Pacific.  Thus the inhabitants
of the tropical portions have to depend on artificial irrigation for the cultivation of the land.

What mighty force must have been required to raise those mountains to their present elevation,--and
how fearful must be the fires which still rage beneath their bases!  Gigantic, however, as
they seem to human eyes, the most lofty could be represented on a globe six feet in diameter
by a grain of sand, less than one-twentieth of an inch in thickness.  How insignificant then
must the proudest works of man appear--what a mere speck himself--to One who looks down from
on high on this earth of ours!

On examining their sides in various parts, proof is afforded that these vast mountains have
been heaved upwards from beneath the ocean.  Shells are found 1300 feet above the sea, covered
with marine mud.  On a beach elevated 2500 feet above the Pacific, numerous species of patella
and other shells can be picked up, identical with those obtained on the coast with the living
animal inhabiting them.  At Huanuco, in Peru, there is a coal-bed existing at the height of
14,700 feet.  Shells have also been found at the height of 13,000 feet; and on the side of
Chimborazo there is a salt spring 13,000 feet above the ocean.

The surface of the great lake of Titicaca--the largest piece of fresh-water in South America--is
12,795 feet above the Pacific; an elevation greater than that of the highest peaks of the Pyrenees.
In the neighbourhood of this lake, remains exist which speak of the advanced state of civilisation
of the inhabitants before the appearance of the Incas, with whose latter history alone we are
acquainted.  So completely is the lake surrounded by mountains, that, though fed by numerous
streams, not the smallest rivulet escapes to find its way either into the Pacific or Atlantic.
One large river, however, the Desaguadero, flows out of its south-west corner, and disappears
in the swampy Lake Aullagas in the south of Bolivia.  Its superabundant water must, therefore,
be taken off by evaporation, excessive in that elevated region.  High above it, amid chilling
mists and biting storms of driving snow, are found the silver-mines of Potosi and Pasco.

However, before we wander further amid the giddy precipices and snow-capped summits of this
mighty range of mountains, we will descend for a time to the lower world, and glance round
its southern extremity and along its western shores, bathed by the waters of the wide-stretching
Pacific.

PART THREE, CHAPTER SIX.

SOUTHERN AND WESTERN SHORES OF THE CONTINENT.

Tierra Del Fuego appears as if a mountain region had been partly submerged in the ocean, so
that deep inlets and bays occupy the place where valleys would have existed had its base still
been above the sea. The greater portion of the mountainsides are covered, from the water's
edge upwards to the elevation of 1500 feet, by one wide-extending forest of evergreen beeches.
Scarcely a level spot is to be found throughout the whole country; and so dense is the wood,
and encumbered by the trunks of fallen trees and waterfalls, that it is scarcely possible to
penetrate it.  Here and there on the western side, and in the Strait of Magellan, the forest
disappears, and magnificent glaciers extend down to the very water's edge.

The inhabitants of this region are among the lowest in the scale of human beings, living in
wretched hovels, composed often merely of boughs and leaves, their only clothing scanty pieces
of skin, worn on one side, to defend themselves from the icy winds.

These evergreen forests, consisting of only two or three species of trees, with several Alpine
plants growing on the heights above them, continue round the coast for six hundred miles or
more northward of Cape Horn, till, in the more northern and warmer latitudes, they give place
to semi-tropical vegetation.

In many places the ocean washes the base of the Andes, or huge spurs project from the mountains;
and in others a narrow belt alone is left between them and the water.  The whole of Chili,
indeed, consists of a narrow strip of land between the Cordilleras and the Pacific; while this
strip is often traversed by several mountain lines, which in some parts run parallel to the
great range.  Extending to the south, between these outer lines and the main Cordilleras, we
find a succession of level basins, generally blending into each other by narrow passages.

In the neighbourhood of Valparaiso, above which Aconcagua (23,000 feet in height) looks down
on the Pampas on one side and the blue Pacific on the other, is the beautiful valley of Guillota,
thoroughly irrigated and brought under cultivation.  It has, during the whole summer, the hot
sun striking down from a cloudless sky.  It is only in these parts where the nature of the
streams affords means of irrigation that vegetation can exist.

Further north, the western shore is in many parts very arid; and about latitude 20 degrees
south the burning desert commences, extending 540 leagues--almost to the Gulf of Guayaquil--and
varying in width from three to twenty leagues.  Over this region of death, heaps of stone or
mounds of sand are alone seen, except where, at wide intervals, some mountain stream, fed by
the melting snows of the lofty peaks, finds its way into the ocean.  It is only in the neighbourhood
of these rivers that man can venture to take up his abode.  On the banks of most of them have
been built the few cities which exist near the sea in Peru.  For some miles the traveller finds
not a drop of water, no trace of vegetation.  His weary horse sinks, overcome with the pangs
of thirst and the fatigue of dragging its limbs through the soft sand.  Through this region
the mule can alone be trusted, as, like the camel of the Eastern desert, it will longer endure
fatigue and want of water.  Here, as in the deserts of Africa, violent winds stir up the sand,
forming vast columns, as terrible in their effects as the flames of the prairie. Rising to
a hundred feet in height, they are seen approaching, whirling through the air, till the unhappy
traveller finds himself surrounded by an overwhelming mass, and, unable to breathe, sinks exhausted
on the ground.  Flight alone can save him.  Many have here perished.  On several occasions,
troops attempting to cross the desert have been overwhelmed.  Others have lost their way when
traversing the sandy plains, and have wandered about, in vain seeking for water to quench their
burning thirst.  On one side is the salt ocean, on the other the rocky precipices of the mountains.
Wandering on for hours and hours, at length, exhausted, they have abandoned themselves to despair.
These sand-storms occur more especially during the heats of summer, so completely altering
the appearance of the country, by covering it with large hillocks, that the most experienced
guides find it at times impossible to discover their way; and perhaps, when searching for it,
another storm arises, and once more spreads the mounds over the level plain.

In some places the whole soil is covered with a thick crust of salt, white and hard, giving
the country the appearance of being covered with snow.  For months and months together, in
many parts not a drop of rain falls.  At length a shower descends, and, as if by magic, the
grass springs up in spots where not a blade was before visible; and for a short time the whole
country puts on a green mantle, soon, however, to be withered up by the burning heat.

Northward of this desert region, the land on the shores of the Gulf of Guayaquil and its neighbourhood
is covered with the richest vegetation, supported by the numerous streams which descend from
the Andes of Quito and Columbia.

PART THREE, CHAPTER SEVEN.

THE INDIANS OF THE CORDILLERAS.

Leaving the burning sand-coast, we will ascend once more the steep sides of the Cordilleras
to those fertile tracts found at an elevation of many thousand feet above the ocean; but, before
describing the brute creation and the vegetable products of this interesting region, we should
properly take a glance at the human beings inhabiting it.

When, in 1524, the Spaniards first reached the western coast of South America, of which they
were soon to become the conquerors, they found a people greatly advanced in civilisation. 
They consisted of two distinct races; the one, known as the Incas, showing a decided superiority
in intellectual power over the other.  Whence they came is unknown; but a tradition existed,
that two persons--husband and wife--had appeared some four hundred years before that period
in the neighbourhood of Lake Titicaca, announcing themselves as the Children of the Sun.  The
husband, Manco Capac, taught the men the arts of agriculture; and his wife, Mama Oello (mama,
meaning mother), initiating her own sex in the mysteries of weaving and spinning.  The wise
policy which regulated the conduct of the first Incas (kings, or lords), was followed by their
successors, and under their mild sceptre a community gradually extended itself along the surface
of the broad table-land, which asserted its superiority over the surrounding tribes.

Fine cities sprang up in different parts of their kingdom, connected by well-formed roads,
suited to the nature of the country.  Their capital was Cuzco, at some distance to the north
of the lake, in latitude 14 degrees south; while the city next in importance to it was Quito,
in a rich valley, beneath the equator.  These cities were connected by two roads; one passing
over the grand plateau, and the other along lowlands at the borders of the ocean.  The first
was conducted over mountain-ridges, frequently buried in snow; galleries were cut through the
living rock; rivers crossed by suspension-bridges; precipices scaled by stairways; and deep
ravines were filled up with solid masonry.

This road was upwards of fifteen hundred miles long; and stone pillars, to serve the purpose
of mile-stones, were erected at intervals of about a league along the route.  Its breadth was
about twenty feet.  In some places it was covered with heavy flagstones; and in others, with
a bituminous cement, which time has rendered harder than the stone itself. Where the ravines
had been filled with solid masonry, the mountain torrents have eaten a way beneath it, leaving
the superincumbent mass still spanning the valley like an arch.  The suspension-bridges--instead
of which wretchedly inferior ones of wood are now used--were composed of the tough fibres of
the maguey; a species of osier, possessing an extraordinary degree of tenacity and strength.
The fibres were woven into cables of the thickness of a man's body, which were then stretched
across the water, and conducted through rings or holes cut in immense buttresses of stone raised
on the opposite banks of the river, and there secured to heavy pieces of timber.  Several of
these enormous cables bound together, side by side, formed a bridge--which, covered with planks
well secured, and defended on each side by a railing of the same material, afforded a safe
passage for the traveller.  The length of this aerial bridge, sometimes exceeding 200 feet,
caused it--confined as it was only at the extremities--to dip, with an alarming inclination
towards the centre; while the motion given it by the passenger created an oscillation frightful
to one whose eye glanced down into the dark abyss of waters, that foamed and tumbled many a
fathom beneath.

Over these roads a system of communication throughout the country was kept up by running postmen,
called chasquis.  Along the roads small buildings were erected, within five miles of each other,
at which a number of chasquis were stationed.  They were trained to the employment, and selected
for their speed and fidelity.  As the distance each had to perform was small, he ran over the
ground with great swiftness, and messages were carried along all the routes at the rate of
a hundred and fifty miles a day.  The chasquis not only carried despatches, but brought fish
from the distant ocean, and fruits, game, and other commodities, from the warm regions on the
coast.

It is not our province to describe the gorgeous temples, palaces, and convents, in which the
Virgins of the Sun resided, and the numerous other public buildings, extensive remains of which
still exist scattered throughout the region.  The glory of the Incas has departed.  But few
of their descendants remain, and their blood has generally mingled with that of their conquerors.

THE NATIVE INDIANS.

The tribes over whom they ruled are still to be found, though in diminished numbers, and debased
by the cruel system of oppression under which they long groaned.  The native inhabitants of
the central region of the Andes are known as the Quichuas, and their chief characteristics
are common to the greater number of the tribes along the whole extent of the range.  Though
the languages of the different tribes vary, they are probably derived from the same source.
The head of the Quichua is an oblong longitudinal, somewhat compressed at the sides.  He has
a low and very slightly arched forehead; a prominent, long, aquiline nose, with large nostrils.
The mouth is large, and the teeth very fine, while the lips are not thick; the chin is short,
but not receding; cheek-bones not prominent, eyes horizontal and never large, eyebrows long,
the hair jet-black--and, though thick, straight and coarse, yet soft.  He has little or no
beard.  In stature they seldom reach five feet.  The chest is long, broad, deep, and highly
arched.  The hands and feet are small. The colour is between olive, brown, and bronze,--somewhat
like that of the mulatto.  Though their chests are broad, and their shoulders square, their
arms are weak--their chief strength existing in their backs and legs.  Mild, generous, and
submissive, they have existed when a fiercer race would have been exterminated; but, on several
occasions, they have shown that they can be goaded into revolt.  About the year 1770, under
Tupac Amaru, they broke into rebellion, when, had they possessed better arms and more discipline,
they might, with the courage they exhibited, have driven the Spaniards from the country.  The
rebellion was put down with the atrocious cruelties to which the Spaniards have invariably
subjected this unhappy race.

On the eastern slopes of the Andes are found savage tribes, wearing few or no clothes, painting
their skins, and ornamenting themselves with the coloured feathers of birds.  Towards the southern
end of Chili, the fierce Araucanians inhabit the mountains.  Beyond them are the large-limbed
Patagonians, clothed in skins; and at the extreme end, the wretched Fuegans, living in nearly
a state of nature, on seals and fish.

The race supposed to have been the most civilised before the time of the Incas were the Aymaras,
whose descendants still inhabit the shores of Lake Titicaca.  Their language differs from the
Quichua, though evidently a sister-tongue.

This expanse of water, already mentioned, is about eighty miles long and forty broad.  Numerous
rivers flow into it; in some places it is very deep, but in others so shallow that there is
only just room to force the balsas through the rushes.  It abounds in fish of peculiar form,
and in aquatic birds.  Several islands rise above its surface.  That of Titicaca, from which
it takes its name, is most celebrated.

During one of the several occasions when the Indians rose against their taskmasters to free
themselves from the mita--a system which compelled one-seventh part of the male population
to labour in the mines--the lake, for a long time, afforded them a place of refuge.  In some
places along the shores, beds of rushes exist nine leagues long and one broad. In the midst
of them there is an island, to which lanes were cut through the tangled mass.  This watery
labyrinth was navigated by the Indians in their balsas; and, secure in their retreat, they
contrived to make inroads on the Spanish towns in the neighbourhood for a length of time. (These
balsas are composed of reeds, tightly fastened together on the sides, in the form of boats,
and are propelled both by sails and paddles.)  Several of the Indian chiefs were at length
captured and executed.  This, however, only exasperated the rebels, who, under an enterprising
leader, attacked the bridge over the Desaguadero, and carried off the heads of their chiefs,
which had been stuck on poles above it.  The Spanish troops sent against them waded to some
islets, but the Indians, hovering round them in their balsas, prevented them from advancing
further.  At length the Spaniards embarked in twenty balsas, and came in sight of the native
squadron.  The Indians, however, going in and out among the lanes and rushes, baffled their
oppressors, cutting off several Spanish balsas.  A party of cavalry also, advancing into the
swampy ground, was suddenly surrounded and cut to pieces, with a loss to the Indians of only
three men.

These outbreaks, and the far more important rebellion under Tupac Amaru, show that Spanish
tyranny had not entirely succeeded in crushing the spirit of the Indians.  During the civil
wars which for so long devastated the Spanish provinces of South America, the Indians fought
with a courage fully equal to that of the whites.

THE PUNA.

An elevated region called by the Quichuas the Puna, or "the uninhabited," must be described.
A scanty vegetation covers these vast plains.  Man can with difficulty breathe on them, or
produce the means of existence.  Barley, though cultivated, seldom ripens; the chief plant
which grows to maturity being the maca, which has tuberous roots, and is used like the potato.
In consequence of the diminished pressure of the air, water begins to boil at so low a temperature
that neither meat, potatoes, nor eggs, can be sufficiently cooked.  From the same cause, those
unaccustomed to the rarefied air are afflicted with an attack called the vela--consisting of
headache, nausea, and producing even spitting of blood, and other disorders of the mucous membrane.
Horses suffer in the same way; and cats are so affected that they die in violent convulsions.
There is another complaint, called the chanu, affecting the skin of the hands and face, as
well as the eyelids; when, the skin breaking, blood flows from every opening.  The surumpe,
by which travellers are affected--the inflammation of the eyes caused by the reflection from
the snow--is still more painful.  Often the agony which even an Indian suffers from it is so
great, that he has been known to sit down and utter cries of anguish; while, occasionally,
total blindness has been the ultimate consequence.

But it is time that we should turn to the brute creation existing in these regions, noticing
the interesting specimens of the vegetable kingdom as we proceed in our survey.  As the camel
is the characteristic animal of the sandy deserts of Arabia and Africa, the royal tiger of
the jungles of Bengal, and the kangaroo of the wide-extending plains of Australia, so the llama
brings to our recollection the lofty plateaus of the Andes, and the mighty condor its still
higher peaks.

PART THREE, CHAPTER EIGHT.

THE WILD ANIMALS OF THE CORDILLERAS.

THE LLAMA.

It is on the above-mentioned bleak table-land that the llama, with its kindred--the alpaca,
vicuna, and huanucu--are found.  The historian of the conquest calls them the sheep of Peru,
but the llama is more allied in its characteristics to the camel of the desert.  In outward
form, except that it has no hump on its back; in the structure and cellular apparatus of the
stomach, which enable it to abstain for a long time from water; in the expression of its large
full eye; in the mobility and division of the upper lip; in its fissured nostrils; in the nature
of its teeth; and in its long woolly clothing and slender neck,--the llama has a strong resemblance
to the camel of the deserts of Arabia.  While the camel's feet, however, are formed for passing
over the burning sands or level ground, and are therefore broad and cushioned, those of the
llama, to enable it to climb the rugged crags of the Cordilleras, are slender, elastic, and
claw-tipped.  The llama has indeed been rightly called the camel of the mountains, and was
employed by the ancient Peruvians--as it is at present--as a beast of burden.  The load laid
upon its back rests securely upon a bed of wool, without the aid of girth or saddle.  It cannot
carry more than from eighty to one hundred pounds.  If overladen it will lie down, and nothing
will induce it to rise till it has been relieved of its burden.

The llamas move in troops of five hundred or even one thousand, and thus, though each individual
carries but a little, the aggregate is considerable.  The whole caravan travels at a regular
pace--passing the night in the open air without suffering from the cold--marching in perfect
order, and in obedience to the conductor.  Thus they proceed over rugged passes from twelve
to fifteen miles a day.  They were especially employed in bearing the produce of the mines
of Potosi to the coast, often in places where the hoof of the mule could find no support. It
was estimated, after the conquest, that 300,000 were thus employed. As they never feed after
sunset, it is necessary, when journeying, to allow them to graze for several hours during the
day.  They utter a peculiar low sound, which at a distance resembles, when the herd is large,
the tone of numerous Aeolian harps.  On seeing any strange object which excites their fears,
they immediately scatter in every direction, and are with difficulty reunited.  The Indians
treat them kindly, ornamenting their ears with ribbons, and hanging little bells about their
necks.  When any of them, over-fatigued, fall to the ground, their conductors endeavour by
every gentle means to induce them to proceed. In spite, however, of the kind treatment they
receive, numbers, from the heat of the coast region, which they cannot stand, annually perish.

When offended, the llama shows its anger by turning its head at its driver, and discharging
a saliva with a bad odour in his face.  It is about the size of the stag.  It carries its long
neck upright, constantly moving its long ears.  The animals vary in colour.  Some are of a
light brown, the under part being whitish; others dappled; but they are seldom found quite
white or black.  In consequence of the introduction of the mule and horse into the country,
which have superseded them in many places as beasts of burden, their price seldom exceeds three
or four dollars.  The flesh of the llama is eaten; and as many as 4,000,000 were, in days gone
by, annually killed for food.

THE ALPACA.

The alpaca is smaller than the llama, and somewhat resembles the sheep. It has a long, soft,
fine fleece of a silky lustre.  In the domestic breeds the wool falls in large flakes reaching
down to the knees.  This wool was employed by the ancient Peruvians for weaving a kind of cloth.
It approximates in character to silk, and a large quantity is now exported to Europe for the
manufacture of shawls and other delicate fabrics.  Immense herds of the llama or alpaca were
held by the Peruvian government, and placed under the protection of herdsmen, who conducted
them from one quarter of the country to another, according to the season.  They were exclusively
the property of the Incas; as were the vicunas, which roam in native freedom over the frozen
ranges of the Cordilleras.

THE HUANUCU.

The huanucu is considerably larger than the llama, which it so much resembles, that it was
formerly considered to be the same animal in a wild state.  The body is brown, with the under
parts white; the face is of a blackish-grey, approaching to white about the lips.  The fleece
is shorter and not so fine as that of the llama.  The huanucus are very shy, and only when
caught young can they be tamed--and even then they can rarely be induced to carry burdens.
They generally live in small troops of from five to seven.  Not unfrequently they may be seen
scaling the snow-covered peaks to a height which no other living thing save the condor can
reach.  They find sustenance in the ychu, a species of grass which grows all along the great
ridge of the Cordilleras, from the equator to the southern limits of Patagonia.

THE VICUNA.

The vicunas are very beautiful and graceful creatures, with the habits of antelopes.  They
have long, slender necks, and rich fawn-coloured coats, with patches of white across the shoulders
and inside the legs. The wool is shorter and more curly than that of the three other species,
and, from its extreme fineness, is of much greater value.

During the dry season, when the grass of the plains has withered, they descend to the swampy
ground below.  One male is followed by a dozen or more females, over whom he watches with the
most faithful care.  Should he apprehend danger, he utters a loud, shrill cry of alarm, and
rapidly advances.  The herd then collecting, moves forward slowly; but immediately they discover
the approach of an enemy they wheel round and fly--at first at a slow pace, frequently looking
round, and then away they dart, fleet as the wind, the male covering their retreat.  Should
their protector be wounded, the females return and keep circling round him, uttering piercing
notes of sorrow, and remain to be shot rather than desert their companion.

Although it is only when enraged that the llamas and huanucus spit upon those near them, the
vicunas and alpacas invariably eject saliva and undigested food--which has a peculiarly disagreeable
smell--upon all who approach them.

Vicunas in vast numbers are found ranging over the more remote and lofty regions of the Puna,
where they are able to find a safe retreat from the attacks of man.  They have, however, a
very formidable enemy in the ravenous condor, who frequently robs them of their young.

These two wild species the Peruvian peasants were never allowed to hunt, they being as much
the property of the government as if enclosed within a park.  Only on stated occasions, once
a year, great hunts took place under the superintendence of the Inca, or his principal officers.
They were never repeated in the same quarter oftener than once in four years, that time might
be allowed for the waste occasioned by them to be replenished.  At the time appointed the whole
surrounding population-- sometimes, it is said, amounting to nearly ten thousand men--formed
a circle round the area which was to be hunted over.  Armed with spears, they gradually closed
in, destroying the beasts of prey, and driving the huanucus, vicunas, and deer towards the
centre, where the male deer and the huanucus were slaughtered.  Their skins were reserved for
various useful manufactures; and their flesh, cut into thin slices, was distributed among the
people, who converted it into chasqui, or dried meat (constituting then, as it does now, the
principal animal food of the lower classes of Peru).

The vicunas are hunted at the present day.  A member from each family of the Puna villages
joins the hunting party, forming altogether a band of about one hundred persons.  They carry
poles with cordage.  The poles are placed in the ground, and united by ropes at about the height
of two feet, forming a circle of half a league in circumference, enclosing a space called the
chasqu.  Coloured pieces of rag are attached to the ropes, which are moved about by the wind.
Some of the hunters are on horseback, others on foot.  Each man is armed with the well-known
bolas; which consists of three balls of lead, two of which are heavy and one lighter, attached
to a long leathern thong knotted together at one extremity.  The hunter takes the lighter ball
in his hand, and swings the other two in a wide circle over his head.  When at a distance of
fifteen or twenty paces from the animal, the lighter is let loose, when the three fly in circles
towards it, encompassing it in their snake-like folds.  Thus prepared, the hunters disperse,
forming a circle several miles in circumference, driving all the vicunas before them towards
the entrance of the circle.  As soon as the animals have entered, it is closed.  The vicunas,
afraid to spring over the ropes with the coloured rags fluttering in their faces, are attacked
by the hunters with their bolas, the hind-legs being generally aimed at.  The huanucus, which
are much wilder, invariably leap the barriers and escape, when frequently the vicunas follow
their example.  As soon as the animals within the chasqu are killed, it is carried off and
again erected at a distance of twelve or more miles, when the same operation is gone through.
Thus from one hundred to three hundred animals are killed during the chase, which generally
lasts for a week.

Notwithstanding the opposition from the Peruvian government, a large herd of alpacas were,
some years ago, successfully carried to the coast and shipped off to Australia, where, in a
high and dry district, they appear to be flourishing.

THE CONDOR.

The traveller standing on the rocky heights of the Cordilleras, at an elevation which Etna
does not surpass, though still with many a snow-capped mountain round him, may see, on one
of the dizzy pinnacles amid which he stands, a vast bird.  It is the condor, the largest of
the vulture tribe; the monarch of the birds of that region.  He may know it by the glossy black
colour, tinged with grey, of its body; the greater wing-coverts, except at the base and tips,
and the quill-feathers being mostly white.  Round the neck is a white ruff of down; the skin
of the head and neck is excessively wrinkled, and is of a dull reddish colour with a tinge
of purple.  Surmounting the forehead is a large, firm comb, with a loose skin under the bill
which can be dilated at pleasure.  Now it expands its wings, nine feet from tip to tip.  Off
it flies from its rocky perch, now appearing to sink with its own weight; but, gradually rising,
it soars aloft, even above the glittering dome of Chimborazo, no vibration seen in its powerful
wings.  Higher and higher it soars, till it appears a mere speck in the blue ether; then, lost
to the sight of human eye, darts rapidly downwards towards the sultry coast of the Pacific,
there to prey upon the putrefying carcasses of animals it may espy from afar.

On that lofty pinnacle, or some jutting ledge near it, the female has laid its two eggs, and
here it rears its young.  The eggs are large and white, and laid upon the bare rock.  The young
are covered with a whitish down, and, it is said, are unable to fly for an entire year. Few
other birds can fly to so great a distance above the earth.  It appears to respire as easily
in the most rarefied air as on the seashore.  They do not live in pairs, like the eagle, but
several are generally found together.  When an animal falls dead, a number of the vast birds
are soon seen coming from afar to feast on the carcass.

Great as is the altitude to which the condor can fly, and although it ranges through clouds
and storms to the southern end of the Andes, it is not found to the north of Panama.

The condor is a true vulture, gorging itself on dead and putrid carcasses.  It will also attack
the young llama, as well as lambs and calves, which it carries away in its powerful talons.
This makes it dreaded and hated by the shepherds of the hills and plains alike, who seek its
destruction by a variety of means.  Firearms are, however, useless, as its thick and strongly-constructed
coat of feathers will turn aside a bullet.  Besides, it is so tenacious of life, that one has
been known to receive several bullets in its body, and to have lived a considerable time afterwards.
The shepherds train their dogs to give notice of the approach of a condor; and the moment one
appears in the sky, they look upwards, and bark violently till their masters appear. Among
other modes which the natives employ to capture it, they kill an old mare--which they have
an idea is better than a horse--and allow the bird to gorge itself.  It then becomes so sluggish,
that they can without difficulty throw their bolas round its neck and legs.  It also sleeps
so soundly, that they frequently manage to approach it when at roost, and capture it in the
same way.

In the province of Abacay, in Peru, another method is employed.  A native fastens a quantity
of putrid flesh to a fresh cow-skin, under which he lies hid with a supply of rope.  When the
condor pounces down upon the meat, and remains gorging himself, the native fastens its legs
by means of the rope to the skin.  As soon as this is done, he creeps from beneath it.  The
frightened bird in vain attempts to escape. Immediately the hunter's companions, rushing forward,
throw their bolas over the bird, and make it captive.  Frequently several are thus caught at
the same time.

The cruel and disgusting custom of bull-baiting is still kept up in the country, and the condors
are employed to add to the terror and sufferings of the unhappy bull.  Before the unfortunate
animal is driven into the circus, his back is laid bare with a lance, and one of the birds,
which has been starved for a week or more, is bound upon it.  The famished condor immediately
attacks the raw, quivering flesh of the poor beast; and while it is thus engaged, the bull
is driven into the midst of the arena, to afford amusement to the savage spectators.

There is among the mountains a natural funnel-shaped excavation, sixty feet in depth, and about
eighty feet in diameter at the top.  The Indians place, on the edge of the pit, the putrid
body of a mule, so balanced that it will easily fall over.  In a short time it is discovered
by numbers of condors, which, darting down, greedily attack it.  Tugging and pulling at the
flesh, they soon draw it over the edge, when it falls to the bottom of the pit.  Not to be
disappointed of their prey, they hold tightly to the body, and descend with it.  Here, having
gorged themselves, they are unable to rise again to the mouth of the pit, and are speedily
killed with stones and sticks by the natives who collect round it, or are drawn captive to
the surface.  Dr Tschudi, in his Travels, mentions having seen twenty-eight birds at one time
thus destroyed.

They are caught in a similar manner in other places, and brought down to the coast, where they
are sold for a few dollars; and often thus find their way to Europe.  It was long an unsettled
point whether the condor discovers the dead animals on which it feeds by the power of sight
or of scent; but Darwin, by several experiments, has settled the question in favour of the
bird's keenness of vision.

A number of condors were kept captive in a garden, secured by ropes. Wrapping up a piece of
meat in white paper, and holding it in his hand, he walked up and down in front of the birds;
but they took no notice of it.  He then threw it down in front of an old male bird; but it
was still disregarded.  He then pushed it with a stick till it touched the condor's beak, when
the paper was torn off with fury, and every bird in the row began struggling and flapping its
wings to reach the food. Under the same circumstances, no dog would have been deceived.

The condor is said formerly to have been worshipped in Peru.  Perhaps the Peruvians, seeing
it descend through the air from beyond their sight, supposed it a celestial messenger from
the sun, which they worshipped.  If so, their descendants treat it in a very different way
to what they must then have done.

A condor ordinarily measures nine feet from tip to tip of the wings, and slightly over four
feet from beak to tail.

PART THREE, CHAPTER NINE.

THE VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS OF THE CORDILLERAS.

CHINCHONA OR PERUVIAN BARK.

The chinchona (it is erroneously spelt cinchona) tree constitutes the type of a natural order
(Chinchonaceae), which also includes ipecacuanhas and coffees.

On the western slopes of Chimborazo, and in several other regions extending from the wooded
heights of Merida and Santa Martha, at the northern end of the Cordilleras, as far as the Republic
of Bolivia, 19 degrees south, the chinchona-tree has its range.  Vegetation in the Cordilleras
within the tropics reaches to a much greater height than in higher latitudes.  The sun's rays
have there great power in heating the soil; while the mists drawn from the broad Pacific, rising
above the plains, rest upon the lofty sides of the mountains.  The warm and humid atmosphere
thus created is especially favourable to the growth of certain trees and shrubs.  Among others
is the chinchona-tree, from which quinine is obtained.  It is generally found growing at a
height of from 6000 feet to 10,000 feet above the ocean.

It would have been strange had not the native Peruvians been acquainted with the qualities
of the bark.  The Quichua name for the tree, quina-quina--"bark of barks"--shows that they
believed it to possess medicinal properties; indeed, there is little doubt that they were aware
of its febrifugal qualities, though they might not have attached much importance to them. 
Through them, probably, the Spanish colonists in the neighbourhood of Loxa first discovered
its virtues.  It was, however, but little known till the year 1638, when the wife of the Count
of Chinchon, Viceroy of Peru, lay sick of an intermittent fever in the palace of Lima.  The
corregidor of Loxa, who had himself been cured of an ague by the bark, hearing of her sickness,
sent a parcel of powdered quinquina bark to her physician.  It was administered to the Countess
Anna, and effected a complete cure.  She, in consequence, did her utmost to make it known.
Her famous cure induced Linnaeus long afterwards to name the whole genus of quinine-yielding
trees Chinchona, in her honour. The Jesuit missionaries, who had learned its virtues, also
sent parcels of the bark to Rome, whence it was distributed to members of their fraternity
throughout Europe by the Cardinal de Lugo.  Hence it was sometimes called Jesuits' bark, and
sometimes Cardinal's bark.  For many years, however, great opposition was made by European
physicians to its use.  Some Protestants, indeed, went so far as to decline taking it, because
it was favoured by the Jesuits.  Although the bark was used for many years, it was not till
Dr Gomez, a surgeon in the Portuguese navy, in 1816 isolated the febrifugal principle, and
called it chinchonine, that its true value became known.  But the final discovery of quinine,
as it is now used, is due to the French chemists Pelletier and Caventon, in 1820.  It is a
white substance, without smell, bitter, fusible, and crystallised.

Chinchonine is of less strength than quinine, and is used in mild cases of intermittent fever;
but in severe cases, the use of quinine is absolutely necessary.  Since the discovery of the
medicinal properties of this bark, it has proved an inestimable blessing to the human race.
For many years the bark itself was used as a febrifuge; but quinine, which is extracted from
it, is of still greater value in curing or preventing ague.  On various occasions it has rendered
great service by preserving the health of troops.  Many lives were saved by it in the disastrous
Walcheren expedition.  In India it is now universally used with the same beneficial effect;
and several African explorers have been enabled to prosecute their journeys through pestiferous
regions by its frequent use.  Dr Livingstone, among others, speaks of it as the chief remedy
he has employed when attacked by sickness on his journeys.

Most of the Chinchonae, when growing in good soil, and under favourable circumstances, become
large forest-trees.  When crowded, they frequently run up to a great height without a branch;
while at the upper limit of their zone, they become mere shrubs.

There are numerous species of chinchona, producing bark of greatly different values.  There
are upwards of nineteen different species of the true Chinchonae, and upwards of seventy once
received as such, though now considered of no commercial value.  The three characteristics
by which the true chinchona may be known are--the presence of curly hairs bordering the laciniae
of the corolla; the peculiar mode of dehiscence of the capsule from below upwards; and the
little pits at the axils of the veins on the under sides of the leaves.  The leaves are of
a great variety of shapes and sizes.  In the finer species they are lanceolate, with a shining
surface of bright green, traversed by crimson veins and petioles of the same colour.  The flowers
are very small, and hang in clustering panicles like lilacs.  They are generally of a deep
roseate colour, paler near the stalk, and dark crimson within the tube, with white curly hairs
bordering the laciniae of the corolla.  The colour of one species is entirely white.  They
send forth a delicious fragrance, which scents the air in their neighbourhood.

The region round the little town of Loxa, on the southern frontier of Ecuador, is the original
home of the chinchona.  In its sheltered ravines and dense forests were found those precious
trees which first made known to the world the healing virtues of Peruvian bark.  They grow
at a height above the sea of from 6200 to 8200 feet.  The trees are there from 30 to 48 feet
high, with three or more stems growing from the same root.  The leaves are like those already
described.  The bark is black when exposed to the sun and wind, but of a brownish colour when
surrounded by other trees; and is always covered with lichens.  The bark from the Loxa region
is known as crown bark; that from Chimborazo, as red bark; while in the Huanaco region of Northern
Peru grey bark is produced.

When first the demand for the bark was established, bark-collectors, called cascarilleros,
entered the forests in parties of a dozen or more, supplied with food and tools.  At their
head was a searcher (cateador), who, climbing a high tree, looked out for the manchas, or clumps
of chinchona-trees, which experience taught him to know by their dark colour and the peculiar
reflection of the light from their leaves amidst those endless expanses of forest.  Having
marked the spot, he descended, and led his party, sometimes for hours together, through the
tangled wilderness, using the wood-knife to mark his way to the chinchona clump.  As soon as
it was found, rude huts were built, and the parties commenced their work.  Having with their
axes laid the tree level with the ground, cutting it as close as possible to the roots, the
work of stripping off the bark was commenced.  The original mode of doing this is still continued.
It is done by dividing the stems into pieces of uniform length.  The bark is then cut lengthwise,
so as to remove the rind without injuring the wood, or severing any of the fibres.  In a few
days the bark is taken off in strips as broad as possible, and is afterwards pressed out into
flat pieces.  That, however, taken from the thinner branches is allowed to retain its form,
and is known as quill bark--called by the natives canuto; that from the solid trunk is called
tabla or plancha.  It is sewn up in coarse canvas, with an outer covering of fresh hide, forming
packages called serons.  Thus prepared, it is transported to the coast for shipment.

From the careless way in which the bark-collectors have hewn down the trees, often digging
up the roots themselves, the production has greatly decreased.  When the root is allowed to
remain, and the stem hewn as near as possible to it, an after-growth is produced, which, in
the milder regions, in the space of six years again produces bark.  In the colder regions twenty
years are required before a tree is fit to be cut down.

With great care and trouble chinchona plants and seeds have been transported from South America
to India by Professor Markham; and in the mountainous regions of the East the tree is now cultivated
and flourishing.  It had some years before been carried by the Dutch to Java, where, however,
from want of sufficient care at first, its cultivation has not been so successful as it appears
to be in India, Coca.

The native Indian, as he climbs the dizzy precipice, or passes over the rocking bridge, in
his journey across the rugged mountains, or leads his troop of llamas to the seashore, or labours
in the dark mines, bringing up vast weights from the bowels of the earth, is enabled to bear
the fatigue he is called on to undergo by putting a few dried leaves into his mouth, which
he chews, and replenishes from time to time.  Thus the coca leaf is a great source of comfort
and enjoyment.  As he journeys, his chuspa or coca-bag, made of llama cloth, dyed red and blue
in patterns, is hung over his shoulders.  In his bag he also carries small cakes--composed
of carbonate of potash mixed with lime and water--called clipta.  Sitting down, he first puts
a few leaves into his mouth, which he chews, and turns over and over till he has formed a ball.
He then adds a small piece of the cake; and, sustained by the wonderful qualities of the morsel,
will go on for many hours without food.  He usually replenishes his mouth about three times
in the day.

The smell of the leaf is agreeable and aromatic, and gives out a grateful fragrance.  When,
however, used to excess, like other narcotics, coca--though the least injurious--is still prejudicial
to health.

The coca plant (Erythoxylon coca) grows at an elevation of between 5000 and 6000 feet above
the level of the ocean, in the warm valleys of the eastern slopes of the Andes, where rain
frequently falls.  It is from four to six feet high, with straight and alternate branches.
The leaves, which are of a light green, are alternate, and in form and size similar to tea
leaves.  The flowers, which are solitary, have a small yellowish white corolla.  It requires
careful cultivation.  It is produced from seeds, and the plants are then transplanted into
soil carefully weeded and broken up.  It is found growing on terraces on the mountainsides,
which will allow of but a single row of plants.  At the end of eighteen months the plants yield
their first harvest, and continue to yield for upwards of forty years.  The green leaves, when
picked, are carefully spread out in the sun to dry.  The name of "coca" is bestowed on them
only when they are dried and prepared for use.

Some writers, objecting altogether to stimulating narcotics, assert that the use of coca produces
all the evil results of opium; but this, from the evidence of many enlightened travellers,
seems not to be the case. Taken immoderately, no doubt it is injurious,--as is tea, coffee,
tobacco, or wine; but used as it generally is by the natives, it is to them a great blessing.
The valleys, however, most suitable for its cultivation are reputed to be unhealthy.

So valuable was coca considered in the days of the Incas, that divine honours were paid to
it, and it was especially the property of the sovereign.  Even at the present day the miners
of Peru throw a quid of coca against the hard veins of ore, under the belief that they are
thereby more easily worked.  The natives also sometimes put coca in the mouth of the dying
man, believing that if he can taste the fragrant leaf it is a sure sign of his future happiness.

Its moderate use is considered wholesome; and European travellers who have chewed coca state
that they could thus endure long abstinence from food without inconvenience, and that it enabled
them to ascend precipitous mountainsides with a feeling of lightness and elasticity, and without
losing breath.

PART THREE, CHAPTER TEN.

HUMMING-BIRDS (TROCHILIDAE) OF THE CORDILLERAS AND WESTERN COAST.

We should scarcely have expected to find the smallest specimens of the feathered tribe inhabiting
the same region as the mighty, coarse-feeding condor; but whereas the latter pounces down on
his carrion banquet into the plains below, the little humming-bird seeks his food from the
bright flowers which clothe the mountainside, or the minute insects which fly amid them.

Humming-birds are found throughout the whole of the New World, from the borders of the great
Canadian lakes, along the entire range of the Cordilleras, down to the shores of Tierra del
Fuego; also in the West India Islands, and over the whole wide-extending plains watered by
the Orinoco, the Amazon, and other great rivers which empty themselves into the Atlantic. 
The greater number of the species exist about the equator, and, as might be expected, diminish
as we proceed either to the south or north.

They obtain their name on account of the humming sound which their wings produce when they
are hovering over the flowers in which they seek their food.  The sound, however, varies in
the species; and the well-practised ear of the naturalist is often able to distinguish without
difficulty one from the other.  Some are furnished with strong wings, with which they can extend
their flight over a large extent of country; and many are migratory.  Others again have only
small wings, and are compelled to remain always in the same locality.  So rapid is their flight,
that the eye can scarcely distinguish the little bird as it cleaves the air; and when hovering
over a flower, the wings appear like filmy grey fans on either side.

The food of most species consists partly of insects and partly of the honey extracted from
flowers.  In order to obtain its food from the deep recesses of flowers, it possesses a long
delicate beak; in some birds straight, in others curved downwards, while some, again, have
a double curve.  These variations in form are undoubtedly to suit the particular flowers on
which they feed.  By means of the peculiar structure of its tongue, which is long, filamentous,
and doubled nearly to the base, it is enabled to project it to a great distance--even into
the very depths of the largest flowers.

There are upwards of three hundred species of these beautiful birds, and others are being constantly
discovered--one vying with the other in beauty and richness of plumage--truly described as
the "feathered gems of the mountain and forest."  Some humming-birds tower, like the lark,
to a great height in the air; while others keep always near the ground, among the shrubs in
which they live.

The nests of humming-birds vary in form and structure, but they are all of a most delicate
nature.  The external parts of some are formed of light grey lichen, and so perfectly arranged
round it as to appear at a little distance as if only forming part of the branch to which it
is attached.  The interior consists of the silky fibres of the cotton-tree, extremely delicate
and soft.  The female lays a couple of eggs only, purely white, and about the size of peas.
Ten days are required for their hatching, and the birds raise two broods in a season.  When
first hatched they are not larger than an ordinary-sized fly.  Small as is the male humming-bird,
he is a brave little fellow, and will courageously fly at the largest bird which approaches
his nest; while, by the rapidity of his flight, he can avoid the attacks of even the swiftest
of the larger race.

There is a remarkable circumstance connected with humming-birds, especially in lofty regions,
where they are more particularly susceptible of electric influences.  It is well known that
in many regions small birds are found killed after a thunder-storm, in consequence of the amount
of electricity in the air.  The humming-birds, as if conscious of this danger, build their
nests of peculiar form, and of materials which are bad conductors of electricity, within which
they are thoroughly protected.  The nests of some are shaped like inverted cones, tapering
to a fine point--that, as is supposed, the electricity which would destroy the delicate young
ones, or the vitality of the eggs, may pass off into the air.

Their notes are very feeble, rarely rising into a whistle.  In one week after they are hatched,
the young birds are ready to fly, but they are fed by their parents for nearly another week.
Their plumage, however, does not attain its full brilliancy till the succeeding spring.

But we must confine ourselves to the humming-birds of the Cordilleras, on the western coast.

SWORD-BILL HUMMING-BIRD.

At the north of the range, between Santa Fe de Bogota and Quito, at an elevation often of 12,000
feet, is found the sword-bill humming-bird. Its name is derived from the length of its beak,
which is nearly as long as its body, and enables it to seek its food from the long pendent
corollas of the Brugmansae.  Nothing can exceed the elegance of its movements as it probes
the pendent blossoms, searching to their inmost depths.  Its nest, woven with wonderful skill
and beauty of construction, is fastened to the end of a twig.  The head and upper part of the
body of the male bird are green, glossed with gold in some parts, and with bronze in others.
The wings are dark black-brown, with a purple gloss; while the tail is dark black, the upper
surface being bronzed.  A conspicuous white, slightly elongated spot exists behind each eye,
and on each side of the chest there is a broad crescent-shaped mark of light green.  The under
parts are of a bronzed green, and the under tail-coverts are flaked with a little white.

COPPER-BELLIED PUFF-LEG.

In the neighbourhood of Santa Fe, another very beautiful and curious little bird, the copper-bellied
puff-leg, is found, at an elevation of about 9000 feet.  (Unlike the greater number of birds,
the female humming-birds are generally as richly ornamented as the male.)  It is named from
the curious white puffs or ruffs--looking as if formed of swan's-down--on the legs.  The head
of the male, the sides of the neck, and back, are green, with a bronzed tint, except on the
tail-coverts, where the green is pure, and of metallic brilliancy.  The tail is black, with
a purple gloss; the throat is of a shining, metallic green; while the breast and under portion
of the body is green, glossed with gold.

This bird, probably on account of the vegetation of the locality, from which it obtains its
food, is restricted to a narrow mountain-ridge, not three-quarters of a mile in width.

WHITE-BOOTED RACKET-TAIL.

The rapid flying white-booted racket-tail is likewise common near Santa Fe.  It possesses muffs,
like the former, and is found at an elevation of nearly 10,000 feet.  It is named from the
long, racket-shaped feathers of the tail, which, when flying, are in constant motion, waving
softly in the air, opening and closing in the most beautiful manner.  In its flight it may
vie with the arrow as it darts from a bow; and when the bird rapidly cleaves the air, the tail-feathers
lie straight behind it.

The chief colour of this bird is a bronzed green, the upper tail-coverts being of a richer
and redder hue.  The wings are of a purple-brown, as is the tail; but the rackets are black,
shot with green.  The feet are yellow, with two beautiful white ruffs surrounding the legs.

COLUMBIAN THORN-BILL.

In the same district, invariably keeping at the bottom of the valleys, is found the Columbian
thorn-bill.  It does not even mount, as do many humming-birds, to the tops of the trees, but
seeks its food among the low, flowering shrubs.  It is of a golden green colour on the upper
parts, and of a dull green below; except on its curious tuft, which hangs from the chin, and
is of a light green at the base, and a purple-red towards the points.  The wings are of a purple-brown
hue, as is the tail, with a bronzed gloss, while the under tail-coverts are brown-yellow. 
It is curious that the hen, though in other respects like the male, has no beard.

BLACK WARRIOR.

At the height of 13,000 feet above the ocean is found a curious bird, which, from the pointed
plume crowning the top of its head, and the long beard-like projection from its chin, is very
appropriately called the helmet-crest or black warrior.  It inhabits regions immediately below
the line of perpetual snow, where we should least expect to find so delicate a creature.  Its
food it gathers from the thinly scattered shrubs projecting from the ledges of rock near the
snow.  Its flight is swift, but very short.  When launching itself from the lofty height on
which it is perched, it flies obliquely downwards, uttering at the same time a plaintive, whistling
sound.  It is more sedate in its habits than its brethren, nor does it seem to partake of their
joyous spirit.  The head and neck of the male are black, with a line running along the centre.
The long beard is white, and round the neck and back of the head is a broad band of white.
The upper surface of the body and the two central feathers of the tail are bronzed green, the
others being of a warm reddish bronze.  Its length is a little over five inches.

The female is chiefly brown, and possesses no beard or helmet-like plume; it is also considerably
smaller.

THE SICKLE-BILL.

In the humming-birds, we see the same perfect adaptation of their construction to their peculiar
wants which is found throughout the whole animal creation.  This is beautifully exhibited in
the sickle-bill, which is occasionally found in Bogota.  Its bill is very short and sharply
curved, in order that it may enter the short, curved flowers of that region.  It is generally
of a duller hue than most of its tribe. Its head and small crest are blackish-brown, each feather
having a spot of buff on its tip.  The upper part of the body is of a dark, glossy green, slightly
touched with buff.  The under part is a brownish-black, with a few buff streaks upon the throat
and breast.  It is about four and a half inches long.

MARS' SUN-ANGEL.

Mr Gould describes the Mars' sun-angel as among the most beautiful of the genus Heliangelus
inhabiting the northern end of the Cordilleras.

"It has all the charms of novelty to recommend it, and it stands alone among its congeners;
no other member of the genus, similarly coloured, having been discovered up to the present
time.  The throat vies with the radiant topaz, while the band on the forehead rivals in brilliancy
the frontlet of every other species.  The male bird has a fiery red mark on its forehead, and
the crown of the head and upper surface of the body are bronzed green.  The throat is ornamented
with a gorget of deep fiery red, and below it is a crescent-shaped band of light buff, while
the under part is of a deeper buff, changing to green at the sides.  The tail is of a bronzed
brown, with the two centre feathers of bronzed green.  The female is destitute of the red mark
on the throat and forehead."

HELIANGELUS CLARISSA.

Another sun-angel, the Heliangelus Clarissae, has a deep ruby crimson gorget.

SNOW-CAP HUMMING-BIRD.

In New Granada is also found the curious little snow-cap humming-bird, one of the most rare
of the Trochilidae.  It is of a brown colour, with a coppery hue, in which, in certain lights,
a purple reflection can be perceived.  The crown of the head and the tip of the tail-feathers
are of a dazzling white.

Mr Gould describes one he saw perched on a twig, pluming its feathers. At first he was doubtful
whether so small an object could be a bird.  It was standing over a pool of water.  "At first
the little creature would poise itself about three feet or so above the water, and then, as
quick as thought, dive downwards, so as to dip its miniature head in the placid pool.  Then
up again it would fly to its original position, as quickly as it had descended.  These movements
of darting up and down it repeated in rapid succession, producing a wonderful disturbance of
the surface of the water for so diminutive a creature.  After a considerable number of dips
it alighted on a twig near at hand, and commenced pluming its feathers."

SPANGLED COQUETTE.

The spangled coquette, like all of its genus, possesses a well-defined crest on the head, and
a number of feathers projecting from the neck. This singular crest it can raise or depress
at will, producing a curious effect in the appearance of the little bird.  When depressed,
the crest lies fiat, and projects on either side, so that the sparkling eyes can scarcely be
seen.  The crest and feathers projecting from the neck are of a light, ruddy chestnut, the
latter having dark bronzed green spots on the tip.  The head is of the same colour; the throat
and face of a lustrous green.  Below the gorget projects a small crossing from side to side,
and the rest of the plumage is of a dark, ruddy chestnut colour. The female has neither crest
nor gorget.

TRAIN-BEARER (LEOBIA AMARYLLIS).

Professor Orton tells us that the valley of Quito swarms with those winged jewels--of varied
hue--the Trochilidae.

Among them is the train-bearer, which, small as it is, has a straight tail nearly six inches
in length.

HILL STAR.

The neighbouring heights of Chimborazo and Pichincha are adorned with two beautiful little
creatures, well called "Hill Stars;" and it is curious that the hill star of Chimborazo never
visits Pichincha, nor does the latter ever approach Chimborazo.  They are very like each other;
but while that of Chimborazo has a triangular green spot upon the throat, it is wanting in
the Pichincha hill star.  The colour of the upper part of the Chimborazian hill star is of
a somewhat dark olive-green, except the wings, which are of a purple-brown tint.  The under
parts are white; but they deepen into a dusky black upon the under tail-coverts.  The head
and throat are of the most glorious blue, with the exception of the before-mentioned emerald-green
patch on the centre of the throat, which is of a triangular form, one angle pointing upwards.
It has a broad collar of velvety black round the neck, the dark hues of the head contrasting
curiously with the dark body.  In the tail there are two white feathers, edged with greenish-black.
The hen is of a more sombre hue, having an olive-green head, and the throat white, spotted
with green.

THE SAPPHO COMET.

Proceeding southwards, we find numerous beautiful humming-birds in Bolivia.  Among them is
the sappho comet, or bar-tailed humming-bird. In winter it descends into the lowlands of Peru,
among the abodes of men, visiting their gardens and orchards with perfect fearlessness.  The
larger part of the plumage is of a light green, the lower portion of the back a deep crimson-red.
The throat is metallic green, and the wings are purple-brown.  The base of the tail is brown,
but the greater part is of a fiery hue, tipped with velvety black.

As it darts from flower to flower--now describing a circle, now turning and performing numberless
other evolutions--the eye is unable to follow it, and it is lost to sight, until it again returns
to the flower which at first attracted its attention.

On arriving at its winter abode, it takes up its residence in the shrubberies and gardens of
the Indian cottages, says Mr Bonelli.  The hill-side of the neighbouring country, clothed with
the indigenous trees and shrubs, also affords it a fit place of abode, whence it descends several
times a day to the cultivated plains below, particularly to the fields of maize and pulse,
and other leguminous plants.  The rich flowers of the large cacti are also frequently visited,
as they afford it a constant and abundant supply of insect food.

The nest is a somewhat loose structure, outwardly composed of vegetable fibres, slight twigs,
and moss, and frequently lined with soft hair. The lower portion is prolonged considerably
below the cup-shaped interior, which is about an inch and a half in diameter, and an inch in
depth; the total length of the nest being nearly three inches.  The nest is placed against
the sides of the walls, supported by any hanging root or twig that may be best adapted to afford
it security.  The eggs are two in number, and oblong in form, of a pure white, half an inch
in length, by about five-sixteenths of an inch in breadth.

THE PHAON COMET--BLUE-TAILED SYLPH.

The phaon comet is considerably larger, but very similar to the former, except that the whole
of its tail is of a crimson-red.

The blue-tailed sylph has a wide range along the temperate regions of the Cordilleras.  The
genus of sylph to which it belongs is among the most beautiful and graceful in form of the
humming-birds.  The body is of a bronzed green, and the crown of the head of a metallic golden
green; while the throat is adorned with a gorget of the most intense purple-blue.  It has a
superb tail, the two central feathers of which are of a shining metallic green; the two next
are black at their base, and rich blue towards their extremities, tipped and edged with bright
metallic green, shot with blue.

But we have not space to describe one-tenth part of those wonderful, bright, and small specimens
of the feathered tribe which inhabit the mountains for their entire length.  Darwin found one
of the species--the Trochilus forficatus--flying about amid the snow-storms in the forests
of Tierra del Fuego; while in the wooded island of Chiloe, which has an extremely humid climate,
he saw it skipping from side to side amid the dripping foliage.

In the same island is found another species, the Trochilus gigas--a very large bird for so
delicate a family.  It feeds chiefly on insects.  The note of this species, like that of nearly
the whole family, is extremely shrill.

In Bolivia are found the Bolivian violet-ear, Warren's wood-star, and many others; but we must
bring our description of the humming-birds of this region to a conclusion.

PART THREE, CHAPTER ELEVEN.

MAMMALIA.

THE SAVAGE INHABITANTS OF THE AMAZONIAN VALLEY.

Full of animal life as are the forests of South America, the number of species of what are
generally called wild beasts is remarkably small. Four only are capable of attacking man--the
jaguar, the puma, the great ant-eater, and the savage little peccary, with its lancet-like
tusks. The first only is universally dreaded; the puma flies when bravely confronted; the great
ant-eater is not dangerous, except to those who get within its reach; and the peccary is dreaded
chiefly when hunting in a pack, as it does, like the wolf.  The burly tapir, the largest animal
of the continent--though a hippopotamus would look at it with contempt-- is perfectly harmless;
and, with the exception of a few species of tiger-cats, nearly all the other Mammalia are rodents,
or belong to the order Quadrumana.  The latter are by far the most numerous inhabitants of
its wide-extending forests.  It is especially the country of monkeys, where they have arrived
at their highest development.  Several of the species are not only furnished with four hands,
but they have tails which serve them, to all intents and purposes, as a fifth hand.  They can
hang by them, or insert them into a hole and pick out a bird's egg, or a minute insect, with
the greatest ease.  They are generally, with the exception of the howlers, amicably disposed,
easily tamed, with beautiful coats of fur, and, if not exactly elegant in their forms, very
agile, and generally attractive, interesting little creatures.

The serpents and insects are far more dreaded and annoying than the wild beasts.  Many of the
former are fearfully venomous.  The boa occasionally finds a human being in the forest, sick
or wounded, and unable to fly, and winds its huge coils round his body.  The anaconda is equally
dangerous to those sleeping near the river's edge; while the cunning and savage alligator lies
in wait for the unwary bather or drawer of water who ventures into the stream; and termites
and ants devour the stores of the inhabitants, and, in certain localities, well-nigh sting
them to madness.

THE PUMA.

The gaucho of the Pampas, the llanero of the savannahs in the north, the herdsman on the slopes
of the Cordilleras facing the Pacific, and the settlers on the eastern shore, dread the wide-ranging
puma--or the American lion, as the creature, on account of its tawny hide, is wrongly called.
Supplied with powerful limbs, capable of climbing tall trees and swimming rivers, neither mountains,
forests, open plains, nor streams stop its progress.  Like the cat, to which genus it belongs,
it stealthily approaches its prey, and, seizing it with a sudden spring, rends it to pieces.
When coming upon a flock of sheep or vicunas, it deals havoc and destruction on every side,
often striking down in mere wantonness a far greater number than it can carry off or devour.
Yet, though far larger than the jaguar, it is inferior to it in courage, and, when boldly opposed
by man, will always take to flight; though, like the jaguar, it will track a human being through
the forest, in the hope of springing on him when unobserved.  Yet, boldly faced, it plays the
coward, and will creep off, unable to stand man's steady gaze.  Like a wild cat, it climbs
a tree with ease; and, taking post on a branch, crouches down, stretched out at full length
along it, its colour harmonising with the bark, so that it cannot be seen by its unwary prey
moving near it.  As the deer or vicuna passes below, it launches itself on the doomed creature,
and, drawing back its neck with its powerful claws, breaks the vertebra, and instantly kills
it.  Darwin states that he has frequently seen skeletons of huanucus with their necks thus
dislocated.

In the Amazonian forests the puma is not so common as the jaguar.  The colour of its fur resembles
that of the deer in these forests.  The natives call it the sassu-arana, or the false deer,
as it frequently, in consequence, deceives them at first sight.  "It was from this name being
misspelt that it is called the cuguacuarana, the first c being soft," observes Bates.  Hence
the name cougar, employed by French zoologists, and copied in most works on natural history.
The hunters do not fear it, describing it as a coward; and such, in spite of its strength,
it undoubtedly is.  Still, instances have occurred of its killing human beings.

It is often found at an elevation of upwards of 10,000 feet.  After killing an animal and eating
its fill, it covers over the carcass with bushes, and lies down to watch it.  This habit frequently
causes its destruction, for the condors, attracted by the carcass, assemble from far and near
to their expected feast, when the puma springs out to drive them off.  The gauchos of the Pampas,
observing the birds rise together on the wing, hurry with men and dogs to the chase.  Whirling
their bolas round their heads, they quickly entangle the animal's limbs, and then, throwing
their lassoes over it, drag it along the ground till rendered insensible, when its brains are
quickly beaten out.  In Chili it is hunted with dogs, or, driven up a tree, is easily shot.
It is noted for its craft.  When once it has been betrayed when watching a carcass, and has
managed to make its escape, it is said never to resume that habit. When pursued it will stop
and spring on one side, and wait till the dogs have passed by.  Unlike the jaguar, which is
among the most noisy of beasts of prey, the puma seldom utters any sound, even when wounded,
but silently takes its way, its presence only known as it makes the fatal spring on its victim.

THE JAGUAR.

The Indian, as he roams through the forest, turns many a cautious look over his shoulder, lest
the savage jaguar, with stealthy feet, may be following his trail.  Meeting the monarch of
his forests face to face, he fears it not, provided he is armed with a bow and poisoned arrows,
or sumpitan and envenomed dart, which will soon compel the fierce creature to succumb to its
deadly influence.

Of the jaguar, or ounce (Felis onca), there are two species--the one of a palish brown-yellow,
variegated on the upper parts of the body with streaks and regular oblong spots of black; while
the other is of a general black hue, and is considered the more savage of the two.  It reaches
a size which may vie with the tigers of India, though it is often not much larger than a wolf.
It is frequently called the tiger or panther of the New World.  The tail is not so long as
the body.  In outward appearance it closely resembles the leopard, especially in its arborial
habits, as by means of its powerful claws it can with ease spring up the trunk of a tree, and
make its way along the branches, ready to pounce down upon a foe.  Nearly every creature of
the forests and arid plains over which it roams, and many which frequent the margins of the
rivers and lakes, have to dread its voracious jaws.  It will spring from the bough, along which
it lies crouching, on the back of the thick-skinned tapir, which, with those powerful claws
clinging to its hide, dashes terror--stricken through the thickets, endeavouring to shake off
its foe.  It will even fearlessly attack the alligator, in spite of the latter's enormous jaws,--avoiding
which, by its agility, it will tear open the reptile's side, and devour it before life is extinct.
It lies watching from a projecting trunk for the huge manatee swimming by, and grappling it
with its claws, holds it fast in the struggle for life and death, by degrees dragging the vast
body out of the water, and never letting go its grasp till it has succeeded in capturing its
prey. Turtles become its easy victims.  Watching for them as they crawl up the sandy banks,
it turns them helplessly over with its paws.  The capybara, or water-hog, seems born for the
especial purpose of serving it as food, enormous numbers of that big rodent being devoured
by it.  Even active monkeys cannot escape it.  It will climb the trees and surprise them when
sleeping; or sometimes, lying in concealment, springs out among a troop of them joyously gambolling,
unsuspicious of danger, when their shrieks of terror and the hoarse roar of the jaguar may
be heard resounding through the forest.

But where flocks and herds are collected in the neighbourhood of man's abode, the jaguar is
especially dreaded, as it will spring upon a horse and bring it to the ground with ease; it
has been known to drag one many yards to the water's side, and swim across the river with its
prey, carrying it away on the opposite side to its home in the forest.  Sheep and deer fall
easy victims.  When seizing a deer or horse, it leaps on the animal's back, and grasping the
head with its claws, wrenches it back till the vertebrae of the neck are broken.

There are but two animals who do not fear the jaguar.  The great ant-eater is defended from
the monster's attacks by its shaggy, thick coat.  It will often grasp the jaguar in its powerful
claws, and keep it in a close embrace, while these formidable weapons tear open its side--
treating it as some chiefs in India were in the habit of treating their guests, whom they pretended
to receive with an embrace of friendship, their hands armed with the steel-formed claws in
imitation of those of tigers.  Though the savage little peccaries, when caught singly, are
quickly despatched by the jaguar, yet when meeting it collected in a herd, they so fiercely
assault it with their sharp tusks, that it is either pierced to death, in spite of the blows
of its claws, or compelled to take to flight.

It catches fish as it does the manatee, suddenly thrusting forth its talons as they pass below
it; while it scrapes up the turtle's eggs in numbers.  It even pounces on birds and lizards,
in spite of their activity and means of escape; and, when pressed by hunger, it will attack
a native village, and carry off, not only fowls and other tame animals, but the children, and
sometimes full-grown people, whom it may catch unawares.

Darwin says, that when the floods drive these animals to drier ground, they are most dangerous;
and mentions many instances of people being destroyed by them.  On the Parana they have been
known to get on board vessels at night.  He heard of a man who, coming up from below when it
was dark, was seized on the deck by a jaguar.  He escaped, however, with the loss of the use
of an arm.

The gauchos say, that when wandering at night, it is frequently followed by foxes yelping at
its heels.  If such is the case, it is a curious coincidence with the fact, generally affirmed,
that jackals accompany the East Indian tiger.

The jaguar often leaves marks on the bark of trees, which it scrapes for the purpose of tearing
off the rugged parts of its claws; a habit common also to the puma, as Darwin says he frequently
found in Patagonia scores so deep on the hard soil, that no other animal could have made them.

Brett mentions several instances which came under his notice of human beings being killed by
jaguars.  A Carib Indian had gone into the forest to procure touari,--the inner bark of the
sapucaya-nut tree, of the thin papery layers of which the Indians form the envelopes of their
cigarettes.  While employed in cutting off the long strips of the bark, on turning round he
discovered a jaguar stealthily approaching.  His friends, as he did not return, set out in
search of him.  For a whole day they searched in vain; but on the second they discovered his
foot-tracks, and those of a large jaguar.  Following these for a long way in anxious suspense,
they at length came to a spot where there were marks of a conflict, and they discovered their
comrade's bow lying broken on the ground.  Still it was apparent that the Indian had beaten
off his assailant, for the tracks of both led still further into the forest.  At length they
reached the scene of the last desperate struggle.  On the ground lay the man's knife, which
he had lashed to the end of a stick; but it had been loosened and turned aside against the
tough hide of the animal.  From the marks on a tree it was evident that the poor fellow, in
dire extremity, at the approach of night, had been trying to climb it, but ere he had ascended
ten feet the jaguar had sprung after him, and pulling him down, had torn him to pieces.  The
remains, terribly mangled and half-devoured, lay near.  One of the Caribs who had found the
body described the sickness which came over him at the sight, and remarked that he had never
since felt secure when traversing the forest with only his knife and bow and arrows.  On the
banks of the Pomaroon lived a Carib family, with a number of small children.  The young ones
had gone into the water to bathe, when they were startled by the cry of the smallest of their
party--a little boy-- whom they had left seated at the water's edge.  On looking round they
beheld a huge jaguar which had been attracted by their noises of splashing, and which, having
come behind the poor child, was standing with one paw on his shoulder.  The elder children,
screaming for help, attempted bravely to drive away the savage beast, but their efforts only
resulted in it seizing the poor little fellow's head with its powerful jaws.  It was a moment
of agony.  Their father was absent, but another Carib who was near rushed to the spot, followed
by the child's mother and some other females.  The beast, startled at this sudden increase
in the number of its assailants, dropped its victim, whom the man immediately took up and gave
to the mother.  But assistance had come too late.  The child gave his last struggle as his
mother received him in her arms.  When night set in, the disappointed beast came back to claim
his prey, roaring and yelling through the hours of darkness around the open shed which formed
their dwelling.  Females alone were present, as the man had gone off to call the child's father;
and they had great difficulty, with firebrands and shouting, in keeping the brute off till
help arrived.

Some time after this, another man, of considerable personal strength and cool courage, was
one day in his field, with a little dog playing by his side, when he saw a jaguar at a distance
watching his movements.  The beast slunk away when observed, and as the Carib had no gun, he
went on quietly with his work, clearing away the bush with his cutlass, which was a new and
sharp one.  The jaguar had, however, marked the dog for its prey, and only retreated to execute
a flank march through the bush, and to come unperceived on his rear.  Having effected this,
it crept noiselessly forward, and sprang on the dog, which was instantly killed. The Carib
rushed to the assistance of his favourite, compelling the savage jaguar to relinquish its hold,
but the creature turned and sprang upon him.  The man, however, anticipating the attack, dashed
forward and decided the contest by a single blow, which buried his cutlass deep in the jaguar's
skull.  The same man, on another occasion, clove the skull of a second jaguar with an axe with
which he was about to fell some trees.

The jaguar, however, is capable of being tamed.  The well-known Captain Inglefield possessed
one, afterwards placed in the Zoological Gardens. It was so tame that he used to lie down and
place his head on its body as on a pillow.  It was allowed to roam at liberty about the ship.
It was remarkable, however, that this creature could never be trusted when a young child or
a dog was present.  On such occasions it became greatly excited, endeavouring to break away
from the chain with which it was secured when on shore.  Probably in its native wilds both
would have fallen victims to its natural ferocity.

The Bishop of Demerara witnessed an instance of the way in which these savage creatures may
occasionally be tamed, while on an expedition up the River Demerara.  On approaching the falls,
he and his party halted at an Indian settlement on the left bank, where they saw a young jaguar
only a few weeks old, which appeared to be extremely savage, when any of them went near it.
"But," he continues, "never did I observe such apparent gentleness and attachment in any animal;
as, when one or two of our party had certainly not gone the way to win the creature's affections,
it allowed itself to be drawn close to us by an Indian woman, and afterwards by a little child.
Not a moment before, it was as angry and savage as could be; but no sooner did the child draw
it towards her, than, looking up with an expression of intelligence and trustfulness quite
new to me, it nestled itself within the embrace of its kind protectress."

The Indians are proverbially famous for the facility with which they attract animals towards
them.  Bates and Wallace also mention having seen, on several occasions, jaguars perfectly
tame, roaming in and out of the huts, as their smaller feline relatives would have done.

ANT-EATERS.

Within the recesses of the primeval forest, near the borders of a river or lake, a large mass
of what looks, at a little distance, like a collection of some long, coarse, curled, fibrous
substance, is often seen by the hunter.  The jaguar glances at it askance and passes it by,--although,
when hunger presses him, he may long to obtain the dainty meal which lies beneath.  The huge
hairy mass is the tail of the ant-bear, which serves it as a shelter from the rays of the noonday
sun and from the deluges of the rainy season: spread out over its body, it is the sole covering
it seeks, as it neither burrows, nor takes up its abode in the hollows of trees nor in artificial
caves.  With its elongated toothless head and thin tongue, it seems utterly incapable, at the
first glance, of defending itself, not only against the jaguar or puma, but, notwithstanding
its great size, against even the attacks of the smallest carnivorous animals of the wilds,
as it moves with toilsome and awkward steps over the ground.  It cannot climb the trees; unadapted
for swimming, it dare not seek safety in the water; and incapable of moving rapidly, it is
unable to run from its foes.  Its hind-feet, unlike those of many animals, are valueless for
defence; but yet it has not been left without ample means of protection.  Examine its fore-feet,
and on each will be seen two large, powerful, trenchant claws.  With these, aided by its muscular
power, and thick hide covered with long coarse hair, it boldly defies the attacks of the fiercest
creatures.

Of a peaceable disposition, it makes its solitary way through the forest; but woe betide the
hunter's dogs, or any other animals, which venture to assail it!  With one blow of these sharp
weapons it rips up its assailant, or hugs it in a close embrace, where its own thick skin resists
the teeth of its foe; and, able itself to endure hunger longer than any other animal, it keeps
it thus till starved to death.

Vast numbers of ants and termites swarm in the tropical forests of South America, of great
varieties of form and mode of life and occupation. Their business in the economy of nature
is chiefly the consumption of decayed vegetable matter, which would otherwise contaminate the
atmosphere.  They are furnished with incalculable powers of increase, and, to prevent their
too great excess, other animals have been created to prey on them.  The chief creature engaged
in that work is this most extraordinary denizen of the forest--the ant-bear, or great ant-eater
(Myrmecophaga jubata), called also the tamanoir.  It often measures, from the tip of its snout
to the extremity of its tail, eight feet; and though it seems wonderful that so large an animal
should be able to subsist solely on such minute insects, yet, from the formation of its mouth,
it is unable to consume any other.  It has a long slender head, with a pointed snout; and its
mouth, entirely destitute of teeth, is furnished with a long flexible tongue, covered with
a glutinous saliva. This it passes lightly over the swarms of ants which rush out when it attacks
their dwelling, and they, adhering to it, are speedily dragged into its maw.

Its body is covered with long, coarse, shaggy hair, except on the head, where it is short and
close; while its black bushy tail is of great size and length.  It is plantigrade--that is,
it stands lower on the hind-legs than in front.  Though its mouth appears so incapable of enabling
it to defend itself, it can do so effectually with the two long, sharp claws of its fore-feet.
With these claws it opens the ant-hills, on whose inhabitants it subsists.  Its hind-feet have
five toes, but they are furnished with short, weak claws, similar to those of ordinary quadrupeds.

Its favourite resort is the low swampy marshes of the rivers and stagnant pools; but it also
ranges widely in search of its prey.  It lives in solitude; its habits are slothful; it sleeps
during the greater part of the day.  Its long claws, when not employed, are folded upon a thick
rough pad, which renders the exertion of walking less difficult. As, however, it is compelled
to step upon the outer edge of its fore-feet, it progresses in an awkward and painful manner,
and it cannot move for any length of time.  Its eye possesses a peculiarly cunning expression.

Of a peaceable and harmless disposition, the ant-bear, when not provoked, never attacks any
animal; but on the approach of an enemy, it assumes the defensive in such a way as to make
the boldest aggressor pause.  Resting on its left fore-foot, it strikes out its right with
a force sufficient to tear off the hide of the thickest-skinned assailant. When attacked from
behind, it turns round with the rapidity of lightning; and when assailed from several quarters
at once, it throws itself on its back, fighting desperately with both its fore-legs, and uttering
angry growls of defiance.  So thick is its hide, that no animal has been found with teeth capable
of piercing it; and even when the jaguar, pressed by hunger, dares to assail it, the monarch
of the American forest is often driven off, or left weltering in its blood from the wounds
inflicted by the formidable claws of the ant-bear.

When attacking an ant-castle, the tamanoir strikes a hole in the wall of clay with his powerful,
crooked claws.  The warrior-ants then issue out by thousands to resent the insult, while the
labourers retire to the inmost recesses.  The soldiers swarm on every part of their assailant,
but their sharp mandibles are unable to pierce its thick skin.  The bear then putting forth
its long tongue, which is lubricated from two large glands situated below its root, the insects
remain sticking in the glutinous liquid.  When a sufficient supply has been thus obtained,
it draws back its tongue within its mouth, and swallows the whole army at a gulp.

MYRMECOPHAGA TAMANDUA.

While the vast citadels of the white ant formed on the ground are attacked by the great ant-eater,
the too great increase of the arborial termites is kept under by three smaller species, formed
to live among the branches of the trees.

The tamandua is seen climbing the loftiest monarchs of the forest in search of its insect prey.
It is about the size of a cat.  Though its head is elongated, it is considerably less so than
that of the ant-bear; while its hair is short and silky, resembling fine wool.  The feet are
formed in the same manner as those of the larger animal, but, to enable it the better to climb
among the branches, it possesses a prehensile tail.

Though it cannot be said to possess a sweet tooth--as its mouth is as destitute of teeth as
that of the tamanoir--yet it does not confine its food to the termites alone, but seeks the
nests of the stingless bees, which form their hives among the loftiest branches of the forest,
and robs them of their honeyed treasures.

LITTLE ANT-EATER.

There is another curious little ant-eater, about the size of a squirrel,--which animal it resembles
very much in its habits, and somewhat in its appearance.  It possesses a prehensile tail, like
that of the ateles and other American monkeys, with which it can swing itself from branch to
branch.  The tail is covered with fur, with the exception of about three inches of the under
surface at the extremity.  It has a small head, the snout sharpened and bent slightly downwards.
A soft, curled, and pale yellow-brown fur clothes its body.  It has only two claws on each
of its fore-feet, the exterior one being stronger and larger than the interior.  With these
weapons it is enabled to hook out the small insects from the crevices of the bark, or grubs
from the nests of bees or wasps.  Like the squirrel, it sits upon its hind-limbs when eating,
supporting itself with its prehensile tail.  It may more properly be called the twisted-tail
ant-eater (Cyclothurus didactylus).

There is another small ant-eater found in Guiana, called the striped ant-eater (Myrmecophaga
striata), from the marks on its body.  Its general colour is of a tawny hue, the under parts
being white.  It is marked with broad, distinct, blackish transverse stripes, and the tail
is annulated with similar ones.  Its whole length, from the tip of its nose to the end of its
tail, is about twenty inches.  The snout is elongated, the upper mandible extending very little
beyond the lower.

THE SLOTH.

That shaggy-haired creature, which may be seen hanging from the boughs of the lofty cecropia--the
much-abused sloth--is generally described as a type of laziness, doomed to a helpless and wretched
existence; but such an animal the all-beneficent Creator has not placed on the earth. To each
animal that he has formed he has given an instinct and organisation specially adapted to their
mode of life and the part they are destined to perform in the economy of nature.  The sloth
is formed to pass its time in trees, and to feed on the superabundant leaves, which would otherwise
impede the circulation of the air, retard their growth, or bring on premature decay.  This
duty it shares with numberless other animals of the luxuriant forests of Tropical America.
Place the sloth out of its natural position, and, as would be the case with other animals,
it finds itself in a difficulty.  Its destiny is to live in the dense forest, where, the branches
of the trees meeting each other, it can move along from bough to bough, and make its way for
considerable distances without difficulty, or having to descend to the ground.  When by force
or accident placed on the ground, it is unable to move along except at a slow and toilsome
pace.  When by any chance thus seen, its arms appear much too long, while its hind-legs, which
are very short, look as if they could be bent almost to the shape of a cork-screw.  Both fore
and hind-legs, by their form, and the manner in which they are joined to the body, are incapable
of acting in a perpendicular direction, or in supporting its body.  Hence its belly touches
the ground.  Indeed, as its looks and gestures betoken its uncomfortable situation, and as
a sigh every now and then escapes it, it may be concluded that it actually is in pain."

Thus it is evident that the sloth is formed, not to live on the ground, but in trees; and on
further observation it will be seen that, unlike most other arborial animals, it lives, not
on the branches, but under them.  It moves, suspended from the branch; it rests, suspended
from the branch; and sleeps, suspended from the branch.

In proportion as the sloth's organisation unfits it for terrestrial progression, it is wonderfully
adapted for climbing trees.  With its long arms it reaches right up, and clings to the branches
with its long and crooked claws.  It has thus the power of grasping a tree which no other mammal
possesses.  It is indeed the best climber among mammals, while it is the only mammal that can
neither walk nor stand.

It is almost tailless.

The head of the sloth is short, the face small and round, the hair coarse and shaggy.  There
are several species, differing considerably in colour, but resembling in general dry, withered
grass, or moss.  The species vary in size from two feet to the size of a rabbit.  Its face
resembles the human countenance as much as that of the monkey, but with a very sad and melancholy
expression.  It brings forth its young and suckles them like ordinary quadrupeds.  The infant
sloth, from the moment of its birth, adheres to the body of its parent, until it acquires sufficient
size and strength to shift for itself.  Its cry is low and plaintive, resembling the sound
of "ai."  Hence the three-toed sloth has obtained the name of the ai.

Mr Bates says that the natives consider the sloth the type of laziness, and that it is very
common for one native to call another--reproaching him for idleness--"beast of the cecropia
tree;" the leaves of the cecropia being the food of the sloth.  "It is a strange sight," he
adds, "watching the creature's movements from branch to branch.  Every movement betrays not
indolence, but extreme caution.  It never loses its hold of one branch without catching the
next; and when it does not immediately find a branch to grasp with the rigid hooks which serve
it for paws, it raises its body, supported by its hind-legs and claws, and feels round in search
of a fresh foothold."  In one of their voyages, he and Mr Wallace saw a sloth (Bradypus infuscatus)
swimming across a river, at a place where it was probably three hundred yards broad.  It is
not generally known that this animal takes to the water.

THE TAPIR.

Throughout the densely-wooded regions on the banks of the rivers from Demerara, across the
Brazils, to Paraguay, the long-nosed tapir has its range.  It and the peccary are the only
two Pachydermata, or thick-skinned animals, indigenous to the southern continent.  It is considered
one of the links which connect the elephant and rhinoceros to the swine; its habits, indeed,
are somewhat similar to those animals.

Six feet in length, and four in height, it is the largest quadruped in South America.  In form
it is somewhat like the hog; but its snout is lengthened into a flexible proboscis, which resembles
the rudiment of the elephant's trunk, and serves for the same purpose--that of twisting round
the launches of trees and tearing off the leaves, on which it partly feeds.  Like the rhinoceros,
it delights in water, is a good swimmer and diver, and enjoys wallowing in the mud.

Though in its wild state its food consists of the shoots of trees, buds, wild fruits, gourds,
and melons, when in captivity it is an indiscriminate swallower of everything, filthy or clean.
During the day it remains concealed in the deep recesses of the forest, issuing out at night
to seek its food.  On its front feet are four toes, but there are only three on the hinder--their
tips cased in small hoofs.  The eyes are small and lateral, and the ears long and pointed.
The teeth are strong and powerful, to enable it to crush its food, or defend itself against
its enemies.  The hair, of a deep brown, approaching to black, is short, scanty, and closely
depressed to the surface; while it has little or no tail.  It possesses enormous muscular power;
and as its body is defended by a thick, tough hide, it can force its way through the dense
underwood where no other creature can penetrate.  Generally it moves in a trot, but when pursued
breaks into an awkward gallop, carrying its head downwards, like the hog.

Its chief enemy is the fierce jaguar, which, leaping on its back, endeavours to bring it to
the ground.  The tapir, on being seized, darts through the forest, attempting to destroy its
foe, and dislodge it from its back by rushing under the low boughs of the trees.  Should this
fail, and water be near, it quickly frees itself by diving down--as the jaguar, unable to dive,
must either let go its hold or be drowned.

Of a peaceful and harmless disposition, it never willingly attacks man or beast; but when hunted
and brought to bay, it will defend itself desperately, frequently inflicting, with its strong
teeth, severe wounds on its assailants.

THE PECCARY.

The only other pachydermatous animal besides the tapir indigenous to South America is the little
truculent peccary--a herd of which creatures is more feared by the natives than the jaguar,
boa, or anaconda.  There are two species--the Dicotyles tajacu and Dicotyles labiatus, or white-lipped
peccary; the latter being the larger and fiercer of the two.  The peccary is very like a small
hog.  Its form is short and compact, thickly covered with strong, dark-coloured bristles, except
the lower part of the body, which is nearly destitute of hair.  It has a somewhat large head,
short snout, and short, upright ears; while a fleshy protuberance is its representative for
a tail.  At the first glance it seems harmless enough, but inside its mouth are found some
short tusks, double-edged, and as sharp as lancets, with which the creature is capable of inflicting
the most deadly wounds.  It is remarkable for a glandular orifice at the lower part of the
back, surrounded by strong bristles.  From this gland exudes a strong-scented fluid; so that,
as soon as the creature is killed, it is necessary to cut it out, or the rest of the flesh
becomes so imbued as to make it unfit for food.

In its habits it is like the hog, and lives on the same kind of food, but its chief duty in
the economy of nature is that of destroying reptiles and snakes of all sorts,--particularly
the rattlesnake, which it attacks without the slightest hesitation; nor does it appear to suffer
in any way when bitten.  It gives voice with a sharp, shrill grunt; but when angry, it smartly
clashes its tusks together, making a sound heard at a considerable distance, and announcing
its approach.

The flesh is somewhat dry and insipid, and entirely destitute of fat. That of the female is
considered the best.

The larger species--the white-lipped peccary--is dreaded by the farmers, as it frequently,
in large numbers, attacks their crops, choosing always the most flourishing fields.

The peccary, though occasionally found by itself, is a gregarious animal.  A herd will attack
a jaguar or puma, and even the sturdy tapir, without fear; and rushing at their antagonist
with their sharp tusks, never fail to come off victorious.  Knowing their power, the jaguar,
when meeting a herd, flies through the forest to avoid them.  When the hunter and his dogs
encounter one of these armies, his only chance of escape is to climb the nearest tree, when
they can only stand below gnashing their teeth, and gazing up at him with their vindictive
little eyes.  His dogs, however, quickly fall victims to their fury.

On one occasion a party of hunters had brought a bear to bay, when, in the midst of the fierce
contest, a herd of peccaries came charging over the ground, putting not only the bear, but
the men and the dogs to flight.

The peccary will, indeed, attack man or beast without hesitation, its assaults being not the
less dangerous because it seems utterly ignorant of the danger it runs itself.  It is, however,
hunted by the natives for the sake of its flesh.  It frequently takes up its abode in some
forsaken burrow or the hollow of a tree.  The creatures back in, one after the other, till
there is no room for more.  The outer one then takes the post of sentinel, and gives notice
of the approach of any desirable quarry.  The hunters, aware of this habit, cautiously-- sometimes
with firearms and sometimes with pointed weapons--approach the peccaries' abode.  A slight
noise draws the sentinel from the hollow, when it is immediately shot down or transfixed by
a spear.  Another at once takes its place, coming out to see what is the matter, when it is
killed in the same way; and thus a whole family may be killed in detail.

HYDROCHAERUS CAPYBARA.

In all parts of the continent,--on the banks of the streams flowing through the Llanos of Venezuela,
as well as by the side of the La Plata and its tributaries,--the capybara, the largest rodent
in existence, may be seen, seated on its haunches, like others of its family.  It is of the
size of a moderately large hog about two years old.  It has a large head, and thick divided
nose, on each side of which are long whiskers. The ears are small and rounded; the eyes are
black and of considerable size; and the upper jaw much longer than the lower,--which gives
the face a curious appearance.  The body is thick, covered with short, coarse brown hair, and
destitute of a tail.  The neck is short, as are the legs--with remarkably long feet, which
are also very broad, the claws of a blunt form, and approximate in shape to the hoofs of the
Pachydermata.  They are partly webbed, and thus adapted to the aquatic life it enjoys, and
which has gained for it the name of the water-hog. Though it feeds on vegetables, it is also
fond of fish, to catch which it enters the water, swimming after them with the rapidity of
an otter. When seen at a distance as they run over the ground, from their colour they look
like pigs; but when seen seated on their haunches, attentively watching any object with one
eye, as is their habit, their true character is known.

Darwin describes his observing a party of several.

The capybara is classed with the Cavidae or guinea-pig tribe.  When not persecuted, it is very
tame; but in the regions frequented by the jaguar it becomes his easy and constant prey.  It
is of a mild disposition, and is sometimes tamed.  Its flesh is rather dry, and has a somewhat
musky flavour, but affords wholesome food to man.

AGOUTI DASYPROCTA.

Of agoutis there are several species.  The larger agouti, mara, or Patagonian cony--twice the
size of a hare--are seen three or four together, hopping quickly one after the other in a straight
line across the Pampas.  It is somewhat like a hare, but has the external covering of a hog,
its long coat concealing its little stump of a tail.  It has also the hog's voracious appetite.

It is fond of occupying the burrows of the bizcacha when it finds them, but when they do not
exist it is compelled to make a house for itself. It here stores away the food it does not
require for present use.  When eating, it sits up like the squirrel, using its fore-paws to
convey the food to its mouth.  Its hind-legs being very long, it leaps over the ground at considerable
speed.  As it is very fond of the sugar-cane, wherever plantations exist it is hunted without
mercy, and driven from the district.

The smaller agouti, rather less than a rabbit, generally inhabits forest districts; and as
it is there a nocturnal animal, it spends the chief part of the day in its hiding-place--usually
the cleft of a rock or the hollow of a decaying tree--twenty or thirty creatures congregating
together.  Here their nests are formed of soft leaves, where the young are placed till they
are able to accompany their parents on their predatory expeditions.  It is a gentle little
creature, and when caught, instead of attempting to bite, only gives vent to a piteous cry.

The larger agouti, or mara, is sometimes classed between the agoutis and the pacas.  It is
more easily tamed than the smaller species, and the fur is handsomer--of black, white, and
golden brown.

THE PACA (COELOGENYS).

The paca--another rodent--is remarkable for its enormously-developed cheek-bone, and for the
thick pouch which it possesses.  Like its big relation, the capybara, it always takes up its
abode in the neighbourhood of water.  It forms a burrow so near the surface, that a person
walking over it suddenly steps through.  It generally makes three openings, which it covers
with dry leaves and branches.  The Indian easily discovers the entrances, when he closes up
two of the apertures, and watches till the paca ventures out of the third.  The little animal,
however, defends itself bravely, and will severely bite its assailant.

It is of a thick, clumsy form, measuring about two feet in length from the tip of the nose
to the extremity of the body, and about one foot in height.  The hinder limbs are long, the
front ones much bent.  Its feet are armed with thick, strong, conical claws, suitable for digging.

Though a clumsy-looking creature, it can run and jump with great activity.  It makes a noise
somewhat like the grunting of a young pig. It lives upon fruits and tender plants, going out
from its hole to forage at night, but generally remaining concealed during the daytime. When
alarmed it readily takes to the water, and dives and swims remarkably well.

Bates describes a tame cutea, or an agouti, which he found feeding in the neighbourhood of
a village, nibbling the fallen fruits of the inaja-palm.  On his trying to catch it, instead
of betaking itself, as he thought it would, to the thicket, it ran on to the house of its owners,
which was at a distance of about two hundred yards.

The paca and agouti belong to the peculiar family of the rodent order confined to South America,
and which connects the Rodentia to the Pachydermata--the order to which the elephant, horse,
and hog belong.

The fossil toxodon resembled the Rodentia in its dentition, and, at the same time, was nearly
related to the elephant.  These facts make it probable that these animals are living representatives
of a group which existed at a distant epoch of the world's history, and which possessed a structure
partaking of the character of the two great orders--Rodentia and Pachydermata--now so widely
distinct in the majority of forms.

THE ARMADILLO.

In days gone by, huge monsters--their backs covered with bony armour-- ten feet and upwards
in length, some perhaps of the bulk of the rhinoceros, crawled along the plains of South America.
They have become creatures of the past, and their places have been taken by others of a similarly
curious formation, of which even the giant armadillo, when compared to them, is a mere pigmy.
These creatures abound in all parts of the continent, from Paraguay to Venezuela; but, incased
as they are in coats of complete armour, and running so quickly, and so rapidly digging into
the earth, they can rarely be overtaken by the hunter.

The armadillo (Dasypus) belongs to the order of Edentata.  The armour, which covers the whole
body, consists of a triangular plate on the top of the head, a large buckler over the shoulders,
and a similar one covering the haunches; while between the solid portions a series of transverse
bands intervene in such a manner as to allow the creature to move its body in a variety of
postures.  The tail is likewise covered with a series of calcareous rings.  It can, in consequence
of this peculiar conformation of its covering, roll itself up, like the hedgehog, into a ball,
and thus present a solid surface, impervious to the attacks of birds of prey or small quadrupeds.
The part over the shell is covered with short hairs, which appear between the joints of the
armour.  It has a pointed snout, long ears, thick, short limbs, and powerful claws.  With these
claws it burrows with extraordinary rapidity, and can inflict severe wounds.

The common armadillo, or the poyou, is about twenty inches in length, including the tail. 
As its hearing is very acute, and it never ventures far from its home during the daytime, it
easily escapes the attacks of its foes, with the exception of man.  It readily takes to the
water when pursued, and swims well, but does not enter it by choice.  The Indian hunter, however,
attacks the creature with a skill it cannot escape.

It is a curious fact that mosquitoes often inhabit the burrows of the armadillo.  The Indian,
knowing this, as soon as he finds a burrow, puts a short stick down it.  If a number of insects
come out, he knows there is an animal within.  When he finds no mosquitoes, he is sure there
is no armadillo.  If he is satisfied that the armadillo is at home, he cuts a long, slender
stick, and introduces it into the hole, carefully observing the line which it takes, and then
sinks a pit in the sand to catch the end of it.  This done, he puts it further into the hole,
and digs another pit; till he at last comes up with the poor armadillo-- which has been making
a passage in the sand, till, from its exertions, it has lost all its strength.

The armadillo feeds on all vegetable or animal matter not too hard for its sharp teeth.  It
is especially useful in devouring the offal or the putrid carcasses of animals which might
otherwise affect the air.  In spite of this coarse style of feeding, its flesh is esteemed
by the natives--who for the sake of it perseveringly hunt the poor creature throughout the country.

The species are distinguished from one another chiefly by the number of bands on the trunk
of the body, between the shield on the fore-shoulders, and that on the rump.  Baron Cuvier,
however, divides the whole genus into five small groups,--distinguishing one from another by
the number and form of their teeth and claws.

The great armadillo (Dasypus gigas) has enormous claws and unequal toes, with twenty-four broad
teeth on both sides of its jaws.  It measures, exclusive of the tail, nearly three feet in length.

Darwin describes another, living on very dry soil, the pechy (Dasypus minutus), which wanders
by day over the open plains, and feeds on beetles, leaves, roots, and even small snakes.  So
rapidly does it burrow, that scarcely is one seen before its hind-quarters disappear in the
sand.  It likewise tries to escape notice by squatting down close to the ground.

THE OPOSSUM.

There are numerous species of opossum, most of them marsupial, in the Brazils, where they take
the place of the shrews of Europe.  They are very destructive to poultry.  One of the species
is aquatic, and has webbed feet.  The terrestrial species are nocturnal.  They sleep during
the day in the hollows of trees, and come forth at night to prey on birds in their roosting-places.
Some live entirely on trees.

THE CRAB-EATING OPOSSUM.

The crab-eating opossum is a curious creature, about ten inches in length; with a prehensile
tail, fifteen inches long, in addition.  It has a somewhat pointed nose, and a darkish fur.
When born, the young are transferred by the mother to her cradle pouch, where they live for
some weeks before they are sufficiently developed to venture abroad.

The creature is formed especially for living among the trees, about which it moves with the
activity of a monkey.  It advances carefully, always entwining its tail round one branch before
venturing on to another.

The crabs and other crustaceans on which it lives--from which circumstance it obtains its name--are
found on low marshy soils, in the neighbourhood of which these species exist.

MERIAN'S OPOSSUM.

A still more curious creature is Merian's opossum (Philander dorsigerus).  It has no true pouch,
and the mother, therefore, while her young are in their infancy, carries them on her back.
From this circumstance the name of dorsigerus, or back-bearing, has been given to it.  They
cling to her fur with their little hand-like feet, while they twine their tails round hers,
which she places over her back in a convenient position for that purpose.  Other species of
opossums carry their young in the same manner,--some even which are furnished with well-developed
pouches.

YAPOCK OPOSSUM.

The little yapock opossum is a representative of the aquatic species (Cheironectes yapock).
It is of a fawn-grey tint, with dark black marks.  It measures in length about ten inches,
with a tail of twelve or fifteen inches.  The hind-feet are furnished with a membraneous web,
which connects the toes together, and serves as a paddle.  The fore-paws possess great grasping
powers, and have a hand-like appearance.  The ears are small, sharp, and pointed, and the head
tapering.  It possesses also large cheek-pouches, similar in their use to those of monkeys.
It is thus enabled to stow away the creatures it catches on its aquatic excursions, and to
keep them there till it returns to the shore to dine. It feeds principally on fish, crustaceans,
and aquatic insects.  So similar is it in its habits to the otter, that it is frequently described
as one, and has been called the Demerara otter; but it is in reality a true opossum.

BATS.

No animal's physiognomy can be more hideous, when seen from the front, than the countenance
of the largest South American vampire-bat.  Fancy a creature measuring twenty-eight inches
in expanse of wing, its large leathery ears standing out from the sides and top of the head,
and an erect spur-shaped appendage on the tip of the nose,--the grin, and the glistening black
eye, all combining to make up a figure which reminds one of some mocking imp of fable.  No
wonder that imaginative people have conferred diabolical instincts on so ugly an animal.

Ugly as is the broad leaf-nosed family of bats, it is in reality the least harmless.  The little
grey Phyllostoma is the guilty blood-sucker which visits sleepers and bleeds them in the night.
It is of a dark grey colour, striped with white down the back, and having a leaf-like fleshy
expansion on the tip of the nose.  Although they undoubtedly attack sleeping people, yet they
appear to be somewhat partial as to the individuals they select.  Bates, when sleeping in a
room up the Amazon, long unused, was awoke at midnight by a rushing noise made by vast hosts
of bats sweeping round him.  The air was alive with them.  They had put out the lamp, and when
he relighted it the place appeared black with the impish multitudes that were whirling round
and round.  After he had laid about him well with a stick for a few minutes they disappeared
among the tiles; but when all was quiet again, they returned once more and extinguished the
light.  The next night several got into his hammock, and on waking in the morning he found
a wound, evidently caused by one of them, on his hip.  There were altogether four species.
One of them (the Dysopes perotis) has enormously large ears, and measures two feet from tip
to tip of the wings.  The natives, however, assured him that it was the phyllostoma which had
inflicted the wound, and they asserted that it is the only kind which attacks man.  But Mr
Bates considers that several kinds of bats have this propensity.

Darwin, when travelling in Chili, noticing that one of the horses was very restive, went to
see what was the matter; and fancying that he could distinguish something, put his hands on
the beast's withers, and discovered a vampire-bat.  In the morning, the place where the wound
had been inflicted was easily distinguished by being slightly swollen and bloody.

Waterton describes the mode in which the vampire-bat makes the orifice through which to suck
its victim's blood.  It does so by pressing gently the point of its sharp projecting teeth,
noiselessly circling round, and making them act the part of a centre-bit,--performing the operation
so quietly that no pain is felt.  He says, however, that at times they commit a good deal of
mischief.  A young Indian boy suffered greatly by being frequently attacked; and the son of
an English gentleman was bitten so severely on the forehead, that the wound bled freely on
the following morning.  The fowls also suffered so terribly that they died fast; and an unfortunate
jackass on whom they had set their fancy was almost killed by inches.

The vampire rises in the air by means of a wide flattened membrane connecting the whole of
the limbs and tail, the thumb of the fore-paws and the hind-feet alone being left free.  This
membrane, though wonderfully delicate, is furnished with minute blood-vessels.  It also possesses
a system of nerves of the most exquisite power of sensation, which enables it to fly rapidly
among the boughs and foliage, avoiding all impediments even in the darkest hours of night.
The vampire can run along the ground and climb trees by means of the sharp hooks on the fore-paws.
They sleep, however, like ordinary bats, hanging by their hind-feet--being thus able at a moment's
notice to take to flight.

Of the other species, some have the fur of a blackish colour, some of a ruddy hue.

When flying, the larger ones wheel heavily round and round, somewhat in the manner of a pigeon,
so that they may easily be mistaken for birds. Although they live largely on insects, they
also greedily devour fruits; indeed, some species live chiefly on them.  Bates opened the stomach
of several, and found them to contain a mass of pulp and seeds of fruit, mingled with a few
remains of night insects.  On comparing the seeds taken from their stomachs with those of cultivated
trees, he found that they were unlike any of them: he concludes, therefore, that they resort
to the forest to feed, coming only to human habitations in the morning to sleep, where they
find themselves more secure from animals of prey than in their natural abodes in the woods.

PART THREE, CHAPTER TWELVE.

QUADRUMANA.

MONKEYS.

The American monkeys consist of two chief families,--the Cebidae, and the Midas or Marmosets--which
are again separated into thirteen genera, consisting of about eighty-six species, greatly diversified
among themselves.  In America neither Pithecidae or Lemurs are found: they exclusively inhabit
the Old World.

The Cebidae have thirty-six teeth; the Marmosets possess but thirty-two: three of them, however,
are pre-molar, as are three of those of the Cebidae, thus distinguishing them both from all
the forms of the Old World.

The Marmosets are a low type of apes--their brain being smooth, and they having claws instead
of nails; but from their intelligent-looking countenances, and their gentle, playful disposition,
they appear to have as much sense as the larger apes.

The American monkeys differ greatly in size and form.  The largest--the savage black howler--is
nearly two feet and a half in length of trunk; while the beautiful timid marmoset is so small
that it may be inclosed in the two hands.  Some have tails twice the length of their bodies;
the caudal appendages of others appear to have been docked, or are altogether absent.  The
long tails of some are prehensile, and have a smooth surface, which enables them to employ
it as a fifth hand; others are covered with thick bushy hair, and are employed apparently only
in balancing the animal.  When night comes they roll themselves into a ball, huddled together
as close as may be, to keep themselves warm. Sometimes it happens that a few little monkeys
have not been alert enough to get into the ball, and are left shivering outside.  They keep
up a pitiful howling the whole night through.

One family--the Marmosets--have, as has been remarked, claws instead of nails.  Others are
covered with short, coarse hair; while others, again, have coats of a long, soft silky texture.

Some sport among the branches, seeking their food in the daytime; others, again, only come
forth from the hollows of trees, where they have their beds during the night season--their
eyes being formed, like those of owls, incapable of meeting the glare of day.

It is remarkable that the smallest of all--the Hapali pygmaeus, measuring only seven inches
in length of body--is among the most widely dispersed, having found its way into Mexico: the
only monkey known to have wandered far from the great river-plain.

All the monkeys of the New World are arborial; as, indeed, are many of the animals which, in
other parts of the world, live entirely on the ground.  They are mostly furnished with long,
prehensile tails.  Some have the under part of the extremity perfectly smooth, so as to serve
the purpose of a fifth hand, by which the creatures can swing themselves from bough to bough,
and hold on securely while their four hands are actively employed.  On passing through an Amazonian
forest, sometimes the branches of the trees are seen alive with active little creatures swinging
backwards and forwards, climbing up the sipos with the agility of seamen on the rigging of
a ship, scampering along the boughs, playing all sorts of antics, or engaged in plucking the
juicy fruit or hard nuts to be found in ample abundance, even on the tallest monarchs of the woods.

SPIDER-MONKEYS.

Among the most curious of the monkey tribe are the ateles, or spider-monkeys,--called also
Cebidae, and, by the natives sapajous, one of the species of the coaita, or quata.  As they
are seen gambolling among the trees, with their long limbs, and still longer tails, ever actively
employed, their resemblance to huge spiders is remarkable.  Not that the creature is always
in a state of activity, for it will often sit swinging slowly backwards and forwards, or place
itself in the oddest of attitudes without moving a limb, as if resting after its exertions,
or, in a contemplative mood, watching the proceedings in the world below.  Sometimes a whole
colony may thus be seen, when the native huntsman, approaching with his deadly blow-pipe, can
without difficulty pick them off one by one, and secure his prey.  But let them be alarmed,
and away they go through the forest, swinging themselves from bough to bough, at a rate which
no other creature, without wings, can exceed.

In the spider-monkeys, the tail, as a prehensile organ, reaches its highest degree of perfection,
and they may therefore be considered as the extreme development of the American type of apes.
Their tails are endowed with the most wonderful degree of flexibility.  They are always in
motion--except when the animal is perfectly at rest--coiling and uncoiling themselves, like
the trunks of elephants, seeking to grasp, apparently, whatever comes within their reach.

The coaita can apply its tail to all sorts of uses.  So delicate is its touch, that one would
almost think it possessed the power of sight. Should it discover a nest of eggs or any creature
in a crevice too small for its paw to enter, it inserts the end of its tail and hooks out the
tit-bit.

The animal is of considerable size, and is covered with coarse black hair--with the exception
of the face, parts of which are of a tawny flesh-coloured hue.  There are various species,
each of which has its peculiar district; and they vary slightly in appearance.

In the neighbourhood of Obydos, the Ateles paniscus has its abode; while in the Upper Amazon
the white-whiskered coaita (Ateles marginatus) takes its place.  It is remarkable that animals
which apparently have the means of moving without difficulty at a rapid rate in any direction
should thus be confined to particular localities.

THE CHEMECK.

The chemeck appears to have a wider range.  It possesses a thumb, slightly projecting, and
furnished with a nail--though the thumb cannot be used like that of a human being, as it is
incapable of being opposed to the fingers.  It is a gentle creature, and capable of considerable
cultivation.  Although playfully inclined, it is seldom spiteful; while its disposition is
very different from that exhibited by the capricious temper of the Old World monkeys.  It soon
learns to distinguish its friends; and will playfully pretend to attack them, but never does
any real harm.  It is covered with a long fur, which falls densely over the body; as is its
tail, which at once distinguishes it from its relatives. The ear is somewhat similar to that
of man, but has no lower lobe.  The nostrils open at the sides, and are separated by a wide
piece of cartilage.  The habits, however, of the ateles, are so similar, that they require
no separate description.

Wandering through the forest with an Indian guide, we reach an igarape or stream, where the
lofty branches of the trees do not completely meet overhead, but where the opening is as yet
of no great width.  Lying concealed, we hear a strange chattering and rustling among the foliage
in the distance.  Pieces of rotten wood, husks, and nuts come dropping down, and we may see
the boughs alive with numberless dark-haired little creatures, their long lithe tails twisting
and twirling, their active limbs stretched out in all directions, as they make their way through
the forest.  We recognise them as a troop of ateles, migrating to some other district, or on
some expedition in search of food.

On reaching the boughs above the banks of the stream, they seem somewhat puzzled.  Several
of the elders of the tribe go to the outer ends of the boughs, and appear to be measuring the
distance across.  As they have an especial dislike to wetting their hairy skins--although they
would undoubtedly swim if no other means could be found of getting to the opposite bank--they
have devised a method more suited to their tastes. They leap from bough to bough, till they
find one projecting in a line with the trunk or branch of any tree inclining over the water
from the opposite side.  The larger and stronger members of the tribe now assemble, leaving
the younger ones to gambol and frisk about among the boughs, and amuse themselves in juvenile
monkey fashion.  One monkey-- the Hercules probably of the tribe--twisting his tail round the
outer end of the branch, now hangs by it with his head downwards, at his full length.  Another
descends by the body of the first, round which he coils his tail.  A third adds another link
to the chain: and thus, one by one they increase its length, till the surface of the water
is almost reached.  The chain now begins to oscillate backwards and forwards towards the opposite
bank, each movement increasing the length of the arc, till the lower monkey, with fore-arms
outstretched, reaches the stem of the tree on the opposite bank.  He grasps it tightly, gradually
clambering up, and drawing the line composed of his comrades after him, till the monkey immediately
below him is also able to seize the trunk, and assist in dragging up the rest.  They thus form
an almost horizontal bridge above the water.  The rest of the agile tribe, now summoned from
their sports, begin to cross; the younger ones, in the exuberance of their spirits, taking
the opportunity of playing all sorts of pranks during their passage over the bodies of their
self-sacrificing elders-- giving many a sly pinch of the ear, or pull of the hair, for which
they well know they cannot at the moment receive punishment.  Thus the whole party--the mothers
with their infants on their backs, and the other juvenile members--cross in safety, and assemble
among the branches to watch the further proceedings.

The great difficulty now appears to be for the individuals composing the bridge to get across
without touching the water.  Trusting to the muscular power of their tails and limbs, they
appear in no way daunted. The monkeys which have hitherto formed the lower links of the chain,
still holding on by their tails to their friends, work their way up the trunk and along a branch
of equal or greater height than that on the opposite side, to which the long-enduring Hercules
has hitherto clung. On their attaining the point selected, he at length unwinds his tail, and
swings downwards--with a force which seems sufficient to dislocate the limbs of those holding
on above--and now becomes the lowest in the line.  The force with which he has descended enables
him to swing towards the side which his comrades have reached, and to grasp the trunk, up which
he also climbs, till his neighbour can catch hold of it. He follows his example, till all,
one after the other, have grasped it: and thus they perform an operation which the most renowned
of human athletes would find it difficult to imitate.

A troop will cross a gap in the forest in the same way, rather than venture down from the leafy
heights they find it safest to occupy.  When compelled to descend to the ground, they scuttle
over it in the most awkward manner--their long limbs straggling out, and their tails in vain
seeking some object to grasp.  On these occasions the spider-monkey turns its hind-feet inwards,
and thus walks on the outer sides, while the fore-paws are twisted outward; thus throwing the
whole of its weight upon their inner edges.  It is when thus seen that the appropriateness
of the name given to it is more especially observed.  When hard-pressed, however, the knowing
little animal, finding no bough round which to coil its tail, rears itself up on its hind-limbs,
and balances itself by curling up its tail in the form of the letter S, as high as its head;
thus--by altering the centre of gravity--being enabled to got over the ground in a posture
such as no other member of its tribe can maintain. It will thus run on towards some friendly
stem or low-hanging bough, which it seizes with its lithe and prehensile limb, and joyfully
swings itself up in its usual monkey fashion, quickly disappearing amid the foliage.

The ordinary size of the coaita's body is about a foot from the nose to the root of the tail,
while the tail itself is rather more than two feet in length.

MACACO BARRIGUDO.

Seated among the boughs may often be seen, in the forests of the Upper Amazon, a number of
large, stout-bodied, fat-paunched monkeys, with long flexible tails, furnished underneath with
a naked palm, like the hand, for grasping.  Their faces are black and wrinkled, their foreheads
low, and eyebrows projecting; their features bearing a wonderful resemblance to those of weather-beaten
old negroes.  The heads of some are covered with black hair, and others with grey.  They are
called by the Portuguese macacos barrigudos, or big-bellied monkeys.  They belong to the species
of Lagothrix, and are closely allied to the coaitas.  They are bulky fellows, and though able,
by means of their prehensile tails, to get along at a good rate among the boughs, seldom trouble
themselves to move rapidly.

With the exception of the black howler, which will be described anon, they are the largest
monkeys in America--their bodies measuring about twenty-eight inches in height.  Their flesh
being highly esteemed by the natives, they are unceasingly hunted by the Indians.  Though their
manners are somewhat grave, yet, from their mild and confiding temper similar to that of the
coaitas--they are much sought after for pets. They live exclusively on fruits.

THE UAKARI.

On the western side of the River Yapura, near where it pours its waters into the Amazon--a
forest region inundated during the greater part of the year--there lives in small troops, high
up among the crowns of the lofty trees,--where it feeds on fruits of various descriptions,--a
small, almost tailless monkey, its face glowing with the most vivid scarlet hue.  Its body,
about eighteen inches in height, exclusive of limbs, is clothed from head to tail with very
long, straight, shining, whitish hair.  Its head, nearly bald, is sprinkled over with a short
crop of thin grey hair; whilst round its ruddy countenance, bushy whiskers, of a sandy colour,
meet under the chin.  It has reddish-yellow eyes.  It belongs to the Cebidae family.  The Indians
call it the white uakari.  It inhabits, as far as is known, no other district.

In spite of its want of tail, it is an active little creature, running up and down the larger
branches, but seldom leaping from one to the other.  The mothers, as is the custom with the
other monkey orders, carry their young on their back.  They are highly valued as pets; but
being of a delicate constitution, seldom live long when transported from their native district.

The native hunter, on wishing to obtain one of these creatures alive, goes forth with his blow-pipe,
and arrows tipped with diluted wourali poison.  This poison, though producing so deadly an
effect on animals, as well as human beings who exist without salt, appears to have little or
no effect on salt-consuming Europeans.  Salt, indeed, is the great antidote to the poison.
The hunter, in consequence, supplies himself with a small quantity of salt.  As soon as he
has shot a monkey, he follows it through the forest, till, the poison beginning to take effect,
it falls exhausted into his arms.  He then immediately puts a pinch of salt in its mouth, and
in a short time the creature revives, and is led away captive.  If old, however, when thus
caught, it appears to be discontented in confinement, and, seldom becoming tame, in a short
time pines away and dies.  When a young one is thus caught, it frequently becomes a playful
and interesting pet, and is highly valued by the Brazilians.

Further to the west, an allied species of this monkey is found, clothed with red instead of
white hair; while, at a still greater distance, a black-faced and grey-haired species takes
the place of the two former.

ALOUATTES, OR HOWLERS.

The voyager up the Amazon, or one of its numerous tributaries, when his montaria has been moored
to the banks, a fire lighted to keep prowling jaguars or pumas at a respectful distance, his
hammock hung up in his temporary hut, and he is expecting to enjoy a quiet night's rest, is,
ere long, often awoke by the sound of the most fearful howling proceeding from the recesses
of the forest.  Nothing can be more dismal or dispiriting than the fearful uproar.  Hour after
hour it goes on during the night, increasing as the dawn approaches.  Now the howls come from
one direction, now from another, and in far-off parts of the forest.  Yet, terrific as they
appear, they are produced by animals not much larger than a full-grown fox.  It is the mycetes,
or ursine howler--the largest monkey of South America.

On advancing into the forest in the morning, three or four may be seen seated on the upper
branches of a tree--shaggy-haired animals, with long prehensile tails like those of the spider-monkeys--hideous-looking
creatures, with pyramidical heads, the upper jaw descending much below the cranium, while the
branches of the lower one ascend very high, for the purpose of containing a bony, drum-shaped
expansion of the larynx, which gives to its voice that prodigious volume of sound which makes
night hideous.

They differ somewhat in colour.  Some are entirely black, others brownish-black, while the
Mycetes ursinus is of a shiny yellow.

These unmusical howlings are supposed by some naturalists to be merely the nocturnal serenades
of lover mycetes addressed to their mistresses, seated high on the branches in some distant
part of the forest; others regard them rather as noises which serve to intimidate their enemies,
though not emitted in general for any sudden alarm.

The female howler carries its young on its back.  It is the least attractive in appearance
of its western brethren, and is the only one of the monkey tribe which the natives are unable
to tame.  Though often caught, they do not survive many weeks in captivity.  It lives on fruits
and nuts, and is hunted for the sake of its flesh, which, though rather dry, is much esteemed.
The natives entrap this monkey in a curious fashion.  They take a large nut, and scraping out
the interior, leave only a small mouth, and, filling it with sugar, leave it near the trees
inhabited by the mycetes.  The inquisitive monkey soon descends to examine the nut, and putting
in his hand, grasps the sweet contents. Knowing that it is well-suited to his taste, he will
not let go, but runs off with his prize, which greatly impedes his progress.  Although he might
easily draw out his hand by opening it, this he does not think of doing; and thus, unable at
the best to move rapidly over a level surface, is soon overtaken by the hunter, and captured.

THE CUXIO (BEARDED SAKI).

Among the host of curiously-shaped, long-tailed, active little monkeys which inhabit the American
forests, the cuxio is one of the most remarkable.  Its general colour is a grizzly-brown; but
the head, limbs, and tail, are black.  As the passer-by sees the odd little creature gazing
down on him, he might fancy that it had just escaped from the hands of the perruquier.  The
black hair of its head is parted carefully on either side.  Its enormous black beard seems
as if just freshly dressed; while its bushy tail looks as if equally cared for. Notwithstanding
its somewhat fierce and Turk-like visage, it lives a respectable, domestic life, with one partner
alone--the sharer of its home--engaged in the task of rearing its infant progeny.

She is not of so dark a colour as her mate, her hair being chiefly of a rusty-brown.

The odd little creature's head is of a round form, and considerable size, greatly increased
in appearance by the amount of hair which surrounds it.  The nostrils are wide, and divided
by an unusually large cartilage.  It is furnished with large jaws, and teeth so sharp that
it has been seen to drive them, when angry, into a thick plank.  When in a rage it grinds them
together, and, rubbing its long beard in a most curious way, leaps about in every direction.
At the slightest cause of offence, it gives a savage grin, wrinkling the skin of its face and
jaws, and threatening the offender with the most menacing grimaces.

It seems perfectly conscious of the unusual adornment of its head, treasuring its bushy beard
with as much care and pride as does a human exquisite.  When drinking, it dips its paw, curved
into the shape of a spoon, into the water, and thus brings the liquid to its mouth.  The natives
declare that it does so to avoid the risk of wetting its long beard, of which--being generally
destitute of such appendages themselves--they fancy it must be excessively vain.  As it is
chiefly nocturnal in its habits, it might be classed among the Nyctipitheci, or night monkeys.
From its fierce countenance, long, sharp teeth, and savage temper, it has gained its second
scientific name--Brachyuras Satanus.

THE CACAJAO.

The cacajao is a curious contrast to the cuxio.  It is called also the black-headed saki. 
Unlike most of its brethren, it has but a short, hairy tail, looking as if it had been docked.
The head is perfectly black, somewhat flattened at the temples, with large ears approaching
in shape to those of the human head, and devoid of hair.  The fur on the body is generally
of a bright yellowish-brown.  When full-grown, the animal reaches to upwards of twenty inches
in length, while the tail is from three to five inches long.  Its legs are covered with rough
hair, and its fingers are unusually long and slender, giving it an awkward appearance when
feeding.  In captivity it is a docile and peculiarly timid animal.  A little creature which
had been caught exhibited great alarm at the appearance of several small monkeys of its own
country; and when a serpent was placed before its eyes, it trembled violently.

It is found on the borders of the Negro, where it is known by several names--among others,
as the mono faio, or ugly monkey.

MARMOSETS, OR MIDAS MONKEYS.

The most active, playful, and amusing of animals are the midas monkeys, which form the second
family of American Quadrumana, several species of which exist, each in its respective district.
As they are seen gambolling among the branches,--now running round and round the trunk of a
perpendicular tree, now with their sharp claws rapidly mounting the branches, sending down
showers of rotten bark and twigs, and uttering sharp twittering cries,--they might be mistaken
for a troop of squirrels.

They are restless, inquisitive little creatures, possessed of a large share of curiosity. 
When a stranger is passing through the forest, they invariably stop for a few moments to have
a stare at him.

Though in no way related to squirrels, which belong to the rodent order, they may easily be
mistaken for them at a distance.  They are all of small size, and very similar, in their mode
of climbing, to squirrels. Their nails, also, except those of the hind-thumbs, are long and
claw-shaped; and the thumbs of the fore extremities, or hands, are not opposable to the other
fingers.  Their bodies are long and slender, clothed with soft hair; and their tails, though
not prehensile, are nearly twice the length of their bodies.

MIDAS URSULUS.

The midas ursulus is found in the Lower Amazon, frequently in the neighbourhood of towns, and
it seems much less afraid of man than most other monkeys.  It is seldom that more than three
or four individuals are seen together.  It moves generally among the larger boughs and trunks
of trees, its long nails assisting it to cling securely to the bark.

It lives on both animal and vegetable food; the former including various insects, eggs, and
occasionally a young bird--while its vegetable diet consists of all the sweetest fruits it
can find.  The smaller insects-- flies, and other soft-bodied creatures--it pops into its mouth
whole; but when eating a larger one--such as a cockroach--it nips off the head, wings, and
legs, before putting it into its mouth.

It has gained the name of oustiti, in consequence of its giving vent to a little sharp whistle
when alarmed or irritated; but it otherwise generally preserves silence.

The midas ursulus is about nine inches long; and the tail measures fifteen inches.  It is clothed
in a thick, long fur, and has a reddish-brown streak down the middle of the back.

It is often seen in the houses at Para, and when treated kindly becomes very tame and familiar.
When, however, strangers approach it, its dark, watchful eyes, expressive of distrust, observe
every movement which takes place.

MIDAS LEONINAS, OR JACCHUS ROSALIA.

Another species, the Midas leoninas, or Jacchus Rosalia, inhabits the Upper Amazon.  It is
only seven inches in length.  It is so named on account of the long brown mane which hangs
from the neck, and gives it very much the appearance of a diminutive lion.

One of these little creatures, kept tame, became familiar with every one, and used to climb
up the chairs, over their shoulders and heads, just as a squirrel does.  Mr Bates relates that
one he met with, having reached his shoulder, looked into his face, showing his little teeth,
and chattering, as though it would say, "Well, and how do you do?"  It exhibited more affection
towards its master than to strangers, and would climb up to his head a dozen times in an hour,
and make great show of searching for certain animalcule.

Audubon the naturalist possessed a little creature of this species, which could distinguish
different objects depicted in an engraving.  On showing it the portrait of a cat and a wasp,
it became much terrified; but when the figure of a grasshopper or beetle was placed before
it, it precipitated itself on the picture, as if to seize them.

Another, which belonged to a lady, used, when angry, to pull at her hair, and nibble the ends
of her ringlets.  It also possessed the accomplishment of being able to stand on its head.

It is certainly one of the most beautiful of its tribe.  It is covered with long glossy locks
of a bright and lustrous chestnut, having a golden sheen, almost varying in texture with the
fine fibres of unwoven silk.  The colour darkens somewhat on the paws.  The fur is everywhere
long, but on the head and shoulders it is of extraordinary length in proportion to the size
of the animal, which has thus gained a name very inappropriate to its disposition, as it is
an especially timid little creature, and unable to do battle with any foe.  It is, however,
so active and clever in hiding itself, that it is enabled to escape from its enemies.  When
pleased, its voice is soft and gentle; but when angry or terrified, it utters a somewhat sharp
hiss.

MIDAS ARGENTATUS.

Among the rarest of the tribe is the Midas argentatus, measuring only seven inches in length
of body.  It resembles a little white kitten,-- being covered with long white silky hair. 
The tail, however, is blackish, and the face nearly naked and flesh-coloured.  The eyes, which
are black, are full of curiosity and mistrust; and one seen in captivity--except when in the
arms of its owner--shrank back and trembled with fear, while its teeth chattered, and it uttered
a tremulous, frightened tone, at the approach of a stranger.

SAI CAPICINUS.

The most attractive little creatures in the American forests are the capucins, the best-known
of which is the Sai capucinus.  Their tails, though covered with hair, are prehensile.  They
are active and lively in the extreme, leaping about from bough to bough, and eagerly watching
all that goes forward in the world below.  There are several species of similar habits, their
quaint ways and general intelligence making them all great favourites when tamed.  They live
chiefly on vegetable food, but they devour insects and eggs, and do not object to a bird when
they can manage to catch one.

HORNED CAPUCIN.

The horned capucin, or sapajou (Cebus fatuellus), is remarkable for two points of hair which
stand out from the forehead, and give it the appearance of having horns.  The colour is sometimes
of a deep brown, and at others of a purple-black, while occasionally it has a chestnut tint.

THE COMMON CAPUCIN.

The hair of the common capucin is of a golden olive, with white fur bordering the face.

These curious little creatures are noted for forming a friendship with other animals when in
captivity.  Baron Humboldt mentions one which used to mount on the back of a pig every morning,
and continued sitting there during the whole of the day; and even when the pig went out feeding
on the campos, it still kept its seat, riding back again in the evening to its home.  Others
have been known to choose cats for their steeds, and perseveringly to keep their hold in spite
of their active movements-- seeming to enjoy them as much as the llanero does those of a colt
he is engaged in breaking-in.

PARAUACU.

On the dry lands to the north of the Upper Amazon, a little timid inoffensive monkey is found
with a long bear-like coat of speckled grey hair.  The long fur hangs over its head, half concealing
a pleasing diminutive face; the tail--to the very tip--which is of some length, is also completely
covered.

PITHECIA HIRSUTA--PITHECIA ALBICANS.

There are two more species--the Pithecia hirsute and the Pithecia albicans.  They are especially
capable of attachment to those who treat them kindly.  Being somewhat dull and cheerless, they
seldom indulge in the usual sportive movements of their race.

Mr Bates relates that a friend of his possessed one of these little creatures.  His friend,
accompanied by the monkey, was in the habit of paying him a daily visit.  One day the little
animal, having missed its master, concluded, as it seemed, that he had gone to his house, and
accordingly came straight to it, taking a short cut over gardens, trees, and thickets.  This
it had never done before; they learned it, however, from a neighbour who had observed its movements.
On arriving at Mr Bates's house and not observing its master, it climbed to the top of the
table, and sat with an air of quiet resignation waiting for him. Shortly afterwards he arrived,
and the gladdened pet then jumped to its usual perch on his shoulder.

SAIMIBI--CALLITHRIX--TEETEE--COLLARED TEETEE.

There is another genus of light and graceful little monkeys, known by the name of Callithrix,
or "beautiful hair."  Among them is the Saimiri, or teetee, of which there are several species.
The collared teetee is among the most attractive--Callithrix torquatus.  The general colour
is a greyish-olive, the limbs looking as if washed with a rich golden hue. The ears are white,
and the body whitish-grey.  The tip of the long tail is black.

They are very engaging little creatures, and possess an intelligence which makes them the most
attractive of their race.  Their temper, too, is amiable, and they are never known to get into
a passion.  Their countenances express almost an infantine innocence, and this exhibits itself
especially when the creatures are alarmed.  Tears fill their hazel eyes; and, with imploring
gestures, they seem to claim the protection of their human friends.  They have also a curious
habit of watching the lips of those who address them, as if they could understand what is spoken;
and apparently wishing the better to comprehend their master, they will place their fingers
on his lips in the most attractive, confiding way.

The creature's long tail possesses no prehensile power, but it appears to use it as a lady
does a boa,--coiling it round its body to keep itself warm.

NIGHT APES, OR DOUROUCOULI.

When travelling through some parts of the Amazonian forests, and looking up into an ancient
tree, a number of little striped faces crowding a hole in the trunk may suddenly be seen gazing
inquisitively down at the intruder who has disturbed their noonday sleep.  These are Nyctipitheci,
or night apes, which the Indians call ei-a, and are named also Douroucouli.  Sleeping soundly
during the day in some dark hollow, out of harm's way, they come forth at night to prey on
insects or small birds, which they hunt and capture,--as well as fruit.  The body of the creature
is about a foot long, and the tail fourteen inches, thickly covered with soft grey and brown
fur.  Its face is round, and encircled by a ruff of whitish fur.  The forehead is of a light
colour, and adorned with three black stripes,--which in one species meet at the top of it,
and in another continue to the crown; the muzzle is somewhat flat, and the mouth and chin small.
The ears are very short, scarcely appearing above the hair of the head; and the eyes are large
and of a yellowish colour, imparting that staring expression observed in owls or night animals.
From this they have obtained the name of owl-faced night apes.  The creature has nails of the
ordinary form to its fingers, and semi-opposable thumbs; but the molar teeth are studded with
sharp points, showing that it lives chiefly on insects.

Though in the daytime it appears torpid and dull, yet at night, shaking off its drowsiness,
its large dull eyes, which shrunk from the rays of the sun, are full of eager animation as
it sets off in quest of its prey.  So active and quicksighted is it, that it catches the rapidly-flying
insects as they flit by, or chases the beetles as they run over the bark of the trees on which
it lives.

Mr Bates describes a tame one he met with, which was excessively confiding in its disposition,
very lively and nimble, and in no way mischievous.  It delighted to be caressed by all persons
who came into the house.  It used to sleep in the hammock of its owner, or nestle in his bosom
half the day as he lay reading.  From the cleanliness of its habits, and the prettiness of
its features and ways, it was a great favourite with every one.  He himself had a similar pet,
which was kept in a box, in which was placed a broad-mouthed glass jar.  Into this it would
dive when any one entered the room, and, turning round, thrust forth its inquisitive face to
stare at the intruder.  It was very active at night, giving vent at intervals to a hoarse cry,
like the suppressed bark of a dog, and scampering about the room after cockroaches and spiders.
Although it preferred insects, it ate all kinds of fruit, but would not touch either raw or
cooked meat.  Its brothers, when let loose about the house, are very useful in clearing the
chambers of bats, as well as insects and vermin.

It is monogamous.  The ei-a and its wife may often be discovered together tending their small
family in some hollow trunk.  Its cry is wonderfully loud, considering its small size; and
curious as it may seem, is not unlike the roar of the jaguar.  It can also hiss or spit in
the fashion of an angry cat, while it utters a curious mew resembling the same creature.  It
sometimes gives a guttural, short, and rapidly-repeated bark.

There are several species of night monkeys with very similar habits.

It is difficult, except when they are in captivity, to obtain a correct idea of the habits
of these interesting little, animals,--though, of course, when they are tamed, they must abandon
some of those they possessed in a state of nature.  Of their dispositions, however, a very
fair notion may be formed from the way they behave when in captivity. The above descriptions
refer only to a few of the numerous species of monkeys which exist in the South American forests,
but as typical forms have been selected, a tolerable idea of the whole may be obtained.

PART THREE, CHAPTER THIRTEEN.

BIRDS.

HUMMING-BIRDS.

Most of the humming-birds found on the banks of the Amazon belong to the genus Phaethornis;
remarkable for their long, graduated tails, the central feathers of which greatly exceed the
others.  Their nests are curious and beautiful, being formed in a long funnel-like shape, tapering
below to a slender point.  They are woven with great delicacy, and attached to some twig, or
hanging leaf, by means of spider's webs. They are lined with a soft silky cotton fibre; and
composed, externally, of a woolly kind of furze, bound together with which appears also to
be spider's web.

One of the largest is the Eupetomena macroura, with a swallow tail, and a livery of brilliant
emerald-green and steel blue.  When feeding, it remains a shorter time than usual poised in
the air before the flowers, frequently perching, and occasionally darting after small insects
flying by.

When the orange-trees become fully covered with flowers, the humming-birds appear in vast numbers.
Their motions are totally unlike those of other birds.  So quickly do they dart backwards and
forwards, that the eye can hardly follow them.  Even when poising themselves before a flower,
with such inconceivable rapidity do their wings move, that even then their bright colours are
scarcely perceptible; and anon they shoot off to sip the nectar from another cup.  Unlike the
systematic way in which bees proceed, they seem to delight in darting, now in one direction,
now in the other; now for a moment they perch on a spray, probing, as they sit, the flowers
nearest to them; then again they fly off, in their eccentric course, to another spot.

"Wherever a creeping vine opens its fragrant cluster, or wherever a flower blooms, may these
little things be seen," writes Edwards, in his usual graphic way; "in the garden, or in the
woods, over the water, everywhere, they are darting about, of all sizes, from one that might
easily be mistaken for a different variety of bird, to the tiny hermit-- T. Rufigaster, whose
body is not half the size of the bee's--buzzing about.  Sometimes they are seen chasing each
other, in sport, with a rapidity of flight and intricacy of path the eye is puzzled to follow.
Again, circling round and round, they rise high in mid-air, and then dart off like light to
some distant attraction.  Perched upon a little twig, they smooth their plumes, and seem to
delight in their dazzling hues; then, starting off leisurely, they skim along, stopping capriciously
to kiss the coquetting flowerets.  Often two meet in mid-air and furiously fight, their crests,
and the feathers upon their throats, all erected and blazing, and altogether pictures of the
most violent rage.  Several times we saw them battling with large black bees who frequent the
same flowers, and may be seen often to interfere provokingly.  Like lightning our little heroes
would come down, but the coat of shining mail would ward off their furious strokes.  Again
and again would they renew the attack, until their anger had expended itself by its own fury,
or until the apathetic bee, once roused, had put forth powers which drove the invaders from
the field."

Bates remarks, that he several times shot, by mistake, a humming-bird hawk-moth, instead of
a bird.  This moth (Macroglossa Titan) is smaller than humming-birds generally are, but its
manner of flight, and the way it poises itself before the flower whilst probing it with its
proboscis, are precisely like the same actions of humming-birds.  This resemblance has attracted
the notice of the natives, who firmly believe that one is transmutable into the other.  The
resemblance between this hawk-moth and the humming-bird is certainly very curious, and strikes
one, even when both are examined in the hand.  Holding them sideways, the shape of the head
and position of the eyes in the moth are seen to be nearly the same as in the bird, the extended
proboscis representing the long beak.  At the tip of the moth's body there is a brush of long
hair-scales, resembling feathers, which, being expanded, looks very much like a bird's tail;
but, of course, all these points of resemblance are merely superficial.

He one day saw a little pigmy, belonging to the genus Phaethornis, in the act of washing itself
in a brook.  It was perched on a thin branch, whose end was under water.  It dipped itself,
then fluttered its wings, and plumed its feathers, and seemed thoroughly to enjoy itself alone
in the shady nook which it had chosen.  "There is no need for poets to invent," he adds, "while
nature furnishes us with such marvellous little sprites ready to hand."

But these beautiful little creatures require a separate description.

TOPAZ HUMMING-BIRD.

The topaz humming-bird is perhaps the most resplendent and beautiful of its tribe.  The fiery
topaz (Topaza pyra) is found on the shores of the Rio Negro.  The larger part of its feathers
are of a blazing scarlet, which contrasts beautifully with the deep velvet-black of the head
and part of the neck.  The throat is emerald-green, with a patch of crimson in the centre.
The lower part of the back, and the upper tail-coverts, are of a resplendent green with an
orange gloss; and the wings and tail of purple-black, the two elongated feathers of the tail
excepted--they being of a purplish-green.  Its nest appears as if formed of leather, and is
so cleverly woven that it can scarcely be distinguished from the bark or fungi growing on the
branch to which it is fixed.

ARA HUMMING-BIRD.

The crimson topaz, or ara humming-bird (Topaza pella), vies with it in beauty.  Its hues are
of a deeper crimson.  The tail is of a reddish-buff, except the two central feathers, which
are of the same hue as the preceding.  Unlike most humming-birds, it is of a shy and retiring
disposition, and seldom ventures from among the deep shades of the forest; and then only at
early dawn, or late in the evening, when it may be seen darting across the stream in search
of insects, on which it chiefly feeds.

THE RACKET-TAIL HUMMING-BIRD.

The racket-tail humming-bird (Discura longicauda) takes its name from the curious form of its
tail, the feathers of which are forked,--the two exterior ones being twice the length of the
second pair.  The colour of the tail is purple-black; the face, throat, and part of the neck
light green; while under the chin there is a little velvet-black spot.  The upper part of the
body is a bronze-green, and a bright buff band crosses the lower end of the back.

THE CAYENNE FAIRY.

The beautiful little Cayenne fairy (Heliothrix auritus) is often seen flitting among the flowers
which adorn the trees near the mouth of the Amazon.  It may be known by the snowy-white under
part of its body, while the upper surface is of a glossy golden green, extremely light on the
forehead.  The middle feathers of the tail are blue-black, and the three exterior ones are
white.  Across each side of the face is a jet-black line, terminated by a small tuft of violet-blue,
while below the black line runs a luminous green one.  Few of these beautiful little creatures
have any voice which rises above a mere twitter.

The best songster of the tribe is the Vervain humming-bird, found in the West India Islands.
Those on the Amazon are almost mute.  Small as they are, they are brave little creatures, and
several of the species are tamed without difficulty.

Mr Webber describes one of the means by which nature has gifted these little creatures of escaping
the observation of their foes.  On leaving the spot where a number had perched not far from
their nests, he observed them shoot suddenly and perpendicularly into the air till they had
got out of sight.  After a time, down came the hen-bird, like a fiery aerolite from the sky,
upon the very spot where she had built her nest, so rapidly, as almost to escape observation.

Different species, of great varieties of form and colour, are found throughout the continent.
Although the greater number are confined to particular localities, others have a wide range.
On the mountain heights, in the thick forests and open plains, wherever flowers and insects
exist, there one or more species make their home throughout the continent.

COTINGAS.

Lovely as are the humming-birds, the cotingas, belonging to the order of Passeres, and of which
there are several species, almost rival them in beauty of plumage.

This cotinga is a solitary bird, and utters only a monotonous whistle, which sounds like quet.
Another has a purple breast with black wings, and tail and every other part of a light and
glossy blue.

The pompadour cotinga has a purple body and white wings, their four first feathers tipped with
brown.

None of these have any song.  The last, however, utters sounds something like wallababa.  They
feed on the fig, wild guaco, and other fruit-trees.

THE CAMPANERO, OR BELL-BIRD.

Far-away in the forest a singularly loud and clear note, like the sound of a bell, is heard;
mile after mile, and still the same strange note reaches the ear.  A single toll; then a pause
for a minute, then a pause again, then a toll, and again a pause; then for six or eight minutes
no toll is heard; then another comes strangely and solemnly amid the tall columns and, fretted
arches of the sylvan temple.  Sometimes of a morning, and sometimes in the evening, and even
when the meridian sun has silenced all the other songsters of the grove, that strange toll
is heard.  At length, high up on the dried top of an aged maura, a snow-white bird may be seen,
no larger than a pigeon; and yet it is the creature who is uttering those strange sounds. 
It is another species of the cotinga--the well-known campanero, or bell-bird.  When thus employed,
and filled with air, it looks like a spire; when empty, it becomes pendulous.  Though, like
most of its tribe, it is sometimes seen in flocks, it never feeds with other species of cotingas.

The witty Sydney Smith, remarking on the account Waterton gives of the campanero, observes:
"This single bird then has a voice of more power than the belfry of a cathedral ringing for
a new dean.

Had the witty dean been aware of the fact--stated by the astronomer and aeronaut, Mr Glaisher--that
a female voice is heard a mile further than that of the most hirsute and sturdy "tar," he might
have been less sceptical of the powers of the little cotinga to make itself heard for the distance
of three miles through the pure and calm air of the tropics.

THE UMBRELLA, OR FIFE-BIRD.

In the yearly submerged gapo forests and the plains of the Upper Amazon, a singularly deep
and long-sustained flute-like sound is often heard. It might be supposed that it was produced
by the pan-pipes used by the natives of that region.  It is, however, the note of a bird, named
by the Indians uira mimbeu, or fife-bird, from the peculiar tone of its voice.  It is, from
the ornament on its head--consisting of a crest, with long curved hairy feathers, having long
bare quills; which, when raised, spread themselves out in the form of a fringed sunshade over
the head--called the umbrella-bird (Cephalopterus ornatus).  It resembles in size and colour
the common crow.  In addition to this umbrella-like ornament on its head, it has what may be
called a pelerine suspended from the neck, formed by a thick fan of glossy steel-blue feathers
which grow on a long fleshy lobe or excrescence.  This lobe is connected with an unusual development
of the trachea and vocal organs, undoubtedly assisting the bird to utter its strange note.
While singing, it draws itself up on the bough, spreads widely out the umbrella-formed crest,
waves its glossy breast lappet, and then, in giving vent to its loud, piping note, bows its
head slowly forward.

The female has only the rudiments of a crest and lappet, and is of a much duller colour than
the male.

THE COCK OF THE ROCKS.

Among the forest highlands at the foot of the sierras to the north of the Amazon, the magnificent
orange-coloured cock of the rocks enjoys existence.  About the size of a pigeon, it belongs
to the tribe of the diminutive manakins, most of which have beautiful and curious plumage.
It, however, surpasses them all.

It has gained its name from the slight external resemblance that it bears to the gallinaceous form.

Its plumage is of a rich orange tint; with the exception of the quill-feathers of the wings,
which are of a sooty black hue, and those of the tail, which are brown tipped with yellow.
On its head it wears a peculiar fan-like crest, which, overhanging the forehead, extends to
the back of the head, and which bears a strong resemblance to the plume of an ancient helmet.
The tips of these crest-feathers are tinged with brown and yellow.  Between the wing and upper
tail-coverts appear flowing plumes, which droop gracefully over the firmer feathers of the
tail and sides.

Like some birds of paradise in the Eastern Archipelago, the cocks of the rocks assemble in
numbers to perform a kind of dance for their amusement, selecting generally the smooth rocks
or roots of trees,-- moving here and there, round and round, backwards and forwards, and erecting
their gorgeous plumes, to exhibit their beauty.  Wallace observed a company of birds engaged
in this singular way, though he says that no females or young birds were present.

Schombergh describes a similar scene.  A troop of these beautiful birds was celebrating its
dances on the smooth surface of a rock.  About a score of them were seated on the branches
as spectators, while one of the male birds, with proud self-confidence, and with spreading
tail and wings, was dancing on the rock.  He scratched the ground, or leaped vertically in
the air; continuing these saltatory movements until he was tired, when another male took his
place.  The females, meanwhile, looked on attentively, and applauded the performances of the
dancers with laudatory cries.

Wallace, in his later work on the Eastern Archipelago, gives an equally animated picture of
the king birds of paradise enjoying a similar performance on the topmost boughs of the most
lofty trees in the Aru Islands.

GOLDEN-WINGED MANAKIN.

The golden-winged manakin--another tribe--are often seen perched in large flocks on the summits
of the trees, or rapidly moving amid the branches in search of the rich fruits and numerous
insects found in the gapo forests.

The beautiful little troupiale, arrayed in plumage of rich orange and shining black, with delicate
and well-shaped form, pours forth a variety of sweet and plaintive notes among the dry forest
lands, and has gained from the Portuguese the name of the nightingale of America.

There is another of a smaller size, and of less rich a colour, which also sings melodiously.
It is a fearless bird, and the hen builds her nest often in the roofs of cottages, while her
mate sings for hours close by.  There are several species, one of which (the oriolus varius)
builds a curious nest like a basket, of a conical form, and of a loose texture; securing it
to the flexible end of a branch, thus enabling it the better to endure the movement to which
it is subjected when agitated by the wind.

A fourth species flies in flocks--especially when the Indian maize is ripe--and is looked on
with a jealous eye by the farmers, whom it robs, and whom it does not repay by the melody of
its song.

GOATSUCKERS.

Numerous species of the goatsucker, well known as the bird of night, inhabit the forests of
the Amazon as well as the settled districts. Their pretty mottled plumage is destitute of the
lustre which is observed in the feathers of the birds of day.  One is nearly the size of the
common wood owl.  Its cry once heard will never be forgotten.  It seems like one in deep distress.
"A stranger," says Waterton, "would never believe the sound to be the voice of a bird.  He
would say it was the last groan of a midnight murdered victim, or the cry of Niobe for her
children before she was turned into stone.

Other species articulate some words so clearly, that they receive their names from the sentences
they utter.  One cries "Who are you? who, who, who are you?"  Another bids you "Work away;
work, work away."  A third shrieks mournfully--"Willy come, go Willy, Willy, Willy come, go;"
and a fourth exclaims--"Whip poor Willy; whip, whip, whip poor Willy!"

Ignorance alone has given the goatsucker its name.

CACIQUES.

A species of cacique--of which there are several--like the blue jay of the northern part of
the continent, is celebrated for its imitative powers.  It is one of the handsomest in form
of the feathered tribe, in size somewhat larger than a starling.

The cacique is gregarious, and is generally found in large flocks,-- sometimes one species
building their nests on one side of a tree, while another, with a neighbourly feeling, appears
to have selected the opposite side; and they may be seen working amicably away, without interfering
with each other.  They show wonderful instinct in the selection of trees, sometimes hanging
their large pendulous nests to the extremities of palm branches, that they may thus be as much
as possible out of the reach of enemies who might attempt to take their young brood. Others
are said to select the trees on which the stinging-wasps have already built their nests, as
no tiger-cat nor reptile of any description would venture to attack such adversaries.

One species (the casicus cristatus) weaves its nest of lichens, bark fibres, and the filaments
of the tillandsias; another (the casicus ruba) of dry grasses, and always suspends it over
the water.  This has a slanting opening in the side, so that no rain can penetrate it.

TOUCANS.

During the dry season, on the topmost boughs of the lofty trees growing on the gapo lands,
large gaily-coloured birds, with huge beaks of the shape of a banana or pacova, are perched,
in bands of five or six, uttering loud, shrill, and yelping cries, having somewhat the resemblance
to "Tocano! tocano! tocano!"  Hence the Indians give them the name from which we derive toucan--a
bird especially characteristic of the forests of Tropical America.  The Brazilians also call
them "preacher-birds,"--from their habit of lifting up their beaks, and clattering them together,
and shouting hoarsely.  One, mounted higher than the rest, acts either as the leader of the
inharmonious chorus, or does the duty of sentinel.  He keeps a bright look-out on every side,
and as danger approaches, gives a warning cry, when his companions stretch their necks downwards
in an inquisitive manner, to ascertain what foe is below; and on espying the least movement
among the foliage, fly off to a distance.

Sometimes the whole flock, including the sentinel, set up simultaneously a deafening loud yell,
which can be heard a mile off, and serves to lead the hunter to their haunts.  They are said
also to mob any strange bird which gets among them, surrounding it, and shrieking at it in
whichever way it turns; so that it sees itself surrounded on all sides by huge snapping bills,
and long tails bobbing regularly up and down with threatening gestures, till it is seized by
its foes or manages to make its escape.

It seems wonderful at first sight that any creature should be encumbered with so huge a beak;
but the toucan knows well how to use it.  Though of great size, it is of light structure, and
serrated at the edges.  In some species it attains to a length of seven inches, and a width
of more than two inches.  It assists the bird in climbing the branches of the trees on which
he lives, and from which he never willingly descends to the ground.  It enables him to seize
the large fruits and small birds which serve him for food; and enables him to chew the cud--his
huge tooth-bill being useful in holding and re-masticating the food.

As the flowers and fruits which crown the large trees of the forest grow principally towards
the end of slender twigs, which would not bear his weight; and as he has a heavy body, with
feeble organs of flight, he cannot seize his food on the wing.  He therefore sits on some opposite
branch, eyeing the fruit which he thinks will suit his taste, and then darting off, seizes
a mouthful, and returns to his perch.

Though their general diet is fruit, they also devour small birds and their eggs, as well, probably,
as caterpillars, and the larvae of insects in general.  Mr Broderip describes the curious way
in which he saw a toucan seize a small bird, pluck off the feathers, and having broken the
bones of the wings and legs with his beak, continue working away till he had reduced it to
a shapeless mass.  He then hopped from perch to perch, uttering a peculiar hollow, chattering
noise, and began pulling off piece after piece, till he had swallowed the whole, not even leaving
the beak and logs.  In a quarter of an hour he had finished, when he cleansed his bill from
the feathers.  After a time he returned his food into his crop, and after masticating the morsel
for a while in his bill, again swallowed it.

The bird mentioned was in captivity; and though his food consisted of bread, boiled vegetables,
and eggs, he showed a decided preference for animal food when given to him.

The toucan (Ramphastos) belongs to the genus of scansorial birds.  There are several species,
five of which inhabit the forests of the Upper Amazon.  The largest of that region is Cuvier's
toucan, and is distinguished from its nearest relatives by the feathers at the bottom of the
back being of a saffron hue instead of red.  It lays its eggs in hollows of trees, at a great
height from the ground, and moults between March and June.

Solitary toucans are sometimes met with, hopping silently up and down the larger boughs, and
peering into the crevices of tree trunks.  When the gapo is flooded, they fly to the drier
ground, assembling in large flocks, when they are easily shot by the hunters.  The birds are
then very fat, and their flesh sweet and tender.

In some species the bill is nearly as large and as long as the body itself.  It is light, cellular,
and irregularly notched at the edge, having both mandibles arched towards the tip.  The tongue
is also of a singular form, being narrow and elongated, and literally barbed like a feather.
The feet are short--formed, like those of parrots, rather for grasping than for climbing; the
tail long, and the wings moderate.  It has a straight but laborious flight, and seems awkward,
except on the boughs, when it moves lightly and actively from branch to branch.  When eating,
it throws up its head, apparently to allow the food to fall down its throat with greater ease.
When the toucan is at roost, it turns its long tail directly over its back, and thrusts its
beak beneath the wing, so as to appear very much like a large mass of feathers.

The common or crested toucan (Ramphastos dicolorus) inhabits chiefly the lower part of the
Amazon.  It is about eighteen inches in length, of a black colour, with a gloss of green. 
The cheeks, throat, and fore part of the breast are either of a sulphur or orange-yellow. 
Across the lower part of the breast is a broad crimson bar.  The rump is crimson or orange-yellow.
The bill is of a dark olive-green, with a pale yellow base, bounded by a thick bar.

The tocano pacova has a beak of a rich glowing orange, with a large patch near the tip, a black
line round the base, and a number of dark red bars upon the sides.  The body and head are black,
the throat and cheeks white; while the breast is of a yellow brimstone hue, edged with a line
of blood-red.  The upper tail-coverts are greyish-white, and the under deep crimson.  A large
orange circle surrounds the eye, and within it is a second circle of cobalt-blue.  A green
ring incloses the pupil, with a narrow yellow ring round it.

Cuvier's toucan inhabits the woods of the Upper Amazon.  There are several smaller toucans,
one of which (the Pteroglossus Havirostris) has the most beautiful plumage,--its breast being
adorned with broad belts of rich crimson and black.

The most curious, however, is the curly-crested toucan (Pteroglossus Beauharnaisii).  The feathers
on its head consist of thin, horny blades of a lustrous black colour, curled up at the ends,
and resembling shavings of steel.  The curly crest assumes, indeed, the grotesque form of a
coachman's wig dyed black, and produced apparently by the tongs of the hair-dresser.

None of the smaller species utter the loud yelping notes of the larger. The cries of the curly-crested
toucan are very singular, resembling somewhat the croaking of frogs.

Mr Bates had one day wounded one; and on attempting to seize it, it set up a loud scream. 
In an instant, as if by magic, the wood seemed alive with its companions, who descended towards
him, hopping from bough to bough, some of them swinging on the loops of the lianas and sipos,
croaking and fluttering their wings like so many furies.  Had he had a long stick in his hand,
he could have knocked over several of them.  The screaming of their companion which he had
killed having ceased, they remounted the trees; and before he could reload his gun, which he
had left at a little distance, they had all disappeared.

He possessed a tame toucan of one of the large species, which was allowed to go free about
the house.  Having chastised it for mounting his work-table, the first time it made the attempt,
it never again repeated it.  It slept on the top of a box in a corner of the room, with its
long tail laid right over its back, and its beak thrust underneath its wing.  It ate of everything--beef,
turtle, fish, farina, fruit--and was a constant attendant at meals.  It learned the hour to
a nicety, and he found it difficult to keep the bird away from the dining-room at these hours.
When it had become somewhat impudent and troublesome, he tried to shut it out in the back-yard;
but Tocano used to climb the fence, and hop round by a long circuit, making its appearance
with the greatest punctuality as the meal was placed on the table.  One day it was stolen,
and given up for lost; but two days afterwards it stepped through the doorway at the dinner-hour,
with its old gait and sly magpie-like expression, having escaped from the house of the person
who had stolen it, situated at the further end of the village.

THE REALEJO, OR ORGAN-BIRD.

[Cyphorhinus Cantans; called also the flute-bird.]

While the strange, harsh voice of the goatsucker is hushed, the mycetes has ceased to howl,
and no roar of jaguar is heard, a few slow, sweet, and mellow notes reach the ear, following
one another like the commencement of an air.  The unimpressible natives stop their paddles
as they are floating up an igarape to listen to the dulcet strains.  The sounds appear to be
those of a human voice; some young girl gathering fruit in the neighbouring thicket, it would
seem, warbling a few notes to cheer herself in her solitude.  Now the tones become more flute-like
and plaintive,--now they seem to be those of a flageolet.  It is difficult to imagine that
they can be produced by a bird.  No bird, indeed, can be seen, however closely the surrounding
trees and bushes are scanned.  Yet that sweet voice seems to come from a thicket close at hand.
The listeners are silent, expecting to hear the strain completed, but disappointment follows.
An abrupt pause occurs, and then the song breaks down, finishing with a number of clicking,
unmusical sounds, like a piping barrel-organ out of wind and out of tune.

This is the organ-bird--the most remarkable songster by far (says Bates) of the Amazonian forests.
When discovered, he seems habited in sober colours; but he need not envy his gaily-dressed
companions--while, as a songster, he remains unrivalled in his native woods.

THE CURASSOW.

High up among the lofty boughs of the thick forest sit a flock of magnificent birds, each the
size of a turkey.  They are the crested curassow (Crax elector).  The plumage is of a deep,
shining black colour, reflecting purple and green shades.  The abdomen and tail-coverts are
white, but the tail is black, and generally tipped with white.  On its head it carries a handsome
golden crest, the feathers narrow at the base and broad at the tip, which it raises and depresses
as it moves along.  Its voice, far from sweet, sounds like a hoarse cough, and each time it
utters its cry it partially spreads its feathers and throws up its tail.  The hen, however,
has another way of expressing herself, uttering a whining sound.

Among the trees where they are perched are their large nests, roughly formed of sticks and
leaves and plaits of grass.  Their eggs, of which there are six or seven, are about the size
of those of a turkey, and of a pure white.  They feed on bananas and other fruits, as well
as maize and rice.

There are several species.  One (the mitu tuberosa) has an orange-coloured beak, surmounted
by a bean-shaped excrescence of the same hue.  It lays two rough-shelled white eggs.

Another species (the crax globicera) inhabits the Upper Amazon, and possesses a round instead
of a bean-shaped excrescence on the beak.

These birds are easily tamed.  Bates mentions one which used to attend the family with whom
he lived at all the meals, passing from one person to another round the mat to be fed, and
rubbing the sides of its head in a coaxing way against their cheeks or shoulders.  At night
it went to roost in a sleeping-room--beside the hammock of one of the little girls, to whom
it seemed to be greatly attached, following her wherever she went about the grounds.  These
birds, however, do not breed in captivity, and are therefore only kept by the Indians as pets;
though possibly they might be induced, by proper management, to do so, when they would prove
a valuable addition to the poultry-yard in England.

In its wild state it seldom descends from the lofty trees.

MACAWS.

On observing the curious, powerful beak of a macaw, we at once see that it must be an inhabitant
of a region producing hard fruits, which require the application of considerable strength to
break them.  At morning and evening flocks of this large and richly-plumaged bird may be observed
flying across the streams in all directions--their loud, harsh screams echoing among the forests
through the calm air--wheeling and turning before they alight on the tops of the palms to feed.
They belong to the Psittacidae, or parrot tribe, and are known at once by the great length
of their tails, and by having their cheeks destitute of feathers.

There are several species which frequent the trees growing on wet and swampy ground.  The red
and blue macaw, the largest and handsomest of the family, is well described by Waterton.

Bates saw a flock feeding on the fruits of a Bacana palm, and looking like a cluster of flaunting
banners beneath its dark green crown.

They build their nests in the hollows of decayed trees, and lay twice in the year--generally
two eggs at a time, the male and female alternately watching over them.  They are said to increase
the size of the hole with their powerful beaks, should it not be sufficiently large for their
purpose.  They fly to a distance of several miles to feed, but--like rooks in England--return
to their homes in the evening.

This macaw frequently measures, from the tip of the bill to the extremity of the tail, forty
inches and more.

There are, besides, several other species of the red and yellow, blue, and blue and yellow,
which equal the scarlet and blue in size,--their habits being very similar.  They are easily
tamed, and can be taught to repeat words, and sometimes even phrases.  They are remarkable
for their longevity, some having been known to live to one hundred years.

The magnificent great green macaw is noted for his depredations on the maize-fields; but, being
a sagacious bird, he always places a sentinel to give the alarm to his marauding associates
when danger approaches.

PARROTS.

Parrots much inferior in size and less richly decked fly amid the foliage in vast numbers.
The two most common species are the Amazon green parrot and the festive green parrot.

Of the former (Psittacus Amazonius) there are several varieties.  They have their homes in
the midst of the impenetrable forests.  The female lays four white eggs in the hollow of a
tree.  The usual length is about fourteen inches.  The bills vary in colour; the plumage is
of a bright green, with the feathers marked by dusky or blackish margins.  On the top or edges
of the shoulders there is a brilliant scarlet patch, bounded by shades of blue, green, and
yellow.  A bright blue band reaches from eye to eye, beyond which the feathers of the crown,
cheeks, and throat are of a rich yellow.

The Brazilian green parrot is a large and beautiful bird, of a fine grass-green, rather paler
beneath the feathers, edged with purplish-brown.  The front and round the base of the bill
is bright red, the cheeks rather deep blue, and the top of the head yellow.  The edge of the
wings, at some distance from the shoulders, is red.  The tail is especially handsome, the outside
feathers being deep blue, tipped with yellow; the next red, with a similar yellow tip; and
all the remaining ones green, with yellow tips.  The bill is of a light colour, and the legs
and feet dark.  It is the species most ordinarily brought to England, and is valued on account
of its powers of imitation-- individuals having been taught not only words, but whole sentences.

ANACA PARROT.

One among the most rare of the beautiful parrot family is the anaca (Derotypus coronatus).
It is of a green colour, and at the back of its head rises a hood of red feathers bordered
with blue, which it can elevate or depress at pleasure.  It is the only American parrot which
resembles the cockatoo of Australia.  It is of a solemn, morose, and irritable disposition.
The natives often keep the bird in the house for the purpose of seeing the irascible creature
expand its beautiful feathers, which it readily does when excited.  The crest is something
like that of a harpy eagle.  It is known also as the hawk-headed parrot.

MARIANNA PARROT.

There is also a beautiful black-headed species--the macai of the Indians--known as the marianna.
It has a white breast, orange neck and thighs.  It is a remarkably lively little bird, and
when tamed, shows its playful and inquisitive disposition.

Wallace describes one which he had on board his canoe, which used to climb into every crack
and cranny, diving into all the baskets, pans, and pots it could discover, and tasting everything
they contained.  It was a most omnivorous feeder, eating rice, farina, every kind of flesh,
fish, and vegetables; and drinking coffee too.  As soon as it saw him, basin in hand, it would
climb up to the edge, and not be quiet without having a share; which it would lick up with
the greatest satisfaction, stopping now and then to look knowingly round,--as much as to say,
"This coffee is very good,"--and then sipping again with increased gusto.

It has a pretty, clear whistle, which the Indians imitate, making it reply, and stare about
in a vain search for its companions.

TROGONS.

Among the smaller birds in these forests, the trogons--a genus of scansorial birds--are the
most beautiful, surpassing their relatives found in other parts of the world.  There are numerous
varieties, differing in size--from the trogon viridis, scarcely larger than a sparrow, to the
beautiful trogon, with its handsome tail, the size of a rook.  Often they are to be seen in
the depths of the forest, sitting motionless for hours together, simply moving their heads,
watching apparently for insects, or sometimes scanning the neighbouring trees for fruit.  Having
selected a ripe one, they dart off now and then at long intervals to secure it, returning always
to the same perch.

Their wings are feeble, and they are of a dull, inactive temperament. They have long spreading
tails, and a dense plumage, which makes them appear larger than they are in reality.  They
are solitary birds, and may be seen sitting singly, or in pairs--some species on the taller
trees, and others but a few feet above the ground--occasionally uttering a mournful note, which
sounds like curucua,--the name which the Indians give to them.  "This would betray them to
the hunter," says Edwards; "but they are great ventriloquists, and it is often impossible to
discover them, though close above one's head."

Their feathers are fixed in a very loose manner, so that in falling, when shot, numbers fall off.

THE RESPLENDENT TROGON.

The resplendent trogon--the largest of the species--is one of the handsomest of birds, on account
of the richness and brilliancy of its colour, the beautiful blending of tints, the flowing
grace of its plumage, and the elegance of its colour.  On its forehead is a curiously-shaped
tuft, of slight and elastic feathers which curl over something like those of the umbrella-bird.
This ornament--as also the head, throat, back, wings, and upper tail-coverts--is of the very
richest green, with a gloss of gold, which glows, when moved by the breeze, with a changeable
sheen.  The upper tail-coverts are exceedingly long, projecting considerably beyond the tail,
and flowing gracefully over the stiffer feathers beneath them.  The lower part of the body
is of a rich carmine.

Another species, called by the natives the curucua grande, has a soft, golden green plumage,
a red breast, and an orange-coloured beak.

In the Gapo territory a yellow-bellied trogon, with a back of a brilliant metallic green colour,
and a breast of steel-blue, is found.

The trogon melanurus is remarkable for the beauty of its plumage, having a glossy green back
and rose-coloured breast.  Bates found one seated alone on a branch, at no great elevation,
uttering at intervals, in a complaining tone, its usual cry of "quaqua."  It appeared to be
a dull, inactive bird, and even when approached seemed very unwilling to take flight.

JACAMARS.

Among the characteristic members of the feathered tribe in these forests are the jacamars,
as they are found in no other part of the world.  They have straight, long, pointed bills,
with a keel on the upper mandible. Some species have only three toes, while others possess
the usual number of four.  They live on insects, but in many respects resemble the trogon;
being even still less disposed to fly than they are.  "Their stupidity, indeed, in remaining
at their posts, seated on low branches in the shady parts of the forest, is somewhat remarkable
in a country where all other birds are exceedingly wary," observes Bates.

The green jacamar (galbula viridis) is a beautiful bird, about the size of a lark; the upper
parts of the body being generally of an exceedingly brilliant, changeable green, glossed with
copper-gold.  The beak is two inches long, black, slightly incurved, and sharp-pointed.  The
legs are short and weak, of a greenish-yellow, and the claws black.  It is a very solitary
bird, and delights to take refuge in the thickest parts of the forest, where insects abound,
and is seldom seen in company with others. It has a short, quick flight, and a sweeter voice
than most of its feathered companions.

The paradise jacamar (galbula paradisea) frequents the more open parts of the forest, and is
generally found in pairs.  It is a larger bird than the former, being nearly a foot long. 
The prevailing plumage is green, but the throat, front of the neck, and under wing-coverts
are white.

It seizes its food in the same way that the trogons do.  It will sit silent and motionless
on a branch, moving its head slightly, and when an insect passes by, within a short distance,
it will fly off and seize it with its long beak, and return again to its perch.

Most jacamars are clothed with a plumage of the most beautiful golden, bronze, and steel colours.
They bear a strong outward resemblance to kingfishers, but are not further united to that group
of birds.  They appear to have the same peculiar attachment to particular branches as many
humming-birds possess; and the spot can generally be discovered by the number of legs and wings
and hard cases of the insects they have caught, and which they have plucked off before eating
their victims.

The little three-toed jacamar possesses a few of the brilliant hues which adorn his brethren.

The great or broad-billed jacamar is very like a kingfisher.  The beak is very broad, while
the dilated ridge on the upper mandible is distinctly curved.  It feeds very much like the
kingfisher,--darting down from a branch to secure, with its bill, the active insects as they
fly by.  It feeds exclusively on them, however, never attempting to obtain food from the waters.

THE JACANA.

The light-bodied jacana, supported by its spider-like, widely extended feet, treads over the
floating pan-like leaves of the Victoria Regia, and other aquatic plants, without sinking them
in any perceptible degree below the surface of the calm pools in which they float.  They take
up their dwelling on the borders of the remote lakes and igarapes of the Amazonian Valley.

They are called by the natives oven-birds, because frequently seen on the pan-shaped leaves
of the before-mentioned magnificent lily.

The common jacana has a black plumage, with a greenish gloss.  The legs are very long and slight,--as
are the toes and claws, especially that of the hind-toe, which is nearly straight.  The body
is about ten inches long; and the beak upwards of an inch, and of an orange colour.

The jacana feeds on aquatic insects and vegetable matter.  While feeding it utters a low-sounding
cluck, cluck, at short intervals.  When flying it throws out its long legs horizontally to
their full length, generally skimming above the surface, out of danger.

Its body is of a peculiarly light construction, so that, large as it appears, it weighs but
little when pressing the floating leaves, on which it delights to walk in search of its prey.

FRIGATE-BIRD PELICANS.

Even to the distance of fifteen hundred miles and more from the mouth of the Amazon, large
flocks of the high-flying frigate-birds are descried hovering at an immense height above the
stream, preparing to plunge down and seize their finny prey.

They measure seven feet from wing to wing, and appear almost to live in the air.  The neck
is partly bare, and very extensible; the bill long, and hooked at the end; the feet small,
and webbed.  The body of the male is entirely black, while the hen has the head and neck white.

It is probably a different species from the frigate-bird, or sea-hawk, of the Eastern tropical
seas.

THE HORNED SCREAMER.

On the shores of a sand-bank, flocks of wild gulls may be seen flying overhead uttering their
well-known cries, sandpipers coursing along the edge of the water, here and there lonely wading
birds stalking about, and among them the curious Palamedea cornuta--the anhima of the Brazilians,
or the horned screamer of Cuvier--called also the kamichi. Startled by the approach of the
canoe, up it flies, its harsh screams resembling the bray of a jackass--but shriller and louder,
if possible-- greatly disturbing the calm solitude of the place.

It is the size of a swan, but more nearly resembles a crane.  On its head it wears a long,
pointed horn, surrounded with small black and white feathers.  It has a tail about eight inches
long; its wings, when folded, reaching to more than half the length of the tail.  They are
armed with sharp spines, with which it can inflict a wound on its foes, and which assist it
in repelling the attacks of snakes and guarding its young from their rapacity.  Unless when
attacked, however, it seldom uses its weapon of defence.  It walks boldly along, as if conscious
of its power; and when on the wing, has a strong and easy flight.

The head and neck are of a greenish-brown colour, and covered with soft feathers.  The back
is black, except the upper part, which is brown, with yellow spots; the whole lower part, with
the thighs, of a silvery white.

It feeds on grain and aquatic plants, in search of which it wades through the reptile-haunted
morasses.

VULTURES.

Monarch of the feathered tribes of the forest, the king vulture fears no rival throughout his
wild domain.  While the condor has its home on the mountain-tops, the sovereign of the vultures
confines himself exclusively to the thickly-wooded regions along the banks of the rivers or
lagoons, where he can more readily obtain the carcasses on which he feeds.

He is a magnificent bird, of about two feet and a half in length, and upwards of five feet
across the expanded wings.  The neck is brilliantly coloured of a fine lemon tint; both sides
of the neck, from the ears downwards, are of a rich scarlet.  The crown of the head is scarlet,
and between the lower mandible and the eye, and close to the eye, there is a part which has
a fine blue appearance; the skin which juts out behind the neck, like a carbuncle, is partly
blue and partly orange.  The bill is orange and black.  Round the bottom of the neck is a broad
ruff of soft, downy, ash-grey feathers, and the back and tail-coverts are of a bright lawn.
The middle wing-coverts and tail-feathers are glossy black.

These superb birds may sometimes be seen seated in pairs on the topmost boughs of trees, but
occasionally in large flocks.  The great expanse and power of his wings enables the king vulture
to soar to a prodigious height, whence he can survey with his piercing sight a wide extent
of his domain; possibly also his exquisite sense of smell enables him to detect the odour of
the putrefying carcass which rises through the pure air.

He is somewhat of a tyrant among his subjects; for not only will he allow no other vultures
or carrion-feeding birds to approach the carcass he has selected, but on his appearance the
other species, who may already have discovered it, fly to a distance, and stand meekly looking
on while their sovereign gorges himself.

The king vulture makes his nest in the hollow of a tree, where his queen lays two eggs.

THE BLACK VULTURE.

The gallinaso, or black vulture (Cathartes atratus), acts the part of a scavenger, and as such
is of great use throughout the whole centre of South America, as also in the northern continent.
Disgusting as are its habits and appearance, it is carefully protected, on account of the service
it renders to mankind.

It may easily be distinguished from the turkey-buzzard, which it greatly resembles, by the
shape of the feathers round its neck, which descend from the back of the head towards the throat
in a sloping direction; whereas those of the turkey-buzzard form a ring round the throat. 
Its general colour is a dull black.  The head and part of the neck are destitute of feathers,
wrinkled, and sprinkled with a few black hairs. The throat is of a yellowish tint.

It flies high, sweeping through the air with a beautifully easy motion, and is generally found
in the neighbourhood of fresh-water.

The black vultures are gregarious, brought together apparently by the pleasure they seem to
have in society rather than by the attraction of a common prey.

THE TURKEY-BUZZARD.

The turkey-buzzard (Cathartes ora) is similar in its habits to the black vulture, and is frequently
mistaken for it.  It is seldom found southward of latitude 41 degrees.  Of late years, however,
they have become numerous in the Valley of the Colorado, three hundred miles further south.
It is not found on the desert and arid plains of Northern Patagonia, except near some stream;
and it is supposed not to have passed into Chili, although in Peru it exists in great numbers,
where it is preserved to act the part of a scavenger.

It is a solitary bird, and goes in pairs; and may at once be recognised at a distance, from
its lofty soaring and most elegant flight.  It ranges from North America to Cape Horn.

Such are some of the more notable members of the feathered tribes inhabiting the Valley of
the Amazon.  There are numberless others,--both land and water birds,--a description of which
would occupy too much space, some of them also being common to other parts of the world. Several,
likewise, are seen more frequently either in Venezuela and Guiana, or in the La Plata region,
and will be noticed when we visit those countries.

From the Birds, then, we will pass on to the Reptiles and Insects of South America; in which,
as to number and the variety of their forms and habits, it equals, if it does not surpass,
any portion of similar size of the Old World, in the same latitude.

PART THREE, CHAPTER FOURTEEN.

REPTILES.

ALLIGATORS.

Along the river-banks, in every igarape, stream, and pool, the hideous and ravenous alligator
lurks for its prey.  It is greatly dreaded by the natives for its treachery and cunning, numbers
falling victims to its powerful jaws.  The largest, the jacare-uassu, or great cayman, is often
found from fifteen to twenty feet long, and of enormous bulk.

There is a smaller species, the jacari-tinga, which has a long slender muzzle, and black banded
tail.  This, when full-grown, is about five feet long.

A still smaller one exists, said to be found only in shallow creeks.  It does not attain, when
full-grown, a length of more than two feet.  Its eggs are rather larger than those of a hen,
and oval in shape, the shell having a rough, hard surface.  So numerous are they, that Bates
observes "it is scarcely exaggeration to say that the waters of the Solimoens are as well stocked
with alligators in the dry season, as a ditch in England is in summer with tadpoles."

Like the turtle, the large alligator has its annual migrations.  During the wet season it retreats
to the interior pools and flooded forests, and descends to the main river in the dry season.
During the hot months, when the pools are dried-up, and the alligator cannot reach water, it
buries itself in the mud, and becomes dormant, sleeping till the rainy season returns.

As the alligator cannot turn its head, it is little feared on shore, as a person can easily
leap out of its way; but he must beware of its tail, which, when angry, it will lash about
in a furious manner, sufficient to break a limb.  The alligator never attacks human beings
when on their guard, but, lying in wait, seizes them when he can venture, to do so with impunity.
These savage saurians are called indiscriminately, though improperly, alligators, crocodiles,
and caymans.

The real alligator is distinguished by having its toes only partly webbed--the outer ones being
free.  It will never willingly seek an encounter, and shows great terror, even, when attacked
by dogs.  The creatures are often killed by jaguars, who pounce upon them, and with their powerful
claws tear out their entrails.  But when aroused to anger it blindly attacks all opponents,
and is then a truly formidable foe. With a single blow of its tail it can overturn a canoe.
The instant it seizes its prey it sinks with it below the surface, to devour it at its leisure.
It usually feeds on fish, fowl, turtle, or any creature it finds floating on the surface of
the water; but when these fail, it lies concealed among the sedges on the banks, waiting for
any land animal which may approach to drink.  Sometimes it thus retaliates on the jaguar, and
seizing the fierce brute, drags it down below the surface, where it is soon drowned.

The great alligator usually lays fifty or sixty eggs, rather oblong than oval, and about the
size of those of a goose,--covering them up with sand, and allowing them to be hatched by the
heat of the sun.  The mother, however, does not desert her young, but conducts them to the
water, and watches over them till their scales have hardened, and their limbs have gained sufficient
strength to enable them to take care of themselves.

Waterton relates an anecdote showing the daring ferocity of the creature when pressed by hunger.
It was on the banks of the Orinoco, near the city of Angostura.  The tale was told him by the
governor of that place.  The monster plunged into the river with its prey, and we instantly
lost sight of him, and never saw or heard of him more."

Bates also relates that a native crew, having arrived at Egga, got drunk, when one of the men,
during the greatest heat of the day, while everybody else was enjoying an afternoon nap, took
it into his head, while in a tipsy state, to go down alone to bathe.  He was seen only by a
feeble old man, who was lying in his hammock in the open verandah at the rear of his house,
at the top of the bank.  He shouted to the besotted Indian to beware of an alligator which
had of late taken to frequenting the neighbourhood.  Before he could repeat his warning, the
man stumbled, and a pair of gaping jaws, appearing suddenly above the surface, seized him round
the waist, and drew him under the water.  A cry of agony--"Ai Jesus!"--was the last sound made
by the wretched victim.  The young men of the village, going in search of the monster, came
up with it when, after a little time, it rose to breathe, with one leg of the man sticking
out from its jaws.  It was immediately despatched, with bitter curses.

One night Bates and his party were asleep in their hammocks in an open shed on the banks of
the river, with a fire made up in the centre.  He was awoke by his attendants hurling burning
firewood, with loud curses, at a huge cayman which had crawled up the bank, and passed beneath
his hammock towards the place where a little dog lay asleep.  The dog had raised the alarm
in time.  The reptile backed out, and tumbled down the bank into the water, the sparks of the
brands hurled at him flying from his back and sides.  Notwithstanding this, the next night
he repeated his visit.

The alligator, in its daring attempts to seize human beings, does not always come off victorious.
An Indian and his son had gone down to the water, when the boy, whilst bathing, was seized
by the thigh, and carried under.  The father, rushing down the bank, plunged after the rapacious
beast, which was diving away with its victim.  He followed it unarmed, and overtaking the creature,
thrust his thumb into its eye, and forced it to release its booty.  The lad, who was present
when the story was told, exhibited the marks of the alligator's teeth in his thigh.

On another occasion an alligator was shot by one of the passengers on board a steamer, and
hauled up on deck.  When the knife was applied, it showed that it still possessed some sparks
of life, by lashing out its tail, and opening its enormous jaws, sending the crowd of bystanders
flying in all directions.  It is extraordinary how tenacious the creature is of life, and what
a prodigious amount of battering it may receive and still live.

Fortunately for other animals, the young alligators have numerous enemies, even the males of
their own kind occasionally gobbling them up; while they are terribly persecuted by wild beasts
and birds of prey,-- the latter esteeming their soft bodies delicate morsels, and frequently
pouncing down into their midst and carrying them off.

The alligator, far from being a silent animal, as is generally supposed, makes a hideous noise
at times, bellowing with so singular a cadence and loud a din, that he can even outroar the
jaguars and mycetes.

Sir Richard Schombergh describes the way in which the alligator seizes its prey.  He secured
a bird or fish to a piece of wood, and then turned it adrift on the river.  No sooner was it
seen than a cayman, slowly and cautiously approaching--without even rippling the surface of
the water-- and then curving its back, hurled its prey by a stroke of its tail into its wide-extended
jaws.

It makes also a loud sound, by clacking its teeth, and lashing its tail on the water.  It has
a voice not readily to be distinguished from that of the animals of the forest.  It is similar
to a hollow suppressed sigh bursting forth on a sudden, loud enough to be heard a mile off.
First one gives vent to this fearful sound, then another answers from a distance; and from
up and down the river, and across the current, these horrible noises are heard, showing that
the hideous saurians are in a lively mood, watching for their suppers.  It is supposed that
when once they have tasted human flesh they will always endeavour again to procure it.

Humboldt mentions another instance, where an Indian, landing on the banks of a shallow lagoon,
was seized by a cayman.  With wonderful presence of mind the Indian searched for a knife, but
not finding it, he pressed his fingers into its eyes.  The monster, however, did not let go,
but dragged the unfortunate man down into deep water, and, to the horror of several spectators,
was seen swimming off with the poor fellow in its jaws, to devour him on a neighbouring island.

Humboldt states that during the inundations of the Orinoco, alligators have been known to crawl
into the streets of Angostura and carry off human beings.

Schombergh once saw an enormous cayman seize one of a smaller species, and bear it away--not,
however, without a desperate struggle.  In a short time the monsters reappeared, wildly beating
the surface with their tails.  Now a huge head rose up, now a tail, indistinctly seen in the
seething whirlpool.  At length, however, the larger was beheld swimming off to a sand-bank,
where it immediately began to devour its prey.

THE IGUANA.

See yonder hideous-faced creature, nearly six feet in length, the size of many alligators,
its head covered with scaly plates, a huge dewlap depending from its throat, its body and long
tail covered with small imbricated scales, its back garnished with a row of spines, and on
its thigh a number of porous tubercles, while its legs and claws are wide-spreading.

As it crawls along a bough overhead, the bravest man who had never before seen it would undoubtedly
get out of its way, expecting it to leap down and seize him.  Yet the iguana, ugly as is its
countenance, is perfectly harmless; except that it can give a sharp bite with its compressed
triangular and serrated teeth.  It lives generally on trees. When hard-pressed it takes to
the water, and swims with ease,--pressing its legs close to its sides, and sculling itself
on with its tail; while it can remain an hour or more under water without suffering.

The flesh of the iguana, unfortunately for itself, is considered excellent; and hunters go
out to catch it with a noose at the end of a long stick, which they cast round its neck, and
then by a sudden jerk pull it to the ground.  As the creature seems to fancy that it cannot
be reached on the bough, it seldom moves on the approach of the hunter, and is thus easily
caught.  It lashes out with its tail, however, and tries to bite, when once it finds itself
entrapped; and being also very tenacious of life, it is not killed without repeated heavy blows,
or a pistol-shot in its head.

The common iguanas are numerous in the neighbourhood of villages, where they climb the trees
for the sake of their fruit.  Some species lay their eggs--which are about an inch and a half
in length, and oblong--in hollow trees.  Others are known to do so in the sand, to be hatched
by the heat of the sun.  They are considered delicacies, and are much sought after in consequence.

The colour of the iguana changes, like that of the chameleon.  The Brazilians, indeed, call
it the chameleon.  Its food consists almost entirely of fruits and other vegetable substances,
though some species are supposed to be omnivorous.  The natives frequently tame it, when it
willingly allows itself to be carried about by its owner, though it at once distinguishes strangers.

There are, however, numerous species of iguanas; indeed, the family contains fifty genera--the
true iguanas being all inhabitants of the New World.  To its predecessor, which it closely
resembles in bony structure, the largest is but a mere pigmy--for that extinct monster must
have been about seventy feet in length, the length of the tail alone being fifty-two feet,
and the circumference of the body fourteen and a half feet; while its thigh-bone was twenty
times the size of that of the modern iguana.  Vast as was the inhabitant of the ancient world,
it was herbivorous, like that of the comparatively Lilliputian creature of the present day.

Everywhere the agile, beautifully-tinted lizards abound, sunning themselves on logs of wood,
or scampering over the sandy soil.  Now they may be seen turning round the trunk of a tree,
much as a squirrel does, watching the passer-by, and trying to keep out of sight.  Some are
of a dark coppery colour, others have backs of the most brilliant silky green and blue, while
others are marked with delicate shades of yellow and brown.

The largest of their family is the teguexin, or variegated lizard. Sometimes it is called the
safeguard, from the idea--probably an idle fable--that, like the monitors of the Nile, they
give notice of the approach of the alligator by their loud hissing.

There are several species which inhabit the hot, sandy plains, or dense, damp underwood near
the rivers and lakes.  One of them exceeds five feet in length, and is extremely active.  It
feeds almost entirely on snakes, frogs, and toads, but occasionally devours poultry, and breakfasts
off their eggs.  It is also somewhat of a cannibal, for though it will not eat its own species,
it does occasionally those of a somewhat smaller lizard allied to it.  It possesses strong
teeth, and can bite with great force; indeed, when attacked it defends itself fiercely, and
when seizing a foe can seldom be compelled to let go.

Its colour is variable, but generally the upper parts of the body are deep black, with mottlings
of yellow or green; while on the higher portions of its sides are a series of white spots,
the under part being chiefly yellow, with black bands.

The little ameiva, on which it occasionally preys, is of a dark olive colour, speckled with
black about the neck.

There is another large lizard, known as the great dragon (Ada Guianensis).  It is of an olive
colour, with yellow below, and mottled with brown; and frequently attains a length of six feet.
While the former cannot climb trees, it is a good swimmer.  The great dragon climbs with wonderful
agility, but is said not to be very much at home in the water.  It also bites fiercely.

Both are hunted for the sake of their flesh; while their eggs--of which thirty or forty are
laid--are considered great delicacies.

GECKOS.

Not only in the huts of the natives, but in the abodes of the wealthy white men, hid during
the day in dark corners, are numbers of dark grey, hideous-looking lizards, which, when night
comes on, crawl rapidly over the walls and ceilings, hunting for the flies and other insects
to be found there.  Repulsive as are these little geckos, and undeservedly possessing a bad
name for being poisonous, they are not only harmless, but render good service by the destruction
of numerous household pests. Their large eyes are so constructed that they can discern objects
in the dark, and are at the same time capable of bearing the rays of the bright sun.  Their
colour, too, enables them to escape detection by the creatures which attack them, while they
are thus hid from the prey for which they lie in wait.  They can also bend themselves in an
extraordinary way into hollows and crevices.

But their feet are especially curious, being admirably adapted for clinging to and running
over smooth surfaces.  The under side of their toes is expanded into cushions, beneath which
folds of skin form a series of flexible plates.  By means of this apparatus they can run or
crawl across a smooth ceiling with their backs downwards--the soft soles, by quick, muscular
action, exhausting and admitting air alternately.  They are also provided with sharp claws,
which enable them to climb up the trunks of trees, and over rough surfaces.

The Brazilians call them osgas, and believe that they poison by their touch whatever they pass
over.  Probably, however, if any annoyance does arise from them, it is when with their sharp
claws they run across a sleeping man, or small blisters have been raised by the adhering apparatus
at the bottom of their feet.  By some "the spider, which taketh hold with her hands," is believed
to be a gecko, as a species of this creature is very common in the East.  The popular prejudice
against them causes the death of many a poor gecko, who, had he been allowed to live, would
have rendered good service to his persecutors.  Those in the houses are of small size; but
others, existing in the forest, and living in the crevices of the trees, are of considerable
magnitude.  Their tails are easily struck off--the loss being, however, as is the case with
other lizards, repaired by a new growth, though less perfect than the original member.

THE ANACONDA.

With its ill-favoured head protruding above the surface of the water near the banks of slow-flowing
rivers, pools, and swamps, the vast anaconda lies in wait for its prey.  The fish swimming
along in its neighbourhood,--the birds which, rising from the reeds, skim by overhead,--the
animals which come to the banks to drink,--even man himself, have cause to dread a blow from
the snout, and the powerful coils of the huge water-serpent.  Its appearance is most hideous,
being very broad in the middle, and tapering abruptly at both ends.  Fish, and the smaller
animals, it swallows whole; but a larger animal it seizes by the nose with its powerful jaws,
and surrounds with the mighty coils of its huge body, pressing one coil upon another till it
crushes its prey to death.

Though generally found from twenty to thirty feet in length, it is said to attain a length
of forty feet; and one of that size is fully capable of swallowing an ox or horse,--there being
many instances of its having been done.  Its voracity is prodigious.  The French naturalist
Firmin found in the stomach of an anaconda a large sloth, an iguana four feet long, and a good-sized
ant-bear; all three in the same state almost as when they were swallowed--a proof that they
had been captured within a short time.  Bates relates that an Indian father with his son went
one day in their montario to gather fruit a short distance from Egga, when, landing on a sloping,
sandy shore, the boy was left to take care of the canoe while the man entered the forest. 
The boy was playing in the water under the shade of some myrtle and wild guava trees, when
a huge reptile stealthily wound its coils round him.  His cries brought the father to the rescue,
who, rushing forward, seized the anaconda boldly by the head, and tore its jaws asunder.

This formidable serpent lives to a great age; and Bates heard of a specimen being killed which
measured forty-two feet in length.  Those he measured were only twenty-one feet long, and two
feet in girth.  He was a sufferer, on one occasion, from one of these.  While on a voyage up
the river, his canoe being moored alongside the bank, the neighbourhood of which had been haunted
for some time past by one of the creatures, he was awoke a little after midnight, as he lay
in his cabin, by a heavy blow struck at the side of the canoe, close to his head.  It was succeeded
by the sound of a heavy body plunging into the water.  When he got up all was again quiet,
except the cackle of fowls in the hen-coop, which hung at the side of the vessel, about three
feet from the cabin door.  In the morning the poultry were found loose about the canoe, two
of the fowls being missing; while there was a large rent in the bottom of the hen-coop, raised
about two feet from the surface of the water. The Indians went in search of the reptile, which,
being found sunning itself on a log at the mouth of a muddy rivulet, was despatched with harpoons.

It is extremely tenacious of life; and though the head may be nearly cut off, and the entrails
taken out, it will still move about for a considerable time.  It is detested by the farmers
on the banks, as it has the habit of carrying off poultry, young calves, or any animal it can
get within reach of.  It is often seen coiled up in the corner of farm-yards, waiting for its prey.

The statement that the anaconda kills its prey by its pestilent breath, is wholly fabulous.
Waterton altogether denies the existence of any odour in the snake's breath.  It is possible,
however, that some species may produce a horrible stench, from a substance secreted in certain
glands near the tail--a fact which has probably given rise to the fable.

THE BOA.

Among the semi-civilised, idolatrous inhabitants of the continent, several snakes were objects
of worship.  The boa-constrictor especially was regarded as an emblem of strength and power,
from its vast size, and the fearful effect produced by its encircling coils as it winds itself
round the body of its victim.

See the creature as its shining body moves rapidly among the fallen leaves and dried husks
in the forest, rather like a stream of brown liquid than a serpent, with skin of varied colours!
Onwards it goes, with scarcely a perceptible serpentine movement.  Even the huge trunk of a
fallen tree does not stop it, but it glides over the impediment in its undeviating course,
making the dry twigs crack and fly off with its weight.  Now it stops, watching for its prey.
An agouti runs by, regardless of the seeming rivulet; but the hapless creature is seized by
the serpent's jaws, and those terrible folds surrounding the body--coil above coil--crush the
bones, till it becomes a mere mass of flesh.  And now it begins to suck in its prey; not lubricating
it, as is generally stated, although a large quantity of saliva surrounds the animal while
it is descending the monster's throat.  After a time the meal is finished, and the serpent--its
body greatly distended--remains at rest, unwilling to move, when it may be easily captured
by the daring hunter.

The body of the boa is of a rich brown colour.  A broad chain of large black spots, alternating
with white, runs along its back; while the scales round the eyes are set in a circle, separated
from those of the lips by two rows of smaller scales.  The jaws are not united, but attached
to the skull by muscles and ligaments, which enable it to dilate the mouth sufficiently to
swallow bodies much larger than itself.

The largest grow to a length of thirty feet and upwards; but boas ordinarily do not attain
more than twenty feet in length.

THE SPOTTED BOA.

The boa scytale, or spotted boa, is of a greyish colour, marked with round spots, and scarcely
inferior in size to the former.

THE RINGED BOA.

There is another species--the ringed boa, or boa cenchris--which, though growing to a considerable
size, does not attain that of the former species.

A curious species (the boa canina) has a large head, shaped somewhat like that of a dog; the
general colour a bright Saxon-green, with transverse white bars down the back.  The sides are
of a deeper green, and the belly is white.

Wallace describes a small one only eleven feet in length, but as thick as a man's thigh.  It
was secured by having a stick tightly tied round the neck.  It went about dragging its clog
with it, sometimes opening its mouth with a very suspicious yawn, and sometimes turning its
tail up into the air.  Being put into a cage, and released from the stick, it began to breathe
most violently, the expirations sounding like high-pressure steam escaping from a Great Western
locomotive.

The boa, however, is not much dreaded in South America, as it seldom or never attacks man;
which the anaconda is said always to do, if it can find him unprepared.  Stories are told of
desperate encounters between travellers in the forests of the Amazon and pythons or boas. 
A French traveller narrates how, on one occasion, the whole of his attendants took to flight
on seeing a huge python approaching,--with the exception of a gallant native, who, attacking
the monster vigorously with a long, lithe pole, struck it a blow which paralysed its powers;
when, the party returning, it was easily killed.

THE RATTLESNAKE.

Venomous as is the bite of the rattlesnake, and abounding as it does in all parts of the continent,
it is less dreaded than many other serpents. It is, in the first place, very sluggish in its
habits; and it is happily compelled to bear about it an instrument which gives notice of its
approach and intention of biting.  The South American rattlesnake-- the Boaquira crotalus horridus--has
the rattle placed at the end of the tail.  It consists of several dry, hard, bony processes,
so shaped that the tip of each upper bone runs within two of the bones below it.  By this means
they have not only a movable coherence, but also make a multiplied sound, each bone hitting
against the others at the same time. The rattle is placed with the broad end perpendicular
to the body, the first joint being fastened to the last vertebra of the tail by means of a
thick muscle under it, as well as by the membranes which unite it to the skin.  Indeed, an
idea of this curious structure may be formed by placing a number of thimbles one within the
other.  These bony rings increase in number with the age of the animal; and they are generally
found with from five to fourteen.  The sound produced has been compared to that of knife-grinding.
It cannot be heard at a distance, and in rainy weather is almost inaudible.

The effects of the bite vary according to the season of the year; indeed, at times it will
seldom strike a foe, and the venom is comparatively mild in its effects.  At other times the
poison is of deadly intensity, and, should a large vein be bitten, the victim speedily dies.

Waterton describes handling a number of rattlesnakes--removing them from one apartment to the
other--with his hands alone.  They hissed and rattled when he meddled with them, but did not
offer to bite him. Possibly this might have occurred during the time when they were sluggish,
and their venom less deadly.

The little peccary is a great enemy of the rattlesnake, as it is of all other serpents, and
ordinary hogs destroy it easily without suffering from its bite; so that as man makes progress
through the country and introduces these animals, rattlesnakes speedily disappear.

Although the fascinating powers of the rattlesnake have been doubted, it seems probable that
small birds and animals are frequently attracted when they catch sight of it coiled up on the
ground below the branches on which they are posted--and, if not fascinated, fall through terror
into its open jaws; or it may be that, influenced by the same overpowering impulse which induces
human beings to rush into danger, the animal or bird, on beholding its deadly enemy, approaches
it against its own will, and is drawn nearer and nearer, till it either falls into the deadly
fangs, or comes near enough to be entrapped.

Bates was one day in a forest with a little dog, which ran into a thicket and made a dead-set
on a large snake whose head was raised above the herbage.  The serpent reared its tail slightly
in a horizontal position, and shook its terrible rattle.  It was some minutes before he could
get the dog away.  This shows how slow the reptile is to make the fatal spring.

On another occasion, he heard above his head, as it seemed, a pattering noise, when the wind,
which had been blowing, lulling for a few moments, he discovered that it proceeded from the
ground, and, turning his head, was startled by a sudden plunge, a heavy gliding motion betraying
a large rattlesnake making off almost beneath his feet.

THE FER DE LANCE.

More dreaded than the jaguar or alligator is the jararaca--the native name for the terrible
serpent, the fer de lance (Craspedo cephalus lanceolatus).  The hideous creature, with brown
colour, flat, triangular head, connected to its olive-tinted body by a thin neck, lies coiled
up among a heap of leaves, from which it can scarcely be distinguished till the passer-by is
close upon it; then suddenly it rears its head, which is armed with four long poisonous fangs,
and, darting forward, strikes its victim with a deadly blow.  Man, as well as all animals,
dreads it-- except the hog, and its relative, the little peccary, which are indifferent to
the effects of its poison.

On human beings its bite is generally fatal.  Bates mentions several instances of death from
it, and only one clear case of recovery,--but in that instance the person was lame for life.
Although most other serpents fly from man, the jararaca frequently attacks him; leaping from
its concealment among the leaves, and inflicting a wound which in a few hours produces death.
The first symptoms caused by the poison are convulsions, pains at the heart, and distressing
nausea, the whole nervous system appearing to be greatly affected.  The only known remedy is
the copious use of spirits, a large amount of which is required to counteract the enervating
power of the poison.

The jararaca is generally six feet long, but sometimes reaches the length of eight feet.  It
is marked with dark cross bands, while below it is of a whitish-grey hue, covered with small
dark spots.

Even birds seem to have a slight dread of this fearful serpent, and may be seen hovering about
the spot where it lies coiled up, uttering cries and screams, produced by fear and anger.

THE BUSHMASTER.

Almost as much dreaded as the jararaca is the enormous cuanacouchi (Lachesis mutus), or bushmaster,
as it is called in Demerara.  Its proper name is the curucucu.  It sometimes reaches to a length
of fourteen feet, being the largest known poisonous snake.  It is equally remarkable for the
glowing radiance of its fearful beauty, displaying as it does, when gliding amid the sunshine,
all the prismatic colours. Though generally remaining on the ground, it mounts trees with perfect
ease in search of its prey--birds or their eggs; while from the overhanging bough it can dart
down on the unwary passer-by.

It is said that furious battles sometimes occur between snakes of different species,--that
the boa will watch for the rattlesnake as it issues from its hole,--or that the latter will
sally forth, and, relying on its envenomed fangs for victory, attack the huge boa as it glides
by; though, as no naturalists appear to have witnessed such combats, it may be doubted whether
they ever take place.  But we may fancy how desperate would be the strife between a python
and the venomous bushmaster of Demerara.

LABARRI, OR ELAPS LEMNISCATUS.

The labarri--another beautiful snake, adorned with the colours of the rainbow--produces certain
death by its envenomed bite.  It, too, is a tree-climber, and may be seen lying coiled up on
a low, thick branch or decayed stump, or sometimes on the bare ground, apparently selecting
spots where it can be least easily distinguished.  Though generally smaller than the bushmaster,
it attains a length of eight feet or more.

WHIP SNAKES.

There are two or three species of whip snakes, or Dryadidae, remarkable for the slender elegance
of their forms, and in general for the great beauty of their colouring, as well as for the
rapidity of their movements.  The whip snake, having seized its prey, winds its light and lithe
body round its victim, coil upon coil, like the boa and anaconda, and strangles it in its embrace.

The emerald whip snake (Philodryas viridissimus) is one of the most beautiful.  So slender
is its body that, although two feet long or more, it can coil itself up within a space not
larger than the hollow of the hand.  It lives in trees, and may be seen sporting amid the branches;
but the moment it catches sight of a person, away it darts, scarcely moving the branches and
leaves amid which it makes its way.

THE GREEN SNAKE.

Delicate in form, and of the brightest grass-green--while, like the rest of its family, perfectly
harmless--the green snake is a great favourite with the Brazilians; and as it is easily tamed,
young girls may often be seen carrying it about, winding it round their throats or wrists,
forming it into living necklaces or bracelets.  It lives in trees, among the green foliage,
over which it rapidly glides in search of insects-- its usual food.

FROGS AND TOADS.

Frogs abound of all sizes, living in marshes, some on dry ground, and others inhabitants of
trees--many with voices which resound loudly through the midnight air.  Toads, too, are numerous,
some of enormous size.  They may be seen on bare, sandy places--huge fellows, seven inches
in length and three in height--crawling over the ground, utterly indifferent to the appearance
of a stranger among them.

Among the frogs is the curious tingeing frog (Hylaplesia tinctoria), which is an inhabitant
of the forest.  It may be seen during the day crawling along the branches, but at night it
takes up its abode under the loose bark.  Except during the breeding season, it seldom visits
the water.  It then, like the rest of its species, goes there for the purpose of depositing
its eggs.  It is generally of a dark colour-- sometimes quite black--with a white spot on the
head and two white lines running along each side.

It gains its name from the use the Indians are said to make of it.  They employ it as they
do the parrot-fish, to give a different colour to the plumage of their parrots.  To do this
they pull out the feathers from the spots to which they wish to impart a new tint, and then
rub the blood of the frog into the wounded skin.  When the new feathers grow, they are said
to be of a bright yellow or vermilion hue.

The bi-coloured tree-frog (Phyllomedusa bicolour) is of considerable size, and is the only
one of its family at present known.  The upper part of the body is of the deepest azure-blue,
while the under parts are of a pure white, sometimes of a rosy tinge.  The thighs and sides
are spotted with the same tinge as the abdomen.

Instead of being nocturnal in its habits, as other toads are, and living in obscure recesses,
it crawls about over dry hillocks and arid plains during the day, where not a single drop of
water can be found.  It depends on the dew for its moisture, which is probably absorbed by
the skin.  The creature seems to dread water, and is utterly unable to swim.

THE SURINAM TOAD.

The Surinam toad is one of the most curious, though, at the same time, among the most hideous
of batrachians.  It is remarkable on account of the extraordinary way in which its young are
developed.  The skin of the female is separated, as is the case with others of its family,
from the muscles of the back, and is nearly half an inch thick.  She deposits her eggs, or
spawn, at the brink of some stagnant water, when the male manages to take them up in his paws
and places them on her back, where they adhere by means of a glutinous secretion, and are pressed
into cells which, at that time, are open to receive them.  Gradually the cells are closed by
a membrane which grows over them, when her back greatly resembles a piece of honeycomb, the
cells of which are filled and closed.  Here, in the course of about three months, the eggs
are hatched, and the creatures undergo the usual change of the rest of the genus; first assuming
the form of tadpoles, and gradually acquiring their complete shape.  When perfected, and possessed
of their limbs, they work their way out of the cells; and it is a curious sight to see them
struggling out--their head and paws projecting in all directions from their mother's back--and
sliding down on the ground, when they begin to hop merrily about.

The cells are considerably deeper than wide, and each would contain an ordinary bean thrust
endwise into it.  The head of the creature is of an unusual shape, as it has a snout with nostrils
lengthened into a kind of tube.  The skin is of a brownish-olive above, and white below; and
is covered with a number of small, hard granules, with some horny tubercular projections among
them.  After the brood have left the mother's back, the cells again fill up--the whole process
occupying about eight days.

In spite of the repulsive appearance of the creature, the negroes occasionally eat it.

TORTOISES.

Tortoises (Testudinata, or Chelonians) belong to a very numerous order of reptiles, the usual
form of which is too well known to require description.  They are shut up, as it were, in a
box and breast-plate: the carapace and plastron, in reality, are external developments of certain
parts of the skeleton.

The land tortoises have the strongest plastrons.  In some species it is slightly movable, but
generally fixed by a uniting suture.  In one--the pyxis--the plastron is furnished with a transverse
hinge, so that the animal can retract its head and fore-limbs within the carapace, and close
the plastron upon it, first shutting them in.  In another--the kinixis--the carapace has the
posterior portion distinct from the anterior, and movable, so as to shield the hind-limbs and tail.

In water tortoises, or turtles, as they are generally called, the plastron is united to the
edges of the carapace by intervening cartilage, and not by suture.  The jaws of tortoises are
not furnished with teeth, but are cased in horny coverings, resembling somewhat the sharp hooked
beak of a parrot; which enable them either to crop and mince the vegetable aliment on which
most of them live, or to masticate the small, living animals, such as birds and reptiles, of
which the food of others consists.  Round the outside of this beak are thick fleshy lips.

In the curious matamata, the jaws of which open very wide, these parts, instead of being armed
by a strong beak, are protected by a sheath of horn.

In the land tortoises, the feet are stump-like, the toes being enveloped in the skin, so that
they can move but slowly.  The marsh and lake tortoises have their feet palmated, to enable
them to move either on the water or on land.  In the turtles, these limbs appear in the form
of broad, flat, undivided paddles, well-adapted for moving in the water, but awkward as instruments
of locomotion, even on the level, sandy shores to which they resort at the breeding season.

The tortoise has a fleshy tongue like that of a parrot.  The brain is but slightly developed,
scarcely filling the cavity of the skull in the marine species.  At the same time, the animal
possesses great muscular irritability, and extreme tenacity of life.  All are oviparous, and
bury their eggs, which are hatched by the warmth of the sun.  The water tortoises, when seen
below the surface, move like birds in the air, the paddles flapping like wings.

The order is divided into four groups: first, Chersians, or the land tortoises; second, the
Elodians, or marsh tortoises; third, the Potamians, or river tortoises; fourth, the Thalassians,
or sea tortoises, generally called turtles.  These groups are again variously subdivided.

The waters of Tropical America abound with the second and third families.  The Elodians, found
in the shallow pools of the Amazonian Valley, swim with facility, and move quickly over the
ground.  They feed not only on vegetables, but prey on living animals--river molluscs, and
other water creatures.

The Potamians, which are found in vast numbers in the larger rivers, grow to a great size,--some
weighing seventy pounds.  They feed much as the last described.  They swim with ease, both
on the surface and at mid-water.  The upper part of the body is generally brown or grey, with
regular dotted spots; while the under parts are pale white, rosy, and bluish.  When they seize
their food, they dart out their heads and long necks with the rapidity of arrows, and bite
sharply with their trenchant beaks, not letting go till they have taken the piece out.  The
females are said to be far more numerous than the males; indeed, Father Gumilla, describing
the turtles of the Orinoco, states what might be doubted,-- that "in each nest of eggs there
is one, larger than the rest, from which the male is hatched.  All the others are females."
The eggs are spherical; their shell solid, but membraneous or slightly calcareous.

A further description of them will be given when the mode in which they are captured is described.
The species, however, deserves particular notice.

THE CHELYS MATAMATA.

Grotesque, and unlike what we fancy a reality,--such as those creatures which the wild imagination
of the painters of bygone days delighted in producing,--is the curious matamata (Chelys matamata),
found along the banks of the Amazon, as well as in Guiana.  It is covered with armour on the
back, neck, and head.  On its head it wears what looks like a curiously-shaped helmet, with
a long tube in front, which serves as a snout; while its feet are webbed, and armed with sharp
claws at the end of its thick, powerful legs.  From the chin hang down two fringe-like membranes,
and the throat and neck are similarly ornamented.  It is often three feet long; and, from its
formidable appearance, it might easily make a stranger eager to get out of its way.  This helmet
consists of two membraneous prolongations of the skin, which project on either side from its
broad and flattened head.  A long, flexible, double tube forms its snout.  The shield on the
back is marked with three distinct ridges, or keels, along it, and is broader before than behind.
It has a stumpy, pointed tail.

This curious monster, concealing itself among the reeds on the bank, lies in wait for its prey,
darting forward its long neck, and seizing with its sharp beak any passing fish, reptile, or
water-fowl; or, should they not come near enough, it swims at a great rate after its prey.

PART THREE, CHAPTER FIFTEEN.

WONDERS OF INSECT LIFE.

TERMITES, OR WHITE ANTS.

The great ant-eater, dozing during the hot hours of the day within the shady coverts of the
forest, sallies forth in the cool of the evening to search for its insect prey on the open
Campos.  The surface of the ground is there, in many districts, raised into conical hillocks,
some five feet in height, and streaked by lines which differ in colour from the surrounding
earth, and lead in all directions, over decayed timber and the roots of herbage, from one hillock
to the other.  These hillocks are the habitations of those curious small pale-coloured and
soft-bodied insects called termites, or white ants.  They differ very greatly from the true
ants in their mode of growth, or metamorphosis, though similar to them in their habits.

The true ant, when emerging from the egg, is a footless grub, and remains in the pupa, or quiescent
stage, inclosed in a membrane, till its limbs are developed.  The termites at once possess
the form they are to bear through life, except that the sexual individuals, during the latter
stages of their growth, gradually acquire eyes and wings.  They belong, indeed, to two very
dissimilar orders of insects.  The ant-bear, however, never troubles himself about this matter;
but, scraping away with his powerful claws, soon breaks open the citadel which the industrious
insects have formed during days of unremitting toil.

The mounds of the termites differ in composition.  Some, consisting of earth, are worked into
a substance as hard as stone.  The coloured lines on the ground mark the covered ways which
lead from the places where the insects obtain their food, or the materials for their habitations.
The mounds exhibit no openings for egress or ingress.  They are often formed by several distinct
species of termites, each of which keeps to its own portion of the mounds, and uses different
materials.  Within the fortress exist a vast number of chambers, with galleries connecting
them, composed sometimes of particles of earth, and at others of vegetable matter, cemented
by the saliva of the insects.  As they live on dry food, and in regions where no water is found,
it is supposed that they may possess the power of combining, by vital force, the oxygen and
hydrogen of their vegetable food, and thus form water.  This supposition, if correct, accounts
for the large amount of liquid which they employ in the construction of their cells.  The inhabitants
of these structures consist of differently formed insects, employed in various distinct occupations.
The most numerous are the labourers, who have to toil for the benefit of the community.  They
are sexless and blind; yet, without the power of sight, they are ceaselessly employed in the
construction of these curious mounds, or in taking care of the young, and in collecting and
bringing in food for the support of the population.  Then come the soldiers, who defend the
fortress, or, as more frequently happens, sacrifice themselves for the protection of the rest.
The two most important personages of the community are the king and queen, who are the parents
of future colonies.  These are always found in every perfect termitarium.  There are also a
large number of winged termites, male and female, who, at a certain period of the year-- generally
at the commencement of the rainy season--issue forth from the hive into the world.  Although
a large number are destroyed, a few escape, and, pairing, become the parents of fresh colonies.
The formation of a new citadel or colony takes place somewhat in the following manner:--On
a mound becoming overstocked, a party of workers, guarded by a body of soldiers, issue forth,
and commence a fresh edifice at a distance from the old one.  Here they form a large cell in
the centre, surrounded by numerous galleries leading to smaller cells.  From thence they run
their covered ways, in suitable directions, towards spots whence they can obtain their necessary
supplies of food and building materials.  This being accomplished, they go in search of a royal
pair; whom, when they have found, under a leaf or clod of earth, they conduct into the interior
cell, where they are installed in due state.  The newly-married couple, who have by this time
got rid of their wings, are considerably larger than the rest of the population, but are helpless
individuals, having neither the power of working nor fighting. The king soon dies; but his
consort, instead of pining for his loss, sets herself to work for the benefit of posterity,
by laying a countless number of eggs.  As soon as these are deposited the workers carry them
off, and place them in the cells, where they watch over them with the most vigilant care, supplying
the larvae with food as soon as they are hatched; and when the nursery becomes full, carrying
some off in their mouths to another cell.  While some are thus employed, others increase the
size of their abode by running fresh corridors round the edifice, and forming new cells; while
other parties, protected by soldiers, are foraging far and wide for food for the ever-increasing
population.

In process of time--always within twelve months--the numberless progeny of the queen become
full-grown.  Some become developed into labourers, with smooth, rounded heads, and mouths adapted
for carrying loads and working up the materials for the construction of their abodes; others--
the fighting class--have heads of large size, provided with pointed weapons of defence of various
shapes, resembling, in different species, horns, pikes, rams; while others are furnished with
powerful jaws, resembling either sabres, swords, or sickles.  A third class appear with eyes,
and long, delicate wings--gay, happy creatures, far better formed, it would seem, to enjoy
existence than their hard-working brethren. These are the males and females of the community.
When they are prepared to issue forth from their birth-place, the labourers busily set to work
to clear a passage to allow of their speedy egress.  This takes place generally on a damp,
close evening or cloudy morning.  Countless numbers issue forth at intervals, till the whole
progeny of males and females have emerged from their pupa state.  They make a loud rustling
noise as they fly through the air in all directions; but they are immediately set upon by numberless
enemies,--goatsuckers, lizards, spiders, and ants,--who greedily eat them up.  On reaching
the ground they immediately divest themselves of their wings; and the few pairs which escape
from their foes seek safety in some hollow beneath a leaf or lump of earth, where they await
the arrival of the faithful labourers, who now come forth in search of them, and conduct them,
as has before been said, to the newly-formed abode prepared for their reception.  And thus
the wonderful process goes forward year after year.

So utterly helpless are these males and females, that, were it not for the assistance of other
individuals, the race would speedily become extinct.  The warrior termites are utterly regardless
of personal safety.  When their castle is attacked, they appear in vast numbers at the breach,
to cover the retreat of the labourers.  As the long tongue of the ant-eater is projected among
them, they throw themselves on it; and no sooner is one regiment swallowed up than another
rushes out to take its place--thus, by the sacrifice of themselves, enabling the rest of the
community to seek safety in flight.

SAUBA ANTS.

Of the numerous true ants which exist in all parts of Tropical America, the sauba is one of
the most remarkable.  In all parts of the country-- as well near the abodes of man as in the
distant wilds--large mounds are seen, two feet in length, and often upwards of forty yards
in circumference, and distinguished from the surrounding soil by the difference of colour.
Yet these mounds are merely the domes or upper works of the vast subterranean galleries which
run for enormous distances and to great depths below the surface.  Unlike the termites, the
armies go forth in open daylight in vast hordes, to obtain food or materials for the construction
of their wonderful habitations. Sometimes, many hundred yards away from these mounds, the whole
ground seems covered with animated leaves, each of the size of a sixpence, moving at a steady
pace over the ground.  Each leaf is held vertically in the mandibles of an ant, which is conveying
it for the purpose of thatching the domes which cover the entrance to its subterranean abode;
the roof thus formed protecting the cells beneath, rilled with young, from the heavy rains.
Going in the direction whence the army is seen coming, we may find a tree covered by innumerable
multitudes employed in cutting off leaves.  Here the labourers are protected by the warrior
class, who appear also to perform the duties of overlookers, and keep them to their tasks.
Each ant, on gaining a leaf, commences with its scissor-like jaws to make a semicircular incision
on the upper side.  It then takes it into its jaws, and detaches it by a sharp jerk.  Having
done this, it descends to the ground, and joining its comrades, who have been similarly employed,
they return with their loads to the colony. Frequently, however, while an ant is up the tree,
the piece of leaf falls to the ground, when it sets to work to cut off another; while fresh
labourers appear, to carry away the pieces which have thus accumulated.

The sauba ants are greatly dreaded by the inhabitants, as they frequently attack their coffee
and orange-trees, and utterly destroy them.  Sometimes, indeed, plantations have to be abandoned
in consequence of the inroads of these persevering insects.

The body of the sauba ant is of a pale reddish-brown colour, and of a solid consistency.  The
head is armed with a pair of sharp spines, while the thorax has three pairs of the same character.

There appear to be three orders of workers among them, greatly differing in size.  One order
has an enormously large head; the head of another is very highly polished; while that of a
third is opaque--to enable it, apparently, to perform the duties of a subterranean labourer.
The earth of which the domes of the sauba ants are composed is brought up from a considerable
depth below.  There are numerous entrances leading to the galleries, but, under ordinary circumstances,
they are kept closed.  The smaller galleries lead, at a depth of several feet, to a broad,
elaborately-worked tunnel of four or five inches in diameter, which conducts downwards to the
centre chamber; the abode of the royal pair, on whom devolves--as is the case with the termites--the
duty of propagating the species.  Here they are guarded much in the same way by the labourers,
who deposit the eggs in the cells, and finally assist in the exit of the winged males and females--which
fly forth to be destroyed in vast numbers, the few who remain becoming the parents of other
families.

The female winged ants are of considerable size, measuring fully two and a quarter inches across
the wings.  The male is very much smaller.

The royal chamber is curiously constructed.  As soon as the newly-wedded pair are conducted
within, the workers, who are themselves much smaller, so diminish the size of the entrance
that it is impossible for the king and queen to escape.  Round it are numerous exits and entrances,
through which the workers convey the eggs when laid.  The queen, after the death of her consort,
lives for two or three years, employed during the whole of the time in laying eggs, at the
rate of fifty in a minute.  This will give some idea of the rapid increase of the population.

The workers vary somewhat in size and appearance.  While a large number are employed in bringing
in leaves and granules of earth for thatching their domes, as well as various sorts of provision,
others are engaged in tending the royal chamber--carrying the eggs to the cells, and watching
over the young.  There is another class, whose heads are covered with hairs, and who appear
to be employed entirely below ground, probably as excavators or tunnellers.

Like the Cyclops, they have in the centre of their forehead a single eye, very different in
structure to the compound eyes on the sides of their head.  The other workers do not possess
this peculiar frontal eye, nor is it found in any other species of ant.

It is wonderful what extensive tunnels these ants will form.  Near Rio de Janeiro a tunnel
was discovered, excavated by the creatures under the River Parahiba, as broad as the Thames
at London Bridge.  Near Para they, on one occasion, pierced the embankment of a large reservoir
to such an extent as to allow the escape of a vast body of water before the damage could be
repaired.  In the same neighbourhood an attempt was made to destroy their colonies, by blowing
fumes of sulphur down the galleries by means of bellows.  Mr Bates relates, that he saw smoke
issuing from a vast number of outlets, one of which was seventy yards distant from the place
where the bellows were used.

They wander to a great distance in search of plunder, and enter houses for the purpose of carrying
off the farina or mandioca meal.  The same naturalist relates that he was one night awoke by
his servant telling him that rats were robbing the farina baskets.  On listening, he was certain
that the noise was unlike that made by rats.  On going to the storeroom he there found a broad
column of sauba ants, consisting of thousands of individuals, passing to and fro between the
door and his baskets of meal.  Most of those passing outwards were loaded each with a grain
of farina, larger and many times heavier than the bodies of the carriers.  The baskets, which
were on a high table, were entirely covered with ants, many hundreds of whom were employed
in snipping the dry leaves which served as a lining; and this had produced the rustling sound
which had disturbed him.  He and his servant in vain attempted to exterminate them by killing
them with their wooden clogs.  Fresh hosts came on to take the place of the slain.  The next
night they returned, when he attempted to get rid of them by laying trains of gunpowder along
their line to blow them up.  Not, however, till he had repeated this operation several times,
did the survivors of the daring depredators retreat.

THE AMPHISBAENA.

A curious snake, with something the character of the English slow-worm, the amphisbaena--called
by the natives Mai das Saubas, or the mother of the saubas--is frequently found in these mounds.
The natives believe that the ants treat it with great affection, and will, if the snake is
removed, leave the spot.  It is probable, however, that the amphisbaena takes up its abode
in the nest for the convenience of devouring the inhabitants, whenever unable to procure other
food.

Some of the American ants are of great size.  One species (the Dinoponera grandis) is an inch
and a quarter in length, and proportionally stout.  It is seen marching in single file through
the forest; but though of considerable size, its sting is not severe, while there is nothing
particularly interesting about its habits.

ECITONS.

There are, however, several species of foraging ants, called ecitons, which move in vast bodies
through the forest in search of prey.  They are carnivorous, and attack not only insects and
grubs of all sorts, but even other ants,--assaulting their citadels and carrying off the slaughtered
inhabitants.  The natives, when they meet them in the forest, hurry out of their way, to avoid
their fierce attacks.  Their communities appear to be composed, besides males and females,
of two classes of workers, one with head and jaws very much larger than the others.

One species of these foraging ants is known as the Eciton rapax, the larger workers among which
are half an inch in length.

The two common species of ecitons are, Eciton hamata and Eciton drepanophora, which are very
similar in their habits and appearance.

They are of the most pugnacious character, and a person incautiously getting in their midst
finds himself furiously attacked.  They climb up his legs, and, holding on by their pincer-like
jaws, double in their tails, and sting with all their might.  The natives, on seeing them,
cry out, "Tauoca"--the name which they give to the ecitons--and scamper off to a distance.
The only way of getting rid of them is to pluck them out one by one; but so securely do they
fasten themselves to the skin, that their head and jaws are left sticking to it.

As they advance through the forest, the creatures on which they prey endeavour to get out of
their way; but vast numbers of maggots, caterpillars, larvae, and ants of other species fall
victims to their ferocity.  They advance in a long column live or six deep, while thinner columns
forage on either flank, till they arrive at a mass of rotten wood abounding in insect larvae,
when they surround it, and do not again move forward till every particle of food has been carried
off!

When they discover a wasp's nest, they attack the papery covering to get at the larvae pupae
and newly-hatched wasps.  In spite of the rage of the parents, who vainly keep flying about
them, they carry off their spoil in fragments; the carriers having their loads apportioned
to their size--the dwarfs taking the smaller pieces, and the stronger fellows the heavier portions.
Sometimes two ants join in carrying one piece.

ROBBER ECITONS.

Another species (the Eciton legionis) has been known to attack other ants' nests for the sake
of plunder.  Mr Bates saw an army of them employed on the face of an inclined bank of earth.
They were excavating mines to get at the nest of a larger species of ant of the genus Formica.
Some were rushing into the passages, others were seen assisting their comrades to lift out
the bodies of the formicae, while others were tearing them in pieces--their weight being too
great for that of a single eciton.  A number of carriers then seized each a fragment and carried
it down the slope.  When the naturalist dug into the earth with a small trowel, the eager freebooters
rushed in as fast as he excavated, and carried off the ants, so rapidly tearing them in pieces
that he had great difficulty in rescuing a few entire specimens.

The little ecitons seemed to be divided into parties, some excavating, others carrying away
the grains of earth.  When the shafts became rather deep, the mining parties had to climb up
the sides each time they wished to cast out a pellet of earth; but their work was lightened
by their comrades, who stationed themselves at the mouth of the shaft and relieved them of
their burdens, carrying the particles to a sufficient distance from the edge of the hole to
prevent them rolling in again. All the work seemed thus to be performed by intelligent co-operation
among the host of eager little creatures.  Still, there was not a rigid division of labour;
for some of them, whose proceedings he watched, acted at one time as carriers of pellets, and
at another as miners, and all shortly afterwards assumed the office of conveyers of the spoil.
In about two hours, all the nests of the formicae were rifled.

He frequently saw these little creatures engaged apparently in play, in the neighbourhood of
their homes.  Some were walking slowly about, others were brushing their antennae with their
fore-feet; but the drollest sight was to see them cleaning one another.  Here and there an
ant was seen stretching forth first one leg, then another, to be brushed or washed by one or
more of its comrades; who performed the task by passing the limb between the jaw and the tongue,
finishing by giving the antennae a friendly wipe.

There are two species of blind ecitons--which, however, go on foraging expeditions, and even
attack the nests of other stinging species; but, avoiding the light, they move always under
leaves and fallen branches: when the columns have to pass a cleared space, the ants form covered
ways with granules of earth, arched over and holding together mechanically.

BLIND ANTS.

Two other species--Eciton vastator, and Eciton erratica--both of which are blind, move entirely
under covered ways in search of promising hunting-grounds.  Their arcades are sometimes two
hundred yards in length, the grains of earth being taken from the soil over which the column
is passing, and fitted together without cement.  In this they are distinguished from the covered
ways made by the termites, who use a glutinous saliva for cementing their edifices.  These
blind ecitons build up the side of their convex arcade, and in a wonderful manner contrive
so to fit in the key-stones, without allowing the loose uncemented structure to fall to pieces.
Whenever a breach is made in any of their covered ways, the workers remain behind to repair
the damage, while the soldiers issue forth in a menacing manner, rearing their heads, and snapping
their jaws with an expression of fiercest rage and defiance.

The above account will give some idea of the vast numbers and varieties of the termites and
ants of this region, and of the wonderful way in which Providence has furnished them with the
means of sustaining existence, and taking their part in the economy of nature.  Science is
deeply indebted to Mr Bates, for his persevering efforts and acute observation in making known
the varieties and habits of these curious insects.

CENTIPEDS--COCKROACHES--FIRE-ANTS.

Although the rest of the animal creation is small compared with the creatures of the Eastern
world, insects and reptiles attain a size which will vie with those of any portion of the globe.
Here we have a centiped nearly a foot in length, with innumerable legs, and two horns or feelers,
which it protrudes with the most venomous expression.  These animals are not only hideous to
look on, but their bite is very painful, though not dangerous.

Cockroaches swarm everywhere; but the fire-ant is, for its size, probably the most terrible
of created beings.  Its bite produces the most acute pain; and where they swarm, on the dry
sandy shores of the streams, they frequently compel the natives to desert their villages. Mrs
Agassiz mentions having on one occasion hung some towels to dry on the cord of her hammock,
and was about to remove them, when suddenly her hand and arm seemed plunged into fire.  She
dropped the towels as if they were hot coals, which for the moment they literally seemed to
be. She then saw that her arm was covered with little brown ants.  A native brushed them off
in all haste; and an army of them was found passing over the hammock, and out of the window,
near which it hung.  He said they were on their way somewhere, and if left undisturbed would
be gone in an hour or so.

INSECTS--FIRE-FLIES.

Of those diamonds of the night, the fire-flies and fire-beetles, there are numerous species.
One of the most abundant--and of much larger dimensions than the rest of the elaters or beetles--pyrophorus
noctilucus, called by the natives cocuja, displays both red and green light.  On the upper
surface of the thorax there are two oval tubercles, hard and transparent, like bull's-eye lights
let into a ship's deck. These are windows out of which shine a vivid green luminousness, which
appears to fill the interior of the chest.  Then on the under surface of the body, at the base
of the abdomen, there is a transverse orifice in the shelly skin, covered with a delicate membrane,
which glows with a strong ruddy light; visible, however, only when the wing-cases are expanded.
It is about an inch and a half long, of a brown colour, and has a strong spine situated beneath
the thorax, which fits at pleasure into a small cavity on the upper part of the abdomen.  By
means of this machine it can, when placed on its back, spring up a couple of inches, and regain
its feet.

So brilliant is the light of these creatures, that even one moved over the print of a book
wall enable a person to read by it, while eight or ten placed in a clear glass bottle serve
the purpose of a lamp.  The Brazilian ladies ornament their dresses with these fire-beetles,
by securing them so as not to injure the creatures; while they frequently wear several in the
braids of their dark hair, which, when they walk abroad in the evening, has a curious and beautiful
effect.  [Gosse and Darwin.]

Prescott relates that when the Spaniards first invaded America, on seeing the air filled with
cocujas during the darkness of night, their excited imaginations converted them into an army
with matchlocks, and they waited, expecting to be attacked by an overwhelming force.  A similar
story is told of the British, when first landing in the West Indies, being induced to hastily
re-embark on seeing at night innumerable lights moving about, which they supposed were Spaniards
approaching to defend the shore.

SUSPENDED COCOONS.

The forests of Brazil exhibit numerous beautiful examples of insect workmanship.  Among others
is the work of a caterpillar--a cocoon about the size of a sparrow's egg, woven in broad meshes
of either buff or rose-coloured silk, and seen suspended from the tip of an outstanding leaf
by a strong thread, five or six inches in length.  It forms a conspicuous object hung thus
in mid-air.  The glossy threads with which it is knitted are stout, and the structure is not
likely therefore to be torn by the beaks of insectivorous birds; while its pendulous position
makes it doubly secure against their attacks, as the apparatus gives way when they peck at
it.  There is a small orifice at each end of the egg-shaped bag, to admit of the escape of
the moth when it changes from the little chrysalis which sleeps tranquilly in its airy cage.

Other caterpillars form cases with fragments of wood or leaves, in which they live secure from
their enemies, whilst they are feeding and growing.  Some of these, composed of small bits
of stick, are knitted together with fine silken threads, and others make tubes very like the
cadis-worms of English ponds.  Others choose leaves, with which they form an elongated bag,
open at both ends, having the insides lined with thick webs.  As the weight of one of these
dwellings would be greater than the caterpillar inside could sustain, it attaches the case
by one or more threads to the leaves or twigs near which it is feeding.

LANTERN-FLY.

There is a large and beautiful insect, with an enormous transparent prolongation of the forehead,
which is supposed to have a resemblance to a lantern: it is called the lantern-fly (Fulgora
laternaria).  Though often described as possessing luminous properties, it is now known to
be destitute of any phosphorescence whatever.

THE TANANA.

[Chlorocelus tanana.]

Often through the woods a loud, sharp, resonant stridulation is heard, sounding like the syllables
"Ta, na, na," succeeding each other with little intermission.  It is produced by a species
of wood cricket, called by the natives after the sound it produces.  The total length of the
body is two inches and a quarter when the wings are closed.  The insect has an inflated bladder-like
shape, owing to the great convexity of the thin, firm, parchmenty wing-cases; the little creature
being of a pale green colour.  The instrument by which it produces its music is contrived out
of the ordinary nervures of the wing-case.  In each wing-case the under edge of the wing itself
has a horny lobe.  On one wing this lobe has a sharp raised margin, on the other the strong
membrane which traverses it on the under side is crossed by a number of fine and sharp furrows
like those of a file.  When the insect rapidly moves its wings, the file of the one lobe is
scraped sharply across the horny margin of the other, thus producing the sounds; the parchmenty
wing-cases and the hollow drum-like space they enclose assisting to give resonance to the tones.
These notes are the call notes of the males, inviting a mate to his burrow.  [Bates.]

WOOD BEETLES.

Enormous as are the trees of the Amazonian forests, and able to withstand the fiercest storms,
they have frequently to succumb to the attacks of minute insects.  Many a monarch of the woods
has been brought low by the efforts of the persevering termites; but they have other enemies.
The palm-trees are assailed by a group of beetles (the Histeridae) which take possession of
the moist interior of their stems. One of these is an enormous fellow--the hister maximus.
Another group have their bodies as thin as wafers, to enable them to live in the narrow crevices
of the bark.  One set of species, however (the trypanaeus), are totally different, being cylindrical
in shape.  They drill holes in the solid wood, and look like tiny animated gimlets when seen
at work; their pointed heads being fixed in the wood, while their smooth glossy bodies work
rapidly round so as to create little streams of sawdust from the holes.

The caribi, which in Europe perform the important duty of scavengers, and live on the ground,
are in South America nearly always found on trees.  Some are of enormous size.

The Hercules beetle, which lives on the mamma Americana, attains a length of five and sometimes
six inches.  It is known by the singular horn-shaped proboscis rising from the head and thorax,
which gives it so formidable an appearance.  Its duty is probably to eat up the rotten wood.

Other members of the family,--known as the elephant, Neptune, and typhon,--excavate burrows
in the earth, living on the decomposed trunks of trees during the day, and flying about at
night with a loud humming noise--apparently to enjoy the air, of which they are deprived in
the daytime.

The megasominae is of an enormous size, as is also the beautiful Inca beetle.

Among the most beautiful beetles in the Brazils is the diamond beetle (Entrinus nobilis), of
a lustrous azure green, and with golden wings. With it, and other species, the ladies form
necklaces, and ornament their dresses.

In Venezuela, the cactus plants, which grow so abundantly, serve to nourish the valuable though
odd-looking little coccus cacti.  The male and female differ greatly.  The female resembles
a Lilliputian tortoise, and is of a dark brown colour, with two light spots on the back covered
with white powder.  The male, possessed of a pair of wings, is much smaller, and roves about
at will from plant to plant.  The female, a short time after she has become full-grown, secures
herself to a leaf, where she remains immovable.  She now grows to such a size, that she more
resembles a seed belonging to a plant than an insect, all her limbs being completely concealed
by her wide-expanded body.  In process of time, before the young insects are born, the cochineal-gatherers
detach the insect by means of a knife dipped in boiling water, which kills them.  They are
then dried in the sun, and appear like small dry berries of a deep mulberry colour.

SPIDERS.

Fear-inspiring is the appearance of the great crab-spider--the Mygale avicularia, one genus
of the formidable Arachnida family--with a body two inches in length, and, when the legs are
expanded, seven inches across, covered entirely with coarse grey, reddish hairs.  It lives
among the rocks in the drier regions; some dwell under stones, others form artistic tunnels
under the earth, and some build their dens in the thatch of houses.  Bates one day saw some
Indian children with one of these monsters secured by a cord round its waist, by which they
were leading it about the house as they would a dog.  The hairs with which it is covered come
off when touched, and cause a peculiar and almost maddening irritation.  This is, however,
probably owing to their being short and hard, and thus getting into the fine creases of the
skin, and not to any poisonous quality residing in the hairs.  These monstrous spiders prey
on lizards, small birds, and other diminutive vertebrates. Their muscular power is very great.
When the creature is about to seize its prey, it fixes its hind-feet firmly in the ground,
and lifting up the front ones, darts them forward, and fastens them with the double hooks which
terminate its feet between the cranium and the first vertebra, thus preventing the possibility
of their escaping.  Nothing will then tear it from its prey.  When pressed by hunger, it climbs
at night the trees and shrubs in which humming-birds and other small birds are perched, or
have built their nests, and springing on them, grasps them with its powerful claws.  It seizes
the anolis, a kind of water-lizard, in the same way.  The fact of its seizing on birds, so
long doubted, though asserted by Madame Marian, the French naturalist, has been corroborated
by Monsieur Jonnes, her countryman.  He states that it spins no web to serve it as a dwelling,
but burrows and lies in ambush in the cliffs and hollow ravines.  It often travels to a considerable
distance, and conceals itself under leaves, thence to dart out on its prey; or it climbs along
the branches of trees to surprise the humming-birds and other small tree-creepers.  Bates still
further settles the point.

With regard to the habits of another species which does spin a web, he says that, catching
sight of one of these spiders, he was attracted by its movements.  It was in the crevices of
a tree, across which was stretched a dense web.  The lower portion of the web was broken, and
two small birds,--finches,--were entangled in the pieces.  They were the size of the English
linnet, and probably male and female.  One was quite dead, the other lay dying under the body
of the spider, and was smeared with the filthy liquor or saliva exuded by the monster.

The mygale carries its eggs enclosed in a cocoon of white silk of a very close tissue, formed
of two round pieces uniting at their borders.  It supports this cocoon under its corselet by
means of its antennulae, and transports it along with itself.  When hard-pressed by its enemies,
it abandons it for a time, but returns to take it up as soon as the combat is concluded.  Nearly
two thousand eggs are contained in these cocoons.

The young ones when they appear are entirely white, gradually assuming the colour of the adult.

The falces, or reaping-hook claws, of the great crab-spider are of enormous size, and ai-e
sometimes set in gold and used as toothpicks, from the idea that they possess some medicinal
virtue to cure the toothache.

The different species vary very much in their habits.  One big fellow-- the Mygale Blondii--forms
a broad slanting gallery about two feet in length, the sides of which he lines beautifully
with silk.  Just before sunset he may be seen keeping watch near the mouth of his tunnel, disappearing
suddenly when he hears a heavy foot-tread near his hiding-place.

Many are of the most showy colours.  Some double themselves up at the base of leaf-stalks,
so as to resemble a flower, and thus deceive the insects on which they prey.  One of the most
extraordinary in appearance--the Arosoma arcuatum--has two curved, bronze-coloured spines,
an inch and a half in length, proceeding from its abdomen.  It spins a large web, those huge
spikes apparently being no impediment to its work.

BEES AND WASPS.

Bees and wasps of a countless number of species abound in every region of the continent.  Some
build their habitations, composed of a papery substance, attached to the under side of the
broad leaves of the tucuma and other palms.  Others, again, form them in hollow trees, or among
their roots in the earth.  Many build in houses, or pierce their mud walls till they look as
if riddled with shot.  Others make holes in the ground, especially in sandy places.  Others,
again, construct their habitations of clay, and fasten them to the boughs of trees or to buildings.
There are, indeed, mason bees, carpenter bees, and miner bees and wasps.

Watch the little, pale green bombex, or sand-wasp, at work, throwing out with its fore-feet
jets of sand from the hole it is forming in the sloping bank.  In a wonderfully short time
the female miner has formed a gallery two or three inches in length.  Out she backs, making
a few turns round the entrance to admire her work--or, probably, to take note of the locality--and
then away she flies.  She may be absent for a few minutes, or perhaps for an hour, according
to her success in hunting. At length back she comes with a big fly in her grasp, benumbed by
her sting.  She carries it in, lays an egg in the body, which will serve as food for the soft
footless grub soon to be hatched, and then closing the entrance, sets to work to form a new
nursery like the first, which she will furnish in the same careful manner.  It is curious how
she can find her way back, for often she has to go half a mile before she can find a fly to
suit her purpose.

Another species,--the Monedula signata,--as large as a hornet, is particularly useful in carrying
off the teasing flies, the bloodthirsty motucas, which buzz round the voyager on the Amazon
when at anchor near a sand-bank.  Bates was rather startled by seeing one fly directly at his
face, on which it had espied a motuca, and which it carried off, holding it tightly to its breast.

The pelopaeus wasp builds a nest of clay, shaped like a pouch, two inches in length, and attaches
it to a branch.  It forms the clay in little round pellets, kneading it with its mandibles
into a convenient shape, and humming cheerfully while engaged in its work.  On arriving with
the ball of moist clay it lays it on the edge of the cell, and then spreads it out round the
circular rim by means of the lower lip, guided by the mandibles--sitting astride while at work.
On finishing each addition it takes a turn round, patting the sides with its feet inside and
out, before flying off for a fresh pellet.  It feeds on small spiders, which it reduces to
a half dead state by its sting, thus to serve as food for its progeny.

One bee,--the Trypoxylon aurifrons,--builds a nest of clay like a squat round bottle or carafe;
generally in rows, one beside the other, on a branch, or in the corners of a building.

The melipona bees are the most numerous of the honey-producing insects, their colonies being
composed of vast numbers of individuals.  They are smaller than the English hive-bee, and have
no sting.  The workers collect pollen as do other bees, but a great number are employed in
gathering clay for forming walls as an outer protection to their nests. They first scrape the
clay with their fore-mandibles, passing it on to the second pair of feet, and then to the large
foliated expansions of the hind-shanks, patting it in the process, till the little hodsmen
have as much as they can carry, when they fly off with their loads to their nests.  One species
builds a tubular gallery of clay of a trumpet shape at the mouth.  Here a number of the pigmy
bees are stationed to act the part of sentinels.

Thus the melipona bees are masons as well as workers in wax and pollen gatherers.  Although
they have no sting, they defend their habitations, and bite furiously when disturbed.  Bates
found forty-five species of these bees in different parts of the country, and one hundred and
forty of other species.  Several of them were attended by drones, which deposit their ova in
the cells of the working bees, some of them having the dress and general appearance of their
victims.

BUTTERFLIES.

This is a region of magnificent butterflies.  In the neighbourhood of Para alone seven hundred
species have been found.  Many seldom leave the shady paths which pierce the forests; others,
however, occasionally come forth into the broad sunlight and more open glades.  See the slender
Morpho menelaus, with splendid metallic blue wings seven inches in expanse, flapping them as
does a bird as it flies along.

Far surpassing it, however, is the Morpho rhetenor; which, conscious of its beauty, revels
in the sunlight, but seldom ventures nearer than twenty feet from the ground.  So dazzling
a lustre have the upper wings of this butterfly, that when it flaps them occasionally, and
the blue surface flashes in the sunlight, it may be seen a quarter of a mile off.

Another species of the same genus has a satiny white hue; but, infinite as they are in number,
so most diversified are they in their habits, mode of flight, colours, and markings.  Some
are yellow, others bright red, green, purple, and blue.  Many are bordered or spangled with
metallic lines and spots of a silvery or golden lustre.  Some have wings transparent as glass.

One of these (the Hetaira esmeralda) is especially beautiful, having an opaque spot on its
wings, of a violet and rose hue; and as this is the only part visible when the insect is flying
low over the dead leaves of the darker recesses of the forest--where it is alone found--it
looks like the wandering petal of a flower.

Of moths, too, there are great numbers,--among them, the Erebus strix, the largest of its family,
sometimes measuring nearly a foot in expanse of wing.  In the open sunny spots the bright air
is often alive with superb dragonflies.  Upwards of one hundred species are found near Para.
Some live only in the gloom of the forest.  Often, however, they are the most beautiful, being
more brightly coloured and delicate in construction than the others.  Many delight to flit
over the igarapes and calm pools.

Among these, the Chalcopteryx rutilans has four wings, each transparent,--while the hind-wings,
of a dark colour, glitter with a violet and golden effulgence.  They all wage unceasing war
against the day-flying insects.  When one is captured, the dragon-fly retires to a tree, and
there, seated on a branch, devours the body at its leisure. It is wonderful the number of flies
which these beautiful insects destroy.  When evening comes on they eagerly fly off to the chase,
amid the swamps and around the tree-tops, or wherever their victims congregate.

PART THREE, CHAPTER SIXTEEN.

WONDERS OF THE FOREST.

Of the palms alone, upwards of a hundred species are found in these forests.  These supply
the Indian with nearly all he wants to support existence.  Their fruit, or pith, or crowns,
furnish him with an abundance of food.  He builds his hut and floors it with their wood, and
thatches it with their leaves.  From the trunks of some species he forms his canoes, of different
sizes.  He obtains from them oil, cord, thread, wine--or a beverage which answers the purpose--wax,
mats, baskets, arrows for his sumpitan or bow, and numberless other articles.  Pure, clear
oils are made from some of the nuts and palm fruits; while many palms yield a fibrous material
admirably suited for cordage, being singularly elastic and resistant.

From the curious candella-tree,--called by the Spaniards arbol de la manteca, by the Indians
cuajo,--he obtains tallow for candles and excellent oil for lamps, and a beverage which is
made from its fruit.

The cow-tree supplies a milk in appearance like that of the animal from which it takes its
name, but thicker.  On analysing this product, it is found to consist of water, animal milk,
and wax as pure as that obtained from bees.  By dipping cotton in the liquid, too, candles
can be made.

In the hotter regions grows the bajuco d'agua, which supplies the place of wells and fountains,--each
yard of it affording a pint of water. High up on the mountainside, in the regions of icy wastes,
called the paramos, grows the frailejou, which yields a pure turpentine, and assists to warm
the human body.  Of the palms, a few only can be described.  There is the cocoa-nut palm, with
its swollen bulb-like stem when young, its tall straight trunk when full-grown, its cluster
of heavy fruit, its long plume-like drooping flower; the coccoeiro, with its slighter trunk
and pendent branches of small berry-like fruit; the palmetto, with its tender succulent bud
on the summit of the stem, used as a vegetable, and proving an excellent substitute for cabbage;
the thorny icari, or cari--a variety of fan-palm.  Its spiny stems and leaves, which cut like
razors, make it difficult to approach.  Its bunches of bright chestnut-brown fruit hang from
between the leaves which form its crown, each bunch about a foot in length, massive and compact,
like a large cluster of black Hamburg grapes.

The syagrus palm has a greenish fruit, not unlike the olive in appearance, which hangs in large
pendent bunches just below the leaves. The fruit resembles somewhat that of the bread-tree,
but is more slender and cylindrical in form.

The leaves of different kinds of palms are used for thatching the Indian huts, the curua palm
among others.  When young, they grow closely round the mid-rib attached to the axis by a few
fibres only, so that when the mid-rib is held up they hang from it like so many straw-coloured
ribbons.  With these leaves both the walls and roofs are covered.  The mid-rib, which is strong,
and sometimes four or five yards long, is set across to serve as a support, and bind down the
pendent leaves.  Such a thatch will last for years, and is an excellent protection from rain
as well as sun.

The Indian furnishes himself with cups and vessels of all sorts from the cuieira-tree (Crescentia
cajeput).  It is of immense size, the fruit being like a gourd.  It is spherical, of a light
green shining surface, and grows from the size of an apple to that of the largest melon.  It
is filled with a soft white pulp, easily removed when the fruit is cut in halves.  The rind
is then allowed to dry.  Cups and basins of various sizes are made from it, which the Indians
adorn with a variety of brilliant colours.

One of the staple productions of the Upper Amazon is the guarana.  It is a trailing plant,
a sort of vine; when full-grown, about eight feet high, and bearing a bean the size of a coffee-bean,
two being enclosed in each envelope.  This bean, after being roasted, is pounded in a small
quantity of water till it becomes compact, and, when dry, is about the colour of chocolate.
It is then grated with the rough tongue of the piraracu, and when mixed with sugar and water
makes a refreshing beverage.  It is said to have an excellent effect when administered in cases
of diarrhoea.

ASPECTS OF THE FOREST.

Although at some times of the year the forests present only varied tints of green and brown,
unrelieved by brighter colours; at others, when, after the rains, nature has revived, the banks
of the streams are gay and beautiful in the extreme.  Thousands of brilliant blossoms of varied
colours rise amid the trunks of the trees, or hang in rich festoons from the branches, while
the air is laden with the almost overpowering perfume of numberless flowers.

"Wild flowers," says Mrs Agassiz, "are abundant; not delicate small plants growing low among
the moss and grass, but large blossoms covering tall trees, and resembling exotics at home
by their rich colour and powerful odour--indeed, the flowers of the Amazonian forests reminded
me of hot-house plants--and there often comes a warm breath from the depth of the woods laden
with perfume, like the air from the open door of a conservatory."

"Beautiful as are the endless forests, however," she remarks in another place, "we could not
but long, when skirting them day after day, without seeing a house or meeting a canoe, for
the sight of tilled soil, for pasture lands, for open ground, for wheat-fields and hay-stacks;
for any sign, in short, of the presence of man.  As we sat at night in the stern of the vessel,
looking up the vast river stretching many hundred leagues, with its shores of impenetrable
forests, it was difficult to resist an oppressive sense of loneliness.  Though here and there
an Indian settlement or a Brazilian village appears, yet the population is a mere handful in
such a territory."

Wonderful is the change in the appearance of the tropical representatives of well-known families
in the Old World.

The india-rubber tree belongs to the milk-weed family.  The euphorbiaceae assume the form of
colossal trees, constituting a considerable part of its strange and luxuriant forest growth.
The giant of the Amazonian woods, whose majestic flat crown towers over all other trees, while
its white trunk stands out in striking relief through the surrounding mass of green--the sumaumera--is
allied to the mallows of the North.  Some of the most characteristic trees of the river-shore
belong to these two families.

BUTTRESS TREES.

One of the most striking characteristics of the forest vegetation is the way in which many
of the trunks of the trees are supported by buttresses.  The huge sumaumera is especially remarkable;
but this disposition to throw out supports is not confined to one tree.  It occurs in many
families.  These buttresses start at a distance of about ten feet from the ground, separating
greatly towards the base, where they are often ten to twelve feet in depth.  The lower part
of the trunk is thus divided into several open compartments, so large that, if roofed over,
they would form a hut with sufficient space for two people to stand up or lie down in.  Others,
however, rise to the height of twenty or thirty feet, and run up in the form of ribs to forty
or fifty feet. Other trees appear as if they were composed of a number of slender stalks bound
together, and are ribbed to their entire height.  In some places the furrows reach completely
through them, and appear like the narrow windows of a tower.  The stems of others again rise
on the summit of numerous roots, like the bulging-stemmed palm, apparently standing on a number
of legs at the height of a dozen feet or more from the ground. Often the roots thus form archways
sufficiently large for a person to walk beneath.

SIPOS OR WILD VINES.

Circling round the stems of trees in innumerable coils, and grasping them with a deadly embrace,
grow in rich luxuriance countless wild vines, well meriting the name of murdering sipos.  They
hang in festoons from their boughs, and form an intricate tracery of network from tree to tree,--often
of sufficient strength to support the falling monarchs of the forest when time has wrought
decay among their roots.

Here are seen tillandsias and bromeliaceae, like the crowns of huge pineapples; large climbing
arums, with their dark green and arrow-head shaped leaves, forming fantastic and graceful ornaments
swinging in mid-air; while huge-leaved ferns and other parasites cling to the stems up to the
very highest branches.  These are again covered by other creeping plants; and thus we see parasites
on parasites, and on these parasites again.  As we gaze upwards, we see against the clear blue
sky the finely divided foliage, many of the largest of the forest-trees having leaves as delicate
as those of the trembling mimosa: among them appear the huge palmate leaves of the cecropias,
and the oval glossy ones of the clusias, countless others of intermediate forms adding to the
variety of its scenery,--the bright sunshine playing on the upper portion of the foliage, while
a solemn gloom reigns among the dark columns which support this wondrous roof of verdure.

In truth, in these woods a thousand objects attract the eye, each a world of varied vegetation
in itself; while the ear listens to the quick rustling breeze moving the palm-leaves fifty
feet or more above the head,--not like the slow gathering, rushing wind among the pine-trees
in northern climes, but like rapidly running water.  Now an immense butterfly of the most vivid
blue comes sailing by to alight on a neighbouring shrub, when, suddenly folding his azure wings
out of sight, it looks merely like some brown moth spotted with white.

As evening comes on, in some districts a strange confusion of sounds is heard, as from a crowd
of men shouting loudly at a distance.  Now it seems like the barking of dogs, then like that
of many voices calling in different keys, but all loud, varied, excited, full of emphasis;
and yet, after all, the rioters are but the frogs and toads uttering their usual notes.

The Seringa or India-Rubber Tree.

Along the whole extent of the submerged region on the banks of the Amazon, beginning at a distance
of about fifty miles from Para, as well as on the shores of many of its tributaries, grows
a tree with bark and foliage not unlike that of the European ash.  The trunk, however, shoots
up to an immense height before throwing off branches.  It is the valuable seringa-tree (Siphonia
elastica), belonging to the family Euphorbia, which produces india-rubber.  As soon as the
waters after the rainy season have subsided, the natives go forth in parties to procure the
sap with large bowls, clay moulds, pans in which to collect it, and axes for cutting the wood
for their fires.  They build their huts in the neighbourhood of the trees.

The first business is to make gashes in the bark, keeping them open by pegs, under which they
place little clay cups, or shells.  Each person has a certain number of trees under his charge.
Every morning he goes round, and pours what has collected in the cups into a large bowl.  The
sap is at first of the consistency of cream, but it soon thickens.  The moulds, which are generally
in the form of bottles, are then dipped into the liquid.  As soon as the coating is dried,
the mould is again dipped in, and the same process is gone through for several days.  The substance
is at this time hard and white.  Meantime fires are made with the nuts of several species of
palms--the inaja and others.  These produce a thick black smoke.  The india-rubber is then
passed several times through it.  By this means a dark colour and the proper consistency are
obtained.  The moulds being broken, the clay is poured out, and the material is ready for the
market.

Sometimes it is formed in large flat pieces; and of late years it has been preserved in a liquid
state in hermetically closed vessels.

The seringa-tree differs greatly from the group of plants which furnish the caoutchouc of Africa
and the West Indies; the latter being the product of certain species of ficus of a climbing
character, and inferior to the india-rubber of South America.

THE COW-TREE.

Among the noblest of the forest monarchs appears a tree with deeply-scored reddish and ragged
bark.  Who would have supposed that from that vast trunk would issue a milky liquid scarcely
distinguishable at first from that of the cow?  Yet such is the sap coming from the opening
made by the axe from the massaranduba or cow-tree.  When fresh it serves every purpose of real
milk when mixed with coffee; but drunk pure has a somewhat coarse taste--and it is considered
dangerous to drink much of it, however refreshing a small quantity may be.  It soon thickens,
and forms a tenacious glue, which can be usefully employed in cementing crockery.  A decoction
of the bark is employed as a red dye for cloth.  The fruit, also, is largely consumed; while
the wood is excessively durable in water.

MONKEYS' DRINKING-CUPS--BRAZIL-NUT TREE.

Two lofty trees, closely allied to each other--the Lecythis ollaria and the Bertholletia excelsa--produce
enormous capsules full of nuts.  The first, called the sapucaya, yields these curious capsules
known as cuyas de maccao, or monkeys' drinking-cups.  At the top is a circular hole, to which
a natural lid fits exactly.  On the nuts becoming ripe the lid is loosened, and the heavy cup
falling to the ground, the nuts are scattered far and wide, when they are eaten by numerous
animals on the watch for them.  The collectors, therefore, have difficulty in obtaining them.
The other tree, known as the Brazil-nut tree, produces similar wooden vessels; but as they
have no lid, they fall entire to the ground, and are thus preserved till human beings come
to collect them, when they are shipped to England and other parts of the world.

THE VICTORIA REGIA.

On the surface of the tranquil pools, amid the recesses of the forest, float the wide-spreading
circular leaves of the magnificent Victoria regia, like vast dishes--their edges turned up
all round--with beautiful flowers rising amid them.  The colour varies from the velvety white
outer petals through every shade of rose to the deepest crimson, and fading again to a creamy
yellowish tint in the heart of the flower.  The natives call it the forno do piosoca, or oven
of the jacana--the leaves being like that of the baking-pans, or ovens, on which the mandioca
meal is roasted.  The leaf rises from the root at the bottom of the pool, on a stock armed
with sharp spines.

When young, the leaf may be seen in the form of a deep cup or vase surrounded with ribs, at
that time comparatively small, the whole green expanse of the adult leaf covered in between
them in regular rows of puffings.  As the ribs grow their ramifications stretch out in every
direction, the leaflets one by one unfolding to fill the ever-widening spaces; till at last,
when it reaches the surface of the water, it rests horizontally above it without a wrinkle--the
colossal leaf being thus supported by a heavy scaffold of ribs beneath it, sufficient not only
to support the light-stepping jacana, but even a young child.  Some of the leaves have a diameter
of from four to five feet; some may grow even to a larger size.

"Here, seen in its own home, it has in addition to its own beauties the charm of harmony with
all that surrounds it," observes Mrs Agassiz,--"with the dense mass of forest, with palm and
parasite, with birds of glowing plumage, with insects of all bright and wonderful tints, and
with fishes which, though hid in the water beneath it, are not less brilliant and varied than
the world of life above."

PALMS.

Almost countless are the varieties of trees in the Amazonian forests, and wonderful the diversity
in their combination.  Rarely is the soil found occupied for any extent by the same kind of
tree.  A vast proportion are yet unknown to science.  The palms surpass in number and variety
all their sylvan brethren.  They differ wonderfully in form and size: some, sturdy giants towering
up towards the sky with wide-spreading branches; others, delicate little pigmies with slender
stems and small broom-like crowns; while others assume the form of creepers, and wind in many
folds round the supporting trunks of other trees.

"Among them are four essentially different forms:--the tall ones, with a slender and erect
stem, terminating with a crown of long feathery leaves, or with broad fan-shaped leaves," remarks
Professor Agassiz; "the bushy ones, the leaves of which rise, as it were, in tufts from the
ground, the stem remaining hidden under the foliage; the brush-like ones, with a small stem,
and a few rather large leaves; and the winding, creeping, slender species.  Their flowers and
fronds are as varied as their stalks.  Some of these fruits may be compared to large woody
nuts with a fleshy mass inside, others have a scaly covering, others resemble peaches or apricots,
while others, still, are like plums or grapes. Most of them are eatable, and rather pleasant
to the taste."

Among the most beautiful is the mauritia, or miriti, with pendent clusters of reddish fruit;
its enormous, spreading, fan-like leaves cut into ribbons.  Contrasted with it appears the
manicaria, or the bussu, with stiff entire leaves, some thirty feet in length, almost upright,
and very close in their mode of growth, and serrated all along their edges.  The leaves all
sprout from, a comparatively short stem.

More curious is the raphia, with plume-like leaves, sometimes from forty to fifty feet in length,
starting also from a short stem--almost from the ground.  Its vase-like form is peculiarly
graceful and symmetrical.

Among the most curious is the pashiuba barrigudo, or bulging-stemmed palm (Iriartea ventricosa);
which, rising on a pyramid of roots for several feet, runs up in a single column for some distance,
and then swells in a curious spindle-form, again to assume the same proportions as below, till
its head spreads out in several fan-like branches with web-shaped leaflets.  The tree looks
as if supported on stilts, and a person can stand upright among the roots of old trees with
the perpendicular stem above his head.  These roots have the form of straight rods, and are
studded with stout thorns, whilst the trunk is quite smooth.  The purpose of this curious arrangement
is probably to recompense the tree by root-growth above the soil for its inability, in consequence
of the competition of neighbouring roots, to extend itself underground.

Here, too, grows the slender and graceful assai-palm, with its perfectly smooth trunk,--the
fruit appearing in a heavy cluster of berries just below the cluster of leaves on its summit.
The stem is hard and tough as horn, and is much made use of, when split into narrow planks,
for the construction of walls and flooring of houses.

The fruit is about the size of a cranberry, and of a dark brown colour. When boiled and crushed
it yields a quantity of juice of about the consistency of chocolate, somewhat of the colour
of blackberry juice, when it has a sweetish taste--and is eaten, made into cakes with the flour
of the mandioca root.  From it also is formed the favourite beverage of the people.  To obtain
the fruit, the native fastens a strip of palm-leaves round his instep, thus binding his feet
together, to enable him to climb the slippery trunk, which he does with wonderful rapidity,
to obtain the fruit at its summit.

Wherever a native village exists, there are seen growing in clusters, beautiful ornaments beside
the palm-thatched huts, the tall and elegant pupunha, or peach palm--Guilielma speciosa--to
the height of sixty feet, and often perfectly straight.  A single bunch of the fruit weighs
as much as a man can carry, and on each tree several are borne.  It takes its name from the
colour of the fruit, not from its flavour or nature, for it is dry and mealy, and may be compared
in taste to a mixture of chestnuts and cheese.  It is eagerly devoured by vultures, who come
in quarrelsome flocks to the trees when it is ripe.  Dogs often feed on it. It is one of the
few trees which the natives brought with them, it is said, from their original home, and have
here cultivated from time immemorial.  The fruit, when boiled, is nearly as mealy as a potato;
and in perfection is the size of a large peach.  It is generally supposed that there is more
nutriment in the fruit than in fish,--about a dozen forming a meal for a grown-up person. 
The leaves of its crown are evenly arched over, forming a deep green vault--the more beautiful
from the rich colour of the foliage.  When the heavy cluster of ripe red fruit hangs under
its dark vault, the tree is in its greatest beauty.

The palms are among the most characteristic features of tropical scenery.  The variety of their
forms, fruit, foliage, and flowers is perfectly bewildering, and yet as a group their character
is unmistakable.  On the whole, no family of trees is more similar; generically and specifically,
none is more varied.  Their leaves follow the simple arrangement of those of grasses, in which
the leaves are placed alternately on opposite sides of the stem, thus dividing the space round
it in halves.  As the stem of the branches elongates, these pairs of leaves are found scattered
along its length, and it is only in the ears, or spikes of some genera, that we find them growing
so compactly on the axis as to form a close head.

Of this law of growth the palm known as the baccaba is an admirable illustration, its leaves
being disposed in pairs one above another at the summit of the stem, but in such immediate
contact as to form a thick crown.  Its appearance is in consequence totally different from
any other palm, except perhaps the jacitara, which has a slender, winding stem.  Sometimes
the crown is more open, as in the inaja--Maximiliana regia--in which the stem is not very high,
and the leaves grow in cycles of five, separating slightly, so as to form an open vase rising
from a slender stem.

Professor Agassiz remarks that the rest of this tropical forest is as interesting to the geologist
as to the botanist, as it reveals to him its relation to the vegetable world of past ages,
showing those laws of growth which unite the past and the present.

The tree-ferns--the chamaerops, the pandanus, the araucarias--are modern representatives of
past types.  The former is a palm belonging to the ancient vegetable world, but having its
representative in our days.  The modern chamaerops, with its fan-like leaves spreading on one
level, stands, with respect to its structure, lower than the palms with pinnate leaves, which
belong almost exclusively to our geological age, and have numerous leaflets ranging along either
side of a central axis.  The young palms, while their elders tower fifty feet above them, are
often not more than two inches high; and to whatever genus they may belong, invariably resemble
the chamaerops,--having their leaves extending fan-like on one plane, instead of being scattered
along a central axis, as in the adult tree.  The infant palm is, in fact, the mature chamaerops
in miniature; showing that among plants, as among animals--at least in some instances--there
is a correspondence between the youngest stages of growth in the higher species of a given
type, and the earliest introduction of that type on earth.

More gregarious in their habits than most other palms are the urucuri palms--Attalea excelsa--groves
of which beautify the higher lands, and grow in vast numbers under the crowns of the more lofty
ordinary forest-trees; their smooth columnar stems being generally fifty feet in height, while
their broad, finely pinnated leaves, interlocking above, form arches and woven canopies of
elegant and diversified shapes.  The fruit, in size and shape like the date, has a pleasant
flavoured juicy pulp, and falls to the ground when ripe.

PART THREE, CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.

THE WONDERS OF THE WATERS.

THE MANATEE, OR COW-FISH.

To maintain the claim of its ocean character, the Amazon possesses that huge, whale-like creature
the manatee, or cow-fish, called by the Brazilians peixe boi, or vacca marina.  It is generally
about seven or eight feet long, though it attains a length of ten feet or more, and nine feet
and upwards in girth.  On the upper part the body is perfectly smooth, and of a lead colour.
It tapers off towards the tail, which is flat, horizontal, and semicircular, without any appearance
of hind-limbs.  The head is in reality small, and the neck undistinguishable; though it has
an enormous mouth, with fleshy lips like those of a huge cow, with an ugly countenance.  On
the lips are stiff bristles, while a few hairs only are scattered over the body. Just behind
the head are two powerful oval fins, beneath which, in the female, are the breasts.  The ears
are very minute holes, and the eyes are extremely small.  The skin of the back is fully an
inch thick; and beneath it is a layer of fat, also an inch or more in thickness.  The fins
of the fore-limbs consist of bones exactly corresponding to those of the human arm, with five
fingers at the extremity--every joint distinct, although completely encased in its thick inflexible
skin.

The manatee ranges from the mouth of the Amazon to the upper waters.  It feeds on the grass
growing on the borders of the lakes and rivers.  It swims at a rapid rate, moved by the tail
and paddles.  The creature is hunted and killed by the natives with harpoons, the flesh being
much sought after.  The taste is somewhat between that of pork and beef.  The natives dress
it by cutting the meat into small pieces and sticking them on skewers, which they place in
a slanting position over the flames to roast.

The female produces one, though sometimes two at a birth, which she holds in her paddles while
giving suck.  From twenty to twenty-five gallons of oil are obtained from each sea-cow.  The
poor manatee, little able to defend itself, has other enemies besides man.  The jaguar lies
in wait for it on the trunk of a tree overhanging the placid pool, and seizing it with his
powerful claws as it swims by, holds it in a vice-like grasp, from which in spite of its strength
it in vain endeavours to escape.

Those who have voyaged on the ocean, know the solemn feeling and the idea of vastness which
is conveyed during a calm at night, when monsters of the deep are heard far and near as they
come to the surface to inhale the air, or "blow," as it is called.  The same feeling is experienced
by the traveller up the Amazon when on board his montaria at anchor, when he hears the splashing
and snorting sounds of its numerous inhabitants, as they rise through the mirror-like plain,
in which countless thousands of bright stars are reflected.  Here fresh-water dolphins roam
in great numbers.  In the Lower Amazon are two species; one of which,--the tucuxi,--when it
comes to the surface to breathe, rises horizontally, showing first the back of its fin, and
then, drawing an inspiration, generally diving down head-foremost; and another, called the
bonto by the natives.  When it rises, it first shows the top of the head, and then floating
onwards, immediately afterwards dips its head downwards, its back curving over--exposing successively
the whole dorsal ridge without showing the tail-fin; the well-known mode in which the sea-porpoise
swims, which makes it appear to pitch head over heels.  The natives regard the bonto or largest
species with especial awe, and will never kill one voluntarily.  Though their fat yields an
excellent oil for lamps, they believe that blindness would result from its use.

The bonto is supposed to possess the characteristic of the malign water-nymphs of the Old World.
They have a legend that a bonto was in the custom of assuming the shape of a beautiful woman,
with hair hanging loose down to her heels; who, going on shore, endeavoured to entice young
men to the river.  When any unhappy youth, smitten with her charms, was induced to follow her
to the water's edge, she would grasp her victim round the waist, and plunging beneath the waves
with a triumphant shriek, disappeared with him for ever.

PIRANHA.

There are several kinds of piranha, many of which abound in the waters of the Tapajos.  The
piranha, called also the caribe, is a kind of salmon (Tetragonopterus).  They are caught with
any kind of bait, their taste being indiscriminate, and their appetite most ravenous.  They
frequently attack the legs of bathers near the shore, inflicting severe wounds with their strong
triangular teeth.

THE DIODON.

The smaller inhabitants of the ocean are also represented in these fresh-waters.  The little
mamayacu, a species of diodon, which in the ocean attains a foot in length, is found in the
Amazon three or four inches long, of a pretty green colour, banded with black.  On being caught--which
it easily is--it becomes in the hand as round as a ball. The natives, when a person gets corpulent,
tell him that he has grown as fat as a mamayacu.

The ocean species, from having the skin about the abdomen looser than that above, floats, when
it becomes distended with air, with its back downwards.  It can thus move about as rapidly
as in its usual position, by aid of its pectoral fins.  By the movement of its jaws it makes
a curious noise, and can give with its sharp teeth a severe bite.  The skin is also covered
with small spikes, which, when thus inflated, become erect and pointed.

It thus, though at first sight looking as helpless as can be, is well able to defend itself.

The diodon has been known to be swallowed alive by a shark, in whose stomach it was found floating,
probably supported by the air with which it had become inflated.  It is asserted that it also
frequently eats its way, not only through the coats of the shark's stomach, but through the
sides of the monster, which is thus killed.  Probably the little diodon of the Amazon has a
similar means of revenging itself on the voracious monsters to whom it falls a prey; and though
it might not be able to liberate itself through the scaly back of an alligator, it would inevitably
kill the monster, or cause him such pain as to make him repent having swallowed so indigestible
a morsel.

The magnificent pirarucu or anatto, of vast size, with its ornamental coat of mail, and broad
large scales margined with bright red, peoples the waters in immense numbers.  It is most frequently
caught by the native fishermen; and when salted, forms the staple food of all classes on the
banks of the Lower Amazon.  It swims at great speed, and attains the length of eight feet when
full-grown, and five feet in girth.  The Indian name of pirarucu is given to it from the native
words pira, fish, and urucu, red; in allusion, says Mr Bates, to the red colour of the borders
of its scales.

Among the other fish most frequently caught are the surubim and piraepieua (species of Pimelodus);
very handsome fishes, four feet in length, with flat spoon-shaped heads, and prettily spotted
and striped skins--two long feelers hanging from each side of their jaws like trailing moustaches.

THE ACARA.

The larger animals which inhabit the mighty river and the network of streams and pools which
surround it on both sides, have been described; but numerous smaller creatures dwell within
it, equally curious, and many totally unlike those to be found in other parts of the world.
It has generally been supposed that, of all creatures, fish are the most destitute of parental
feelings, and that from the moment the eggs have been deposited in the sand or mud, they are
allowed to struggle into existence as best they can, to do battle with their foes, and the
numerous dangers to which they are exposed.  In the acara, however, we have an example of parental
care and watchfulness unrivalled by any terrestrial animal.

The male of this curious fish has a conspicuous protuberance on the forehead, wholly awanting
in the female and the young.  Somehow or other, the eggs of the female are conveyed into the
mouth of the male, the bottom of which is lined by them, between the inner appendages of the
branchial arches, and especially into a pouch formed by the upper pharyngeals, which they completely
fill.  They are there hatched; and the little ones, freed from the egg, are developed until
they are in a condition to provide for their own existence.  In their head there is a special
lobe of the brain, similar to those of the triglas, which sends large nerves to that part of
the gills protecting the young, thus connecting the care of the offspring with the organ of
intelligence.  In this curious cavity of the father's head the young fish are found in all
stages of development,--the more advanced, a quarter of an inch long, and able to swim about,
full of life and activity.  These appear to exist outside the gills, within the cavity formed
by the gill-coverts and the wide branchiostigal membrane.  The eggs remain in the back part
of the gills.

The parent's care does not appear to cease even when the young are fully developed, but he
allows them to swim in and out, and try their powers, if not to search for food; and when danger
appears, opens his mouth, when they all swim back again in a shoal, for safety.  The natives
assert that some species, at all events, are not actually developed in the parent's head, but
are laid and hatched in the sand, the male and female watching carefully over them; and that
the father only takes charge of them when they are hatched, and receives them within his mouth
to protect them from danger.  From the observations of Professor Agassiz, however, there is
no doubt that in some species, at least, the whole process of development is begun and completed
in the gill cavity.

The species which lay their eggs in the sand belong to the genera Hydrogonus and Choetobranchus.
They build a kind of flat nest in the sand or mud, in which they deposit their eggs, hovering
over them until the young are hatched.

Curious also is the little bill-fish--the lymnobellus--with its long beak.

Another fish (the anojas), common in the Amazon, takes shelter--for it cannot be said to build
a nest--in a hollow log.  It belongs to the genus Auchenipterus.  Numbers of this fish are
found crowded in dead logs at the bottom of the river.  One examined by the Professor, was
filled with fish of all sizes, from those several inches long to the tiniest young.  The fish
were so dexterously packed into the log from one end to the other, that it was impossible to
get them out without splitting it open, when they were all found alive and in a perfectly good
condition.  They could not have been jammed artificially into the hollow wood in that way without
injuring them.

ANABLEPS.

We have heard of blind fish, but here is one--called by the Indians tralhote, and known to
naturalists as the Anableps tetraophthalmus, signifying "four-eyed"--possessing four eyes.
A membraneous fold, enclosing the bulb of the eye, stretches across the pupil, dividing the
visual apparatus into the upper and lower half; a curious formation, suited to the peculiar
habits of the anableps.  These fishes gather in shoals on the surface of the water, their heads
resting partly above and partly below the surface, and they move by a leaping motion somewhat
like that of frogs on land.  Thus, half in and half out of the water, they require eyes adapted
for seeing in both elements, and the arrangement described just meets this want.

THE PARROT-FISH.

The birds of the air have, in this region, their representatives in the water.  Among them
is the curious and handsome pirarara, or parrot-fish. It is a heavy, broad-headed creature,
with a bony shield over the whole head.  Its general colour is jet-black, its bright yellow
sides deepening into orange here and there.  The yellow fat of this fish has a curious property.
The Indians assert that when parrots are fed upon it they become tinged with yellow, and they
often use it to render their papagaios more variegated.

THE GYMNOTUS.

On the Amazonian waters is found the carapus, called by the Brazilians sarapo, belonging to
the genus Gymnotus; though far smaller than the electric gymnotus.  They are very numerous,
and the most lively of the whole group.  Their motions are winding and rapid, like those of
the eel; but yet different, inasmuch as they do not glide quickly forward, but turn frequent
somersaults, and constantly change their direction.

LOCALISATION OF FISH.

The researches of Professor Agassiz prove that the localisation of species of fish in these
waters is peculiarly distinct and permanent, their migrations being very limited--consisting
chiefly in removing from shallow to deeper waters, and from these to shallow again, at those
seasons when the range of the shore in the same water-basin is affected by the rise and fall
of the river.  Thus, the fishes found at the bottom of a lake covering, perhaps, a square mile
in extent when the waters are lowest, will appear near the shores of the same lake when, at
the season of high-water, it extends over a much wider area.  In the same way, fishes which
gather near the mouth of a rivulet at the time of low-water, will be found as high as its origin
at the period of high-water; and those which inhabit the larger igarapes on the sides of the
Amazon, when they are swollen by the rise of the river, may be found in the Amazon itself when
the stream is low.  There is not a single fish known to ascend from the sea to the higher courses
of the Amazon at certain seasons, and to return regularly to the ocean.

The striking limitation of species within different areas does not, however, exclude the presence
of certain kinds of fish simultaneously throughout the whole Amazonian basin.  The piraracu,
for instance, is found everywhere from Peru to Para; and so are a few other species more or
less extensively distributed over what may be considered distinct ichthyological fauna.  But
these wide-spread species are not migratory. They have normally and permanently a wide range--just
as some terrestrial animals have an almost cosmopolitan character--while others are circumscribed
within comparatively narrow limits.

Surprising indeed is the variety of species of fishes contained in the Amazonian basin.  Professor
Agassiz, during his expedition, collected nearly two thousand, "for the most part," as he observes--and
which is still more surprising--"circumscribed within different limits, from Tabalinga to Para,
where the waters differ neither in temperature, nor in the nature of their bed, nor in the
vegetation along their borders. There are met with, from distance to distance, assemblages
of fishes completely distinct from each other."

Still more curious, perhaps, is the intensity with which life is manifested in these waters.
All the rivers in Europe, from the Tagus to the Volga, do not nourish a hundred and fifty species
of fresh-water fishes; and yet in a little lake near Manaos, called Lago Hyanuary, the surface
of which hardly covers four or five hundred square yards, more than two hundred distinct species
were discovered, the greater part of which have not been observed elsewhere.

GYMNOTUS, OR ELECTRIC EEL.

In the forest pools, as well as in the marshy ponds and slow-flowing rivers of the Llanos,
numbers of huge serpentlike heads may be seen bobbing above the surface; or a huge, thick-bodied,
yellow, snake-like creature may be caught sight of gliding through the water.  It is the gymnotus
electricus, or electric eel,--one of the many curious inhabitants of this region,--from two
to five, and even eight feet in length.  Though really a fish, it resembles the eel, but is
stouter in its proportions.  It is nearly equal in thickness throughout.  It has a rude, depressed,
and obtuse head, and a compressed tail.  So great is the electric power it possesses, that
when in full vigour it is able to kill the largest animal, when it can unload its electric
organs in a favourable direction.  All other fish, knowing by instinct the deadly effects of
its stroke, fly from the formidable gymnotus.  When fish are struck, or any animals which enter
the pools inhabited by gymnoti--to drink, or cool their bodies, heated by the burning sun of
the Llanos-- they become stupified, and thus easily fall a prey to the electrical tyrant.

The natives of Venezuela employ a cruel mode of catching the creatures, which, notwithstanding
their nature, they use as food.  Placing but little value on mules and horses, they collect
a number of these animals, and, armed with harpoons and long slender rods, drive them with
shouts towards a pool inhabited by gymnoti.  The noise of the horses' hoofs and the men's shrieks
make the fish issue from the mud, when the huge, hideous creatures swim on the surface of the
water, and crowd under the bellies of the horses and mules.  Some of the Indians climb the
trees; others stand round the margin, urging forward the unfortunate animals, and preventing
them from making their escape.  The fish defend themselves by frequent discharges of their
electric batteries.  At first they seem likely to prove victorious.  Some of the quadrupeds
sink beneath the violence of the invisible strokes which they receive from all sides, and,
stunned by the force and frequency of the shocks, disappear under water; others, with their
manes erect and eye-balls wild with pain, strive to escape the electric storm which they have
aroused, but are driven back by the shouts and long whips of the excited Indians. The livid,
yellow eels, like great water-snakes, swim near the surface and pursue their enemy.  After
the conflict has lasted a quarter of an hour or so, the mules and horses appear less alarmed.
They no longer erect their manes, and their eyes express less pain and terror.  The eel-like
creatures, instead of advancing as at first, swim to the shore, when the Indians attack them
with their harpoons, and by means of a long cord attached to it, jerk the fish out of the water,
without receiving any shock, as long as the cord remains dry.

Such is the description given by Humboldt, a witness of the extraordinary scene.  The employment
of their electric powers is evidently spontaneous, and exhausts the nervous energy.  Like voluntary
muscular effort, it needs repose, and the creatures require an abundance of nourishment and
rest before a fresh accumulation of electricity is produced.

In the dry season they form deep circular holes for themselves in the mud of water-courses,
and marshes which remain filled with moisture, and they are thus able to support existence
in their usual localities, while alligators and turtles have to retire to the larger pools
or rivers.  In the shallow ponds of the forest they are easily driven out with long poles.

Bates amused his native companions, who had thus caught some of the creatures, by showing them
how the electric shock could pass from one person to another.  They joined hands in a line,
while he touched the biggest and freshest of the animals on the head with the point of his
hunting-knife.  He found, however, that the experiment did not succeed more than three times
with the same eel when out of the water, for the fourth time the shock was scarcely perceptible.

The limbs even of the strongest man are benumbed, and he is struck down helpless, by a discharge
from the battery of the gymnotus.  The organs which produce this curious electrical effect
are placed along the under side of the tail.  They may be compared to a series of columns inclosed
in a thin membrane packed closely together, which, consisting of a series of fiat discs, may
be imitated by placing a number of coins with their discs parallel to each other, and with
a bladder between each, separated by a gelatinous substance.  These columns are technically
called septa; and La Cepede calculates that two hundred and forty transverse membranes are
packed in each inch, thereby giving to an electric eel eight feet in length an organ cavity
of two hundred and forty-six square feet--an enormous extent, as may be supposed, of electricity
producing surface.  The whole apparatus is supplied with nerves which run through the entire
length of the body.

STING-RAYS.

A fresh-water species of sting-ray is an inhabitant of the creeks and lagoons of stagnant water;
and so infested are some of them with the creatures, that it is almost certain destruction
to venture into them. The sting-ray is circular and flat, with a tail above a foot in length,
very thick at the base, and tapering towards the end.  Near the middle, on the upper part,
it is armed with a long and sharp-pointed sting, finely serrated on two sides, which the fish
can raise or depress at will.  When disturbed, by a quick movement of the tail out darts its
sting towards the object, which it seldom fails to reach.  The wound thus inflicted is so severe
that the whole nervous system is convulsed, the person becoming rigid and benumbed in a few
moments.  Long after the most violent effects of the wound have subsided, the part affected
retains a sluggish ulceration, which has often baffled the skill of the best surgeons.

They frequent the shallow banks of muddy pools, where they may be constantly seen watching
for their prey, and, as if conscious of their powers, scarcely deign to move off when approached.
They have their enemies in vultures and other birds of prey; and as they are considered fit
for food, war with spear and talon is constantly waged upon them.

SERROSALMUS PIRAYA.

In the Orinoco another dangerous creature exists, called by the natives piraya, with a head
shaped somewhat like a sabre.  The lower jaw is furnished with a formidable pair of fangs,
not unlike those of the rattlesnake.  With these it inflicts a gash as smooth as if cut with
a razor.

THE CARIBE.

Every feature of the savage caribe denotes the ferocity and sanguinary nature of its tastes.
The piercing eye, surrounded by a bloody-looking ring, is expressive of its cruel and bloodthirsty
disposition.  Its under jaw, lined with a thick cartilaginous membrane, adds greatly to its
strength, protruding considerably beyond the upper, and increasing the ferocious expression
of its countenance.  Large spots of a brilliant orange hue cover a great portion of its body.
Towards the back it is of a bluish ash colour, with a slight tint of olive-green; the intermediate
spaces being of pearly white, while the gill-coverts are tinged with red.

So sharp are its triangular teeth, arranged like those of the shark, that neither twine, copper,
nor steel can withstand them.  At the sight of any red substance, blood especially, they swim
forward to the attack; and as they usually move in swarms, it is extremely dangerous for man
or beast to enter the water with even a scratch upon their bodies.  Horses wounded by the spur
are particularly exposed to their attacks when fording a stream; and so rapid is the work of
destruction, that unless immediate assistance is rendered, the fish soon penetrate the abdomen
of the animal and destroy it: hence the name given to them by the Spaniards means "tripe-eater."
When a net is drawn on shore, numbers of these little pests are seen jumping in the crowd,
their jaws wide open, tearing whatever comes in their way, and especially the meshes of the
nets, which they soon render useless.

Some tribes of natives place their dead in the water, when these creatures speedily eat the
flesh off the bones, which are then preserved in baskets.

Even human beings, when bathing, or fording rivers, are attacked by these terrible little cannibals;--for
cannibals they are, as, whenever any of their own race are killed, they instantly attack and
devour them.

There are other species of this fish,--among them the black caribe of the Orinoco.  There is
also a small species--a harmless, pretty little fish, of a bright green colour on the back,
and a white belly streaked with pink.  The teeth are used by the Macoushi Indians for sharpening
the points of their poisoned arrows.  This they do by drawing them rapidly between two of the
teeth, in the way that knives are sharpened by two circular steel files, now in common use.

ADAPTATION OF ANIMALS TO THEIR DESTINED MODE OF EXISTENCE.

Strange and unfitted for existence as are many of the animals formed by the Almighty to the
short-seeing eye of mortals, on a further acquaintance with them all will be discovered admirably
suited to the life they are destined to enjoy.  Following Waterton, we may take five as an
example.  The sloth, which has four feet, is unable to use them to support his body on the
earth.  They are destitute of soles, and the muscles requisite for progress in a perpendicular
position; yet no creature is more thoroughly at home when clinging to the trees on which it
has been created to exist.  The ant-bear, without a tooth in his head, roves fearlessly in
the forests inhabited by the jaguar and boa-constrictor.  The sharp claws of his fore-feet
enable him to confront the former, and his powerful muscular body and thick hair set even the
boa at defiance.  The vampire is unable to use his feet for walking, but he possesses a membrane,
stretched by means of his legs, which enables him to mount up into an element where no other
quadruped can follow.  The armadillo, without fur or wool or bristles, has in their stead a
movable shell placed on his back, so formed that he can roll himself up in a ball, while with
his sharp claws he can dig rapidly into the earth to escape his foes.  The tortoise is compelled
to accommodate itself to the shell, which is hard and inflexible, and in no way obedient to
the will of its bearer; yet that very shell, although so apparently inconvenient, serves as
its protection.  The turtle is protected in the same way; but its delicious flesh brings numerous
enemies to attack it, from whom it has a hard task to escape.  The egg of the tortoise, it
may be remarked, has a very hard shell; while that of the turtle is quite soft.

PART THREE, CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.

NATIVES OF THE VALLEY OF THE AMAZON.

A vast number of tribes inhabit the banks of the Amazon and its tributaries, who, though having
a general resemblance, differ in their habits and customs.  Those found on the Lower Amazon
are more or less civilised, and are known as Tupis, or Tapuyas.  They speak the lingua Geral,
and sometimes Portuguese.  The lingua Geral is the ancient Tupee language, considerably modified
by the Jesuits, who taught it to all those under their control.

The Amazonian Indians have generally fine figures, their chests especially being well developed;
their skin is of a copper hue, of various shades, sometimes almost of a dark brown.  The hair
is jet-black, straight and thick, and never curled.  The eyes are black; and they have little
or no beard.  The face is generally wide, and somewhat flattened, with but little or no projection
of the cheek-bones. Indeed, their features are often very regular; and many, except in colour,
differ but little from well-formed European countenances.

THE MUNDURUCUS.

One of the largest semi-civilised tribes inhabiting the banks of the Tapajos are the Mundurucus.
They are noted for tattooing their bodies more completely than any other tribe.  The whole
body is covered with straight lines in diagonal patterns from the mouth downwards, the upper
part being left free.  Some of the women, whose bodies are ornamented in the same fashion,
have lines round their eyes, which look as if they were intended to represent a pair of spectacles.
Even these marks, however, do not destroy the soft drooping look of the eyes common to Indian
women.  The countenances of some of the men are fine; the face, bold, solid, and square, possessing
a passive dignity, with a look of tranquillity which appears immovable.

The more elaborate style of tattooing is only practised by the chiefs, as a mark of their birth
and rank.  It requires ten years to complete the whole process.  The colour is introduced by
fine puncturings over the surface--a painful process, which causes swelling and inflammation.

They are among the most warlike Indians of the Amazon, and keep the neighbouring and less civilised
tribes on their good behaviour.  They are expert agriculturists, and construct canoes and hammocks.
They generally make a foray every year on an adjoining tribe,--the Parentintins,--when they
kill the men, whose heads they preserve by drying and smoking, while they take the women and
children for slaves. They have regular villages of conical huts, the walls and framework filled
in with mud and thatched with palm-leaves.  In the centre is a large hut in which the fighting
men sleep, with their weapons ready for use.  It is ornamented within with the dried heads
of their enemies. They have of late years greatly decreased in numbers.

Some thirty tribes or families are found on the River Uapes.  The men wear their hair in a
long tail hanging down the middle of the back, while the women wear it loose, and cut to a
moderate length.  The only dress worn by the men is a small piece of matting passed between
the legs, and secured round the loins by a string.  The women wear none whatever, but paint
their bodies in regular patterns,--generally red, yellow, and black colours.  The only ornament
worn by the women is a bracelet on the wrist; while below the knee a garter is fastened from
infancy, for the purpose of swelling out the calf.

The men, however, adorn themselves in a variety of ways.  Their hair is carefully parted and
combed on each side.  The young men, especially, wear it in long locks on either side of their
necks, with a comb stuck on the top of the head--their feminine appearance being greatly increased
by the large necklaces and bracelets of beads which they wear, and by their custom of pulling
out every particle of hair from their beard.  As these feminine-looking warriors always carry
their large shields before them, it was but natural, when the Spaniards saw them, or other
tribes similarly adorned, that they should have supposed them to be women.  When, also, they
saw in the distance parties of unadorned persons carrying burdens, they took them to be slaves
captured in war. This, no doubt, was the origin of the fable of nations of Amazons found on
the banks of the river.

GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE NATIVES.

Sometimes these natives wear circlets of parrot and other gay feathers on their heads, as well
as armlets and leg ornaments of the same materials.  Some of these tribes have the horrible
custom of baking the bodies of their dead after they have become decomposed, till only a black
carbonaceous mass is left.  This is pounded, and mixed with an intoxicating liquor, called
caxiri, in vats made out of hollow trees. The relatives having been invited, the whole company
drink the mixture, under the belief that the virtues of the deceased will thus be transmitted
to them.  Some of them are cannibals, and make war for the express purpose of procuring human
flesh.  They smoke dry what they cannot at once consume, thus preserving it a long time for
food.  They have no definite idea of a God; but they dread an evil spirit, whom they believe
delights in afflicting them, and is the cause of death.

Their houses hold a number of families; sometimes a whole tribe.  They are upwards of 120 feet
long, 80 feet broad, and 30 feet high.  The plan is a parallelogram, with a semicircle at the
further end.  A passage twenty feet wide leads from one end to the other; while, on the sides,
are partitions, like the stalls in an old-fashioned public room of an inn, each of which is
inhabited by a separate family.  The chief, or tushaua, resides at the semicircular end, where
he has a private entrance.  The furniture consists of hammocks, with various pots and cooking
utensils made of clay, as well as baskets.  Their canoes are formed out of a single tree, hollowed
and forced open by cross-pieces. Some are forty feet in length.  The dead are nearly always
buried in the houses: a large house having sometimes one hundred graves in it.

From the Rio Negro to the Andes there is a large region, inhabited entirely by savages of whom
little is known, except that they are mostly cannibals, and kill all their first-born children.
On the other side of the Amazon also is a still larger tract of virgin forest, where not a
single civilised man is to be found.

THE PURUPURUS.

Among these tribes, the Purupurus, although thorough savages, are perhaps the best-known. 
They wear no clothes whatever; their habitations are small huts rudely formed of boughs, which
they set up on the sand.  Their canoes are of the rudest construction, having flat bottoms
and upright sides.  They use neither the bow nor the gravatana, but instead have a weapon called
the palheta, from which they can cast an arrow, as from a sling, with wonderful dexterity.
In the septum of the nose and in the ears they bore holes, in which they wear rings.

THE CATAUIXIS.

In their immediate neighbourhood, the Catauixis tribe is found.  Though they go naked, they
build houses, and use bows and gravatanas.  Their canoes are constructed of the bark of a tree
taken off entire.  They are also cannibals, and murder the people of other tribes whom they
can surprise.

Many of the least barbarous tribes have frequently large meetings, when they dress up in feather
ornaments of parrots and macaws in a variety of curious disguises.  The chief wears a head-dress
of toucan feathers, with the erect tail-plumes rising from the crown.  The mask dresses are
long cloaks, made of the inner bark of a tree.  Sometimes they manufacture head-pieces, by
stretching the cloth over a basketwork frame, to represent the heads of monkeys and other animals.
When thus dressed, they perform a monotonous seesaw and stamping dance, accompanied by singing
and drumming.  Often this sport is kept up for several days and nights in succession.  During
the time, they drink large quantities of caxiri, while they smoke tobacco and take snuff. Their
chief masker represents their demon Jurupari, but he does not appear to be treated with any
particular respect.

Very little information has been gathered of the history of these tribes, as they seldom possess
any knowledge of their ancestors beyond the times of their fathers or grandfathers.  Few of
them have benefited in any way by their intercourse with white men, but remain in the same
barbarous condition in which they have probably existed for many centuries.  A further description
of their savage customs would be more disagreeable than satisfactory.  We can only hope that
the true gospel may be some day carried among them, and that they may be redeemed from their
present barbarous condition.

PART THREE, CHAPTER NINETEEN.

INDIAN WEAPONS AND MODES OF KILLING GAME.

THE BLOW-PIPE.

The Indian, destitute of firearms, ranges through the forest in chase of the fiercest and largest
animals which haunt its shade, armed with a slender tube, and a quiver full of needle-like
arrows.  The tube, ten or eleven feet long, is the celebrated gravatana, or blow-pipe; called
also the zarabatana by the Spaniards.  Slight as are the arrows which are blown through this
weapon, they will penetrate the thickest hide; and being tipped with a deadly poison, carry
death through the veins of the wounded animal in the course of a few minutes.

Blowpipes are formed in various ways,--for one, the stems of a small palm, the triatea setigera,
are used.  Outside they appear pointed, from the scars of the fallen leaves, but within they
have a soft pith, which soon rots in water, and is easily extracted, leaving a smooth, polished
bore.  They vary from the thickness of a finger to two inches in diameter.  Each of these stems
is slender, the one of a size which may be pushed inside the larger.  This is done that any
curve in the one may counteract that in the other.  A conical wooden mouthpiece is fitted on
the one end, and the whole is spirally bound with the smooth black bark of a creeper.  Two
teeth, fastened about a couple of feet apart from the mouth end, serve as sights to enable
the sportsman to take better aim. The end applied to the mouth is bound round with a small
silk-grass cord to prevent it splitting; while the other is strengthened by having the seed
of a nut, with a hole cut through it, secured round it.

The arrows, from nine to ten inches long, are made from the leaves of a species of palm, or
from the spinous processes of the patawa, pointed as sharp as a needle.  The other end is burned
hard, and round it is wound a little conical tuft of tree-cotton, the silky covering of the
bomba, so as exactly to fill up the bore of the tube.  They are carried in a quiver, which
holds some hundreds.  It is in shape somewhat like a backgammon dice-box, formed of basketwork,
and covered with a piece of the skin of the tapir.  To it is attached a bunch of silk-grass,
a small piece of bone for scratching the point of the arrows, and a basket for holding wild
honey secured round the blunt end.  The points of the arrows are tipped with the deadly wourali
or urali poison.

Another kind of gravatana is made of two separate pieces of wood, each scooped out so as to
form one half of the tube.  The two halves are then secured together, by binding round them
spirally long fiat strips of the jacitira, or wood of the climbing palm-tree, the whole being
afterwards smeared over with the black wax of the melipona bee.  The tube tapers towards the
muzzle, and a cup-shaped mouthpiece is fitted in the broad end.  It is so heavy that only a
strong man, accustomed to its use, can employ it.

The boys learn to shoot with a smaller and lighter instrument.  The tools used are made of
the incisor teeth of the paca and cavy.  A light arrow is put in at the inner end, and when
the ball of silk-cotton secured to the shafts fits tightly, it can be propelled with such force
by the breath that it makes a noise almost as loud as a pop-gun when flying from the muzzle.
An expert Indian can propel arrows so as to kill at a distance of fifty or sixty yards.  It
is more useful in the forest than a gun, for the report of firearms alarms the birds or monkeys,
while the silent poisoned dart brings them down one by one, until the sportsman has a heap
of slain by his side.

WOURALI POISON.

The wourali poison is made chiefly by the natives of the northern part of the Amazonian valley.
It is looked upon as an important and somewhat mysterious operation.  Waterton and Schombergh
describe it.  The Indian, when preparing to concoct this deadly compound, goes into the wilds
where grows a vine--the strychnos toxifera.  After this he collects a number of bundles, and
then takes up a root with an especially bitter taste.  Having scraped the wourali vine and
bitter root into thin shavings, he puts them into a sieve made of leaves, which he holds over
the earthen pot, pouring water on them.  A thick liquor comes through, having the appearance
of coffee. He then produces the bulbous stalks, and squeezes a portion of the juice into the
pot.  He now adds the pounded fangs of the labarri and counacouchi snakes,--which he generally
has in store, as well as the ants.  The ingredients are next boiled over a slow fire, and the
scum being taken off, the liquid remains till it becomes reduced to a thick syrup of a deep
brown colour.  It is now fit for use.  The arrows are then dipped into it, and if it is found
of sufficient strength, it is poured into small pots, which are covered over with leaves and
a piece of deer-skin.  It is then kept in a dry place, or suspended occasionally over a fire,
to counteract the effects of damp.

The poison must be fresh to kill speedily.  A bird dies in a minute or so, and the largest
animals only survive a few minutes after being struck.  Salt is almost a certain antidote to
the poison.  The Indians, when they wish to preserve an animal alive, scrape off part of the
poison, and, as soon as the animal falls, put salt into its mouth, when it speedily recovers.
Monkeys are frequently captured in this way. Europeans accustomed to eat salt seldom suffer
from the effects of the poison; though it is said to produce its usual deadly effects on the
natives, when wounded by it, as they rarely or never consume salt.

The flesh of the animals killed is in no way injured by the poison, nor does it appear to corrupt
sooner than that killed by the gun or knife.

Bows, with arrows four or five feet long, are used to kill the larger animals.  The arrows
are made of a yellow reed without joint or knot.  A piece of hard wood is inserted into the
end, and in this a square hole is made, tightly bound round with cotton to keep it from splitting.
Into this square hole a spike is fitted, and dipped in the poison, while at the butt-end a
couple of feathers are fastened to steady it in its flight.  The hunter carries a number of
these poisoned spikes.  As the spike easily breaks off, or slips out when the animal is wounded,
he recovers his shaft, into which he can easily refit another spike.  The spikes are cut half
through, to facilitate their breaking off.

TIMBO.

The Indian has also discovered the means of poisoning the fish of the lakes and pools, as well
as the birds of the air.  He extracts the poison from a certain liana--the paullinia pinnata--which
he calls timbo.  To do so, he collects a few pieces, about a yard long, and mashes and soaks
them in water, which soon becomes discoloured with the milky poisonous juice of the plant.
This he carries in a calabash, and pours out on the water.  In about half an hour, all the
smaller fish, over a wider space than that which he has sprinkled with the juice, rise to the
surface, floating on their sides, with their gills wide open.  So powerful is its nature, that
but a slight quantity appeal's sufficient to stupify them.  Some time afterwards the larger
fish appear; and even for twenty-four hours afterwards a number rise floating dead on the surface.
The fish are evidently suffocated by the poison.

MODE OF SHOOTING AND NETTING TURTLE.

Both fish and turtle are shot by the natives with arrows.  The Indian takes his post on a little
stage made of poles and cross-pieces of wood, secured with lianas, on the margin of the pools
frequented by the turtles, armed with his bow and arrows.  The arrow used for killing the latter
has a strong lancet-shaped steel point fitted into a peg which enters the tip of the shaft.
The peg is secured to the shaft by twine made of the fibres of pineapple leaves.  The line,
some thirty or forty yards long, is neatly wound round the body of the arrow.  When the muzzle
enters the shell the peg drops out, and the pierced animal descends with it towards the bottom,
leaving the shaft floating on the surface.  The sportsman, hastening to the spot in his canoe,
sends another arrow into the turtle, and then humouring it by means of the two cords, quickly
gets it on board.  It is extraordinary, the skill the Indians will display on these occasions.
They do not even wait for the turtle coming to the surface, but watch for the tracks which
it makes in the water when swimming beneath it, and shoot with unerring aim.--At certain seasons
turtle in vast shoals wend their way up the Orinoco, when, as they come to the surface to breathe,
the Indians--who are on the watch--shoot them with heavy arrows, which, falling perpendicularly,
pierce their thick coats; and they drift on shore, or are picked up by the canoes kept in readiness
for that purpose.  Nets also are employed: the depth is about equal to that of the water; while
the floats, buoyed up on the surface, thus form a complete track.  One party takes either end
of the net, while the rest beat the water with poles, in order to drive the turtles towards
the middle.  As the beaters advance, numbers of little snouts suddenly popping above the water
show that all is going on well.  The beaters continue shouting and striking the water with
great vigour.  The ends of the nets are then seized by numerous strong hands and dragged quickly
forward, forming a circle to inclose all the body.  The canoes being brought up, the turtles
are thrown into them. Mr Bates describes having seen fully eighty turtles secured thus in about
twenty minutes.

ANOTHER MODE OF CATCHING FISH.

The natives on the banks of the northern rivers also employ a poisonous root for catching fish.
It resembles a turnip, with a small plant rising from it, and is called by them cima.  A decoction
of it being made, it is mixed with boiled maize ground into paste.  The Indian and his family
go forth to the pool with a number of baskets to carry home their prey.  Besides the poison-paste,
he supplies himself with some pellets of paste free from it.  On arriving at the pool or stream,
he throws a quantity of the latter into the water, which attracts a variety of small fish from
all quarters.  He then begins to throw in the poisoned bait, which is no sooner swallowed than
the fish begin to leap out of the water, and tumble about in all sorts of ways, when they are
easily caught by the children, and thrown into their baskets, which in a short time are filled.

The Indians of the Orinoco also entrap fish in other ways.  When the waters begin to ebb at
the end of the rainy season, they form strong stockades across the outlet of the great lagoons
in which a number of the larger fish, as well as turtles of enormous size, have taken refuse.
The stakes of these stockades are driven into the bed of the channel, close enough to allow
of the exit of the water and the smaller fish only.  It is further secured by cross-beams thrown
across the channel. Sometimes, however, so numerous are the fish, and so enormous their size,
that they break through the stockade in spite of all the precautions taken.

POISONING BIRDS.

In the neighbourhood of the Apoure, in Venezuela, a poisonous shrub abounds--the deadly guachamaca--belonging
to the family of Apocinese, or dog-bane.  The natives make a strong decoction from it, into
which they dip a number of small fish, and spread them about in the neighbourhood of lagoons
frequented by cranes, herons, and other aquatic birds, hiding themselves near at hand.  Before
the bird has fairly swallowed the fish it drops dead, when the hunter, cutting off the head
and neck, carries off the body as his prize.  It is said that when meat has been roasted on
spits made of this wood, it has absorbed sufficient poison to destroy all who ate it.

THE LONG-BOW.

Some tribes, using a powerful long-bow, shoot birds in the air at a great distance.  The hunter,
throwing himself on his back, with his quiver by his side, places his feet against the bow,
raised to the required elevation, and thus, stretching out his legs, draws the arrow to his
head on the ground.  By this means he is enabled to kill wild fowl and other game at an enormous
distance.  An amusing writer on Venezuela mentions an Indian who used to place a piece of money
on the top of a lemon, close to the point of the big toe on his left foot, and then, leaning
backwards, bend his bow with the help of his right one, and shoot into the air at an angle
of 85 degrees,--the arrow never failing when it turned round to come down and strike the coin.
Another would shoot a bird soaring above his head, without looking at the bird,--guided only
by the shadow cast upon the ground about mid-day.

STALKING GAME.

In the same legion, the Indians form a sort of trumpet out of bamboo, covering one end with
a thick membrane.  On blowing through the other, a sound is produced resembling the bleating
of a young fawn.  Hiding himself behind a tree, the hunter decoys the doe towards his place
of concealment, when he easily shoots her with his poisoned arrow.

The following is another device for approaching the deer in the open plains.  These animals
seem to have a peculiar fondness for the tall crane of the Llanos--a large white bird, with
long, slender legs, and at least five feet in height.  It has a pouch of a bright scarlet,
and a bill nearly a foot long, and wide at the base, which enables it to swallow a large fish
at a mouthful.  The hunter forms a mask to resemble the head of the crane, and, clothing his
own dark body in white, holding his weapon low down, goes off in the direction of the deer,
taking care to approach it to leeward.  He then imitates the movements of the crane. When the
deer stops to look at him, he bends down his head as if feeding.  As soon as the deer again
begins to browse, the hunter carefully approaches it till he gets within range, and can shoot
his deadly dart with certain aim.

MODE OF KILLING ALLIGATORS.

The Indian bravely attacks the huge alligator, fearless of its enormous jaws, sometimes shooting
it with arrows from his bow.  The arrows are fitted in the same way as those used for killing
turtle--the head remaining in the body of the animal, while the shaft, secured to it by a line,
floats on the surface; which showing the direction taken by the saurian, it is chased and transfixed
by either lances or arrows till it dies from exhaustion.  On these occasions it is often attacked,
it is said, by the caribes, and partially devoured, before it can be dragged on shore.

The creatures are also caught by another device.  A piece of hard wood, pointed at both ends,
is covered up with a large fish or lump of meat, and then thrown into the water, with a strong
rope attached to the middle.  The instant it is seized, the hunters, who have hold of the other
end, drag the creature on shore, and despatch it with clubs or darts.

A story is told of a Llanero, who, accustomed to desperate encounters with savage bulls and
fierce jaguars, determined on one occasion, when compelled to cross the river, to brave the
risk of an attack from an alligator known to infest it.  Plunging into the stream, with his
saddle on his shoulders to prevent its being wetted, and his sharp dagger in his teeth, he
swam on his horse's back.  As those who saw him expected, the crocodile soon appeared.  Boldly
facing the creature, he approached its jaws, and, throwing his saddle at it, the alligator
jumped partly out of the water to catch it.  At that instant the daring Llanero plunged his
dagger up to the very hilt into the arm-pit--the most vital part of the monster--when, with
a tremendous splash, it instantly sank beneath the waves.

The tenacity of life exhibited by these monsters is often marvellous. Sir Robert Schombergh
gives an account of shooting one when ascending the River Berbice.  The snout was taken off
by one ball, and another entered the hinder part of the skull, when the Indians, attacking
it with their clubs, appeared completely to have knocked out every spark of life.  It was at
last hauled up and placed on the bow of the corial. While the corial was being drawn across
the rapids, two of the Indians took up the cayman in order to lay it in a more convenient position.
Scarcely had they done so, when at one bound it jumped into the river and disappeared.  They
could never afterwards be persuaded to touch a cayman.

TURTLE-CATCHING AND COLLECTING EGGS.

Both the Amazon and the Orinoco, with their tributaries, are frequented by several species
of turtles.  The mode employed for capturing the animals, as well as collecting the eggs, applies
equally to both rivers.

There are several species of fresh-water turtles.  The largest in the upper waters grow to
a great size, measuring nearly three feet long, by two in breadth; so that one is a load for
the strongest man.  The Brazilian Government make regulations for protecting the turtles whilst
laying, so that all the inhabitants on the banks may have an equal chance of procuring a supply
of eggs.  The natives collect from all quarters for this object.  The turtles select the highest
and driest banks composed of the finest sand, which will be a sufficient time above water to
allow of the eggs being hatched by the heat of the sun.  Some of these banks are of great extent--many
miles long, and often one or more broad.  They are the haunts and breeding-places of many different
kinds of animals, and are covered by tracks of alligators and turtles. Not only do these here
make their nests, but birds lay in them their eggs during the dry season; and different kinds
of fish use them for the same purpose when covered with water.  Here, too, the wonderful little
acara are found, with their young in their heads; and there are also rounded shallow depressions
in the mud, which the fishermen say are the sleeping-places of the skates.  They are certainly
about the size and form of a skate, and it can easily be believed that these singular impressions
in the soft surface have been made in this way.  The creatures, however, only frequent certain
praias out of the number existing.  When the waters overflow the land, the young turtles move
into the interior, where they remain during their infant days in the numberless lakes and pools
in the forest.  As the dry season approaches, the full-grown turtles descend from the interior
pools while the outlets are still open (between July and August), and seek in countless swarms
their favourite banks.  Sentinels are then posted on high lookout places, situated at the ends
of the banks, where they may watch the proceedings of the creatures, and mark the spots they
have chosen.  They also warn off any fishermen who may approach, as the sight of a man or a
fire on the sand-bank would prevent the turtles from leaving the water that night to lay their
eggs; and, if frequently alarmed, they would forsake the praia for some other place.

The turtles lay their eggs by night--crawling in vast crowds to the central and highest part
of the praia--and are occupied till dawn in the operation.  They excavate with their broad-webbed
paws deep holes in the fine sand.  The first which arrives makes a pit about three feet deep,
and lays its eggs--about one hundred in number--covering them with sand. The next makes its
deposit at the top of the former; and so on till every pit is full.  They are so careful in
covering up the eggs, that, when they quit the spot, the only marks distinguishable are those
which they make when returning to the water--as they go round and round the nest several times
in succession to obliterate all traces.  The sand, however, remains so loose, that it gives
way under foot, and thus the Indian easily discovers the spot.

A body of turtles occupy several days in the operation; one party succeeding the other, night
after night, till all have deposited their eggs.  As the season advances, however, those who
have arrived late, in their hurry to lay, appear to take fewer precautions.  So powerful is
the effect of the sun on these sand-banks, that a few days only are required to hatch the young
turtles.

It has been so arranged by the Creator, that they always come forth at night, as the heat of
the sun would kill them, and they would be devoured by birds of prey and other animals on the
watch to seize the dainty morsels.  Although the hole from which they emerge may be half a
mile or more from the river, instinct teaches them to go in a direct line to the water.  A
number, however, are caught by their enemies; while enormous quantities of eggs are taken,--both
to be used as food, and for the sake of the oil they contain.

A curious sight is witnessed from the top of the sentinel's stage at daybreak.  The sand appears
blackened with the multitudes of turtles-- which, after depositing their eggs, are waddling
towards the river; and often, where the margin of the praia is steep, tumbling down the declivity
into the water.

OIL FROM TURTLES' EGGS.

As soon as the eggs have been laid, the Indians, arriving in their canoes from all directions,
with their families, build reed huts on the banks--some merely driving poles into the sand,
from which to swing their hammocks.  The canoes are then drawn up on the beach and thoroughly
washed out, while the whole praia is covered with natives with the baskets on their backs in
which they collect the eggs.  The eggs are then cleansed from the grains of sand adhering to
them, and emptied into the canoes, when they are trodden on by the children, much in the same
way as grapes are mashed for wine-making.  The canoes, when full, are left exposed to the sun's
rays, and in a short time a fine clear oil rises to the surface.  It is then skimmed off with
shells and put into large pots, when it is boiled over the fire and becomes purified.  It is
next transferred to jars, and is ready for use.  It is finer and clearer than that produced
from olives.

Meantime, any stray turtles which have delayed their departure, as frequently happens, are
turned over on their backs.  Holes are dug in the sand near the water, in which the young turtles
are kept till required for eating.  When not actually employed in picking up eggs or catching
turtles, the whole population are engaged in feasting off them--an enormous quantity being
thus consumed.  The flesh of the animals is cut up and dressed in the shells, which serve as
pots, without the danger of burning; and it is washed down with copious draughts of chica.

The female turtles contain an enormous number of eggs, apparently ready to be laid during a
succession of years--from the large ones covered with a white membrane, down to a confused
mass resembling mustard-seeds. As it requires five thousand to fill a jar of oil, and as many
thousands of jars are collected, it may be conceived what an enormous number of eggs are deposited
every year.  Were it not that many turtles lay in solitary places, which the Indians have not
discovered, the rivers would soon be depopulated.  The Indian children watch for the creatures
as soon as they are hatched, and collect great numbers.

Humboldt calculates that nearly a million turtles annually deposit their eggs on the banks
of the Lower Orinoco.  In the Amazon, already the turtles have greatly decreased in numbers;
and Bates states that, where formerly he could buy one for ninepence, he could with difficulty
procure them latterly for eight or nine shillings each.  Every house on the banks has a little
pond, called a corral, or pen, in the back-yard, to hold a stock of large turtle during the
wet months, till a fresh supply can be procured in the dry season.

The tracaja, or smaller kind, which lays its eggs a month earlier than the larger species,
seldom lives, in captivity, beyond a few days.

The natives cook the turtles in various ways.  The entrails make a delicious soup, called sarapatel;
while the flesh of the breast is mixed with farina, and roasted in the breast shell over the
fire. Steaks, cooked with fat, make another dish; and large sausages, composed of the thick-coated
stomach, filled with mince-meat, and boiled, are considered great delicacies.  Bates, however,
found, that though the flesh is very tender, palatable, and wholesome, it becomes cloying after
a person has lived on it for some time; and he at length could not bear the smell, even though
suffering from hunger.

FISHING-NETS AND BASKETS.

The tribes on the River Uape's use several kinds of bows, some from five to six feet long,--the
arrows being still longer.  The shaft is made of the flower-stalk of the arrow-grass.  The
head is composed of hard wood pointed, and sometimes armed with a serrated spine of the ray-fish,
covered thickly with poison, and notched, so as easily to break off--a most deadly weapon.
Their arrows for shooting fish are armed with iron heads, while smaller arrows are used for
shooting small game.  These alone have feathers at the base, generally from the wings of the
macaw. They are secured spirally, forming thus a little screw on the base of the arrow, causing
it to revolve rapidly, and assisting to keep it in a direct course.

They employ also several sorts of hand-nets for catching fish: one is very similar to the folding
nets of entomologists, and another is like a landing net.  Rods and lines are generally used
by them.  They also catch fish by means of a small conical-shaped wicker basket.  The larger
end is completely open.  Into this, which is placed in a current, the fish enter, and swimming
rapidly on, jam themselves into the narrow end, where, unable to turn, they are completely
secured.  They also use large cylindrical baskets, with reversed cones in the mouth like those
of lobster-pots, but of much greater size.

Fish are also caught by means of weirs.  These are well built, supported by strong posts. 
They are formed when the water is low.  As the water rises, the fish, keeping by the sides
of the stream, are guided by the side wings of the weir into its narrow opening, out of which
they cannot make their way.  Not only fish, but turtles find their way into these weirs, and
sometimes electric eels--as also those dreaded fish, the piranhas.  The Indian gets the fish
out by diving into the weir armed with a small hand-net, and sometimes with a knife.  He first
endeavours, however, to learn whether any of his foes are within, and gets them out first.
Another kind of weir is formed on a still larger scale, generally beneath cataracts or waterfalls.
It is similar to the eel-traps sometimes used at mills.  As the water pours into it, the fish
are often caught in great numbers.  These traps, however, require a considerable amount of
ingenuity and a great exertion of strength for their construction, as large timbers must be
used, to withstand the strength of the current.

CANOES.

Most of the tribes make their canoes out of single trees, which they hollow and expand by means
of a fire placed beneath them, gradually inserting wedges and cross-pieces.  It is first reared
on trestles, with a slit downwards over the fire--which is kept up for seven or eight hours.
The process requires great and constant attention, to avoid cracks, and make the canoe bend
with the proper dip at the two ends. Additional planks are often secured to the sides, while
the stem and stern are formed of semicircular boards pegged on to the ends of the trunk.  The
seams are then caulked with gum.  The paddles have oval blades, and are about three feet in
length, cut out of single pieces.

MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.

A somewhat complicated musical instrument, consisting of twelve pipes or trumpets, made of
bamboos fastened together, with trumpet-shaped mouthpieces of bark, is used by one tribe of
Indians.  The sounds are not disagreeable, resembling somewhat clarionets and bassoons.  No
woman, however, is allowed to see them; and as soon as they are brought out, all the females
hurry off to hide themselves.  Should any one attempt to observe the mysterious instrument,
she is immediately put to death,--generally by poison.  A father or a husband would not hesitate
on such an occasion to sacrifice his daughter or wife.

The Indians of the Uapes manufacture with great neatness a variety of articles, such as fine
hammocks, baskets, and gourds--which they paint with elegant devices; also earthenware water-pitchers
and pans for cooking, and clay ovens.  They also show skill in making several musical instruments--like
fifes and whistles, as also drums--and all sorts of ornaments for the person.  Their feather
dresses are remarkable for their elegance and the labour bestowed on them.

The Purupurus, one of the most savage tribes, have an instrument-- employed by no others--called
the palheta.  It is a piece of wood with a projection at the end, in which the base of the
arrow is secured.  The arrow is held with the handle of the palheta in the hand, and thus thrown
as a stone from a sling.  The natives exhibit wonderful dexterity in the use of this weapon,
and with the greatest facility kill birds, fish, and game of all sorts with it.

PART FOUR, CHAPTER ONE.

NORTHERN REGIONS OF SOUTH AMERICA.

VENEZUELA.

New Granada is almost entirely a mountain region, occupied by the northern end of the Andes,
except where it slopes down towards the Isthmus of Panama and the Caribbean Sea.  Venezuela,
however, contains three distinct zones or characters of country--mountains, forests, and open
plains.  The mountain regions, which are also three in number, are separated by wide plains.
On the west, the mountains belong to the Andes--being spurs of that range--a large portion
consisting of table-lands, called paramos, from 10,000 to 14,000 feet above the sea-level.
Among them lies the Lake of Maracaibo, ninety-two miles in length, and eighty-two in width--the
largest in South America.  On the north-east is the Sierra de Bergantin, and in the south-east
the Sierra de Parima.  The forests extend from the Orinoco southward, joining that of the Amazon--a
vast tract, but seldom penetrated by the traveller.

The natives call the three zones into which they divide their country the Tierras Calidas,
or hot countries--rising not more that 2000 feet above the sea, and in which only tropical
plants and fruits flourish; the Tierras Templadas, or temperate country--from 2000 to 7000
feet above the sea, where the agricultural productions of Europe succeed best; and the Tierras
Frias, or cold countries--which rise above the former, to the height of 15,000 feet, the summits
of the mountains reaching 148 feet above the snow-line.

Two seasons exist in the tropics, into which the year is divided--the wet and the dry.  Though
the heat is greatest in the former, it is called winter, as the sun then passes twice over
the zenith; while during the dry season, which is called summer, the sun is in the southern
hemisphere.  During the whole year the north-east trade-wind blows across the country, but
modified in direction and force by these seasons.

In consequence of the very different elevations of the land, the productions of nearly all
parts of the world can here be cultivated successfully.  In the hot districts, chiefly bordered
by the sea, cotton, indigo, cacao, coffee, sugar, tobacco, and cocoa-nuts come to perfection.
The cocoa-palm, enjoying the advantage of the sea-breeze, here grows to a height of seven hundred
feet above the ocean.  No tobacco surpasses that of the well-known Varina.  Barley and millet,
as well as wheat, are produced on the more elevated tracts; while maize is cultivated all over
the country.

The wide-extending marshes and pools are frequented by pelicans, herons, and wild geese, ducks,
and flamingoes; while other birds--chiefly belonging to the Falconidae, Ardeidae, Strigidae,
and Psittacidae--are numerous.  The savage alligator and fearful anaconda abound in all the
rivers and lakes; while the jaguar, puma, ounce, tiger-cat, monkey, tapir, capybara, porcupine,
wild hog, sloth, and ant-eater range through its forests and savannahs.

Numerous tribes of the aborigines, driven back by the whites, exist in the remoter districts.
They are generally of a dark copper colour, while some are of a lighter hue; and though building
huts, most of them go almost naked.  They exist on plantains, yucca, batatas, and the sugar-cane--which
they rudely cultivate; and the fish, as well as the manatees and alligators, which swarm in
their waters.

The neighbourhood of the Caraccas is described as a terrestrial paradise, where spring perpetually
reigns.  In this favoured region, all the fruits of the tropics come to the greatest perfection.
The delicious chirimoya takes the first place.  It is likened to lumps of flavoured cream,
ready to be frozen, suspended from the branches of some fairy tree, amidst an overpowering
perfume of flowers--for it is in bearing all the year round.  "He who has not tasted the chirimoya
fruit, has yet to learn what fruit is," says Markham.

Here, too, the grandilla, in shape like a water-melon, hangs from its delicate tendrils.  When
cut open, it is found filled with a juice-like nectar, having the flavour of the strawberry
and peach.  A species, of cactus--the nopal--produces the tuna or Indian fig.

It is on the fleshy, downy stems of the cactus that the cochineal insect is reared, producing
the valuable crimson dyes which outshine the vaunted productions of Tyre; and from the same
family of plants rises the magnificent pitahaya,--"those flowers known for size and effulgence,
which begin to open as the sun declines, and bloom during the night, shedding a delicious fragrance,
and offering their brimful goblets, filled with nectareous juice, to thousands of moths and
other crepuscular and nocturnal insects," as Gosse describes it.

The splendid mammey apple-tree (Mammea Americana), which bears numbers of round and heavy fruits,
brown outside, and of a golden yellow within, valued for the marmalades and other delicacies
formed from them.

Of the same family as the chirimoya is the guanabana (Anona muricata), or sour sop, an unattractive
name for so delicious a fruit.  From it a cooling drink is made, and ices of fine flavour.

A near relative is the custard apple, filled with a ruddy compounded substance, which no cook
can surpass.  As also the rinon (Anona squamosa), a kidney-like fruit in form, with a custard-like
interior.

The superb alligator-pear, more properly called percia gratissima; its first name given probably
from its being indigenous to a country abounding in saurian reptiles, otherwise it is difficult
to account for its inappropriate designation.  It resembles in shape a large pear; but the
interior of its rind is lined with a marrow-like substance of a yellowish colour, somewhat
like butter, and used at the breakfast-table.

Among other products is the tamarind, unrivalled either as regards beauty of foliage, brilliancy
of blossoms, or the delicacy of its acidulous pulpy pods.  In blossom the tree is a lovely
object.  Amid its feathery dark green foliage issue, in vast numbers, golden yellow branches
with delicate flowers dazzling to the eye; while its fruits in a green state form a candied
sweetmeat, or when ripe, and made into a decoction, a refreshing drink for fever-stricken patients.

The inaja-palm, of various species, produces pellucid pods, from one to two feet in length,
containing a row of beans--enveloped in white cottony pulp--grateful to the taste.

The cocoa-palm, though at a distance from the coast, here flourishes in great perfection, adding
to the splendour of the vegetation, with its glorious crown of monster leaves; while the plantain
and banana are widely cultivated, a few plants of which are sufficient to supply a family with
bread, vegetables, fruit, and preserves of various kinds. Humboldt observes that an area planted
with plantains produces nearly twenty times as much food as the same space sown with corn.

HUMMING-BIRDS.

Amid this rich and varied vegetation, swarms of tiny and brilliant humming-birds flutter round
the masses of highly-scented blossoms that perfume the air, and which might be mistaken by
the stranger at first sight for some of the metallic-coloured beetles which dispute with them
the nectar of the fragrant flowers, so brilliant is the lustre shed by both.  As Gosse well
remarks: "For that peculiar charm which resides in flashing light, combined with the most brilliant
colours, the lustre of precious stones, there are no birds, no creatures, that can compare
with the humming-birds, confined exclusively to America."  These lovely little winged gems
were to the Mexican and Peruvian Indians the very quintessence of beauty; and were called by
various names, signifying "the rays of the sun," and the like.  Fully four hundred distinct
species of these winged gems are supposed to exist on the continent.

TREES.

Of the trees which have a wide range over the country, especially near the sea-coast, the lignum
vitae is of great value.  As from its hard nature it turns the edge of the best-tempered tools,
it serves for the construction of wharves, as well as for the keels of ships,--the attacks
of the teredo, or sea-worm, being futile upon the iron network of its fibres.  It can remain
under water for an indefinite period without rotting, and eventually becomes petrified.

Here the guayacan, or guayacum of the arts, is found in great abundance.

The alcornoque, a beautiful tree, scarcely inferior to it, here raises its graceful head above
the rest, affording the cattle a permanent shade during the dry season; while in the Llanos
it is used in the construction of houses and fences.

The Brazileto-wood tree grows in abundance, producing a beautiful dye.

Among others is the tree which yields the precious balsam of copaiba,-- extracted by making
incisions in the trunk, when the resinous fluid pours forth.

The natives form their piroques or canoes from the last which we will mention, the tacamahaca
(the Elaphrium tornentosium), which here attains great dimensions.  The bark is of the nature
of the birch-bark of North America, and is stripped off the trees in a similar manner, the
huge sheets being joined at the extremities by means of slender vines, while the interstices
are filled with resin to keep out the water--the whole being then bound with stronger vines,
and several sticks being fixed between the borders to prevent the bark from collapsing.  The
resin of this tree, an opaque lemon-coloured substance, resembles wax; and when mixed with
algoroba, it forms a torch which burns with great brilliancy, and emits a delicious odour.

The vast Llanos, already mentioned, in the north cover a surface of about 110,600 square miles.
Over a large portion of this wide-extending region, even the wild Indian, there unable to find
subsistence, but seldom roamed; and thus for ages it remained a howling wilderness, inhabited,
and that only at certain seasons, by the jaguar, the peccary, the agouti, and the timid deer.
Here, when the summer sun sends down its burning rays day after day from a cloudless sky, the
grass withered and shrivelled by its heat, the plain presents the appearance of a desert waste.
No cooling breeze passes across it, no shelter is found from the scorching heat.  The pools
are dried-up, the surface of the swamps becomes cracked and dry--the brown stalks of the tall
reeds alone marking the nature of the ground.  Here, occasionally, when the blast sweeps across
the plain, columns of dust are set in motion, like those of the African Sahara, overwhelming
and stifling the incautious traveller, who is hurled senseless to the ground.

Here, too, as in other desert regions, the mirage mocks him as he journeys across it parched
with thirst--often assuming a semblance of the ocean, slowly moving in wave-like undulations.

The few trees and shrubs which here and there rise from the plain assume a greyish-yellow tint,
showing that the sap which has hitherto nourished their leaves has ceased to flow,--stopped
by the burning heat, which has dried-up every particle of moisture from which they are wont
to obtain nourishment.  At this season even the animals take their departure; here and there
the alligator and anaconda alone remain, in a torpid state, buried in the clay of the dried-up
swamps.

The traveller who ventures across this arid region has not only to encounter the breath of
the simoom, the sufferings of burning thirst, the attacks of wild beasts, the bite of the matacabello--which
may kill his steed and leave him helpless--and many other dangers, but, more fearful than all,
flames caused by some camp-fire incautiously left burning, seizing the parched vegetation,
traverse the plain with inconceivable rapidity.  He and his Indian guides, without whom he
could not venture across it, discover far-away on the horizon columns of smoke ascending to
the skies.  The Indians, standing up in their stirrups, gaze at it anxiously for a moment to
watch its direction, and then pressing their steeds to their utmost speed, urge him to fly
for life. At first he can scarcely believe that yon distant line of smoke is menacing them
with danger; but soon onwards it comes, the burning torrent rolling rapidly towards them. 
Now and then they turn their heads to watch its progress.  In vain they look out in every direction
for a darker patch in the plain, which may indicate a water pool, and amid which they may seek
refuge.  None appears.  On they rush, urging their horses by whip and spur--their steeds seeming
to know their danger.  Already they see the bright glare of the flames below the dark mass
of smoke.  Already the bursting and crackling of the leaves, as the threatening column rushes
on, reaches their ears.  A fearful death is following them.  At length the sharp eyes of one
of the guides discover a slight eminence; towards this, though almost despairing of safety,
they direct their course.  They reach its base.  It is but thinly covered with vegetation.
Scarcely have they urged up their panting horses to the summit than the flames overtake them.
And now the sea of fire rolls its devouring billows around, and the suffocating smoke, striking
in their faces, compels them to fall on the ground, in the hope of obtaining sufficient air
for breathing, till the flames have passed by.  The fire mounts the hill, but happily, finding
little nourishment, is speedily extinguished.  And now the waving mass, rolling onwards, recedes
further and further from their gaze.

Whole swarms of voracious vultures follow in circling flight the smoky column, like so many
hungry jackals, and pounce upon the snakes and lizards which the blaze has stifled and half
calcined in its murderous embrace.  Then, with the rapidity of lightning, they dart on their
prey and disappear in the clouds of smoke, as if they were voluntarily devoting themselves
to a fiery death.  Soon the deafening noise of the conflagration ceases, and the dense black
clouds in the distance are the only signs that the flames are still proceeding on their devastating
path over the wide waste of the savannah.

The travellers thus happily saved may now proceed on their course, provided they have a supply
of water for themselves, and have certain information of the existence of some deep pool at
which their steeds may quench their thirst.  Let them be cautious, however, how they approach
the pool; for beneath its surface the alligator and anaconda lie hid, or the electric eel--which
with its powerful galvanic battery may strike the steed which ventures within its reach.

Even in this arid region the bountiful Creator has not left his creatures without the means
of sustaining life.  Here, on the driest soil, the globular melon-cactus, measuring a foot
in diameter, flourishes; its tough and prickly skin surrounding a rich and juicy pulp.  It
is, however, covered with long, sharp thorns, which must be broken off before the refreshing
juice can be obtained.  It is curious that the wild horse and ox--strangers, as it were, to
the region--are not possessed of the sagacity to do this; while the mule, when it discovers
the melon, sets to work at once with its fore-feet, and then cautiously sips the refreshing liquid.

Day after day the sun, with a lurid glare spread far and wide over the cloudless sky, rises
above the arid plains, drawing up every particle of moisture, and withering with the intense
heat of his rays every blade of grass and green leaf, till it seems as if the whole region
were doomed to eternal desolation.  At length, however, a wonderful change takes place over
the hitherto arid waste.  A thick veil of mist is drawn across the blue sky.  A low bank of
clouds appears on the horizon. Gradually it rises, assuming the form of distant mountain-chains
above the plain.  Onwards it advances, increasing in density, while vivid flashes of lightning
dart forth; the thunder is heard rolling in the distance, and now loud crashing peals burst
from the clouds, which rapidly spreading across the vault of heaven, plenteous showers rush
downwards on the parched earth, filling up the dry cracks in the marshes, replenishing the
pools, and swelling the streams.  The grass springs up on every long-dry spot, the leaves burst
forth, while thousands of flowers of every tint and hue enamel the plain; and, as if by magic,
the whole face of nature is in a few hours changed.  In a short time the thorny bushes of the
delicate and feathery-foliaged mimosas are loaded with masses of canary-coloured blossoms,
from their summits down to the lowest branches, sending forth an almost overpowering perfume;
while the fronds of the beautiful mauritias--the palm of the Llanos--rising to the height of
one hundred feet above the plain, sprout forth in rich luxuriance.

Animal life, too, wakes up.  The savage alligator and the huge anaconda crawl forth from the
bed of clay in which they have passed their summer sleep, in search of prey; ibises, cranes,
flamingoes, and numberless water-fowl, swarm on the newly-formed pools; the cattle of the Llaneros
luxuriate in the abundant grasses which everywhere appear; while multitudes of insects crawl
forth, seeking refuge from the flood in the higher grounds.  The swollen rivers now inundate
the plains, and the spots where the cattle wandered in vain to quench their thirst can now
be passed for miles together by boats; and alligators lie in wait to seize in their savage
jaws the horses and oxen compelled to swim across the flooded land in search of pasture.

THE LLANEROS.

Sterile as the Llanos appear during the dry season, numerous cattle-farms exist, scattered
widely over large portions.  The Llaneros, as the inhabitants are called--descendants of the
white settlers, with an admixture of Indians and blacks--are a hardy, bold race, living almost
entirely on horseback, engaged in watching over their herds, and in battling with the spotted
jaguar, the savage cayman, the huge boa and anaconda, and occasionally the fierce natives of
the surrounding deserts.  Often, too, they have to struggle for their lives against the sudden
inroads of the vast inundations which sweep off their herds and frail habitations.  Armed with
their unerring lasso and garrocha, or sharp lance, blunderbuss and sword, they fear no foes.
These lances, formed of the tough stem of a small palm, are weapons of no slight importance
to them.  They are sharpened to a point at one end, and hardened in the fire, or sometimes
have an iron head.  Round the point a number of loose metal rings are secured, which when shaken
produce a loud rattling sound.

See a band of these hardy horsemen in chase of the wild cattle which roam at large over the
plains.  In bands of six or ten, they form a circle of fifteen miles or so in circumference--bivouacking
during the previous night at their respective stations.  At early dawn they mount their horses;
and now, shouting and shrieking, with their lasso coiled before them on their saddle, and their
garrocha in their hand, whirled round and round, they advance, closing in towards the centre
of the circle, and driving before them all the animals they meet.  The animals, terrified by
the cries and whirling spears, dash madly forward,--some endeavouring to break away from the
circle, when they are speedily turned back by the sharp goads of the horsemen.  Not only the
cattle, but wild boars, deer, and other quadrupeds, starting up from the ground where they
have been resting, dash on amid the confused herd.  And now perhaps several thousand head of
cattle are collected within the circle formed by a hundred or more horsemen.  If a fierce bull,
turning round, ventures to encounter them, they shake their rattling spears in his ears, and
quickly again turn him.

When a bull is overtaken, the Llanero thrusts the point of his spear into the animal's shoulder,
and, leaning forward with the whole weight of his body upon the shaft, overthrows the savage
creature, who rolls headlong on the plain, where he is quickly secured.  Sometimes a fiercer
bull than ordinary charges the horsemen, who fly on either side; but wheeling round speedily,
with their lassos whirling round their heads, the noose is thrown over the animal's horns,
and the well-trained steeds assisting their riders, he is speedily brought to the ground. 
A hole being then pierced in the thick cartilage of the nostrils, a thong is passed through
it, the other end being fastened to the horse's tail.  A jerk quickly brings the bull to his
feet, and he is led off a captive.

A still bolder manoeuvre is accomplished by the expert horseman. Galloping after the bull,
the rider seizes the animal's tail, giving it a turn round his own wrist, and then again urges
forward his horse till both are at full speed, when, suddenly turning in an oblique direction,
by a powerful jerk--from the impetuosity imparted by their rapid speed-- the bull is brought
to the ground.  Here, too, the horse, knowing what is about to be done, starts forward at the
proper moment, and assists in accomplishing the work.  Sometimes the daring Llanero will throw
himself from his seat, still holding on to the tail of the bull, and seldom fails ultimately
to overthrow it.

The whole scene is one of the wildest confusion.  Clouds of dust rise from the dry plain, trampled
on by the hoofs of numberless animals.  The bulls, driven to fury, tear up the earth, and with
deep, savage bellowings rush at their fellows as well as at their foes, unable to distinguish
one from the other--often piercing the former with their sharp horns.  The uproar is increased
by the yells and shouts of the Llaneros galloping in all directions over the ground, rattling
their garrochas, waving their ponchos, and whirling their lassos.  Yet further to increase
the turmoil and uproar, flocks of cranes and herons, startled by the hoofs of the horses and
shouts of the riders as they rush onward, rise from the stunted frees of a neighbouring marsh,
with loud cries and clashing of wings, into the air, hovering above the heads of the actors
in such numbers as almost to darken the sky as they circle round and round.

The object of the hunt is to separate the cattle of the different owners, and to drive them
into their respective corrals or majadas. Tame cattle are employed to assist in the operation,
and are stationed at various places round the circle.  The horsemen, dashing in among the mass
of excited animals, fearless of the points of their sharp horns, drive out with their lances
those they recognise as their own property-- known by the notches on their ears--goading them
with their lances.  The animals, now separated with wonderful skill, are, with their calves,
urged towards the groups of their well-trained kindred, who lead them on towards the destined
corral.  Often, however, suspecting treachery, they turn round and attempt to escape, rushing
with mad fury towards the horsemen--many of whose steeds are thus pierced by their horns, and
the riders, overthrown, with difficulty escaping.

Thus they at length reach the entrance of the corral, which is in the shape of a funnel, composed
of stout posts strengthened by thick rafters.  Here the most desperate struggle often ensues;
but the bulls are met by an array of the rattling garrochas; and though some may escape at
the last, the great mass are, by the skill of the Llaneros, at length secured within the corral,--many
of the cattle receiving desperate wounds.

These farms of the Llanos, built in the roughest and most primitive style, are surrounded by
fences, intended not only to resist the rush of a herd of cattle, but the attack of human foes.
The inclosures are formed of huge trunks of trees, driven close together into the ground. It
would seem difficult to account for the way in which they are brought across the plain.  This
is done, however, during the inundation of the savannahs, when they are transported to the
spot on rafts made of lighter wood,--the timbers themselves being composed of a species of
acacia of extreme hardness, and from their nature capable of resisting the effects of alternation
of climate for many years.  Many of these corrals are sufficiently spacious to contain three
thousand head of cattle.

When the animal is to be caught for slaughter, the horsemen go in chase, the one securing it
by his lasso over its head and dragging it along, while the other urges it on with his garrocha
till it reaches the slaughter-post.  The first then secures the animal by a few turns of the
lasso round it, while a matador strikes his dagger into the vertebras at the back of the head,
when the animal drops as if struck by an electric spark.

These wild horsemen, when crossing a river, hesitate not to plunge in, in spite of the alligators
which may be swarming on every side.  While their clothes are carried across in a hide-formed
canoe, put together at the moment, they dash into the stream without clothes or saddles, and
then slipping from the backs of their horses, support themselves on the animals' haunches with
one hand, while they guide them by means of the halter with the other--their companions on
the shore shouting, yelling, and shaking their ponchos, to drive the rest of the herd into
the water. The caymans, alarmed by the uproar, keep at a distance; but the savage little caribes
frequently attack them, and many thus fall.

Besides cattle, horses, and mules, vast numbers of hogs range over the plain,--the descendants
of those introduced by the early settlers, and which are now, from their ferocity, and the
formidable size of their tusks, considered foes worthy of the lances of the bold horsemen.
These lances, generally used in hunting, have played no insignificant part in the hands of
the Llaneros, as well as in those of some of the fierce tribes of the desert, during the civil
wars which so long disturbed the country.

A profusion of fruits in a state of nature grow in the woods and plains. Among them are several
species of wild guavas.  Some are of exquisite flavour and aroma.  One sort bears in rich profusion
a number of brilliant scarlet, highly perfumed, and acidulous fruits.  There are various kinds
of custard apples, the inside a sweet and highly aromatic pulp filled with small seeds.  Also
the madrona, which resembles the lemon in shape and colour, and filled with a pulp enveloping
several large nuts, the flavour not unlike strawberries.  The tree which produces these fruits
attains a height of sixty feet, and has a dense foliage of a brilliant green.

On a vine grows the monkey cacao bean, which these animals eagerly devour.

There are many leguminous trees, some bearing pods ten inches long, filled with rows of black
beans enveloped in a snow-white and agreeably sweet pulp.  Here also is the algarobo, or locust-tree
of the New World; bearing pods filled with beans surrounded by a sweet farinaceous substance,
of a highly nutritious quality.

Indeed, Venezuela is behind no other region of the world in the variety and quality of its
natural productions.

PART FOUR, CHAPTER TWO.

GUIANA.

A wide belt of low land borders the ocean side of Guiana on the north-east of the continent,
where white men dwell, in houses elevated on piles of timber, among sugar-estates and cotton-plantations,
tall windmills, and numerous canals crowded with shipping, which would present a thoroughly
Dutch scene were it not for the stately cocoa-nut and cabbage-palms rising amid them, the dark-skinned
labourers, the blue sky, and burning heat.  The province is, however, for the most part a region
of rugged mountains, dense forests, open savannahs, broad streams, cataracts, waterfalls, and
rapids; where the yet untamed savage, making war on his neighbours, and sunk in the grossest
barbarism, lives as his predecessors have done for centuries past.

Through the centre of the territory flows the Essequibo, the largest river between the Amazon
and the Orinoco.  Its source is among the same mountains which give birth to some of the tributaries
of those mighty rivers, the one running to the north, the other to the south; thus adding to
the wonderful network which unites the waters of South America.

It was through this region that the gallant Raleigh, and many bands of Spanish adventurers
in succession, in spite of the most terrific dangers and difficulties, fought their way amid
hostile natives in search of the far-famed El Dorado.  Among the first bands was that led by
the celebrated Philip Von Huten.  They had heard that in the interior of the country there
existed a golden region, surpassing even the wildest descriptions of that of Peru.  It was
said that some of the royal race of the Incas, escaping from their Spanish invaders, had established
a new dynasty amid the mountains, on the shores of a beautiful lake, the sands of which contained
gold in prodigious quantities.  The houses of his capital were covered with plates of gold.
The vessels of the royal palace were of the same metal; and so abundant was it, that the natives,
anointing their bodies with a glutinous substance, sprinkled them over with the dust.  The
person of the sovereign was especially thus adorned by his attendants.  Oviedo remarks--"As
this kind of garment would be uneasy whilst sleeping, the prince washes himself every evening,
and is gilded afresh in the morning;" thus proving that the empire of El Dorado is infinitely
rich in mines.

Von Huten and his band, after desperate fighting, were compelled to retire, just as they believed
they had seen in the far-off distance the shining roofs of the splendid city.  Their leader
was preparing another expedition when he fell by the hand of an assassin.

Notwithstanding the dangers to be encountered from the fierce Caribs-- who, sheltered by trees
and rocks everywhere, attacked their foes with poisoned arrows--and the numerous disappointments
which occurred, fresh bands of adventurers, age after age, still believing in the fabled wealth
which was to be their prize should they succeed, set forth, in hope of reaching the wonderful
city.  Some of Sir Walter Raleigh's followers declared, indeed, that they saw rocks shining
brightly with gold, and a mountain containing diamonds and other valuable stones, the lustre
of which blazed forth to a considerable distance.

Every marvellous fable found belief.  The crew of an English ship, about that time exploring
the Marowyne, stated that they had seen on its banks a gigantic race of men, who carried in
their hands bows made of gold. Wherever mica was seen glittering on the side of a mountain,
it was supposed to be the same precious metal.  Sir Walter Raleigh sent his faithful lieutenant,
Captain Keymis, to carry on the expedition he was himself unable to undertake.  His chief object,
and that of his successors, was to discover the site of the golden city.  Keymis, while sailing
up the Essequibo, heard that by ascending one of its tributaries--the Rupunoony--he would certainly
reach it.

Numerous other expeditions were organised by Spaniards and Portuguese. Many of the unfortunate
adventurers fell by the hands of the natives, others by famine and fatigue; and as late as
the year 1776 a large band set forth, when many hundreds perished, one man only returning to
tell the sad fate of his companions.

At length, in the quarter to which Captain Keymis had been directed, the small lake of Amucu
was discovered, to which a river called the Parinia is connected; and from the geological structure
of the surrounding country, is supposed to have been formerly much larger than at present.
Within and around it are islands and, rocks of mica, slate, and talc; "the materials," observes
Humboldt, "out of which has been formed that gorgeous capital, whose temples and houses were
overlaid with beaten plates of gold."  Schombergh, who visited the lake, agrees with the German
philosopher.  Another traveller, Hillhouse, in 1830 ascended the Masaruni, which flows from
the northern side of the mountains of Roraima, among which the lake is situated; and believes
that its romantic valley was once the bed of a large lake twelve miles in width, and upwards
of one hundred miles in length,--which long ago burst its barriers and gave rise to the fable
still preserved among the Indians, and, till within almost the present century, believed in
by the colonists themselves.

RIVERS:--THE ESSEQUIBO.

Let us take a glance over some of the rivers of the land.

The Essequibo, called by the Indians the "younger brother of the Orinoco," first claims attention.
The mouth has rather the appearance of a vast lake than a river, its shores bordered by thick
groves of that tree of curious structure, the mangrove, whose roots or seeds, borne on the
ocean wave, strike wherever they can find a muddy soil, throughout every part of the tropics.
Rising upwards on the roots, which it shoots downwards as it grows, the base of its stem is
often six or eight feet from the ground--the stem itself seldom more than a foot in diameter,
and from fifteen to twenty feet in height.  Its thick stiff ribs, about eight inches long and
nine inches wide, are of a dark sombre hue.  This broad estuary, extending inland for thirty
miles or more, with numerous picturesque islands covered by tropical vegetation rising out
of it, is joined by the united streams of the Masaruni and Cuyuni, its own and their romantic
waterfalls making a continuous navigation up them impossible.  Yet, notwithstanding its impediments,
these rivers afford the only means of communication, except along the foot-tracks of the Indians,
through the dense forests, into the far-off interior.  These forests commence in many parts
close to the ocean, spreading often for thousands of square miles, broken sometimes by swamps,
and at others by wide savannahs, open spaces covered with grasses, and here and there clumps
of trees.  Even the sand-hills of moderate height bordering the Atlantic are clothed by the
superb vegetation of the tropics,--the forest extending to, and even climbing up the sides
of the Rocky Mountains.  Vast timber trees, the purple and green heart, the stately mora, the
locust-tree, raise their heads above their smaller brethren, conquering in the struggle for
room to allow their foliage to expand; while below, the moist carpet of fallen leaves, fungi,
and moss, increases the richness of the vegetation.  Here also are numerous graceful palms,--the
cocorite, from which the Indians form their poisoned arrows; the troali, with broad and long
leaves, used for thatching their huts.  The graceful manicol, rising to a great height, bends,
like the weeping willow, its slender stem over the stream; and, with several other species
of palm, it affords the succulent cabbage. Beautiful parasites hang in every direction from
the trunks and boughs-- sipos ascending and clinging in intricate network, interlacing the
trunks and branches, and often supporting the remnants of the trees they themselves by their
fatal embrace have destroyed; indeed, the same style of forest here exists as throughout the
Valley of the Amazon.

As the flora is much the same on a similar altitude, so there is little difference in the fauna,
although some species are found in Guiana which are unknown in the latter region.  The native
tribes, however--the red men of the wilds--differ considerably.  Near the supposed site of
the famed El Dorado at Pirara, situated on the borders of Brazil, some thirty years ago, an
attempt was made to carry, not the gold that perishes, but the joyful news of salvation, to
the long-benighted Indians in that region.  It was blessed, and was prospering greatly, and
gave promise of the speedy conversion of the Macusi tribe and others, when some Brazilian Roman
Catholic priests, hearing of it, determined on its destruction, and induced their government
to claim the region as Brazilian territory.  A detachment of militia was despatched, and took
possession of the village.  The Indians, fearing lest the Brazilians might conduct them into
slavery, dispersed into the forests and mountains, while the missionary with difficulty escaped
with his life.

The distance to be traversed from the British capital of George Town to Pirara is about three
hundred miles; and though the scenery is of that enchanting character which, as the enthusiastic
Waterton describes it, made his soul overflow with joy, and roam in fancy through fairyland,
yet, as it is through an almost uninhabited country, with numerous rapids and torrents, woods
to be traversed, and mountains to be climbed, the difficulties are not contemptible.

"To surmount these obstacles to navigation," say Mr Brett, "it is necessary in some places
to carry or haul the canoe overland at the sides of the fall.  At others, advantage is taken
of the eddies which are found at the base, and huge rocks that intercept the stream.  The Indians
pass from rock to rock by leaping, wading, or swimming, and, by means of a hawser, haul the
boat through the rushing water from one resting-point to another, the steersman keeping his
seat, and--sometimes lashed to it--striving with his large paddle to guide in some degree her
course.  The roar of the water dashing and foaming against the surrounding rocks renders this
operation as exciting as it is difficult. Still more exciting and difficult is the task of
descending these rapids.  The safety of all then depends on their perfect steadiness, and on
the bowman and steersman acting in concert, and with instant decision.  The canoe is kept in
the very centre of the current, one of her best hands kneeling with quick eye and ready paddles
in the bow, and the rest of the crew exerting their strength to give her headway. Darting swiftly
along, she arrives at the head of the fall, and bounding downward, shoots into the surf below
it, dashing it up on either side, and leaving her crew alone visible.  If all be well, rising
above the foam, she obeys the guiding paddles in stem and stern, and dances over the tumbling
waves, while her excited crew exult at their success. Whole families, however, even of Indians,
are sometimes drowned; and in 1805 Captain Beresford, son-in-law of the governor, and four
other gentlemen, with two of their crew, lost their lives in shooting the lower falls of the
Masaruni."

THE BERBICE RIVER.

On the Berbice, which falls into the Atlantic about sixty miles eastward of George Town, the
falls and rapids--which do not, however, reach to within one hundred and sixty miles of its
mouth--are very numerous. While the scenery round them is highly picturesque, they are extremely
dangerous.  Here is found the cascade of Idurewadde; and higher up, the cataract of Itabru.
Above these again are more than forty falls and rapids, called by Schombergh the Christmas
Cataracts, and which cost him and his companions immense labour to surmount.  On their return,
one of the party, rashly standing on the thwarts of the canoe while shooting the falls, upset
it and was drowned.

Huge caymans abound in the river, and lie like logs of wood at the foot of the cataracts or
rapids, watching stealthily to catch and swallow whatever the fierce current may bring down
to them.

Above these falls is a lagoon, on which he discovered the now far-famed Victoria Regia, before
that time unknown to the world.  At the head of the Masaruni rises Mount Roraima, 7540 feet
in height.  It is the principal watershed, from which various streams flow in different directions
into the three great rivers--Amazon, Orinoco, and Essequibo. Hillhouse and Schombergh describe
the side of the mountain as composed of cliffs, fifteen hundred feet in height, of compact
sandstone, as perpendicular as if erected with the plumb-line, and overhung in part with low
shrubs.  Though distant, they appear as if in dangerous proximity.  Around are detached masses,
apparently torn from those gigantic walls of nature; and every moment it seems as if one of
them would block up the path, or cut off all retreat.  In places the channel of the stream
is so narrow that the canoe can hardly pass, in others it widens out into a shallow claret-coloured
lake.  At length a capacious basin is entered, black as ink, surrounded by a bold and extensive
shore as white as chalk.  The roar of the water is heard, but no current perceived; though
there is a foam-like yeast on the surface, which remains all day without visible alteration.
At length, in the distance, a broken white line is seen struggling through a cluster of granite
rocks at the base of two quartz cliffs of a mixed character.  This is the fall of Macrebah.

THE ARECUNA INDIANS.

In those mountain regions dwell the Arecunas, a fine sturdy race--with clear copper-tinted
skins--unencumbered by clothing, though wearing feathers and other ornaments; long sticks through
the cartilage of their nostrils, and still longer, richly adorned with tufts of black feathers,
through their ears.  Both sexes are much tattooed; some of the women having dark blue lines
across the upper lip, and extending in wavy curves over each cheek, looking like enormous curled
moustaches.  Others have a broad line round the mouth, which gives it the appearance of being
far larger than it is in reality.  The men wear the heads of humming-birds and of a bird of
a beautiful blue colour in their ears; and round their waist, girdles of monkey's hair.

Schombergh, who visited them, says they made a great feast in his honour, when there was a
grand display of gorgeous plumes, and head-dresses,--the whole winged tribe having apparently
been put in requisition to furnish forth the most brilliant of their feathers.  They had also
necklaces of the teeth of monkeys and peccaries, and porcupines' quills; to which were attached
long cotton fringes--which hung down their backs, and to which toucan and other skins were
suspended securely.  Feasting and dancing, kept up by the natives thus dressed, lasted the
whole night; and the constantly-repeated burden of their song was--"Roraima of the red rock,
wrapped in clouds, the ever-fertile source of streams."

THE CORENTYN RIVER.

Eastward of the Berbice, and greatly inferior in size to the Essequibo, is the Corentyn, which
has its source near the equator, and forms the boundary of the British colony.  A few Indians
of various tribes dwell on its banks near the mouth, but above their last settlement desolation
reigns supreme.

On the rocks near its banks may be seen a few rude carvings, the handiwork of a race long passed
away.  Day after day the voyager on its waters passes amid the wildest and most romantic scenery,--amid
numerous islands, rocks, and rapids; but no human beings are seen--not a light canoe on its
waters, not an habitation on its banks.  At length, after a nine days' voyage, enormous rocks
appear heaped together, opposing progress; vast chasms yawn beneath his feet when he lands,
and at certain places the streams sink into the earth as if by magic, to reappear where least
expected.  A thundering noise is heard, and a mist hovers in the air, in which thousands of
birds disport themselves,-- marking the position of the great cataracts of the Corentyn.  The
scene, however, is too vast to be beheld in its full grandeur from any single point of view.
No waterfall in the territory surpasses them in grandeur.

The fierce Caribs, in the days of their power, inhabited the banks of the river, engaged in
carrying into slavery the people of other tribes from far and near; but they, and those they
oppressed, have passed away--a few families only of their descendants remaining here and there--the
one to boast of the prowess of their ancestors, the other to tell the tale of their woes.

THE DEMERARA RIVER.

High up the River Demerara--on which George Town, the capital of the colony, is built--where
the river forces its way through the dense forest, is a fall of great picturesque beauty. 
Here, says Mr Brett, the cataract precipitates itself in one body over the rocky barrier; and
huge masses of rock, crowned with stately trees, divide it into channels ere it reaches its
lower bed.  Of these channels, there are two large ones in the centre, with smaller ones on
either side.  All are filled with great boulders, over which the dark waters toss and dash
until they roll into the wide basin below, covering its surface and margin with masses of yeasty
foam.  The length of the fall appears to be three or four hundred feet, though the perpendicular
difference between the levels of the river above and below is sixty-five feet.  Three-fourths
of this cataract is hid from view by the luxuriant forest which clothes its sides and covers
its islands.  The misty spray--rising, when the river is full, from the channels between the
tall trees--the rushing noise, and a glimpse of the torrent here and there, show imperfectly
its divided course.  Could a clear view be obtained of it, it would be found to contain a spectacle
full of beauty and interest.

Between that point and the Essequibo, with which the Demerara runs parallel, is a remarkable--almost
perpendicular--rock called Maboora, the uppermost of a succession of natural terraces.  The
ascent to the summit from the forest below occupies some hours.  From hence the broad Essequibo
can be seen flowing, partly hidden by the range of hills.  Its face is broken up by the rains
of ages into huge boulders, but the top is level.  In its western base is a large cavern, having
an inner chamber with a narrow entrance.  Here the beautiful cock of the rocks, adorned with
golden orange tints and double fan-like crest, makes his abode.  The nests of these brilliant
birds are at some distance from the sandy floor, and attached to the rocky sides.

NATIVE TRIBES.

But we must pass from the scenery of this region of cataracts and forests, to take another
glance at the wild tribes who inhabit it.  The most numerous and ferocious at one time, by
far, were the cannibal Caribs; who for ages had inhabited the country, and were joined by their
brethren, driven by the Spaniards from the islands they had long occupied.  Whether the whole
race had originally come from the north, scattering their bands and taking possession of the
islands they passed, seems uncertain.

When Columbus discovered the islands, to which he gave the name of the people, he had full
evidence of their courage, ferocity, and cannibal propensities.  At the same time, they paid
great attention to agriculture, and brought home seeds and plants from the territories they
overran.  They were in the habit of attacking; other islands and the mainland, and carrying
off the women as slaves; making prisoners of the men, to be killed and eaten.  Their arms were
clubs, and bows and poisoned arrows.  Even the women were expert archers, and when their husbands
were away remained to defend their homes.  The hair of these savages was coarse and long--their
eyes, surrounded with paint, giving them a hideous expression; while their limbs were bound
with bands of cotton, causing them to swell out into disproportionate size where unconfined.
When attacked by the Spaniards, the men refused to be taken alive, and the women defended themselves
with the fiercest courage after the death of their husbands.

In the British island of Saint Vincent several bands remained, who devastated the plantations,
and committed many atrocities,--especially in the revolutionary war, when they were stirred
up by the French.  They were removed by the British Government to the island of Ruatan, in
the Bay of Honduras, whence they emigrated to the neighbouring coast. Meantime, they were extending
their power on the Southern Continent, and became the dominant race on the Orinoco and Essequibo,
their excursions reaching even to the provinces watered by the Amazon.  Wherever they appeared,
the other tribes were driven for refuge to the mountains and forests.  They even ventured to
attack the white settlers, and endeavoured to drive out the Spaniards from the city of Valencia
when first established.

They incessantly attacked the natives on the banks of the Orinoco, sometimes ascending that
river in numerous canoes; at other times crossing the highlands, and descending one or other
of its tributaries, they would come suddenly on their foes, never failing to exterminate all
who were their inferiors in power.  They were, however, often fiercely opposed by some other
tribes, and vast numbers cut off.  During the fearful revolt of the negroes in the Dutch provinces,
several tribes of them were engaged by the Dutch Government to assist the whites.  Making their
way through the forest, and concealing themselves by day, they would sally forth by night and
attack the villages of the revolters-- setting fire to their roofs, and slaughtering the inmates,
who fled from their burning habitations.

Sir Walter Raleigh describes them as a naked people, but valiant as any under the sky: and
thus they remained, still rude and savage, till the common fate of other tribes overtook them.
Powerful as they were, these wild hordes could only fight, overrun, oppress, and destroy; and
even in their highest prosperity they were incapable of accomplishing any great and useful
work.  Up to the close of the last century they were the most numerous, as well as the most
warlike, of all the tribes.

Though their chiefs were not hereditary, if a son equalled his father in courage and skill,
he succeeded to his power.  To attain that office, it was necessary for him to be acquainted
with every art and stratagem of savage warfare, and to possess more strength and bravery than
the rest of his tribe.  When a Carib aspired to be the chief, it was customary to expose him
to the biting of ants; and if he could bear the torture without flinching, then he was considered
fit for the office.

When a band determined on a predatory excursion, they would often, unlike other tribes, attack
their enemies in the daytime, paddling their canoes against the current in order that the sound
of their paddles should be heard by their enemies, and allow them time to prepare for battle.
That they were cannibals, there appears no doubt; at least, they feasted on their enemies taken
in battle, whose flesh they tore and devoured with the avidity of wolves.  The men were put
to death, while the women and children were preserved to be sold into slavery.

Scattered tribes still exist in different parts of the interior.  The dress of the women is
merely a narrow strip of blue cloth; and their naked bodies are smeared with arnatto, which
gives them the appearance of bleeding from every pore.  Some dot their bodies and limbs over
with blue spots.  They wear round the leg, just below the knee, a tight strap of cotton, and
another above each ankle.  These are bound on when a girl is young, and hinder the growth of
the parts by their compression, while the calf, which is unconfined, appears in consequence
unnaturally large. Through the lower lip, which they perforate, they wear two or three pins
with the points outwards.  Should they wish to use one of them, they take it out, and afterwards
replace it.  The men secure a cloth round the loins, often of sufficient length to form a kind
of scarf; and to prevent it trailing on the ground, throw it in a graceful way over the shoulder,
so that part of it falls on the bosom, while the end hangs down the back.  It is often ornamented
with cotton tassels, and is the most decent and serviceable, as well as the most picturesque,
covering worn by any of the native tribes.  Sometimes a coronal of flowers surrounds the head,
which is usually adorned by a large daub of arnatto on the hair above the brow; while the forehead
and cheeks are painted in various patterns with the same vermilion colour, which adds extreme
ferocity to their appearance.  Some of the men also smear their bodies with arnatto, as do
the women.  They are generally well-proportioned, and more elegant in figure than the other
races.  The women are noted for weaving excellent and durable hammocks of cotton--a plant which
they cultivate for that purpose.

When a chief died, his bones, after burial for some time, were cleansed by the women, and carefully
preserved in their houses.  Several other tribes follow a similar custom; allowing, however,
the bones to be deprived of flesh by the ravenous little caribes.  After being carefully dried,
and tinged with red, they are placed in baskets and suspended from the roofs of their houses.
Among those who have embraced Christianity, these and many other barbarous customs have been
abandoned.

The object of many of their raids of later years was to obtain captives to sell to the Dutch.
When slavery was abolished by the British, this incentive to cruelty no longer existed.  The
fierce Caribs were, however, very indignant at the new order of things.  A Carib chief arriving
with a slave, offered him for sale to the English governor.  On the refusal of the latter to
make the purchase, the savage dashed out the brains of the slave, declaring that for the future
his nation would never give quarter--one of many instances of their fearful ferocity. The Carib
club is made of the heaviest wood to be found.  It is about eighteen inches long, flat, and
square at both ends, but heavier at one than the other.  It is thinner in the middle, and wound
round with cotton thread, with a loop to secure it to the wrist.  One blow from this formidable
weapon--which is called "patu"--is sufficient to scatter the brains of the person struck. 
Sometimes a sharp stone is fixed in one end to increase its weight.

THE ARAWAKS.

Differing greatly from the Caribs, the Arawaks, who live in the neighbourhood of the British
settlements, have ever been noted for their mild and peaceable disposition.  But still they
have been compelled to fight for their independence, and use bows and arrows and clubs--the
latter formidable weapon being similar to that of the Caribs.  More family affection than other
tribes usually exhibit exists among them. Husbands and wives appear faithful and attached,
and live happily together.  The boys are early trained to fish and paddle their canoes; while
the girls assist their mothers, who generally have to do more work than the men.  The power
of their chiefs, who were formerly called caciques, has almost entirely ceased; indeed, their
ancient manners and customs have been greatly changed by their intercourse with the whites.
Those living still further in the country, however, practise many of their barbarous customs.

Mr Brett describes a scene he witnessed on the Lake Wakapoa--a dance given in honour of a deceased
female, who had been buried in the house where it took place.  A broad plank lay on her grave,
and on it were placed two bundles, containing the refuse of the silk-grass, of which whips--employed
as will be described--were made.  There were also two rudely-carved birds in wood, the other
figures intended to represent infants.  Two large tubs of paiwari--an intoxicating liquor--had
also been prepared.

The young men and boys, fantastically adorned, were arranged in two parallel rows facing each
other; each holding in his right hand a whip, called the maquarri, more than three feet long,
and capable of giving a severe cut--as their bleeding legs soon amply testified.  The dance
in which they were engaged takes its name from this whip.  They waved them in their hands as
they danced, uttering alternate cries, resembling the note of a bird often heard in the forests.

At some little distance from the dancers were couples of men lashing each other on the leg.
The man whose turn it was to receive the lash stood firmly on one leg, advancing the other;
while his adversary, stooping, took deliberate aim, and, springing from the earth to add vigour
to his stroke, gave his opponent a severe cut.  The latter gave no other sign that he was hurt
than a contemptuous smile, though blood must have been drawn by the lash.  After a short dance,
his opponent returned the compliment with equal force.  Nothing could exceed the good-humour
with which these proceedings were carried on.  One of the men was scarcely able to walk, after
the punishment; but, in general, after a few lashes they drank paiwari, and returned to the
main body of dancers, from which fresh couples were continually falling out to test each other's
mettle.

At length, on a signal from the master of the house, the dancing ceased, and all the men, arranging
themselves in procession, went round the building with slow and measured steps, the plank and
the wooden images being carried before them.

After this they arranged themselves near the grave, and one of them chanted something in a
low voice, to which the others answered at intervals with four moans by way of chorus.  The
articles carried in procession were then taken to a hole previously dug in the earth, and buried
there.  Two or three men appointed for the purpose then drew forth their long knives, and rushing
in among the dancers, snatched the whips from them, cut off the lash from each, and buried
them with the other articles.

THE GUARANIS.

The tribes of the Guaranis, or Waraus, who once inhabited the eastern side of the continent,
from the La Plata to the Orinoco, still exist, sunk still lower in barbarism even than formerly.
So little do they care for clothing, that even the females wear only a small piece of the bark
of a tree, or the net-like covering of the young leaf of the cocoa-nut or cabbage-palm; while
their appearance is squalid in the extreme.  They still, however, exhibit the characteristics
which distinguished them in days of yore,--readiness to yield to circumstances, to labour for
wages, and to receive instruction from the white man.  Thus they have continued to exist whilst
more warlike tribes have been exterminated.  They cultivate cassava and other vegetables. From
the former they make the intoxicating paiwari--the cause of many savage murders among them.
They depend greatly on the pith of the mauritia, or ita, as it serves them for bread; while
of other parts of the tree they construct their dwellings.

The younger people possess good features--some of them wearing thin pieces of silver suspended
from the cartilage of the nostrils.  They are generally short, stoutly built, and capable of
great exertion.  They are much sought after for labourers.  They are also noted for making
the best and largest canoes in the country, and with the rudest implements. The Spaniards are
said to have employed some of their canoes which could carry one hundred men.  Those in use
even at the present day are capable of carrying fifty people.

Though scattered throughout the country, the proper territory of their nation is on the low
swampy country which borders the banks of the Orinoco; but their lands being completely inundated
by the overflowing of the rivers for some months in each year, they construct their dwellings
above the water, among the mauritia palms, whose crowns of fan-like leaves wave above their
heads and shield them from the rays of the burning sun.  Not only does this palm afford them
shelter and the materials for constructing their habitations, but it gives them an abundance
of food for the support of life.  To the upright trunks of the trees, which they use as posts,
they fix the lower beams of their habitations, a few feet above the highest level of the water.
On this framework they lay the split trunks of smaller palms for flooring. Above it a roof
is formed, thatched with the leaves of the same tree,-- from which they also procure their
chief means of subsistence.  From the upper beams the hammocks are suspended; while on the
flooring a hearth of clay is formed, on which fires are lit for cooking their food.  Then their
canoes, or woibakas, as they are called, enable them to procure food from the water, and give
them the means of moving from place to place.

No tree is more useful to the natives than the mauritia.  Before unfolding its leaves its blossoms
contain a sago-like meal, which is dried in thin, bread-like slices.  The sap is converted
into palm-wine. The narrow scaled fruit, which resembles reddish pine-cones, yields different
articles of food--according to the period at which it is gathered--whether the saccharine properties
are fully matured, or whether it is still in a farinaceous condition.

The Guaranis have of late years come under the influence of Christian Protestant missions.

THE MACUSIS.

In the neighbourhood of the Lake Parima, the Macusis, as well as other tribes, have their homes.
The former are noted for being the manufacturers of the celebrated wourali poison described
by Waterton. Numerous other tribes, or sections of tribes with different names, exist in the
far interior,--both westward and to the north and south.  Those inhabiting the Lower Amazon
possess some degree of civilisation, and are known under the general name of Tapuyos--from
a once powerful nation of that name, existing towards the southern part of the Brazilian coast,
and driven northward by still fiercer hordes.

Though less cruel, and frequently sparing the lives of their captives, they had the strange
custom of eating a portion of their dead relatives, as the last mark of affection.  Many of
the Brazilian tribes were reclaimed from their more barbarous practices by the Portuguese missionaries,
who from their numerous dialects formed the language now generally in use--the Tupi, Guarani,
or lingua Geral.  The remoter tribes, however, seeing the way the milder races have been oppressed
by unscrupulous traders, and hunted down by government officials to be taken as soldiers, resolutely
defend their territories from all strangers, and retain the ferocity and cannibalism of their
forefathers.

THE ACAWOIOS.

It is pleasing to read of a tribe described by McClintock as superior in domestic virtues to
most of their countrymen.  The Acawoios, or Kaphons, though warlike, differ from other tribes
in many points.  Polygamy is not permitted before a suitable age.  The women are virtuous,
and attentive both in sickness and old age.  After a birth, the mother is relieved even from
the labour of preparing food for her husband, that she may attend to her child.  They are cleanly,
hospitable, and generous, and passionately fond of their children.  They seldom talk above
a whisper among themselves, and however intoxicated--which they sometimes become--never quarrel;
nay, more, an angry look is never discernible.  They use tobacco; not chewing it, however,
but simply keeping it between the lips, for the purpose of appeasing hunger and preserving
their teeth.  They live towards the head-waters of the Essequibo.  On the whole, a more orderly
and peaceably-disposed people can scarcely be found anywhere.

The customs of the fierce tribes, though differing in some respects, agree in many others.
They are in general indolent, and find clothing unnecessary; they have little to provide beyond
their daily food, and thus spend much of their time in their hammocks, leaving the women to
labour in the plantations and attend to their domestic concerns.  They are, perhaps, more apathetic
in manner than reality, having great control over their feelings.  Like the whole race, their
senses are extremely acute, and kept in constant exercise by following game or tracking an
enemy through the forest.  They are keen observers of natural objects, and have a considerable
knowledge of medicinal and poisonous plants, as well as of the habits of the animals, birds,
reptiles, and insects which inhabit their country.  They observe the virtue of hospitality,
and are fond of paying visits to their friends at a distance--expecting to be treated in the
same way.  Theft is unusual among them; and so great is their love of liberty that they can
seldom be induced to follow the customs of civilised life.

Drunkenness drives them often to fearful excesses--most of their quarrels springing from that
cause.  Their dances, though in a certain degree graceful, consist chiefly in stamping on the
ground, balancing on one foot, and staggering in different attitudes as if intoxicated--the
music being generally monotonous and dismal.  Mr Brett describes a curious trial of strength
which the Guaranis exercise at their drinking bouts.  Each of the antagonists is furnished
with a shield made of strips of the mauritia, cut into equal lengths, and firmly lashed across
a frame three or four feet in height, but somewhat less in width, and slightly bending downwards.
The front of each shield is painted in various colours with some peculiar device, while fastened
to the upper edge are elastic stems adorned with coloured tassels and streamers. Each champion
grasps the edges of his shield firmly with both hands, and, after various feints and grimaces
to throw his opponent off his guard, a clash is heard as one springs forward and his shield
strikes that of his antagonist.  The contest is generally one of mere strength, the shield
being pushed forward by the whole force of the body and supported by one knee, while the other
leg is extended firmly behind. Sometimes one of the players is able to push the other off the
ground, or, by a dexterous slip and thrust on the flank, sends him rolling on the sand; but
more frequently they remain pressing, panting, and struggling until exhausted, when the contest
ceases by mutual consent. It is then a point of etiquette to shake the shields at each other
in a jeering manner--with a tremulous motion of their elastic ornaments--and to utter a defiant
sound like the whinnying of a young horse.  This is generally followed by a hearty, good-natured
laugh, in which the bystanders join.  Another couple then step forward and engage.

Polygamy exists among most of the tribes, and is the great bane of Indian domestic life.  Among
the Caribs, especially, the woman is always in bondage to her male relations.  To her father,
brother, or husband she is a slave, and seldom has any power in the disposal of herself. Among
the Macusis, the custom of selling even their near relations prevails.  When a man dies, his
wife and children are at the disposal of his eldest surviving brother, who may sell or kill
them at pleasure.

Among their worst features is their proneness to blood revenge, by which, as among other savages,
a succession of retaliatory murders is long kept up.  They believe also, when a person dies,
that his death is caused by the agency of an evil spirit secured by some enemy; and, having
settled who that person is, will follow his steps till they find an opportunity of assassinating
him.  They are acquainted with several poisonous plants, to which they sometimes resort to
destroy those whom they consider their enemies.

Although the savage Indian has some idea of the power of God, which he deduces from the phenomena
of nature--such as thunder and lightning--and believes in his goodness in supplying him with
cassava and other provisions, yet his whole worship is devoted to propitiate the malignant
spirits, to avert evil which might otherwise overtake him; while he has great faith in the
power of the native sorcerers, who practise on his credulity.  The Guaranis are the most renowned
as sorcerers.  The huts which are set apart for the performance of their superstitious rites
are regarded with great veneration.  They believe in various spirits--some of the forests and
others of the water--as also in the power of charms and potions; while they have numerous legends
by which they account for the creation of the world, the deluge, and many natural objects--some
of them apparently derived from the Peruvians and Mexicans, and other more civilised races.

The languages spoken by different tribes are very dissimilar, many common objects being called
by names which have no approach to each other in sound.  This, however, rather proves the length
of time they have existed in the country, their isolation from each other, and the admixture
which has from time to time taken place, than that they sprang originally from different stocks.
The Guarani appears to be the simplest and most easily acquired of any of the languages, and
is still spoken as far south as the La Plata, as well as on the banks of the Orinoco.  The
Arawak language is remarkable for its softness.  The Carib tongue, somewhat more guttural than
the former, is spoken in a smart, vivacious manner.  "Those who speak it in its purity, regard
as corrupt the language of those Caribs who elsewhere have intermarried with other races,"
observes Mr Brett.  It may easily be understood how an unwritten tongue can, in the course
of ages, be thus totally changed, so as to bear no resemblance to the original language.  Although
in some there is a wide distinction, there are others in which all the Indian dialects seem
to agree.  In their method of numeration, especially, the first four numbers are represented
by simple words.  Although the Indian children learn to read and write with facility, they
acquire with difficulty the simplest rudiments of arithmetic.  This arises from their general
method of numeration--five is represented by one hand; two hands, ten; then they use the toes,
and call twenty by the name of "loko," or man.  They then proceed by men or scores.  Thus forty-five
is laboriously expressed by a word signifying two men and one hand upon it. Some of the Indian
words are of great length.  Among the Arawaks, such words as lokoborokwatoasia (his thought,
or remembrance), rabuintimen-rutibanano (eighteen), are continually used.

MOUNDS FULL OF HUMAN REMAINS.

Undoubted proof has been discovered of the cannibal propensities of some large tribe now passed
away, in mounds situated on high ground, and in swamps in the neighbourhood of the coast. 
On opening one of them-- upwards of 20 feet in height and 130 in diameter at its base--it was
found to be composed of shells mixed with a large number of broken bones, apparently the relics
of meals.  The shells were chiefly periwinkles; there were also mussels, the large claws of
crabs, the bones of vertebrate fishes and land animals, as well as some hard slabs of pottery
resembling the baking-pans used by the wilder tribes at the present day.  Among them, the labourers
were startled by coming upon human bones, in irregular positions and at unequal depths, huddled
and jumbled together.  The skulls, some of which were of great thickness, were in fragments.
The long bones had all been cracked open, and contained sand and dust.  Each mass appeared
to have been deposited, without ceremony, in a common heap.  Scarcely any were found in natural
juxtaposition.  Having dug up the bones of several adults, the labourers came upon the remains
of a little child; one side of its head had been beaten in, and other bones broken open.  With
these human relics several stone axes or tomahawks, most of them broken, were dug up; and a
sharp-edged stone, which might have been used as a knife.  The Indians engaged in the work
were very uneasy at having meddled with the human remains, or, as they said, "troubled the
bones of the old time people."

Other mounds of similar appearance were opened, and found filled with similar contents.  Though
some of the long bones had been broken up, in several instances they had not been severed from
each other at the large joints, but merely doubled or twisted one upon the other before they
were cast aside.

Mr Brett continues: "It was impossible to explain by any supposition of respectful or decent
interment the broken condition of these relics, the violence with which they had been treated,
or the apparent contumely with which they had been cast into the common receptacle for refuse
matter.  The great depth at which many of these remains were found, seemed a convincing proof
that they had not been deposited after the completion of the shell heap, but during its accumulation.
An old Indian with whom I discussed the matter expressed the opinion of his people very plainly:
`That,' said he, `is the way in which the nations who used to eat men always broke open the
bones to get out the marrow; so our fathers have told us.'"  The Caribs anxiously stated that
they knew nothing whatever about the mound, and that their fathers had never lived in its neighbourhood.
Two other mounds were afterwards discovered; one 250 feet in length and 90 feet in width, and
about the same height as the former, and similarly situated.  Among the remains were the bones
of a man who must have been of large stature and of immense strength.  His skull, which was
very thick and hard, was found to have been broken in twenty-seven pieces, which all fitted
exactly; but when built up, a hole still remained in the right side near the crown, where it
would seem the fatal blow--by a pointed stone tomahawk-- had been given.  Some of the mounds
appeared to be of later formation, and in them fragments of pottery were found, though in the
older ones none were discovered.  While searching over these fragments, the first personal
ornaments yet found were discovered,--two small plates of silver with holes bored in them,
by which they must have been suspended from the ears.  One had lost a corner; but they had
originally been cut or broken to the same size and form, and were evidently a pair.  Between
them lay a skull, which had been placed by itself, and was the first found unbroken.  The ornaments,
from their position, seemed to have been detached from the head when deposited there.  A few
feet from that relic lay the limbs of a female, of slight and delicate form.  They were unbroken,
and much slighter than any others found there.  Between the plates was the fragment of a piece
of cotton cord which had attached one of the plates to the ear.

While everything about the relics from the previous mounds indicated the savage condition of
the people who formed them, these little silver trinkets, though rude, proved feelings approaching
women in a state of civilisation.  They, with the unbroken condition and comparative soundness
of the bones found near them, bring us nearer our own times. As the state of the remains differed
from those of the others, so probably did the period and circumstances of the poor girl's fate;
but there is a mystery about it which cannot now be explained.  After the mound had been opened,
the Indian congregation, neatly dressed, went in procession, with their pastor and teacher,
from the chapel to the mound, and collecting round and over it, the various tribes joined in
singing the glorious hymn--

  "Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
  Doth his successive journey run!"

while the lamb, the dove, and other Christian emblems on the banners borne by the school children,
waved over the yawning cavity which had disclosed such relics of barbarous days, indicated
a blessed change in the life of that long neglected race.  May it be extended over the whole
continent!

VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS.

The trees and animals of Guiana afford a more satisfactory subject for contemplation than the
degraded inhabitants.  Among them, sin has not entered.  They remain in all their perfection
and beauty, as they first appeared fresh from the hands of the Creator.  A large number are
so similar to those found in the Valley of the Amazon, that they need no separate description.
In the upper waters of its streams the magnificent Victoria Regia, so long unknown to the eyes
of civilised man, was discovered by Schombergh not forty years ago.

Here, too, grows the spotted coryanthes, of the order of the Orchideae-- Coryanthes maculata--hanging
from the branches of trees, and suspending in the air the singular lips of its flowers, like
fairy buckets, as if for the use of the birds and insects that inhabit the surrounding foliage.
In the whole vegetable kingdom a more singular genus than this does not exist, nor one whose
flowers are less like flowers to the eye of the ordinary observer.  The sepals are of the most
delicate texture. When young they spread evenly round the centre, but after a few hours they
collapse and assume the appearance of a bat's wing half closed. The lip is furnished near its
base with a yellow cup, over which hang two horns constantly distilling water into it, and
in such abundance as to fill it several times.  This cup communicates by a narrow channel,
formed of the inflated margin of the lip, with the upper end of the latter; and this also has
a capacious vessel, very much like an old helmet, into which the liquid that the cup cannot
contain runs over.

The cockarito-palm--as it is familiarly called here--grows to the height of fifty feet, and
produces the most delicate cabbage of the palm species.  It is enclosed in a husk in the very
heart of the tree, at its summit.  This husk is peeled off in strata until the white cabbage
appears in long thin flakes--in taste like the kernel of a nut.  The inner part is often used
as a salad, while the outer is boiled, and considered superior to the European cabbage.  Within
such cabbages as are in a state of decay, a maggot is found--the larva of a black beetle (urculio),
which, growing to the length of four inches, and as thick as a man's thumb, is called "grogro."
This creature, disgusting as it is in appearance, when dressed is considered a great delicacy--partaking
of the flavour of all the spices of the East.

A curious shrub--if it can be so called--known as the troolies, consists of large leaves twenty
feet long and two broad, of a strong texture, and straight fibres growing from a small fibrous
root; the leaves rising from the ends of the eight or ten stems which it puts forth.  These
leaves are employed chiefly for covering the roofs of buildings.

From the silk-cotton-tree, which grows to the height of one hundred feet, and is twelve or
fourteen in diameter, the Indians form their largest canoes.  The locust-tree grows to the
height of seventy feet, and is often nine feet in diameter.  The branches, which only begin
to spread in the higher part of the tree, are covered with leaves about three inches in length,
and of an oval shape and dark green colour.  The blossoms, of the papilionaceous or butterfly
form, produce a flat pod, shaped like the husk of a broad bean, about four inches long, and
of a dark brown colour.  When ripe, each pod contains three beans of the same colour, of a
farinaceous consistency, and with a pleasant sweetness.

The silk-grass shrub produces a leaf, the inner substance of which consists of a number of
small strong white fibres running longitudinally.  These the Indians extract by means of a
small loop of cord, through which the leaf is drawn with a jerking motion.  They are then ready
for drying and twisting into cord.  They make bow-strings of great elasticity and strength.

PART FOUR, CHAPTER THREE.

CENTRAL BRAZIL.

The centre of Brazil is occupied by a high tableland, crossed by a series of serras, mostly
running north and south.  The most eastern,-- the Serra de Espinhaco,--rises about one hundred
miles from the coast, and the table-land extends from it westward for upwards of six hundred
miles.  Numerous peaks besides the serras rise amidst it, few of them reaching a greater elevation
than one thousand feet above its surface. It is mostly clothed with coarse grass and bushes,
and single-standing trees, which in summer shed their leaves, when, the grass being burned
up by the sun, the region has a desert and barren appearance.  Here and there the plain as
well as the hills are covered with sand, and at others with bare rocks.

Still more desert regions exist, which may vie with those of Africa in barrenness.  Almost
in the very centre of the continent is a sandy desert, called the Campos dos Paricis.  Here
the surface is formed by long-backed ridges of sandy hills parallel to one another.  So loose
is the soil, that even the patient mule with a burden on his back can hardly make his way across
it.

Between the western end of this table-land and the Andes of Bolivia is a wide plain from one
thousand to fifteen hundred feet in height, with here and there a few hills rising above it.
It is mostly covered by dense forests; but occasionally there are barren districts, in which
only a stunted vegetation appears.  This plain is traversed by several tributaries of the great
River Madeira, which falls into the Amazon.  In this wide-extending table-land, and among the
serras amidst it, rise innumerable streams, which flow into the Amazon on the north and the
La Plata on the south--many of them, as they plunge into the plain, forming foaming torrents
and magnificent cataracts.  The vegetation of these highlands offers a great contrast to the
dense forest of the great valley and the seaboard.

The cerrados, as they are called, or scrub--consisting chiefly of acacias and leguminosae--reach
to the height of ten or twenty feet. Numerous other shrubs and smaller plants, many of which
are medicinal, cover the ground, and send forth a delicious perfume into the pure air. The
tussock, in thick clumps, is also seen growing in various directions; indeed, altogether, the
Campo is far more completely clothed than either the Llanos or Pampas.

Among these mountains are the celebrated diamond-mines of Brazil.  Some of the mines are reached
by shafts of great depth, sunk into the earth, whence galleries are run along the veins, somewhat
in the mode of gold-mines.  Gold is also obtained, by washing in the streams.  The diamonds
are procured in the same manner.  The strictest watch is kept over the slaves employed in searching
for diamonds, to prevent them from secreting the precious stones, and for this purpose numerous
overseers are required.

The operations are simple.  The loose stones at the bottom of the stream are first raked up
into baskets, and then carefully washed, under the inspection of the overseers.

In one district it is calculated that, from 1730 to 1830, diamonds worth upwards of three millions
sterling were collected; and in that of Abaete, in 1791, a diamond weighing 1382 carats--the
largest in the world--was discovered.

Possibly, however, if the labour which is bestowed on mining were employed in cultivating the
ground, it would be productive of greater profit to the country.

PART FIVE, CHAPTER ONE.

SOUTHERN REGIONS OF SOUTH AMERICA.

GEOGRAPHY AND NATIVE TRIBES.

The vast territory south of the Brazils is watered by a wide-extending branch-work of mighty
streams, having as their main trunk the Rio de la Plata at their southern end.  To the east
is the River Uruguay, running almost parallel with the Atlantic coast.  Close to its mouth
the far more important Parana, rising in the mountains of the Brazils, near the sources of
the Tocantins, falls into the La Plata.  While the Tocantins flows north till it reaches the
Amazon, the Parana takes a more or less southerly course for many hundreds of miles, till it
turns due west for nearly two hundred, and then once more runs south and east till it enters
the main trunk.  At its extreme western point it is joined by the River Paraguay, which, from
its source in the diamond district of the Brazils, has an almost southerly course, receiving
on its way numerous large tributaries.  One of the most important of these is the Vermejo,
which, rising in the Andes, near the source of the Amazon, affords a water communication between
Bolivia across the whole continent to the Atlantic.  These rivers form the boundaries of several
states.

Directly south of the Brazils, between Parana on the east and Paraguay on the west, is the
republic of Paraguay, lately ruled over by the two savage dictators, Francia and Lopez.  It
is a thickly-wooded region, with numerous streams running through it, and a lofty range--the
Cordillera de Caaguazu--at the northern end.  The inhabitants are mostly a mixed race of Spaniards
and Indians.  To the west of the Paraguay river is a wide-extended level region, bounded on
the north by Bolivia, and interspersed with lakes and marshes known as the Gran Chaco, and
inhabited by tribes of still savage Indians.

The southern boundary of Paraguay is the River Parana, where it runs east and west.  To the
south of it is the state of Corrientes, a woody but level region between the two rivers, Uruguay
and Parana.  Further south is the state of Entre Rios; while, to the west, are a collection
of confederated towns and villages scattered widely over the Pampas, known as part of the Argentine
Confederation; to which the two last-mentioned, as well as Buenos Ayres, to the south of the
La Plata, belong.

East of the Uruguay, between it and the Atlantic, is the republic of Uruguay.  Through the
southern portion of the Argentine Republic flow the rivers Colorado, Negro, and Chupat.  On
the banks of the latter a Welsh colony has been established; while in various parts of the
republic numerous other settlements have been formed by Europeans.  The level Pampas--inhabited
by those bold and daring riders, the Gauchos, and still wilder tribes of Indians--extending
to the base of the Andes, from its peculiar and interesting character demands a separate description.

THE PAMPERO.

The pampero, dreaded on shore as well as at sea, blows with tremendous force across this region.

There is not a cloud in the sky.  The night may be perfectly calm. Mosquitoes in vast numbers
are busy with their sharp stings.  Suddenly a rustling in the woods may be heard afar off.
The noise increases into a dull roar.  Clouds appear above the horizon.  Still all is calm.
The mosquitoes vanish.  The dogs are howling in anticipation of danger.  As if by magic, dark
masses of clouds cover the heavens like a curtain. They are rent asunder, thunder roars, lightning
flashes, and the wind, like an army of wild beasts, rushes on.  Down comes the rain in torrents,
beating furiously against the hapless traveller exposed to its fury, or on the deck of the
ship.  Flash succeeds flash; the lightning in forked streaks darting through the air.  In an
hour, perhaps, the heaviest part of the storm may be over, but still the wind blows furiously;
till at length it ceases, the clouds disappear, and the air becomes delightfully fresh and cool.

The craft on the rivers are, however, often caught in these pamperos, and driven into the bush,
or upset, when the swift current carries down the best of swimmers to a watery grave.

Houses, also, are frequently unroofed, orange groves stripped of their golden fruit, and trees
uprooted and hurled to the ground.

NATIVES OF LA PLATA AND ITS TRIBUTARIES--THE PAMPAS AND PATAGONIA.

When the Spaniards first arrived in that sea-like river, with shallow shores--the mighty Parana,
to which Sebastian Cabot afterwards gave the name of La Plata--they encountered a fierce tribe
(the Charranas) inhabiting its shores.  The natives endeavoured to repel the invaders by a
system of warfare which the latter, though they describe it as of the most treacherous character,
were not slow to imitate.  Step by step, however, the Spaniards fought their way; though sometimes
defeated and compelled to retreat, they again returned, establishing forts and towns on the
banks of the river, till they finally obtained a firm footing in the land.  They hesitated
at no act, however atrocious, to secure their conquests by the destruction of their foes.

On one occasion being warned that a tribe--the Guaycaruses--with whom they had formed a treaty
of peace, had laid a plot to cut them off, they formed a counterplot, far surpassing in treachery
that of the savages. The Spanish Lieutenant-Governor, pretending that he had been smitten with
the charms of the daughter of their principal cacique, offered her his hand in marriage.  The
proposal was accepted by the delighted Indians, who, with their chiefs and a large number of
people, were invited into the town to attend the ceremony.  Meantime soldiers were concealed
in the houses to which the chiefs were conducted, and orders were given to supply them amply
with intoxicating liquors.  While they were thus deprived of their senses, soldiers were sent
across the river to destroy the remainder of the tribe who had not come to the wedding. At
a given signal the native village was attacked, and every inhabitant slaughtered; while the
hosts of those in the town killed more than three hundred of their helpless guests.

The invaders were creating a fearful heritage for their descendants by intermarrying with the
native women.  From these marriages have sprung the race which now occupies, in vast numbers,
a large portion of that magnificent territory, and who, by their low moral condition, their
ignorance, and instability of character, have been the chief cause of the melancholy wars which
have so long saturated its plains with blood. The Jesuits, by the missions they formed in various
parts of the country, introduced a superficial civilisation among some of the tribes; but their
system failing, as it ever has done, to raise the moral character of the people, and fit them
for independent thought and self-government, has left them as ignorant and superstitious, and
scarcely less savage, than before.  Thus they have become the facile tools of every leader
who, by greater audacity, craft, or determination, has risen to authority among them.

THE GUARANIS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS.

The Guaranis were the principal nation dwelling on the eastern portion of South America.  They
were probably the same race as the Quichuas, who inhabited the western shores, and a large
portion of the Andes, under the rule of the Incas.  The two languages are still spoken in various
parts of the country.  The Guaranis were superior in civilisation to numerous other intervening
and more isolated tribes, who had sunk by degrees into greater barbarism.  Like the Quichuas,
they were agriculturalists--cultivating mandioca, maize, calabashes, and potatoes. They fed
on honey and wild fruit; and hunted birds, monkeys, and other animals, and caught fish with
their bows and arrows.  They had also canoes; and had a better established system of government
than their neighbours.  Yet they were among the first to bow their necks to the yoke of their
invaders; while other tribes, who, though less numerous, fiercely opposed the Spaniards, were
swept away from the face of the earth.

The descendants of the Guaranis exist--some in a semi-civilised condition, others as barbarous
as of yore--in several parts of the continent; but a large portion became amalgamated with
the invaders, and their language is still spoken throughout Paraguay and the neighbouring provinces
by the mixed race who have descended from them.  The Charruas--the first tribe with whom the
Spaniards came in contact--were barbarous in the extreme.  Their arms were lances and arrows,
and they were noted for their expertness in tracking their enemies.  They could bear an almost
incredible amount of fatigue, and could subsist for several days without food or water.  They
wore their hair long,--the women allowing theirs to flow down the back, while the young men
gathered up their locks in bunches, and ornamented them with white feathers.  They ate every
description of food, even to snakes and insects, and were especially fond of the parasites
of the human body. They tattooed their faces and limbs; and soon after a boy was born a hole
was made in his lower lip, when a piece of wood was introduced like a nail, the head being
in his mouth, while another stick was fastened to it outside.

They lived in tree-formed huts, which they entered on all-fours; and wore no clothes, except
in cold weather, when they covered the chest with a piece of skin.  They never washed, huddling
together in their dirty toldas or huts.  They subsisted entirely on the produce of the chase;
polygamy was general; their children were not taught to obey their parents, while they appear
to have been destitute of all family affection.  Their beverage, called chicha--a name common
throughout South America--was prepared from honey and water.  Although, during lifetime, relations
exhibited no affection towards each other, at the death of one of them the survivors underwent
many cruel funeral ceremonies.  They ultimately assisted the Spaniards in the extermination
of several of the neighbouring tribes, but were eventually either destroyed, or brought completely
under subjection.

THE QUERANDIS OR PEHUELCHES.

The Querandis or Pehuelches--the principal tribe of the Pampas Indians-- were, from the first,
the chief opponents of the Spaniards in Buenos Ayres.  They stole their cattle, made captives
of their wives and children, and cut off the soldiers and estancieros, or cattle-farmers, on
numerous occasions.  They were vain, haughty, and daring.  Unlike the Charruas, they paid great
attention to their dress and appearance, neither painting nor cutting their hair.  The men
wore their locks turned up and secured at the top of the head; while the women divided theirs
in the centre, wearing them on each side in a large clump, fastened by a ribbon, the ends falling
down over each ear nearly to the waist.  They wore combs, and were in every respect cleanly.
The women also wore necklaces, with hanging ornaments.  Their costume was a poncho on festive
occasions, highly ornamented; while they wore leather boots. Although, when galloping across
the Pampas, they went totally naked, they carried their clothes with them--either to put on
during cold weather, or to appear in state when meeting Europeans.  Their weapons of war were
lances and the formidable bolas,--by means of which, used as slings, they could send stones
to a great distance,--and combustible materials, with which they set fire to the Spanish houses.
Their huts were composed of upright poles, four or five feet in height, and as many apart,
on which skins of large animals--such as the huanacus or ostrich--were fastened, on the side
from whence the cold winds blew. These huts formed long streets; but were used only during
cold or rainy weather, as in fine weather they slept on the uncovered ground.

No sooner did the horses introduced by the Spaniards, escaping into the wilds, increase and
multiply, than the Indians learned to bestride them, and soon exhibited an uncommon aptitude
in their management.  Armed with their long lances, they would charge the Spanish troops,--each
man lying down at his horse's side, though going at full gallop, and jumping up, turning round,
or dropping down again, with wonderful rapidity.  Though even the Gauchos give their horses
some preliminary training, the Pampas Indian catches the animal with the lasso, throws it down,
forces a wooden bit, covered with a piece of hide, into its mouth, from which bit there is
a leathern cord to bind round its lower lip, and gallops off.

They are divided into many tribes, who, even a few years ago, made frequent incursions into
the provinces of Buenos Ayres, Cordova, and others, and carried off large flocks of cattle--and
many Argentines, as captives.  They were pursued to the River Colorado, however, when part
of the stolen cattle was recovered, and several captives liberated. They are under the belief
that when death does not occur, in consequence of violence, it is owing to sorcery.

THE PAYAGUAS.

Another tribe or nation must be mentioned--the Payaguas, who inhabited the territory of Paraguay,
and from whom the district has taken its name.  They used canoes, and many of their warlike
expeditions were carried on down the river by water.  The women had to perform all the hard
work, and were never allowed to eat meat.  The boys and girls wore no clothes, but the young
men painted their bodies in a variety of patterns.

The Tupis, another large tribe, appear either to have extended to the Amazon, or to have been
driven there from the south, as their language is now spoken by the tribes on its banks.

The Toromonos were the chief tribe inhabiting the territory of Bolivia to the north of the
Gran Chaco.  They lived in houses, each man building one for himself.  The men wore no clothes,
but ornamented their heads with a crown formed of feathers; whilst the women wore a small cotton
garment, only partially covering the person.  They painted their faces, and wore rings in their
noses and lips.  Many of their customs were cruel and barbarous in the extreme, though they
appear to have cultivated the ground, and used ploughs and wooden implements of agriculture.
They employed bows and arrows in battle, as also for fishing and killing game.  They also showed
skill in building canoes.

INDIANS OF BOLIVIA--NATIVE APOTHECARIES.

Even at the present day, as was the case in the time of the Incas, the people of one of the
tribes were distinguished for their medical knowledge, and sent out travelling apothecaries,
who collected herbs,-- traversing the whole of the continent.  Markham describes meeting with
a party of them emerging from the forest,--cadaverous, miserable-looking men, almost worn to
death by fatigue and hardship.  They wore their long hair plaited and secured behind in the
form of a queue.  They came from the district of Yungas, and are called Yunguenos, or Cherrihuanos.
Formerly they went on foot, but they now ride asses, on which they carry the herbs and nuts,
reputed efficacious for the cure of sickness; as well as bundles of chinchona, coca leaf, incense,
and other articles.

The Bolivian Indians were subdued only in 1843.  Each village or toldera of these tribes is
governed by a cacique, generally possessing hereditary rank; though, as in other cases, much
depends upon his physical powers and wealth.  A number of wild tribes still roam over the country
between the western Argentine states and the Andes.  There they live free and independent,
though barbarous.  When they venture into the neighbourhood of large towns, they soon degenerate
into thieves and drunkards.  Here they come to carry on a trade in furs and panther skins,
or to collect meat at the saladeros, which they dry and carry off with them.  They make money
by selling Indian ornaments, and foraging for the settlers' cattle; or by thieving, which they
look upon as an orthodox mode of gaining a livelihood.

TRIBES OF THE GRAN CHACO.

Several tribes inhabited the Gran Chaco.  The principal one--the least sunk in barbarism--were
the Guanas.  They lived in towns arranged in some symmetrical order, composed of palm-trees.
Each house formed an enclosed square composed of posts and arches.  To these were fixed horizontal
beams, the whole covered with mud and straw.  There was but one door, and the structure was
sufficiently large to contain a dozen families.  They had bed-places on square frames, covered
over with boards and straw and skins, while their houses were kept scrupulously clean.

They were noted for their hospitality, and subsisted chiefly by agriculture.  They cut off
the hair in the middle of the forehead; some shaved sometimes the front half of the head, and
others half-moons over the ears.  Though the marriage ceremony was simple in the extreme, a
contract as to various points was invariably entered into.  The men greatly exceeded the women
in number, in consequence of the unnatural custom prevailing among them of putting to death
the female children. Old women acted the part of doctors.

Their dead were buried outside the doors of their houses, and a considerable time was spent
in bewailing their loss.  Though they fought bravely with bows and arrows, as well as with
spears or clubs, they were of a peaceable disposition, and never made war except in self-defence.

The great ambition of a Chaco Indian is to possess a horse, saddle, and gun.  Once mounted,
he soon becomes a bold rider.

Their mode of crossing a river is curious.  As their canoes cannot carry their animals over,
they first drive the horse into the river up to his shoulders in the water, then launch the
canoe--after tying the animal's head to the top of the gunwale--with the children and luggage
on board. As the horse's feet are off the ground, he cannot injure the canoe. When travelling,
however, without canoes, they form small rafts, into which they put their children; and lance
in hand, and with bow and quiver at their backs, they bestride their steeds and tow them across,
a curious spectacle to witness.

The children go perfectly naked; indeed, so do the people generally, except those who come
into the settled districts.  The women wear their masses of black hair almost covering their
heads and shoulders.  They dress in a short skirt, with a scarf over the shoulders.  "The old
women," observed Captain Kennedy, "are terrible to behold, they having all the hard work to
do.  They even paddle the canoes, while the men and young women sit looking on."

Their villages consist of rows of wretched hovels.  They appear to have no superstitious ideas,
but they believe in an evil spirit, against whom they try to guard by charms and incantations.
They are under a chief cacique; and after the other chiefs in conclave have determined on war,
or rather, on a plundering expedition, and it is concluded, they separate into their original
tribes, each taking opposite directions with their share of the plunder, to escape the risk
of being captured. A considerable portion of the almost unexplored district--the Gran Chaco--which
they inhabit is a dreary waste of lagoons and marshes, traversed by rapid, muddy, and tortuous
rivers.

JESUIT MISSIONS.

The missions established by the Jesuits show the impotence of their system for the civilisation
of the wild man.  The territory where they carried on their chief labours exists on the eastern
bank of the Parana, to the north of Uruguay and Corrientes, bordering on the Brazilian territory.
After three hundred years of labour, they left these savages utterly incapable of self-government.

"The Indian mind, indeed," observes Captain Page--an American--"laying aside its atrocities,
has never emerged from the intellectual development of childhood.  These savages showed the
imitative faculties of the animal.  When taught, they delved and ploughed, planted cotton and
sugar-cane, and executed work in carpentry and wove fabrics, and performed other manual operations;
yet their reason and intelligence has not advanced, even pari passu in any degree with the
progress of European civilisation; nor have the natures of their female population become modified
with the slightest trait of the humanities and tendernesses which are the brightest attributes
of the women of the present century."

"Among the Jesuit missions in the Gran Chaco," observes another writer, "are found no remaining
evidence of better knowledge, than that the Indians now prefer horse-flesh to any other kind
of meat."

The same writer gives us the derivation of the names of several of the rivers:--Parana, resembling
the sea; Paraguay, from the Payaguas, a tribe of Indians who were met with by the discoverers
navigating the river; and Uruguay, from a bird--the uru--which is found on the banks of that
stream.

LANGUAGE.

With regard to the two prevailing Indian languages spoken in the southern part of the continent,
it is remarkable that the Quichua, the language of the Peruvians, is still used by the natives
found on the banks of the River Salado, in the province of Santiago del Estero, though far-distant
from the Andes, in the centre of the Argentine territory; while it is not in use in the intermediate
provinces.  This proves, either the distance to which the Incas extended their conquests, or
perhaps the fact that the natives of Santiago are descendants of a Peruvian colony.  The Guarani
language is still spoken in Entre Rios and Corrientes, while in the Republic of Paraguay it
is more generally used than the Spanish; indeed, paragraphs printed in it appear in one of
the papers published in that province.  The Jesuits compiled a number of grammatical and other
works in the Guarani, for the purpose of teaching the novitiates in their establishments at
Paraguay.

The Guarani nation occupied the whole sea-coast, from Uruguay northwards through Brazil, Cayenne,
and even into Venezuela.

PART FIVE, CHAPTER TWO.

PARAGUAY.

THE PARANA.

After entering the Parana, the voyager sails for hundreds of miles up the mighty stream between
lofty clay-banks of a red colour; sometimes absolutely perpendicular, and at others consisting
of broken masses covered with cacti and mimosa-trees.  Here and there may be seen, projecting
from the cliffs, huge skeletons of the toxodon, megatherium, mylodon, and other monsters which
once in countless numbers inhabited the plains of South America.  Now the river expands into
lake-like proportions, its surface dotted with numerous low and wooded islands. At intervals,
towns, villages, or forts may be seen on the summits of the cliffs, sixty feet above the water.
Generally the country on the western side is a level, treeless plain; but as the river is ascended
woods appear, which gradually become thicker, presenting, as further progress is made, more
and more a tropical character.

As Paraguay is approached, low flat banks appear, which for many a long league are marshy and
impassable.  It is the district of the Esteros, as these flooded lands are called.  Beyond
them, in the wet season, immense shallow lakes are formed; but when they are dried-up in the
hot weather, a grey dusty soil, full of cracks, and covered with wiry grass and low shrubs,
is left.  Nothing can be more dreary than the appearance of the country when the river is high;
the water extending far and wide beyond its crumbling banks, with rows of melancholy palms
standing as landmarks above the flood.  These districts are, however, valuable for grazing
purposes; and before the war were covered by vast herds of cattle, now swept away.  Above the
Tebiquari the country is higher and more diversified.  Vast woods, increasing in breadth and
density, appear, with ranges of distant hills beyond them.

NATIVES.

It is remarkable that the Guarani language, among the peasantry, has almost superseded that
of their Spanish invaders.

The natives, with their Indian blood, have inherited small hands and feet, and coarse black
hair.  The women when young, with their long tresses of jetty blackness, are often pretty;
and some, probably descended from Biscayans, are noted for their remarkable fairness. Rubias,
they are termed, with blue eyes and auburn hair.  The men wear dresses similar to that of the
Gauchos.  That of the women is picturesque: a long cotton chemise cut low at the neck, with
a deep border of embroidery; loose lace sleeves; and a skirt of muslin, or silk, fastened round
the waist by a broad sash.  Very few wear shoes. Their hair is sometimes arranged in two long
plaits, or formed in a wreath round the head, or rolled up at the back and fastened by a large
comb.  They also wear massive gold chains round the neck, large ear-rings, and numerous rings.
Their great amusement, next to smoking, is sipping the yerba or native tea.

"Yerba," says Masterman, "is the dried and powdered leaf Ilex Paraguayensis,--a tree in size
and foliage resembling the orange, with small white, clustered flowers.  It belongs to the
holly family, but contains a bitter principle similar to, if not identical with, theine, or
the alkaloid found in tea and coffee."

It is taken in a somewhat singular way.  The mate, a gourd stained black, holding three or
four ounces of water, is nearly filled with the coarsely-powdered yerba.  The bombilla, a silver
tube with a bulbous end pierced full of fine holes, is then inserted.  The gourd is filled
with boiling water, and the infusion is immediately sucked through the tube, scalding hot.

The bombilla is for the purpose of straining the infusion--which is of a greenish-brown--as
the powder would otherwise get into the mouth.  Like tea, it is slightly stimulating and astringent.

The natives spin the indigenous cotton of the country, and weave it in a curious way, producing
the most intricate lace and needlework.  The thread they manufacture is remarkably fine and
strong.  Weavers travel about the country carrying their simple looms on their shoulders, and
may be seen under an orange-tree by the roadside, the warp-roller suspended from a bough and
balanced beneath by stones, the workman seated on a horse's skull, and producing a fabric as
beautiful as it is durable.

They also manufacture woollen ponchos and saddle-cloths, in patterns of black and white, or
of a fine blue obtained from the native indigo. They manufacture cigars; and cultivate the
sugar-cane in a rude manner, producing from its root a vile beverage called cana, most injurious
to the health.

MOUNTAIN SCENERY.

In the Cordillera, where Masterman describes the scenery as most beautiful, the cacti grow,
bristling with spines, and loaded with delicate white flowers; as also the wild pineapple,
which covers the ground,--its serrated leaves, of a bright scarlet in the centre, and barred,
all straggling from the root.  Its fibre is used by the natives for making fishing-nets and
lines, and a coarse strong cloth.  Paper also has been manufactured from it; and as it can
be produced in great quantities, it may become of much commercial importance.

Game abounds throughout the territory.  Herds of deer roam in the open glades; droves of pigs
are found in the forest somewhat similar to those of England; and a bird, the ynambu guazu,
as large as a pheasant; while quails are seen in flocks in the esteros,--with snipe, wild pigeons,
and other birds.

High up the River Parana is found the magnificent waterfall, El Salto de Guira, rivalling in
splendour Niagara itself.  Other fine waterfalls are found on different rivers.

Here, too, the ant-eater reaches an enormous size.  The capybara is also found.  It is obliged
to triturate its food--grass, and herbaceous plants--for a long time, in consequence of the
contracted size of the oesophagus, which will hardly admit a goose-quill, although the animal
is sometimes so large that it weighs more than two hundred pounds.  Its destiny seems to be
to feed jaguars, for they live principally on the creatures.

The chinchilla, another rodent, is very common in the fields and esteros.  There is a large
heron, called in Guarani the tuyuaju--that is, one which walks in the mud--nearly as tall as
a man, with a bill more than a foot in length.  The puma ranges throughout the country, as
he does much further south; while the jaguar also appears amid the forests and plains.

GREGARIOUS SPIDERS.

Among the insects, Masterman describes a gregarious spider which, when full-grown, has a black
body half an inch in length--with a row of bright red spots on the side of the abdomen--four
eyes, remarkably strong mandibles, and stout hairless legs an inch in length.  They construct
in concert huge webs, generally between two trees, ten or twelve feet from the ground.  In
a garden, among trees forty feet apart, these spiders had extended two long cables, as thick
as pack-thread, to form the margin of each web, the lower being only four feet from the ground;
and between them was a light, loose network perfectly divided into webs, each presenting about
two square feet of surface.  Each of these sub-webs was occupied by a spider from sunset to
a little before sunrise.  Six nets contained two thousand of the creatures.  They often change
their location; and a double stream was always passing along the cables, apparently strengthening
them as they came and went.

Sometimes three or four would be lying in wait within a few inches of each other, the one crawling
over or under the other's body without hesitation.  Soon after sunrise they left their webs,
and, retreating to the shade, formed two or three large masses as big as a hat under the thick
foliage of a jessamine-tree.  There they remained motionless till sunset, when the black lump
crumbled to pieces.  The process was a curious sight to witness.  Then, in a leisurely way,
the spiders scattered themselves to their aerial fishing.  The air swarmed with mosquitoes,
which were caught in great numbers.  Larger flies, and especially moths, were at once pounced
upon and devoured; a dozen often feeding amicably on the body of the same insect, consuming
not only the juices, but the abdomen.  When a part of the web was broken, the nearest spider
gathered up the loose threads, rolled them into a ball, and ate it.  The great difficulty seemed
to be how they could convey the first thread, often sixty or seventy feet long, from one tree
to the other. This was done by a spider from a tree to windward forming a long line, which
blew out and caught in the leaves of a neighbouring tree to leeward.  This it tightened, and
then crossed hastily backwards and forwards on the line, adding to its thickness on each journey,
till it was strong enough to support a web.  The spiders thus employed were apparently all
young, for as they increased in age the ferocity of the race appeared.  There was then a sanguinary
battle,--the few survivors, probably females, devouring some of the slain to provide for a
future brood, and then dying also.

THE CHIGO, OR SAND-FLEA.

Mr Masterman makes some interesting remarks on the chigo, or sand-flea (Pulex penetrans). 
It is very minute, not exceeding one twenty-fifth of an inch in length.  It burrows between
the cuticle and true skin, and there lays its eggs--producing a swelling containing a bluish
white sac, about the tenth of an inch in diameter, filled with them.  This sac is the developed
abdomen of the flea.  It preserves its vitality after the death of the rest of the parent;
and when that event takes place, the eggs are mere germs, which would ordinarily perish at
the same time.

Its cutting apparatus consists of two scimitar-shaped lancets, placed in a common sheath, with
which it slices out a place beneath the skin, large enough to bury it entirely, anchors itself
firmly with its hooked proboscis, and in a day or two dies.  The abdominal section, however,
still lives, absorbing nutritive material through its walls, and growing rapidly at the expense
of the serum poured out by the irritated skin into which it is inserted.  It increases in thickness
as well as in diameter, and the eggs which now fill it grow also,--when mature, each being
half as large as a perfect flea.  Thus it is seen why the sand-flea cannot deposit its eggs
as do the rest of the family. Probably it has no more food than it carries away within itself
on quitting the egg, and therefore cannot provide the material for its greater development.
Not only men and children, but dogs, suffer greatly from them--the latter almost tearing their
feet to pieces in biting them out, and often getting them in their lips and outer nostrils,
from which they cannot dislodge them.

FISH IN THE PARANA.

Among the many fine fish in the river is the dorado,--something like a trout in colour, but
deeper; in shape, more resembling the snapper.  The natives catch it with unbaited hooks. 
The fisherman selects a point of rock jutting over the stream, and having secured three polished
hooks, back to back, attached to a line, throws it as far from him as possible into the water,
giving it several strong jerks to make it look like small fry darting about.  The dorado makes
a dash at them, and gets hooked--generally through the back.

PART FIVE, CHAPTER THREE.

THE PAMPAS.

Westward of the Parana and the Province of Buenos Ayres stretches out the wide-extended and
almost level plain of the Pampas, reaching to the base of the Andes.  It is a wild, savage
region, sprinkled over here and there with salt-lakes and marshes, in which a few streams,
traversing it at considerable distances apart, lose themselves.

The tracks across it are marked by the whitened skeletons of the horses and bullocks which
have succumbed to the fatigues of the journey, or the want of water, and have been picked clean
by the carranchas, and others of the vulture tribe, or by the active teeth of the voracious
little armadillos, which clear away the refuse of the feast left by their feathered companions.
Here and there forts or post-houses are found, garrisoned by the wild Gauchos--their appearance
in keeping with the scenery.

The huts are generally built of the stalks of huge thistles, and are sometimes mere enclosures,
destitute of roofs.  They are surrounded by stockades, in many instances formed of thick hedges
of cacti, well calculated to resist an attack from the still savage Indians who roam throughout
the region in search of plunder.

It is on these plains that the little bizcacha in vast numbers form their burrows; by the side
of which, during the day, their small friends the owls of the Pampas take up their posts, and
watch the passers-by. Vast herds of horses and cattle now roam in unrestrained freedom across
them.  Here the tall rhea, the American ostrich, with outstretched wings runs swiftly across
the plain.  Towards its southern boundaries the huanacu and the deer--Cervus campestris--in
large herds range at large, while the pools and marshes are inhabited by enormous flocks of
wild fowl of all descriptions.  Here hundreds of beautiful flamingoes may be seen rising when
alarmed, and forming a rosy cloud of plumage in the blue sky--the tints shading gradually from
the delicate pink of their necks to the deep red of their long wings; while many others of
the feathered tribes,--some with long legs, others with huge beaks,--fly across the placid
pools, their strange cries and varied notes sounding through the air.

The eastern portion of this enormous district in winter presents a peculiarly rich aspect--herds
of wild cattle grazing in full liberty on the luxuriant clover which then covers the ground.
As spring advances, a totally different plant takes the place of the clover, and in three or
four weeks an extraordinary change has occurred.  The whole region then appears covered by
a dense wood of enormous thistles, which have shot up to a height of nearly twelve feet, and
are now in full bloom.  So densely do they grow, that they present an impenetrable barrier
to man and horse, or even to the strong-limbed cattle or wild beasts of the plain.  The only
passage through them is by those paths which have been kept open by the constant trampling
of feet; while certain tracks, intricate as those of a labyrinth, which exist in some directions,
are the abodes of bands of robbers, to whom alone they are known.  From their recesses they
sally forth to attack the solitary rancho, or to murder the traveller who may be passing through,
knowing well that they can secure a safe retreat, without the risk of being pursued.

Beyond this region of thistles is a second wide district, which produces long grass, changing
only, according to the season, from green to brown; while beyond it, again, is a third region,
reaching to the base of the Cordilleras, and mostly covered with thick groves of low trees
and evergreen shrubs, with here and there streams passing amid them.

Descending from the Andes, the first view of the Pampas resembles somewhat the wide-spreading
ocean seen from afar; but as the sun rises, irregularities can be distinguished in the northern
portion,--while the streams which run through it from the mountainsides glitter like silver
threads, till lost in the immensity of the distance.

But to return to the previous region.  For several months the tall thistles hold possession
of the plain, but at length the heats of summer tell upon them.  They lose their sap and verdure,
their heads droop, the leaves shrink and fade, the stems become black and dead, though still
they stand rattling one against the other with the breeze.  Then dark clouds are seen in the
west; the fierce pampero bursts forth with irresistible force; they bend before it, and in
a few seconds the whole forest is levelled with the ground.  Here, under the influence of the
heat and moisture, they rapidly decompose and disappear, fertilising the soil.  Once more the
clover rushes up, and the plain again smiles with a verdant hue, and welcomes back the cattle,
who have been driven to distant pastures.

GAUCHOS OF THE PAMPAS.

See the inhabitant of this region,--the bold Gaucho, whether owner of thousands of heads of
cattle, or the humble peon or chasqui, servant or courier,--mounted on his fiery steed.  What
command he has over it!  How admirably he and the animal seem adapted to each other!  If a
proprietor or chief manager, he will probably be habited in a white shirt, with wide trousers
richly embroidered with deep lace; the chiripa--a piece of cloth covering the body and passing
round his legs--being tied with a band; a poncho over his shoulders; boots of polished leather,
or, it may be, of simple skin; his heels adorned with a pair of enormous spurs, of silver or
less valuable metal, with rowels of prodigious circumference; with his rebenque, or horse-whip,
in hand, made of cow-hide, and set off by a handle of massive silver.  All classes residing
on the Pampas, whether in Uruguay or the Far West, are called Gauchos.

Such in early life was General Urquiza, for some time governor of his native province of Entre
Rios.  The term is, however, applied generally to the lower orders.

Hardy, and sparely built, like the Arabs of the desert the Gaucho lives on horseback.  For
most nights the ground is his bed and his saddle his pillow, a piece of hide or a poncho his
only covering.  He will gallop thirty leagues a day without fatigue.

From his infancy he has been taught the use of the lasso and bolas; and in his boyhood learned
to catch the fowls, goats, and sheep about his father's rancho, or to capture partridges in
a similar way.  Yet he is but little fitted for the ordinary hard work of life.  In consequence
of his over-exertion and irregular life, his long abstinence from food, and neglect of a due
proportion of vegetable aliment, his body appears to be dried-up, his vital energies fail,
and his term of existence is shortened.

Impatient of rebuke, he will not brook a hasty word, and will conclude a connection with a
master at a moment's notice, by demanding to have his account made up.  Horse-racing and gambling
are his weaknesses.  His knife is ready at hand, and though fatal results seldom follow being
engaged in a quarrel, he attempts to inflict a cut on the face of his antagonist, and there
to leave his mark.  His food he cooks on a stick-- the asadevo--fixed in the ground before
the fire; and eats it without bread or any kind of vegetable, washing it down with copious
draughts of yerba.

He will gamble on all occasions, either with cards, dominoes, or coin--a pitch-and-toss style
of game.  His horse-racing is more for the sake of obtaining the bets staked on the match.
He also delights to bet on the strength of his horse.  This is tried by fastening a pair of
horses tail to tail, but at some distance, so that each end of a short lasso is tied to the
saddle or girth of either animal.  They are then mounted, and urged by whip and spur in opposite
directions, until the stronger draws the weaker over the goal--a line marked on the ground.
In spite of his gambling propensities, he is often intrusted with hundreds of doubloons for
the purchase of cattle by his master.

His mode of catching partridges is curious.  Armed with a loop attached to the end of a thin
stick, he will ride on till he sees a covey of birds on the ground; and then commences circling
round them,--the birds, curiously enough, not attempting to fly, but trying to run away instead.
The horseman keeps on narrowing his circle, till he at last gets near enough to drop the loop
over a bird's head, when he whips it up, a captive, though in no way injured--so that birds
can thus be caught alive.

BREAKING-IN COLTS.

Witness the operation of breaking-in a wild colt from amidst a herd of a hundred or more. 
A Gaucho called the dormador makes his appearance, dressed in a thin cotton shirt secured by
a scarf round the waist, and a coloured handkerchief bound to his head, while his legs are
guarded by a huge pair of boots, armed with enormous spurs.  There he stands, with his lasso
coiled up and thrown carelessly over his arm.  He advances towards the herd, followed by two
mounted Gauchos dressed in full costume.  As the colts gallop round the corral, into which
they have been driven, with wild eyes and waving manes, he selects one of them; and whirling
his lasso lightly round, casts it over the animal's head, sinking down at the same time on
his left knee, and holding it with both hands.  No sooner does the colt feel the lasso than
it bounds into the air, and dashes off, the dormador sliding and crouching along the ground,
playing him, as a fisherman does a large salmon, till he has separated him from the rest of
the herd.  He then brings him into the centre of the corral, plunging and rearing, with his
tether much shortened.  Another Gaucho throws his lasso on the ground under the colt's fore-feet,
and by an upward jerk tightens it round his legs.  At the same time the dormador lets his lasso
out freely; the horse dashes out till it is brought to the ground by the other lasso, with
a shock sufficient, it would seem, to break every bone in his body.  There he lies motionless,
while his fore and hind-feet are secured.

At length restored to consciousness, after some convulsive plunges he again gets on his feet,
and is led by a further relay of Gauchos to a post, where he is saddled and bridled in spite
of his struggles. Regaining his strength, he plunges, kicks, and bites in all directions, the
Gauchos nimbly getting out of his way.  The dormador, watching his opportunity, now leaps into
the saddle, and signs to his companions to cast off the leg-lasso.  Immediately the colt, finding
his legs free, jumps straight off the ground, and then commences to back, plunge, and dash
furiously out.  The dormador, however, sticks on; and another Gaucho, coming behind, administers
a lash with his long cutting whip, which makes the poor animal start off at full speed, with
a snort like a scream.  A mounted Gaucho rides on either side of him, to keep him straight.
Off he goes over the level country for miles, occasionally stopping to back and kick; but each
time his efforts grow fainter, till at length he is ridden back, with eyes bloodshot, covered
with foam and blood, and perfectly bewildered, when he is unsaddled and tied to the post. 
"Poor beast!" observes Captain Kennedy, who describes such a scene, "he looks as much broken
down as broken in."  Few of the Gauchos, however, can overcome a horse after the manner of
the one whose feat he witnessed.

PATAGONIANS.

The chief tribe of Patagonians who inhabit the region as far south as the Strait of Magellan,
go under the name of Pehuenches--men of tall and muscular stature, with thick black hair, high
foreheads, and broad faces, but in no way approaching to what would be called the gigantic.
Their features express passive contentment, but are utterly destitute of vivacity and intelligence.
Their feet are remarkably small.  They have their eyebrows and moustaches plucked so as to
contain only a single line of hairs.  The women are of low size, and unattractive--using a
sort of pigment on their bodies, composed of animal blood and soot.

The sole covering of both sexes is a mantle made of huanacu skins--worn with the hairy side
in--which can be thrown off in a moment.  Their habitations are huts of skin, supported on
poles sloping to the ground, towards the direction from whence blows the strong wind or snow
from Cape Horn.  They sleep, however, in fine weather,--like other tribes further to the north,--on
the uncovered ground.

Their great delight is smoking--from a pipe made of stone, fashioned into the shape of a small
bowl, in which a long tube is fixed.  Each man takes a pull at the pipe and sends it round,
gulping in a huge quantity of vapour, all the muscles of the body seeming in a fierce convulsion
of straining; and while his neighbour is apparently employed in an effort to gulp down the
whole apparatus, there issues from the nose and mouth of the first smoker a cloud which quickly
renders his face and all around him invisible.

Like other tribes of the Pampas, they have become expert horsemen, and with bolas capture huanacus
and ostriches.

DEER OF THE PAMPAS.

Besides the huanacus, a deer of considerable size ranges in small herds throughout the Pampas
and northern Patagonia, and is very abundant.  It possesses an overpoweringly strong and offensive
odour at some periods of the year, which is perceptible at a great distance.  Should the Gauchos
kill an animal when this is the case, they bury the flesh in the earth, by which means the
taint is removed, and it becomes eatable.  A person can easily approach a herd by crawling
along the ground, when the deer, out of curiosity, apparently, approach to reconnoitre him.
They, however, have learned to fear their enemy, man, when mounted on a horse and armed with
bolas; and as soon as they see a horseman, they invariably take to flight.

NATA CATTLE.

Darwin mentions a remarkable breed of cows called the nata or niata.  When walking, it carries
its head low on a short neck; and its hind-legs are rather longer compared with the front ones
than is usual.

The breed is supposed to have originated amongst the Indians southward of the La Plata.  It
is fiercer than common cattle; and the cow easily deserts her first calf if molested or visited
too often.  "Can it be that this animal is an aboriginal of the continent, and existed ages
before the European breeds were introduced?" asks Mr Darwin.

THE BIZCACHA.

The careless horseman on the Pampas soon becomes disagreeably acquainted with the existence
of a little rodent--the bizcacha--into whose closely-set burrows should his horse step, he
will to a certainty find himself pitched over his steed's head.  It closely resembles a rabbit,
but with larger gnawing teeth and a longer tail.  It has only three toes behind, like the agouti.
The creatures are seen in great numbers during the evening seated on their haunches in front
of their abodes,--from which they seldom wander far,--gravely contemplating the passer-by.
When scampering out of danger, their elevated tails and short fore-legs give them the appearance
of large rats.

They have a curious habit of dragging every hard object they find to the mouth of their burrows;
round which bones of animals, stones, and hard lumps of earth, are found, collected in large
irregular heaps. Although, no doubt, some good reason exists for this habit, it is difficult
to account for it.  A gentleman told Mr Darwin, that having dropped his watch one dark night,
he was unable to find it; but returning the following morning, and searching the neighbourhood
of every bizcacha burrow along the line of road, he at length discovered it among a heap of
rubbish.

THE PERUVIAN BIZCACHA AND CHINCHILLA.

Another little rodent, very similar to the bizcacha of the Pampas, lives high up on the mountain,
often at an elevation of 12,000 feet.  It resembles the rabbit, but its ears are shorter, and
its tail is long and rough.

Nearly related to it, and inhabiting the same region, is the chinchilla--a pretty little creature,
rather larger than a squirrel, with great brilliant eyes, an erect tail, strong bristles on
the upper lip, and rounded, almost naked ears.  Its beautifully soft fur is much valued by
ladies in Europe.  It covers in certain districts the slopes of the Andes with its burrows,
which trip up many an unwary horseman-- greatly to its surprise and alarm, as its only object
in forming them is to have a quiet home of its own, where it can bring up its young, and enjoy
the roots which it collects, and on which it feeds at its leisure.

THE TUCUTUCO (CTENOMYS BRAZILIENSIS).

The tucutuco--another small rodent, with burrowing habits something like those of a mole--gains
its name from the short nasal groan which it repeats about four times in quick succession.
It is very abundant, and may be heard at all times of the day uttering its strange sounds directly
beneath the feet in its burrow.  It throws up little hillocks of earth like those of a mole
at the mouth of its abode.  So completely are tracks of country undermined by these animals,
that horses in passing over sink above their fetlocks.

They are gregarious and nocturnal in their habits.  Their chief food consists of the roots
of plants, to obtain which they make their extensive and superficial burrows.  From the formation
of their hind-legs, they are unable to jump even the smallest vertical height.

It is a curious circumstance connected with them, that large numbers become blind,--though
apparently the animal suffers but little inconvenience in consequence, as it exists almost
entirely beneath the surface of the ground.

THE RHEA.

Across the wide Pampas, from the plains of La Plata to the south of Patagonia, the large rhea,
vying almost in size with the African ostrich, stalks along, generally in pairs, but sometimes
in large flocks of thirty or more.  It differs from the real ostrich,--having three toes instead
of two, is smaller, and of a uniform grey colour, except on the back, which has a brown tint.
Like the ostrich, the back and rump are furnished with long feathers, but of a less rich description
than the former species.

When running, it moves at great speed, alternately raising, outstretching, and then depressing
its wings.

The cock bird emits a singularly deep-toned, hissing note; and he can be distinguished by being
larger, darker coloured, and having a bigger head than the hen.  The cry is so deep and loud,
that it resembles that of a wild beast.

His hens lay their eggs at random round a hole which he digs for the nest.  He then employs
himself in rolling them along into it, by inserting his beak between the egg and the ground,
as a boy would roll a hockey ball along with a stick.  He then sits to hatch them, while the
hens feed round at liberty.  He lies so close on these occasions, that he is easily ridden
over.  He is at this time very fierce, and even dangerous, and has been known to attack a man
on horseback, trying to kick and leap up at him.  Frequently twenty-two eggs, and even more,
are found in each nest.

The rhea, when pursued, readily takes to the water; and sometimes even of its own accord, when
not frightened, will swim across a river.  One has been seen crossing a stream four hundred
yards in width.

The rhea is hunted by the Gauchos and Indians on horseback.  The huntsmen form a semicircle,
gradually closing in on the bird, which does not know in which way to escape.  It generally
runs off against the wind; at the same time, when it first starts, it expands its wings, and,
like a vessel, makes sail.  As the huntsman gets close to it he throws his lasso over its neck;
or if he is using the bolas, he casts them so as to entangle the bird's-legs, and thus bring
it to the ground.

The rhea is easily tamed, and is constantly seen about the huts of the Patagonians.

In the southern part of Patagonia another species, much smaller, exists,--the Avestris petise,
now called Struthio Darwinii, in compliment to the naturalist who has described it.  He states
that not more than fifteen eggs are found in the nest of the petise, deposited by two or more
females.  It is a smaller and more graceful bird: its white feathers are tipped with black
at the extremities, and the black ones in like manner are tipped with white.

A third species, the large-billed rhea (Rhea macrorhyncha), has been discovered.  These birds
in vast numbers inhabit the wide-extended plains, and afford a welcome addition to the food
of their roving inhabitants.

CARACARA POLYBORUS.

The largest caracara--Polyborus Braziliensis--ranges the grassy savannahs of La Plata.  It
also attends the estancias and slaughtering-houses, accompanied by its smaller relative, the
chimango.  "When an animal dies on the plain the gallinaso commences the feast, and then the
two species of polyborus pick the bones clean," says Darwin.  These birds, although thus commonly
feeding together, are far from being friends.  The caracara takes little notice, except by
bobbing its head.

The flight of the caracara is heavy and slow, and it is generally an inactive, tame, and cowardly
bird.  It destroys young lambs, by tearing the umbilical cord; and it pursues the gallinaso
till that bird is compelled to vomit up the carrion it may have recently gorged.  It is said,
also, that several caracaras will unite in chase of large birds, even such as herons.

The chimango is tame and fearless; and when an animal is killed a number soon collect, and
patiently wait, standing on the ground on all sides. Darwin describes seeing one pounce on
a dog which was lying asleep close to one of a party of sportsmen.  They had difficulty in
preventing their canine companion from being seized before their eyes.

It will frequently wait, as does the caracara, at the mouth of a rabbit-hole, and seize on
the animal when it comes out.  They are noisy, too, uttering several harsh cries--one of them
like that of the English rook.

OWLS OF THE PAMPAS (ATHENE CUNICULAEIA).

The traveller across the Pampas will see a number of little owls-- generally seated in pairs,
during the evening, on the hillocks near the burrows of the bizcacha, occasionally uttering
their strange wild hoots to each other.

THE PAMPAS CUCKOO (MOLOTHRUS NIGER).

Among the birds of numerous kinds which abound on the plains, there are several worthy of notice.
One is remarkable from its habits.

It deposits its eggs, like the cuckoo, in the nests of other birds. Several of them may be
seen standing together on the back of a cow or horse.

THE CALANDRIA (MINA ORPHEUS).

The best songster on the Pampas is a species of mocking-bird, called by the inhabitants calandria.
Its song is powerful--similar to that of the hedge-warbler.  It only sings, however, during
the spring; at other times its cry is harsh and inharmonious.  They frequent the neighbourhood
of houses; and will boldly peck at the meat which is hung up on the posts or walls to dry.
When any of the other small birds join the feast, the calandria soon chases them away.

FLAMINGOES.

The flamingo, in large flocks, visits the New World as well as the Old. On the shores of the
great rivers, as also on the banks of lagoons and marshes, it may be seen feeding with other
water-fowl--its beautiful red and white plumage shining brightly in the sun, and contrasting
with the dark green of the river vegetation.

OVEN-BIRDS.

Of the genus Furnarius there are several species.  The best-known is the oven-bird of La Plata--the
casara, or house-maker, of the Spaniards.

THE LITTLE HOUSE-BUILDER.

There is another species of Furnarius, which the Spaniards call the casarita, or little house-builder.
This species builds its nest at the bottom of a narrow cylindrical hole, which extends horizontally
to nearly six feet under ground.  It generally chooses the side of a low bank, but sometimes
penetrates the mud walls round the houses, through which it works its way, frequently--very
much to its disappointment-- coming out unexpectedly on the opposite side.

THE SCISSOR-BEAK.

The scissor-beak (Rhynchops nigra) frequents the lakes and streams.  It is about the size of
a tern, with short legs, webbed feet, and extremely long, pointed wings.  The beak is flattened
laterally, and the lower mandible is an inch and a half longer than the upper.  In their flight
they frequently twist about with extreme swiftness, managing, with their projecting lower mandible,
to plough up small fish, which they retain in the lower half of their scissor-like bills. 
Each bird thus leaves its wake on the mirror-like surface.  On quitting the water their flight
is wild, irregular, and rapid.  They then utter loud, harsh cries; their tails, as they fly,
are much used in steering their irregular course.

During the day they may generally be seen resting in flocks on the grassy plains, at some distance
from the water, as they usually take to fishing at night.

PARROTS.

A small green parrot, with a grey breast, frequents the banks of the Parana.  It builds on
the higher branches of the taller trees.

These birds fly in large flocks, and commit great ravages on the corn-fields.

THE BOAT-BILL HERON.

In the same localities the curious boat-bill heron is found,--its short thick neck and enormous
beak giving it a clumsy, ungainly look alongside the elegant flamingo.  The beak may be likened
to two boats, laid one upon the other, gunwale to gunwale, the upper part of the mandible representing
the keel.  It feeds on the Crustacea which it picks up on the shore, as well as on fish--on
which it pounces, as they swim by, from some branch overhanging the water.

It is about the size of a duck, its legs being shorter, in proportion to its body, than those
of waders in general.  On the top of its head the male has a full, long plume of black feathers
drooping over the back. The neck and breast are of a greyish-white.  The back also is grey,
with a wash of rusty-red; while there is a patch of a deeper tint of the same colour upon the
middle of the under part of the body.  The sides are black, and the tail white.

Although many other creatures besides those which have been described are to be found in the
vast regions we have rambled over, none of the larger or more curious have been omitted.  We
have, however, been able to take only a very cursory glance at the human inhabitants or the
wonders of the vegetable kingdom; but it is hoped that the reader will have gained a general
and correct view of the various aspects which the wilder portions of the Western World present,
as well as of the animals with which the Creator, in his infinite wisdom, has thought fit to
people them.

Quitting America, we purpose,--in future volumes,--to wander over the Eastern portions of the
globe, the islands of the Pacific, Australasia, and the Indian Archipelago, and to visit the
Arctic and Antarctic regions,--where numberless objects are to be found, not less interesting
and wonderful than those described in the preceding pages.
