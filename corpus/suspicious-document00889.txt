Mester Blair had what they ca' an opera gless wi' him, an' he handed it to me to look throo.
Sandy in wi' his hand intil his greatcoat pooch, an' oot wi' his spygless, a great lang thing'
like a barber's pole, that he wan at a raffle at the Whin Inn.  There was a chappie deein'
on the stage.  He'd stuck himsel' wi' his soord, because a lassie wudna mairry him, an' he
was juist lyin' tellin' a' the fowk aboot crooil weemin, an' peace in the grave, an' a'thing,
when Sandy cockit up his spygless to hae a glower at him afore he gae his henmist gasp.

I saw the chappie gien a kind o' a fear'd-like start, syne he sprang till his feet an' roared,
"Pileece, pileece! there's an anarkist an' a feenyin's bom in the theater," an' took till his
heels aff the stage.

You never saw sic a wey o' doin'.  You speak aboot peace in the grave. There wasna muckle peace
in the theater.  We was a' winderin' what was ado, an' Sandy was busy peekin' roond wi' his
spygless, when twa bobbies cam' fleein' anower an' grippit him an' roared till him to sirrender.
I can tell you, he nearhand sirrendered ane o' the bobbies wi' the spygless.  If it hadna been
for Mester Blair gettin' a haud o' the wechty end o't, there wudda been a noo helmet, an' mibby
a new bobby needed in Edinboro.

The row was a' ower in five meenits, when Mester Blair explen'd things; but if he hadna been
wi's, I'm dootin' it wudda been a job.  There was ane o' the great muckle dosent nowts o' bobbies
cam' an' gowpit in my face, an' says, "D'ye think this ane's a woman?"  I fand in ahent's for
my umberell; but my chappie gaed his wa's gey quick, or I'd gien him the wecht o't across his
nose.  It was a gey-like wey o' doin' aboot naething; but efter we got hame an' had oor supper
we forgot a' aboot it, an' spent a very happy 'oor or twa afore we gaed to oor beds.

LOVE AND WAR.

Wudna you winder hoo some fowk grow aye the aulder the waur?  You see Toon Cooncillors, for
instance, gettin' less use the langer they keep their job; an' ministers--haud your tongue!
If they're no' guid, they get mair an' mair driech the langer they preach; even their auld
sermons, when they turn the barrel an' start at the boddom o' her, appear to get driecher than
ever.  It's juist the same wi' Sandy--the aulder he grows he gets the waur, till I raley winder
what'll happen till him.  He's richt sensible an' eident whiles; but when the fey blude gets
intil his heid, an' he gets into the middle o' ony rig, he's juist as daft as the rochest haflin
that ever fee'd.

When I heard the band on Setarday efternune, I threw the key i' the shop door, an' ran doon
to the fit o' the street to see the sojers passin'.  Wha presents himsel', merchin' in the
front o' the band, but my billie, Sandy.  There he was wi' a hunder laddies roond him, smokin'
his pipe like's he was gettin' his denner ooten't, ane o' his airms up to the elba in his breeks'
pooch, stappin' oot to the musik like a fechtin' cock, an' his ither airm sweengin' back an'
forrit like the pendilum o' the toon's clock.  To look at him you wudda thocht he was trailin'
the band an' a' the sojers ahent him, he lookit that hard wrocht.  He never saw me--not him!
His e'en were starin' fair afore him; he wudna kent his ain tattie cairt, I believe, he was
that muckle taen up wi' his merchin'.

He landit hame till his tea atween sax an' seven o'clock, stervin' o' cauld, but as happy's
a cricket.  "Man, Bawbie," he says, as I laid a reed herrin' on the brander for him, "there's
naething affeks me like sojers merchin' to musik.  It juist garrs my backbeen dirl, an' I canna
sit still.  When they were doin' the merch-past this efternune, I had to up an' rin, or I wudda
thrappilt some lad sittin' aside's.  That's the wey it affeks me.  I wudda gien a pound note
juist to gotten a richt straucht-forrit fecht amon' them for half an 'oor."

"You're juist like a muckle bubbly laddie, Sandy," says I.  "It's a winder you wasna awa' up
the toon wi' them to see if ony o' the sojers wud lat you cairry hame their gun.  I raley winder
to see an auld tattie man like you goin' on like some roid loon."

"That's a' you ken, Bawbie," says he.  "I ken mair aboot thae things than you, fully; an',
though I am a tattie man, look at Abraham Linkin; he was waur than a tattie man to begin wi';
an' the Jook o' Wellinton--michty, he was born in Ireland; an' look what he cam' till! I tell
you what it is, Bawbie, if they'd haen me at the battle o' Waterloo, you wudda heard anither
story o't.  I feel'd within mysel', that if I'd only haen the chance--see 'at that reed herrin's
no' burnin'--I michta been a dreel sergint or a general----"

"A general haiverin' ass," I strak in.  "See; there's your herrin'; poor oot your tea noo,
an' haud your lang tongue."

"Ow, weel-a-weel," says Sandy, gey dour-like--he's as bucksturdie as a mule when he tak's't
in's heid--"but we're no' deid yet, an' we'll mibby manish to garr some fowk winder yet, when
a's dune.  What's been dune afore can be dune again; the speerit o' Bannockburn's no' de'ed
oot a'thegither."

But I left the cratur chatterin' awa' till himsel', an' ran but to sair some fowk i' the shop.
Did you ever hear o' sic a man?  Dauvid Kenawee says Sandy's a kind o' a sinnyquanon; an' it's
my opeenyin he's no' very far wrang, whatever that may mean.

As I was sayin', there's nae fules like auld fules.  I put oot twa-three bits o' things on
the green on Setarday forenune, an' I forgot a' aboot them till efter the shop was shut.  It
wud be nearhand twal o'clock when I ran doon for them.  It was a fine nicht, but dreidfu' cauld.
Juist as I was gaitherin' up the twa-three bit duds, I heard voices ower the dyke, an' I cudna
but harken to see wha wud be oot at that time o' nicht.  Fancy what I thocht when I heard Beek
Steein's voice, that bides in Mistress Mollison's garret, sayin', "Eh, ay, Jeemie; it's an
awfu' thing luve.  I hinna steekit 'an e'e for twa nichts thinkin' aboot ye."

Preserve's a', thinks I to mysel', this is Ribekka an' Jeems Ethart, the engine-driver.  Jeems
is a weeda man, an' Ribekka's like me, she's on the wrang side o' forty; but, faigs, on Setarday
nicht you wudda thocht they were baith aboot five-an'-twenty.

"My bonnie dooie," I heard Jeems say.  A gey dooie, I says to mysel'. There's twal steen o'
her, if there's a pund.  It wud tak' a gey pair o' weengs to cairry Ribekka, I tell ye.

"A'ye genna gie's a kiss, Ribekka?" Jeems says after a whilie; an' Ribekka gae a bit geegle,
an' then whispers laich in, "Help yoursel', Jeemie"--an' there they were at it like twa young anes.

I didna ken whuther to flee up the yaird, roar oot "feyre," or clim' up on the dyke an' gie
them a wallop roond the linders wi' my bits o' cloots.  So I stud still.

The fient a ane o' them ever thocht there was a livin' sowl within fifty yairds o' them, an'
they were crackin' an' kirrooin' awa' like a pair o' doos.

"Isn't a peety they dinna ca' me Izik?" says Jeems.

"Hoo d'ye think that?" said Ribekka.

"Cause it wudda lookit so fine--Izik an' Ribekka, d'ye see?" an' they nickered an' leuch like
a' that.

"An' I wudda been Ribekka at the wall," said Beek.

"Exackly," said Jeems; "altho' this auld pump's hardly the kind o' wall they had in thae days.
I hope there's nae horn-gollochs aboot it."

"There's twal o'clock," said Ribekka; "we'll need to be goin'. Gude-nicht, Jeems.  See an'
mind aboot me.  Gude-nicht."

"Gude-nicht, my ain bonnie lassie," Jeems harken'd in till her.  "Dinna be feared o' me forgettin'
ye.  I never lift a shuffle o' coals but, I think I see your face.  Every puff o' the engine
brings me in mind o' ye, Ribekka; an' when I sit doon to tak' my denner, I lat fa' my flagon
whiles, I'm that taen up thinkin' aboot ye."

"Eh, Jeems, you're codin' me noo!  But gude-night!  Eh, mind ye, it's Sabbath mornin'."

"Gude-nicht, my bonnie lassie.  Oh, Ribekka, you're sweeter gin heather honey.  I wiss Sint
Tammas Market was here, an' we'll be nae langer twa but wan.  My bonnie dooie!  Gude-nicht,
my ain scentit geranum," says Jeems.

I began to be akinda waumish, d'ye ken.  The haivers o' the two spooney craturs juist garred
me feel like's I'd taen a fizzy drink or something.  You ken what I mean--the kind o' a' ower
kittlie feelin' that's like to garr you screech, ye dinna ken hoo.

"Gude-nicht, Jeems," says Beek again.  "I'll never luve onybody but you."

"Are your shure?" began the auld ass again; an' me stanin' near frozen to death wi' cauld,
an' cudna get oot o' the bit.

"Never!" said Beek; "never!"

"Gude-nicht, than, dearie, an' see an' no' forget me.  Will ye no'?"

"Ye needna be feared, Jeems.  I luve you alone, an' nae ither body i' the wide, wide world.
Gude-nicht, my Jeemie."

"Gude-nicht, than, Ribekka, luvie.  An' if you dinna forget----"

But this was ower muckle for me; so I juist roared oot, "Gude-nicht, ye haiverin' eedeits,"
as heich as I cud yawl, an' up the yaird at what I cud flee.

Sandy was beddit on the back o' ten o'clock, an' he was snorin' like a dragoon when I gaed
up the stair.  But when I got anower he jamp up a' o' a sudden, like's he'd gotten a fleg.

"Keep me, Bawbie, whaur i' the face o' the earth hae you been?" he says, wi' his een stanin'
in's heid, an' drawin' in his breath like's a shooer o' cauld water had been skootit aboot
him.  "You've shurely been awa' at the whalin'.  Bless me, your feet's as cauld's an iceikle.
Keep them awa' frae me."

Isn't that juist like thae men?  Weemin can beat them in mony weys, I admit; but, for doonricht
selfishness, come your wa's!

XV.

SANDY MAKES A SPEECH.

There's been great gaitherin's in oor washin'-hoose this while back--"Nochties-an'-Broziana,"
Bandy Wobster ca'd the meetin's to Sandy.  The ither Wedensday i' the forenicht--the shop was
shut i' the efternune, of coorse; I'm a great believer i' the half-holiday, you see.  I think
it's a capital idea.  It gi'es a body a kind o' a breath or twa i' the middle o' the week,
an' it pits naebody aboot.  The fowk juist come for their things afore you shut.  It disna
mak' a hair o' difference.  If you didna open ava, they wud juist come the nicht afore.

Weel, but, as I was sayin', the ither Wedensday nicht I flang my shallie ower my heid, an'
took a stap oot at the back door i' the gloamin'.  It was a fine nicht, an' I sat doon on the
simmer-seat at the gavel o' the washin'-hoose, an' heard the argey-bargeyin' gaen on inside.
I stuid up an' lookit in at the bolie winda, juist abune whaur the skeels sit, an' here was
Sandy an' his cronies a' busy crackin' an' smokin', an enjoyin' themselves i' the middle o'
a great steer o' reek an' noise.

Juist as I lookit in, Bandy Wobster said something to Dauvid Kenawee, an' Dauvid raise, an'
takin' his pipe oot o' his moo, says, "Order!  I pirpose Mester Wobster to the chair."

"Hear, hear," said a' the rest; an' wi' that Bandy got up on the boiler-heid on his belly,
an' turnin' roond, sat wi' the legs o' him hingin' ower the front o' the boiler, juist like
a laddie sittin' on the dyke at the Common.  Watty Finlay, the weaver, shuved anower a tume
butter kit for Bandy to set his feet on, an' then a'body sat quiet, juist like's something
was genna happen.

Bandy took a bit tarry string, or tabaka or something, ooten his breeks pooch, an', nippin'
aff a quarter o' a yaird o't, he into his moo wi't. Syne he swallowed a spittal, an' said--"Freends
an' fella ratepeyers." Bandy never pey'd rates in's life.  He bides in a twa-pound garret i'
the Wyndies, an' hardly ever peys rent, lat aleen rates.  "Freends an' fella ratepeyers," says he.

Bandy was stan'in' up on the boddom o' the butter kit gin this time, an' a' the billies were
harkenin' like onything.

"Freends an' fella ratepeyers," says Bandy again.  "See gin that door's on the sneck, Sandy,
an' dinna lat the can'le blaw oot."

Sandy raise an' put to the door, an' set the can'le alang nearer Bandy a bit, an' then sat
doon i' the sofa again.

"I hinna muckle to say," says Bandy.  Bandy was brocht up in Aiberdeen, you ken, an' he has
whiles a gey queer wey o' speakin'.  "I hinna very muckle to say, you ken," says he, "an' konsequently,
I'll no' say very muckle."

"Hear, hear," roared Watty Finlay.

"The Toon Cooncil elections is leemin' in the distance," continued Bandy, "an', as ceetizens
o' the Breetish Empyre, we maun look oot for fit an' proper persons to reprisent the opinions
o' the democracy in the Hoose o'--in the Toon Hoose, an' on the Police Commission. Gentlemen----"

This garred a' the billies sit back in their seats, an' dicht their moos wi' their jeckit sleeves,
an' host.  Watty Finlay nearhand cowpit ower the bucket he was sittin' on; but he got his balance
again, an' sayin', "Ay, man," heich oot, he got a' richt sattled doon again.

"Gentlemen," says Bandy, "the time for action draws at hand.  Oor watter is no fit for ki drinking;
an' there's fient a thing but watter in the weet dock.  My heart bleeds when I go roond the
shore an' see all the ships sailin' oot o' the herbir, an' no' a livin' sowl comin' in.  Gentlemen,
that herbir's growin' a gijantic white elephant."

"An' so's the Watter Toor, an' the Lifeboat too," roared Dauvid Kenawee.

"The toon's foo o' white elephants, a' colours," said Moses Certricht. "The Toon Cooncil's
made it juist like a wild beast show."

"Hear, hear," cried the whole lot; an' Stumpie Mertin, gettin' a little excited, roared "Order,"
an' set them a' a-lauchin'.

"Gentlemen," said Bandy again, "it's as plen's a pikestaff that a' oor municeepal affairs is
clean gaen to the deevil a'thegither; an' I have much pleasure----"

"Hear, hear," said Watty Finlay, "he's the very man."  There was a bit lauch at this, an' Watty
added, "I mean Sandy, of coorse--no' the deevil 'at Bandy was speakin' aboot."

"I was genna say," said Bandy, "when I was interrupit by the honourable gentleman----"

"O, gie's a rest," said Watty; an' Bandy had to begin again.

"I was genna say," he said, "that we maun get a hand o' a puckle men o' abeelity an' straucht-forritness,
an' I have much pleasure in proposin' a vote of thanks to oor worthy freend, Mester Bowden,
for comin' forrit to abolish the Toon Cooncil o' every rissim o' imposeeshin, till taxation
shall vanish into oblivion, an' be a thing o' the past. Mester Bowden is a man----"

"Hear, hear," says Watty again.

"Mester Bowden is a man that will never do onything----"

"Hear, hear," Watty stricks in again.  He juist yatter-yattered awa' like a parrot a' the time.

"Onything below the belt," proceeded Bandy.  "Give him your votes, gentlemen.  I can recommend
him.  Sandy--I mean Mester Bowden, will stick to his post like Cassybeeanka, or whatever they
ca'd the billie that was brunt at the battle o' the Nile.  He'll no' be like some o' them that,
like Ralph the Rover,

        Sailed away,
  An' scoored the sea for mony a day.

Gentlemen, let everywan here do his very best to get every elektor to vote for Sandy, Mester
Bowden, the pop'lar candidate.  Up wi' him to the tap o' the poll!"

Bandy cam' doon wi' his tackety buit on the boddom o' the butter kit, an' in it gaed, an' him
wi't, an' there he was, clappin' his hands, an' stanin' juist like's he'd on a wid crinoline.
You never heard sic a roostin' an' roarin' an' hear-hearin' an' hurrain'!  I had to shut my
een for fear o' bein' knokit deaf a'thegither.  Stumpie Mertin jumpit up as spruce as gin he
had baith his legs, instead o' only ane, an' forgettin' whaur he was, he glowered a' roond
the wa' an' says, "Whaur's the bell, lads?"

It was Sandy's turn noo; an' efter Dauvid Kenawee, auld Geordie Steel, an' Moses Certricht
had gotten the chairman pu'd oot o' the butter kit, an' on to the boiler-heid again, Sandy
raise ooten his seat wi' a look on his face like a nicht watchman.  They a' swang their airms
roond their heids, an' hurraed like onything, an' Sandy took lang breaths, an' lookit roond
him as gin he was feard some o' them wud tak' him a peelik i' the lug.

When they quieted doon, Sandy gae a host, an' Watty Finlay said, "Hear, hear."

"Fella elektors," said Sandy, "let me thank you for your cordial reception."

Sandy had haen that ready aforehand, for he said her aff juist like "Man's Chief End."  Syne
he lifted his fit an' put it on the edge o' the sofa.  He rested his elba on his knee, an'
his chin on his hand, an' lookit quite at hame, like's he'd been accustomed addressin' meetin's
a' his born days.

"I think oor worthy chairman spoke ower high aboot my abeelity," said Sandy; "but as far as
lies in my pooer, I will never budge from my post, but stand firm."  At this point, Sandy's
fit slippit aff the edge o' the sofa, an' he cam' stoit doon an' gae Moses Certricht a daud
i' the lug wi' the croon o' his heid, that sent Moses' heid rap up again' Dauvid Kenawee's.

"What i' the world are ye heavin' aboot that heid o' yours like that for?" said Dauvid, glowerin'
like a wild cat at Moses: an' Bandy kickit his heels on the front o' the boiler, an' roared,
"Order, gentlemen. Respeck the chair!"

I was juist away to cry--"Ye micht respeck my boiler, raither, an' no' kick holes i' the plester
wi' thae muckle clunkers o' heels o' yours"; but I keepit it in.

Sandy got himsel' steadied up again, an' pulled doon his weyscot, syne gae his moo a dicht,
an' buttoned his coat.  I cud see fine that he was tryin' to keep up the English; but it wasna
good enough.  "I am no' a man o' learnin'," said Sandy.  "I'm a wirkin' man, an' if I tak'
up my heid wi' publik affairs, it's 'cause I've naething else ado, and it'll keep me oot o'
langer.  As oor respeckit chairman says, I'm no' like Ralph the Rover, sailin' awa' an' scoorin'
the sea for mony a day. That looks like a pure weyst o' soap--juist like what goes on i' the
Toon Cooncil daily-day.  You may lauch, freends, but it's ower true; an' wha is't peys for't?"

"It's his!  It's his, lads!" roared a' the billies i' the washin'-hoose.

"It is so," said Sandy.  "Oor Toon Cooncil's juist like this Ralph the Rover, gaen awa' scoorin'
the sea for nae end--for the sea's no' needin' scoorin'--when he michta been at hame helpin'
his wife to ca' the washin'-machine.  It's usef'u' wark we want.  Neen o' your Bailie Thingymabob's
capers, wi' his donkey engines, eksettera.  Echt thoosand pound for a noo kirkyaird!  Did ye
ever hear the like!  What aboot the grand view you get?  A puckle o' thae Cooncillors crack
as gin they were genna pet bow-windas into a' the graves, to lat ye hae a grand view efter
you was buried.  Blethers o' nonsense!  That's juist what I ca' scoorin' the sea like Ralph
the Rover."

By faigs, lads, Sandy garred me winder gin this time.  Ye never heard hoo he laid it into them,
steekin' his nivs an' layin' aboot him wi' his airms.

"Echt thoosand pound!" he roars again.  "That's seven shillin's the heid--man, woman, and bairn
i' the toon o' Arbroath.  What d'ye think o' that?  But that's no' a'.  There's the toon's
midden, too; that's needin' a look intil."

"Hear, hear," put in Watty as uswal; an' Bandy added, "It has muckle need, as my nose can tell ye."

"What d'ye think o' a midden i' the very middle o' your toon?" Sandy gaed on.  "I paws for
an answer," he said in a gravedigger's kind o' a voice.  He crossed his legs ower ane anither,
an' put ane o' his hands in ablo the tails o' his coat; an', gettin' akinda aff his balance,
he gaed spung up again' Bandy Wobster.  There was a crunch an' a splash, an' there was the
chairman's bowd legs stickin' up oot o' the boiler, an' his face lookin' throo atween his taes,
wi' a pair o' een like a wild cat.  He was up to the neck amon' the claes I had steepin' for
the morn's washin'.  The nesty footer that he was, I cudda dune I kenna what till him.

"Ye great, big, clorty, tarry beast," I roared in at the winda; "come oot amon' my claes this
meenit, or I'll come in an' kin'le the fire, an' boil ye."  Sandy bloo oot the can'le; an'
by a' the how-d'ye-does ever was heard tell o', you niver heard the marrow o' yon.  Stumpie
Mertin roared "Order!  Feyre!" at the pitch o' his voice; an' the chairman was yowlin', "For
ony sake, gie's a grip o' some o' your hands till I get oot o' this draw-wall, or I'm a deid man."

I think he had gotten haud o' a shelf abune his heid, an' giein' himsel' a poo up; for there
was a most terriple reeshel o' broken bottles, an' beef tins, an' roarin' an' swearin', you
never heard the like.

"What i' the face o' the earth was ye doin' blawin' oot the can'le, Sandy?" said Dauvid Kenawee.
"Hold on a meenit till I strik' a spunk, an' see wha's a' deid," he says; an' wi' that he strak'
a match an' lichtit the can'le.  Bandy had gotten himsel' akinda warsled oot o' the boiler,
but Stumpie Mertin had tnakit his wid leg ower by the ankle, an' there he was hawpin' aboot,
gaen bobbin' up an' doon like a rabbit's tail, roarin' "Murder!"

"I think we'll better lave ower the rest o' the meetin' till anither nicht," said Moses Certricht,
"an' we can look into the toon's midden some ither time."

"Juist tak' a look roond aboot ye," says I, in at the winda, "an' ye'll see midden eneuch.
Wha's genna clean up that mairter?  I paws for a answer," says I, in a voice as like Sandy's
bural-society wey o' speakin' as I cud manish.  "Speak aboot pettin' Sandy Bowden at the tap
o' the poll.  He'll be mair use at the end o' the bissam shaft, I'm thinkin'."

"C'wey, you lads," says Bandy.  "I'm soakin' dreepin' throo an' throo, an' it's time I was
oot o' this."

"Hear, hear," says Watty again; an' oot the entry they a' merched withoot a wird.  If I'm no
mista'en that'll be the end o' Sandy's Toon Cooncillin'; an' time till't, I think.  The man's
no' wyse to think aboot ony sic thing.  Perfeckly ridic'lous!

Sandy an' me were oot the Sands enjoyin' a bit walk juist yesterday efternune, an' we were
dreedfu' quiet.  There didna appear to be onything to speak aboot ava.  So I juist said in
a kind o' jokey wey, "Ay, Sandy, an' hae ye seen the Ward Committee yet, laddie, aboot that
Toon Cooncil bisness."

As shure's ocht, he grew reed i' the face; but he got richt efter a whilie, an' he says, "We're
genna be like the Skule Brod efter this, Bawbie.  We'll hae oor meetin's in private, an' juist
lat you an' the publik ken aboot bits o' things ya can mak' naething o'.  D'ye see?  If ye
pet your nose in aboot ony bolies harkenin', you'll mibby get the wecht o' a bissam shaft on
the end o't.  That'll learn ye to slooch an' harken to ither fowk's bisness."

"Keep me!" says I, I says.  "Ye're terriple peppery the nicht, Sandy. Wha's been straikin'
you against the hair, cratur?  It wasna me that shuved Bandy i' the boiler; but he'd been neen
the waur o' a bit steep, for he trails aboot a clorty-like sicht.  Him speak aboot the watter
supply!  It's no' muckle he kens aboot the watter supply, or the soap supply ether."

"Look here, Bawbie," says Sandy, "if you're genna rag me ony mair aboot that, it's as fac's
ocht, I'll rin awa' an' join the mileeshie.  I wud raither be blawn into minch wi' an' echty-ton
gun than stand ony mair o' your gab."

"Tut, tut, Sandy," says I, "keep on your dickie, man.  Ye're no' needin' to get into a pavey
like that.  Keep me, fowk wud think ye was discussin' the auld kirk questin, the wey you're
roarin'.  The mileeshie wudna hae you at ony rate, an' we're no' juist dune wi' ye at hame
yet.  But neist time you're makin' a speech, Sandy, dinna try an' stand on ae leg.  That's
what put ye aff the straucht.  Ye see----"

I lookit roond, an' Sandy wasna there.  When I turned, here's him fleein' in the Sands wi'
his fingers in his lugs, like spring-heeled Jeck.  I tell ye, that man winna heed a single
wird I say till him.

XVI.

SANDY'S CHRISTMAS PRESENT.

Oh, wheesht!  When Sandy's on for doin' something special, he nearhand aye mak's a gutter o't
some wey or ither.  On Setarday nicht he was gaen aboot hostin', an' spittin', an' sayin' ilky
noo an' than, "Ay, Bawbie; it's a fine nicht the nicht."  He sweepit oot ahent the washin'
soda barrel twa-three times; then he rowed up the tnock that ticht that she's never steered
a meenit sin' syne.  He took the hammer an' ca'd a' the coals fair into koom, an' then he redd
up at the back shop till I cudna lay my hands on a single thing 'at I wantit.  I saw fine there
was something i' the wind; but, do my best, I cudna jaloose what it was.

He put on the shop shutters, an' syne screwed aff the gas at the meeter afore I got the bawbees
oot o' the till, an' stack in, ye never saw the like.  He was that anxious to gie me a hand
that he hendered me near half an 'oor.

This gaed on a' Sabbath!  He was three times at the kirk, an' he roostit an' sang till the
bit lassies i' the very koir lookit aboot akinda feard like.  But Sandy never jowed his jundie.
He put in anither button o' his coat, an' stack in till the Auld Hunder like the Jook o' Wellinton
at the battle o' Waterloo.  The koir sang an anthem i' the efternune, an' Sandy sang anither
at the same time, the rest o' the fowk harkenin' to the competition.  Sandy gaed squawlin'
an' squawkin' up an' doon amon' the quivers, an' through the middle o' what he ca'd the cruchits,
juist like a young pairtrick amon' a pozel o' hag.  Mistress Glendie, that sits at the tap
o' oor seat, is a bit o' a singer, an' she put back her lugs an' skooled like a fountin' mule
at Sandy, oot at the corner o' her specks; but Sandy never lut dab.  His een, when he hadna
his nose buried in his book, were awa' i' the roof o' the kirk, an' Mistress Glendie never
got a squawk in ava, eksep when Sandy was swallowin' his spittal.

Gaen to the kirk at nicht was something to mind aboot.  There wasna a lamp to be seen--an'
sic roads!  The very laddies frae the Sabbath Schule were gaen on the paidmint, whaur there
were maist gutters, an' skowf kickin' them at ane anither.  The middle o' the road cudna haud
the can'le to the paidmints for glaur lest Sabbath.  Sandy an' me gaed kloiterin' alang the
Port, Sandy yatterin' ilky noo-an'-than--"Keep on the plennies, 'oman."  He was keepin' his
e'e on his feet that steady, that, afore I kent whaur I was, he had baith o's wammlin' aboot
amon' the gutters doon the Dens.  He'd taen the wrang side o' the dyke at the fit o' the High
Road, an' awa' doon the brae instead o' up!  We saw the muckle lamp up abune the brig juist
like a lichthoose twenty mile awa'. Sandy was widin' aboot amon' the mud, an' his lorn shune
liftin' wi' a noisy gluck, juist like a pump aff the fang.

"I think this is shurely the Sloch o' Dispond we've gotten intil, Bawbie," says he.

"It looks liker the Wardmill Dam," says I, I says; "but if I get oot o't livin', I'll lat the
pileece hear o't.  A gey Lichtin' Commitee we have, to hae fowk wammlin' aboot i' the mirk
like this on their wey to the kirk!  There's ower muckle keepin' fowk i' the dark a' roond,"
says I, I says; "an' there maun be an end till't.  It's a perfeck scandal."
