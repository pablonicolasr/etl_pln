PEACE THEORIES AND THE BALKAN WAR

BY

NORMAN ANGELL

Author of "The Great Illusion"

    Whether we blame the belligerents or criticise the powers, or sit in
    sackcloth and ashes ourselves is absolutely of no consequence at the
    present moment....

    We have sometimes been assured by persons who profess to know that
    the danger of war has become an illusion.... Well, here is a war
    which has broken out in spite of all that rulers and diplomatists
    could do to prevent it, a war in which the Press has had no part, a
    war which the whole force of the money power has been subtly and
    steadfastly directed to prevent, which has come upon us, not through
    the ignorance or credulity of the people, but, on the contrary,
    through their knowledge of their history and their destiny, and
    through their intense realisation of their wrongs and of their
    duties, as they conceived them, a war which from all these causes
    has burst upon us with all the force of a spontaneous explosion, and
    which in strife and destruction has carried all before it. Face to
    face with this manifestation, who is the man bold enough to say that
    force is never a remedy? Who is the man who is foolish enough to say
    that martial virtues do not play a vital part in the health and
    honour of every people? (Cheers.) Who is the man who is vain enough
    to suppose that the long antagonisms of history and of time can in
    all circumstances be adjusted by the smooth and superficial
    conventions of politicians and ambassadors?--MR. WINSTON CHURCHILL
    at Sheffield.

    Mr. Norman Angell's theory was one to enable the citizens of this
    country to sleep quietly, and to lull into false security the
    citizens of all great countries. That is undoubtedly the reason why
    he met with so much success.... It was a very comfortable theory for
    those nations which have grown rich and whose ideals and initiative
    have been sapped by over much prosperity. But the great delusion of
    Norman Angell, which led to the writing of "The Great Illusion," has
    been dispelled for ever by the Balkan League. In this connection it
    is of value to quote the words of Mr. Winston Churchill, which give
    very adequately the reality as opposed to theory.--The Review of
    Reviews, from an article on "The Débâcle of Norman Angell."

And an odd score of like pronouncements from newspapers and public men since the outbreak of
the Balkan War.

The interrogations they imply have been put definitely in the first chapter of this book; the
replies to those questions summarised in that chapter and elaborated in the others.

The "key" to this book and the summary of its arguments are contained in Chapter I. (pp. 7-12)

CHAPTER I.

THE QUESTIONS AND THEIR ANSWER.

What has Pacifism, Old or New, to say now?

Is War impossible?

Is it unlikely?

Is it futile?

Is not force a remedy, and at times the only remedy?

Could any remedy have been devised on the whole so conclusive and complete as that used by
the Balkan peoples?

Have not the Balkan peoples redeemed War from the charges too readily brought against it as
simply an instrument of barbarism?

Have questions of profit and loss, economic considerations, anything whatever to do with this war?

Would the demonstration of its economic futility have kept the peace?

Are theories and logic of the slightest use, since force alone can determine the issue?

Is not war therefore inevitable, and must we not prepare diligently for it? I will answer all
these questions quite simply and directly without casuistry and logic-chopping, and honestly
desiring to avoid paradox and "cleverness." And these quite simple answers will not be in contradiction
with anything that I have written, nor will they invalidate any of the principles I have attempted
to explain.

And my answers may be summarised thus:--

(1) This war has justified both the Old Pacifism and the New. By universal admission events
have proved that the Pacifists who opposed the Crimean War were right and their opponents wrong.
Had public opinion given more consideration to those Pacifist principles, this country would
not have "backed the wrong horse," and this war, two wars which have preceded it, and many
of the abominations of which the Balkan peninsular has been the scene during the last 60 years
might have been avoided, and in any case Great Britain would not now carry upon her shoulders
the responsibility of having during half a century supported the Turk against the Christian
and of having tried uselessly to prevent what has now taken place--the break-up of the Turk's
rule in Europe.

(2) War is not impossible, and no responsible Pacifist ever said it was; it is not the likelihood
of war which is the illusion, but its benefits.

(3) It is likely or unlikely according as the parties to a dispute are guided by wisdom or folly.

(4) It is futile; and force is no remedy.

(5) Its futility is proven by the war waged daily by the Turks as conquerors, during the last
400 years. And because the Balkan peoples have chosen the less evil of two kinds of war, and
will use their victory to bring a system based on force and conquest to an end, we who do not
believe in force and conquest rejoice in their action, and believe it will achieve immense
benefits. But if instead of using their victory to eliminate force, they in their turn pin
their faith to it, continue to use it the one against the other, exploiting by its means the
populations they rule, and become not the organisers of social co-operation among the Balkan
populations, but merely, like the Turks, their conquerors and "owners," then they in their
turn will share the fate of the Turk.

(6) The fundamental causes of this war are economic in the narrower, as well as in the larger
sense of the term; in the first because conquest was the Turk's only trade--he desired to live
out of taxes wrung from a conquered people, to exploit them as a means of livelihood, and this
conception was at the bottom of most of Turkish misgovernment. And in the larger sense its
cause is economic because in the Balkans, remote geographically from the main drift of European
economic development, there has not grown up that interdependent social life, the innumerable
contacts which in the rest of Europe have done so much to attenuate primitive religious and
racial hatreds.

(7) A better understanding by the Turk of the real nature of civilised government, of the economic
futility of conquest of the fact that a means of livelihood (an economic system), based upon
having more force than someone else and using it ruthlessly against him, is an impossible form
of human relationship bound to break down, would have kept the peace.

(8) If European statecraft had not been animated by false conceptions, largely economic in
origin, based upon a belief in the necessary rivalry of states, the advantages of preponderant
force and conquest, the Western nations could have composed their quarrels and ended the abominations
of the Balkan peninsula long ago--even in the opinion of the Times. And it is our own false
statecraft--that of Great Britain--which has a large part of the responsibility for this failure
of European civilisation. It has caused us to sustain the Turk in Europe, to fight a great
and popular war with that aim, and led us into treaties which had they been kept, would have
obliged us to fight to-day on the side of the Turk against the Balkan States.

(9) If by "theories" and "logic" is meant the discussion of and interest in principles, the
ideas that govern human relationship, they are the only things that can prevent future wars,
just as they were the only things that brought religious wars to an end--a preponderant power
"imposing" peace playing no role therein. Just as it was false religious theories which made
the religious wars, so it is false political theories which make the political wars.

(10) War is only inevitable in the sense that other forms of error and passion--religious persecution
for instance--are inevitable; they cease with better understanding, as the attempt to impose
religious belief by force has ceased in Europe.

(11) We should not prepare for war; we should prepare to prevent war; and though that preparation
may include battleships and conscription, those elements will quite obviously make the tension
and danger greater unless there is also a better European opinion.

These summarised replies need a little expansion.

Had we thrashed out the question of war and peace as we must finally, it would hardly be necessary
to explain that the apparent paradox in Answer No. 4 (that war is futile, and that this war
will have immense benefits) is due to the inadequacy of our language, which compels us to use
the same word for two opposed purposes, not to any real contradiction of fact.

We called the condition of the Balkan peninsula "Peace" until the other day, merely because
the respective Ambassadors still happened to be resident in the capitals to which they were
accredited.

Let us see what "Peace" under Turkish rule really meant, and who is the real invader in this
war. Here is a very friendly and impartial witness--Sir Charles Elliot--who paints for us the
character of the Turk as an "administrator":--

     "The Turk in Europe has an overweening sense of his superiority,
     and remains a nation apart, mixing little with the conquered
     populations, whose customs and ideas he tolerates, but makes little
     effort to understand. The expression indeed, 'Turkey in Europe'
     means indeed no more than 'England in Asia,' if used as a
     designation for India.... The Turks have done little to assimilate
     the people whom they have conquered, and still less, been
     assimilated by them. In the larger part of the Turkish dominions,
     the Turks themselves are in a minority.... The Turks certainly
     resent the dismemberment of their Empire, but not in the sense in
     which the French resent the conquest of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany.
     They would never use the word 'Turkey' or even its oriental
     equivalent, 'The High Country' in ordinary conversation. They would
     never say that Syria and Greece are parts of Turkey which have been
     detached, but merely that they are tributaries which have become
     independent, provinces once occupied by Turks where there are no
     Turks now. As soon as a province passes under another Government,
     the Turks find it the most natural thing in the world to leave it
     and go somewhere else. In the same spirit the Turk talks quite
     pleasantly of leaving Constantinople some day, he will go over to
     Asia and found another capital. One can hardly imagine Englishmen
     speaking like that of London, but they might conceivably speak so
     of Calcutta.... The Turk is a conqueror and nothing else. The
     history of the Turk is a catalogue of battles. His contributions to
     art, literature, science and religion, are practically nil. Their
     desire has not been to instruct, to improve, hardly even to govern,
     but simply to conquer.... The Turk makes nothing at all; he takes
     whatever he can get, as plunder or pillage. He lives in the houses
     which he finds, or which he orders to be built for him. In
     unfavourable circumstances he is a marauder. In favourable, a
     Grand Seigneur who thinks it his right to enjoy with grace and
     dignity all that the world can hold, but who will not lower himself
     by engaging in art, literature, trade or manufacture. Why should
     he, when there are other people to do these things for him. Indeed,
     it may be said that he takes from others even his religion,
     clothes, language, customs; there is hardly anything which is
     Turkish and not borrowed. The religion is Arabic; the language half
     Arabic and Persian; the literature almost entirely imitative; the
     art Persian or Byzantine; the costumes, in the Upper Classes and
     Army mostly European. There is nothing characteristic in
     manufacture or commerce, except an aversion to such pursuits. In
     fact, all occupations, except agriculture and military service are
     distasteful to the true Osmanli. He is not much of a merchant. He
     may keep a stall in a bazaar, but his operations are rarely
     undertaken on a scale which merits the name of commerce or finance.
     It is strange to observe how, when trade becomes active in any
     seaport, or upon the railway lines, the Osmanli retires and
     disappears, while Greeks, Armenians and Levantines thrive in his
     place. Neither does he much affect law, medicine or the learned
     professions. Such callings are followed by Moslims but they are apt
     to be of non-Turkish race. But though he does none of these things
     ... the Turk is a soldier. The moment a sword or rifle is put into
     his hands, he instinctively knows how to use it with effect, and
     feels at home in the ranks or on a horse. The Turkish Army is not
     so much a profession or an institution necessitated by the fears
     and aims of the Government as the quite normal state of the Turkish
     nation.... Every Turk is a born soldier, and adopts other pursuits
     chiefly because times are bad. When there is a question of
     fighting, if only in a riot, the stolid peasant wakes up and shows
     surprising power of finding organisation and expedients, and alas!
     a surprising ferocity. The ordinary Turk is an honest and
     good-humoured soul, kind to children and animals, and very patient;
     but when the fighting spirit comes on him, he becomes like the
     terrible warriors of the Huns or Henghis Khan, and slays, burns and
     ravages without mercy or discrimination."[1]

Such is the verdict of an instructed, travelled and observant English author and diplomatist,
who lived among these people for many years, and who learned to like them, who studied them
and their history. It does not differ, of course, appreciably, from what practically every
student of the Turk has discovered: the Turk is the typical conqueror. As a nation, he has
lived by the sword, and he is dying by the sword, because the sword, the mere exercise of force
by one man or group of men upon another, conquest in other words, is an impossible form of
human relationship.

And in order to maintain this evil form of relationship--its evil and futility is the whole
basis of the principles I have attempted to illustrate--he has not even observed the rough
chivalry of the brigand. The brigand, though he might knock men on the head, will refrain from
having his force take the form of butchering women and disembowelling children. Not so the
Turk. His attempt at Government will take the form of the obscene torture of children, of a
bestial ferocity which is not a matter of dispute or exaggeration, but a thing to which scores,
hundreds, thousands even of credible European, witnesses have testified. "The finest gentleman,
sir, that ever butchered a woman or burned a village," is the phrase that Punch most justly
puts into the mouth of the defender of our traditional Turcophil policy.

And this condition is "Peace," and the act which would put a stop to it is "War." It is the
inexactitude and inadequacy of our language which creates much of the confusion of thought
in this matter; we have the same term for action destined to achieve a given end and for a
counter-action destined to prevent it.

Yet we manage, in other than the international field, in civil matters, to make the thing clear
enough.

Once an American town was set light to by incendiaries, and was threatened with destruction.
In order to save at least a part of it, the authorities deliberately burned down a block of
buildings in the pathway of the fire. Would those incendiaries be entitled to say that the
town authorities were incendiaries also, and "believed in setting light to towns?" Yet this
is precisely the point of view of those who tax Pacifists with approving war because they approve
the measure aimed at bringing it to an end.

Put it another way. You do not believe that force should determine the transfer of property
or conformity to a creed, and I say to you: "Hand me your purse and conform to my creed or
I kill you." You say: "Because I do not believe that force should settle these matters, I shall
try and prevent it settling them, and therefore if you attack I shall resist; if I did not
I should be allowing force to settle them." I attack; you resist and disarm me and say: "My
force having neutralised yours, and the equilibrium being now established, I will hear any
reasons you may have to urge for my paying you money; or any argument in favour of your creed.
Reason, understanding, adjustment shall settle it." You would be a Pacifist. Or, if you deem
that that word connotes non-resistance, though to the immense bulk of Pacifists it does not,
you would be an anti-Bellicist to use a dreadful word coined by M. Emile Faguet in the discussion
of this matter. If, however, you said: "Having disarmed you and established the equilibrium,
I shall now upset it in my favour by taking your weapon and using it against you unless you
hand me your purse and subscribe to my creed. I do this because force alone can determine issues,
and because it is a law of life that the strong should eat up the weak." You would then be
a Bellicist.

In the same way, when we prevent the brigand from carrying on his trade--taking wealth by force--it
is not because we believe in force as a means of livelihood, but precisely because we do not.
And if, in preventing the brigand from knocking out brains, we are compelled to knock out his
brains, is it because we believe in knocking out people's brains? Or would we urge that to
do so is the way to carry on a trade, or a nation, or a government, or make it the basis of
human relationship?

In every civilised country, the basis of the relationship on which the community rests is this:
no individual is allowed to settle his differences with another by force. But does this mean
that if one threatens to take my purse, I am not allowed to use force to prevent it? That if
he threatens to kill me, I am not to defend myself, because "the individual citizens are not
allowed to settle their differences by force?" It is because of that, because the act of self-defence
is an attempt to prevent the settlement of a difference by force, that the law justifies it.[2]

But the law would not justify me, if having disarmed my opponent, having neutralised his force
by my own, and re-established the social equilibrium, I immediately proceeded to upset it,
by asking him for his purse on pain of murder. I should then be settling the matter by force--I
should then have ceased to be a Pacifist, and have become a Bellicist.

For that is the difference between the two conceptions: the Bellicist says: "Force alone can
settle these matters; it is the final appeal; therefore fight it out. Let the best man win.
When you have preponderant strength, impose your view; force the other man to your will; not
because it is right, but because you are able to do so." It is the "excellent policy" which
Lord Roberts attributes to Germany and approves.

We anti-Bellicists take an exactly contrary view. We say: "To fight it out settles nothing,
since it is not a question of who is stronger, but of whose view is best, and as that is not
always easy to establish, it is of the utmost importance in the interest of all parties, in
the long run, to keep force out of it."

The former is the policy of the Turks. They have been obsessed with the idea that if only they
had enough of physical force, ruthlessly exercised, they could solve the whole question of
government, of existence for that matter, without troubling about social adjustment, understanding,
equity, law, commerce; "blood and iron" were all that was needed. The success of that policy
can now be judged.

And whether good or evil comes of the present war will depend upon whether the Balkan States
are on the whole guided by the Bellicist principle or the opposed one. If having now momentarily
eliminated force as between themselves, they re-introduce it, if the strongest, presumably
Bulgaria, adopts Lord Roberts' "excellent policy" of striking because she has the preponderant
force, enters upon a career of conquest of other members of the Balkan League, and the populations
of the conquered territories, using them for exploitation by military force--why then there
will be no settlement and this war will have accomplished nothing save futile waste and slaughter.
For they will have taken under a new flag, the pathway of the Turk to savagery, degeneration,
death.

But if on the other hand they are guided more by the Pacifist principle, if they believe that
co-operation between States is better than conflict between them, if they believe that the
common interest of all in good Government is greater than the special interest of any one in
conquest, that the understanding of human relationships, the capacity for the organisation
of society are the means by which men progress, and not the imposition of force by one man
or group upon another, why, they will have taken the pathway to better civilisation. But then
they will have disregarded Lord Roberts' advice.

And this distinction between the two systems, far from being a matter of abstract theory of
metaphysics or logic chopping, is just the difference which distinguishes the Briton from the
Turk, which distinguishes Britain from Turkey. The Turk has just as much physical vigour as
the Briton, is just as virile, manly and military. The Turk has the same raw materials of Nature,
soil and water. There is no difference in the capacity for the exercise of physical force--or
if there is, the difference is in favour of the Turk. The real difference is a difference of
ideas, of mind and outlook on the part of the individuals composing the respective societies;
the Turk has one general conception of human society and the code and principles upon which
it is founded, mainly a militarist one; and the Englishman has another, mainly a Pacifist one.
And whether the European society as a whole is to drift towards the Turkish ideal or towards
the English ideal will depend upon whether it is animated mainly by the Pacifist or mainly
by the Bellicist doctrine; if the former, it will stagger blindly like the Turk along the path
to barbarism; if the latter, it will take a better road.

[Footnote 1: "Turkey in Europe," pp. 88-9 and 91-2.

It is significant, by the way, that the "born soldier" has now been crushed by a non-military
race whom he has always despised as having no military tradition. Capt. F.W. von Herbert ("Bye
Paths in the Balkans") wrote (some years before the present war): "The Bulgars as Christian
subjects of Turkey exempt from military service, have tilled the ground under stagnant and
enfeebling peace conditions, and the profession of arms is new to them."

In dealing with answer No. 4 I have shown how the inadequacy of our language leads us so much
astray in our notions of the real role of force in human relationships. But there is a curious
phenomenon of thought which explains perhaps still more how misconceptions grow up on this
subject, and that is the habit of thinking of a war which, of course, must include two parties,
in terms, solely of one party at a time. Thus one critic[3] is quite sure that because the
Balkan peoples "recked nothing of financial disaster," economic considerations have had nothing
to do with their war--a conclusion which seems to be arrived at by the process of judgment
just indicated: to find the cause of condition produced by two parties you shall rigorously
ignore one. For there is a great deal of internal evidence for believing that the writer of
the article in question would admit very readily that the efforts of the Turk to wring taxes
out of the conquered peoples--not in return for a civilized administration but simply as the
means of livelihood, of turning conquest into a trade--had a very great deal to do in explaining
the Turk's presence there at all and the Christian's desire to get rid of him; while the same
article specifically states that the mutual jealousies of the great powers, based on a desire
to "grab" (an economic motive), had a great deal to do with preventing a peaceful settlement
of the difficulties. Yet "economics" have nothing to do with it!

I have attempted elsewhere to make these two points--that it is on the one hand the false economics
of the Turks, and on the other hand the false economics of the powers of Europe, colouring
the policy and Statecraft of both, which have played an enormous, in all human probability,
a determining role in the immediate provoking cause of the war; and, of course, a further and
more remote cause of the whole difficulty is the fact that the Balkan peoples never having
been subjected to the discipline of that complex social life which arises from trade and commerce
have never grown out of (or to a less degree) those primitive racial and religious hostilities
which at one time in Europe as a whole provoked conflicts like that now raging in the Balkans.
The following article which appeared[4] at the outbreak of the war may summarise some of the
points with which we have been dealing.

Polite and good-natured people think it rude to say "Balkans" if a Pacifist be present. Yet
I never understood why, and I understand now less than ever. It carries the implication that
because war has broken out that fact disposes of all objection to it. The armies are at grips,
therefore peace is a mistake. Passion reigns on the Balkans, therefore passion is preferable
to reason.

I suppose cannibalism and infanticide, polygamy, judicial torture, religious persecution, witchcraft,
during all the years we did these "inevitable" things, were defended in the same way, and those
who resented all criticism of them pointed in triumph to the cannibal feast, the dead child,
the maimed witness, the slain heretic, or the burned witch. But the fact did not prove the
wisdom of those habits, still less their inevitability; for we have them no more.

We are all agreed as to the fundamental cause of the Balkan trouble: the hate born of religious,
racial, national, and language differences; the attempt of an alien conqueror to live parasitically
upon the conquered, and the desire of conqueror and conquered alike to satisfy in massacre
and bloodshed the rancour of fanaticism and hatred.

Well, in these islands, not so very long ago, those things were causes of bloodshed; indeed,
they were a common feature of European life. But if they are inevitable in human relationship,
how comes it that Adana is no longer duplicated by St. Bartholomew; the Bulgarian bands by
the vendetta of the Highlander and the Lowlander; the struggle of the Slav and Turk, Serb and
Bulgar, by that of Scots and English, and English and Welsh? The fanaticism of the Moslem to-day
is no intenser than that of Catholic and heretic in Rome, Madrid, Paris, and Geneva at a time
which is only separated from us by the lives of three or four elderly men. The heretic or infidel
was then in Europe also a thing unclean and horrifying, exciting in the mind of the orthodox
a sincere and honest hatred and a (very largely satisfied) desire to kill. The Catholic of
the 16th century was apt to tell you that he could not sit at table with a heretic because
the latter carried with him a distinctive and overpoweringly repulsive odour. If you would
measure the distance Europe has travelled, think what this means: all the nations of Christendom
united in a war lasting 200 years for the capture of the Holy Sepulchre; and yet, when in our
day the representatives, seated round a table, could have had it for the asking, they did not
deem it worth the asking, so little of the ancient passion was there left. The very nature
of man seemed to be transformed. For, wonderful though it be that orthodox should cease killing
heretic, infinitely more wonderful still is it that he should cease wanting to kill him.

And just as most of us are certain that the underlying causes of this conflict are "inevitable"
and "inherent in unchanging human nature," so are we certain that so unhuman a thing as economics
can have no bearing on it.

Well, I will suggest that the transformation of the heretic-hating and heretic-killing European
is due mainly to economic forces; that it is because the drift of those forces has in such
large part left the Balkans, where until yesterday the people lived the life not much different
from that which they lived in the time of Abraham, to one side that war is now raging; that
economic factors of a more immediate kind form a large part of the provoking cause of that
war; and that a better understanding mainly of certain economic facts of their international
relationship on the part of the great nations of Europe is essential before much progress towards
solution can be made.

But then, by "economics," of course, I mean not a merchant's profit or a moneylender's interest,
but the method by which men earn their bread, which must also mean the kind of life they lead.

We generally think of the primitive life of man--that of the herdsman or the tent liver--as
something idyllic. The picture is as far as possible from the truth. Those into whose lives
economics do not enter, or enter very little--that is to say, those who, like the Congo cannibal,
or the Red Indian, or the Bedouin, do not cultivate, or divide their labour, or trade, or save,
or look to the future, have shed little of the primitive passions of other animals of prey,
the tigers and the wolves, who have no economics at all, and have no need to check an impulse
or a hate. But industry, even of the more primitive kind, means that men must divide their
labour, which means that they must put some sort of reliance upon one another; the thing of
prey becomes a partner, and the attitude towards it changes. And as this life becomes more
complex, as the daily needs and desires push men to trade and barter, that means building up
a social organisation, rules and codes, and courts to enforce them; as the interdependence
widens and deepens it necessarily means disregarding certain hostilities. If the neighbouring
tribe wants to trade with you they must not kill you; if you want the services of the heretic
you must not kill him, and you must keep your obligation towards him, and mutual good faith
is death to long-sustained hatreds.

You cannot separate the moral from the social and economic development of a people, and the
great service of a complex social and industrial organisation, which is built up by the desire
of men for better material conditions, is not that it "pays" but that it makes a more interdependent
human society, and that it leads men to recognise what is the best relationship between them.
And the fact of recognising that some act of aggression is causing stocks to fall is not important
because it may save Oppenheim's or Solomon's money but because it is a demonstration that we
are dependent upon some community on the other side of the world, that their damage is our
damage, and that we have an interest in preventing it. It teaches us, as only some such simple
and mechanical means can teach, the lesson of human fellowship.

And it is by such means as this that Western Europe has in some measure, within its respective
political frontiers, learnt that lesson. Each has learnt, within the confines of the nation
at least, that wealth is made by work, not robbery; that, indeed, general robbery is fatal
to prosperity; that government consists not merely in having the power of the sword but in
organising society--in "knowing how"; which means the development of ideas; in maintaining
courts; in making it possible to run railways, post offices, and all the contrivances of a
complex society.

Now rulers did not create these things; it was the daily activities of the people, born of
their desires and made possible by the circumstances in which they lived, by the trading and
the mining and the shipping which they carried on, that made them. But the Balkans have been
geographically outside the influence of European industrial and commercial life. The Turk has
hardly felt it at all. He has learnt none of the social and moral lessons which interdependence
and improved communications have taught the Western European, and it is because he has not
learnt these lessons, because he is a soldier and a conqueror, to an extent and completeness
that other nations of Europe lost a generation or two since, that the Balkanese are fighting
and that war is raging.

But not merely in this larger sense, but in the more immediate, narrower sense, are the fundamental
causes of this war economic.

This war arises, as the past wars against the Turkish conqueror have arisen, by the desire
of the Christian peoples on whom he lives to shake off this burden. "To live upon their subjects
is the Turks' only means of livelihood," says one authority. The Turk is an economic parasite,
and the economic organism must end of rejecting him.

For the management of society, simple and primitive even as that of the Balkan mountains, needs
some effort and work and capacity for administration, or even rudimentary economic life cannot
be carried on. And the Turkish system, founded on the sword and nothing else ("the finest soldier
in Europe"), cannot give that small modicum, of energy or administrative capacity. The one
thing he knows is brute force; but it is not by the strength of his muscles that an engineer
runs a machine, but by knowing how. The Turk cannot build a road, or make a bridge, or administer
a post office, or found a court of law. And these things are necessary. And he will not let
them be done by the Christian, who, because he did not belong to the conquering class, has
had to work, and has consequently become the class which possesses whatever capacity for work
and administration the country can show, because to do so would be to threaten the Turk's only
trade. If the Turk granted the Christians equal political rights they would inevitably "run
the country," And yet the Turk himself cannot do it; and he will not let others do it, because
to do so would be to threaten his supremacy.

And the more the use of force fails, the more, of course, does he resort to it, and that is
why many of us who do not believe in force, and desire to see it disappear in the relationship
not merely of religious but of political groups, might conceivably welcome this war of the
Balkan Christians, in so far as it is an attempt to resist the use of force in those relationships.
Of course, I do not try to estimate the "balance of criminality." Right is not all on one side--it
never is. But the broad issue is clear and plain. And only those concerned with the name rather
than the thing, with nominal and verbal consistency rather than realities, will see anything
paradoxical or contradictory in Pacifist approval of Christian resistance to the use of Turkish
force.

It is the one fact which stands out incontrovertibly from the whole weary muddle. It is quite
clear that the inability to act in common arises from the fact that in the international sphere
the European is still dominated by illusions which he has dropped when he deals with home politics.
The political faith of the Turk, which he would never think of applying at home as between
the individuals of his nation, he applies pure and unalloyed when he comes to deal with foreigners
as nations. The economic conception--using the term in that wider sense which I have indicated
earlier in this article--which guides his individual conduct is the antithesis of that which
guides his national conduct.

While the Christian does not believe in robbery inside the frontier, he does without; while
within the State he realises that greater advantage lies on the side of each observing the
general code, so that civilised society can exist, instead of on the side of having society
go to pieces by each disregarding it; while within the State he realises that government is
a matter of administration, not the seizure of property; that one town does not add to its
wealth by "capturing" another, that indeed one community cannot "own" another--while, I say,
he believes all these things in his daily life at home, he disregards them all when he comes
to the field of international relationship, la haute politique. To annex some province by a
cynical breach of treaty obligation (Austria in Bosnia, Italy in Tripoli) is regarded as better
politics than to act loyally with the community of nations to enforce their common interest
in order and good government. In fact, we do not believe that there can be a community of nations,
because, in fact, we do not believe that their interests are common, but rival; like the Turk,
we believe that if you do not exercise force upon your "rival" he will exercise it upon you;
that nations live upon one another, not by co-operation with one another--and it is for this
reason presumably that you must "own" as much of your neighbours' as possible. It is the Turkish
conception from beginning to end.

And it is because these false beliefs prevent the nations of Christendom acting loyally the
one to the other, because each is playing for its own hand, that the Turk, with hint of some
sordid bribe, has been able to play off each against the other.

This is the crux of the matter. When Europe can honestly act in common on behalf of common
interests some solution can be found. And the capacity of Europe to act together will not be
found so long as the accepted doctrines of European statecraft remain unchanged, so long as
they are dominated by existing illusions.

       *       *       *       *       *

In a paper read before the British Association of this year, I attempted to show in more general
terms this relation between economic impulse and ideal motive. The following are relevant passages:--

A nation, a people, we are given to understand, have higher motives than money, or "self-interest."
What do we mean when we speak of the money of a nation, or the self-interest of a community?
We mean--and in such a discussion as this can mean nothing else--better conditions for the
great mass of the people, the fullest possible lives, the abolition or attenuation of poverty
and of narrow circumstances, that the millions shall be better housed and clothed and fed,
capable of making provision for sickness and old age, with lives prolonged and cheered--and
not merely this, but also that they shall be better educated, with character disciplined by
steady labour and a better use of leisure, a general social atmosphere which shall make possible
family affection, individual dignity and courtesy and the graces of life, not alone among the
few, but among the many.

Now, do these things constitute as a national policy an inspiring aim or not? Yet they are,
speaking in terms of communities, pure self-interest--all bound up with economic problems,
with money. Does Admiral Mahan mean us to take him at his word when he would attach to such
efforts the same discredit that one implies in talking of a mercenary individual? Would he
have us believe that the typical great movements of our times--Socialism, Trades Unionism,
Syndicalism, Insurance Bills, Land Laws, Old Age Pensions, Charity Organisation, Improved Education--bound
up as they all are with economic problems--are not the sort of objects which more and more
are absorbing the best activities of Christendom?

I have attempted to show that the activities which lie outside the range of these things--the
religious wars, movements like those which promoted the Crusades, or the sort of tradition
which we associate with the duel (which has, in fact, disappeared from Anglo-Saxon society)--do
not and cannot any longer form part of the impulse creating the long-sustained conflicts between
large groups which a European war implies, partly because such allied moral differences as
now exist do not in any way coincide with the political divisions, but intersect them, and
partly because in the changing character of men's ideals there is a distinct narrowing of the
gulf which is supposed to separate ideal and material aims. Early ideals, whether in the field
of politics or religion, are generally dissociated from any aim of general well-being. In early
politics ideals are concerned simply with personal allegiance to some dynastic chief, a feudal
lord or a monarch. The well-being of a community does not enter into the matter at all: it
is the personal allegiance which matters. Later the chief must embody in his person that well-being,
or he does not achieve the allegiance of a community of any enlightenment; later, the well-being
of the community becomes the end in itself without being embodied in the person of an hereditary
chief, so that the community realise that their efforts, instead of being directed to the protection
of the personal interests of some chief, are as a matter of fact directed to the protection
of their own interests, and their altruism has become self-interest, since self-sacrifice of
a community for the sake of the community is a contradiction in terms. In the religious sphere
a like development has been shown. Early religious ideals have no relation to the material
betterment of mankind. The early Christian thought it meritorious to live a sterile life at
the top of a pillar, eaten by vermin, as the Hindoo saint to-day thinks it meritorious to live
an equally sterile life upon a bed of spikes. But as the early Christian ideal progressed,
sacrifices having no end connected with the betterment of mankind lost their appeal. The Christian
saint who would allow the nails of his fingers to grow through the palms of his clasped hands
would excite, not our admiration, but our revolt. More and more is religious effort being subjected
to this test: does it make for the improvement of society? If not, it stands condemned. Political
ideals will inevitably follow a like development, and will be more and more subjected to a
like test.

I am aware that very often at present they are not so subjected. Dominated as our political
thought is by Roman and feudal imagery--hypnotised by symbols and analogies which the necessary
development of organised society has rendered obsolete--the ideals even of democracies are
still often pure abstractions, divorced from any aim calculated to advance the moral or material
betterment of mankind. The craze for sheer size of territory, simple extent of administrative
area, is still deemed a thing deserving immense, incalculable sacrifices.

       *       *       *       *       *

And yet even these ideals, firmly set as they are in our language and tradition, are rapidly
yielding to the necessary force of events. A generation ago it would have been inconceivable
that a people or a monarch should calmly see part of its country secede and establish itself
as a separate political entity without attempting to prevent it by force of arms. Yet this
is what happened but a year or two since in the Scandinavian peninsula. For forty years Germany
has added to her own difficulties and those of the European situation for the purpose of including
Alsace and Lorraine in its Federation, but even there, obeying the tendency which is world-wide,
an attempt has been made at the creation of a constitutional and autonomous government. The
history of the British Empire for fifty years has been a process of undoing the work of conquest.
Colonies are now neither colonies nor possessions. They are independent States. Great Britain,
which for centuries has made such sacrifices to retain Ireland, is now making great sacrifices
in order to make her secession workable. To all political arrangements, to all political ideals,
the final test will be applied: Does it or does it not make for the widest interests of the
mass of the people involved?... And I would ask those who think that war must be a permanent
element in the settlement of the moral differences of men to think for one moment of the factors
which stood in the way of the abandonment of the use of force by governments, and by one religious
group against another in the matter of religious belief. On the one hand you had authority
with all the prestige of historical right and the possession of physical power in its most
imposing form, the means of education still in their hands; government authority extending
to all sorts of details of life to which it no longer extends; immense vested interests outside
government; and finally the case for the imposition of dogma by authority a strong one, and
still supported by popular passion: and on the other hand, you had as yet poor and feeble instruments
of mere opinion; the printed book still a rarity; the Press non-existent, communication between
men still rudimentary, worse even than it had been two thousand years previously. And yet,
despite these immense handicaps upon the growth of opinion and intellectual ferment as against
physical force, it was impossible for a new idea to find life in Geneva or Rome or Edinburgh
or London without quickly crossing and affecting all the other centres, and not merely making
headway against entrenched authority, but so quickly breaking up the religious homogeneity
of states, that not only were governments obliged to abandon the use of force in religious
matters as against their subjects, but religious wars between nations became impossible for
the double reason that a nation no longer expressed a single religious belief (you had the
anomaly of a Protestant Sweden fighting in alliance with a Catholic France), and that the power
of opinion had become stronger than the power of physical force--because, in other words, the
limits of military force were more and more receding.

But if the use of force was so ineffective against the spiritual possessions of man when the
arms to be used in their defence were so poor and rudimentary, how could a government hope
to crush out by force to-day such things as a nation's language, law, literature, morals, ideals,
when it possesses such means of defence as are provided in security of tenure of material possessions,
a cheap literature, a popular Press, a cheap and secret postal system, and all the other means
of rapid and perfected inter-communication?

You will notice that I have spoken throughout not of the defence of a national ideal by arms,
but of its attack; if you have to defend your ideal it is because someone attacks it, and without
attack your defence would not be called for.

If you are compelled to prevent someone using force as against your nationality, it is because
he believes that by the use of that force he can destroy or change it. If he thought that the
use of force would be ineffective to that end he would not employ it.

I have attempted to show elsewhere that the abandonment of war for material ends depends upon
a general realisation of its futility for accomplishing those ends. In like manner does the
abandonment of war for moral or ideal ends depend upon the general realisation of the growing
futility of such means for those ends also--and for the growing futility of those ends if they
could be accomplished.

We are sometimes told that it is the spirit of nationality--the desire to be of your place
and locality--that makes war. That is not so. It is the desire of other men that you shall
not be of your place and locality, of your habits and traditions, but of theirs. Not the desire
of nationality, but the desire to destroy nationality is what makes the wars of nationality.
If the Germans did not think that the retention of Polish or Alsatian nationality might hamper
them in the art of war, hamper them in the imposition of force on some other groups, there
would be no attempt to crush out this special possession of the Poles and Alsatians. It is
the belief in force and a preference for settling things by force instead of by agreement that
threatens or destroys nationality. And I have given an indication of the fact that it is not
merely war, but the preparation for war, implying as it does great homogeneity in states and
centralised bureaucratic control, which is to-day the great enemy of nationality. Before this
tendency to centralisation which military necessity sets up much that gives colour and charm
to European life is disappearing. And yet we are told that it is the Pacifists who are the
enemy of nationality, and we are led to believe that in some way the war system in Europe stands
for the preservation of nationality!

An English political writer remarked, on it becoming evident that the Christian States were
driving back the Turks: "This is a staggering blow to all the Turks--those of England and Prussia
as well as those of Turkey."

But, of course, the British and Prussian Turks will never see it--like the Bourbons, they learn
not. Here is a typically military system, the work of "born fighters" which has gone down in
welter before the assaults of much less military States, the chief of which, indeed, has grown
up in what Captain von Herbert has called, with some contempt, "stagnant and enfeebling peace
conditions," formed by the people whom the Turks regarded as quite unfit to be made into warriors;
whom they regarded much as some Europeans regard the Jews. It is the Christian populations
of the Balkans who were the traders and workers--those brought most under economic influences;
it was the Turks who escaped those influences. A few years since, I wrote: "If the conqueror
profits much by his conquest, as the Romans in one sense did, it is the conqueror who is threatened
by the enervating effect of the soft and luxurious life; while it is the conquered who are
forced to labour for the conqueror, and who learn in consequence those qualities of steady
industry which are certainly a better moral training than living upon the fruits of others,
upon labour extorted at the sword's point. It is the conqueror who becomes effete, and it is
the conquered who learn discipline and the qualities making for a well-ordered State."

Could we ask a better illustration than the history of the Turk and his Christian victims?
I exemplified the matter thus: "If during long periods a nation gives itself up to war, trade
languishes, the population loses the habit of steady industry, government and administration
become corrupt, abuses escape punishment, and the real sources of a people's strength and expansion
dwindle. What has caused the relative failure and decline of Spanish, Portuguese, and French
expansion in Asia and the New World, and the relative success of English expansion therein?
Was it the mere hazards of war which gave to Great Britain the domination of India and half
of the New World? That is surely a superficial reading of history. It was, rather, that the
methods and processes of Spain, Portugal, and France were military, while those of the Anglo-Saxon
world were commercial and peaceful. Is it not a commonplace that in India, quite as much as
in the New World, the trader and the settler drove out the soldier and the conqueror? The difference
between the two methods was that one was a process of conquest, and the other of colonizing,
or non-military administration for commercial purposes. The one embodied the sordid Cobdenite
idea, which so excites the scorn of the militarists, and the other the lofty military ideal.
The one was parasitism; the other co-operation....

"How may we sum up the whole case, keeping in mind every empire that ever existed--the Assyrian,
the Babylonian, the Mede and Persian, the Macedonian, the Roman, the Frank, the Saxon, the
Spanish, the Portuguese, the Bourbon, the Napoleonic? In all and every one of them we may see
the same process, which is this: If it remains military it decays; if it prospers and takes
its share of the work of the world it ceases to be military. There is no other reading of history."

But despite these very plain lessons, there are many amongst us who regard physical conflict
as the ideal form of human relationship; "killing and being killed" as the best way to determine
the settlement of differences, and a society which drifts from these ideals as on the high
road to degeneration, and who deem those who set before themselves the ideal of abolishing
or attenuating poverty for the mass of men, "low and sordid."

Thus Mr. Cecil Chesterton[5]:

     In essence Mr. Angell's query is: "Should usurers go to war?"

     I may say, in passing, that I am not clear that even on the
     question thus raised Mr. Angell makes out his case. His case,
     broadly stated, is that the net of "Finance"--or, to put it
     plainer, Cosmopolitan Usury--which is at present spread over Europe
     would be disastrously torn by any considerable war; and that in
     consequence it is to the interest of the usurers to preserve peace.
     But here, it seems to me, we must make a clear differentiation. It
     may easily be to the interest of a particular usurer, or group of
     usurers, to provoke war; that very financial crisis which Mr.
     Angell anticipates may quite probably be a source of profit to
     them. That it would not be to the interest of a nation of usurers
     to fight is very probable. That such a nation would not fight, or,
     if it did, would be exceedingly badly beaten, is certain. But that
     only serves to raise the further question of whether it is to the
     ultimate advantage of a nation to repose upon usury; and whether
     the breaking of the net of usury which at present unquestionably
     holds Europe in captivity would not be for the advantage, as it
     would clearly be for the honour, of our race.... The sword is too
     sacred a thing to be prostituted to such dirty purposes. But
     whether he succeeds or fails in this attempt, it will make no
     difference to the mass of plain men who, when they fight and risk
     their lives, do not do so in the expectation of obtaining a certain
     interest on their capital, but for quite other reasons.

     Mr. Angell's latest appeal comes, I think, at an unfortunate
     moment. It is not merely that the Balkan States have refused to be
     convinced by Mr. Angell as to their chances of commercial profit
     from the war. It is that if Mr. Angell had succeeded to the fullest
     extent in convincing them that there was not a quarter per cent. to
     be made out of the war, nay, that--horrible thought!--they would
     actually be poorer at the end of the war than at the beginning,
     they would have gone to war all the same.

     Since Mr. Angell's argument clearly applies as much or more to
     civil as to international conflicts, I may perhaps be allowed to
     turn to civil conflicts to make clear my meaning. In this country
     during the last three centuries one solid thing has been done. The
     power of Parliament was pitted in battle against the power of the
     Crown, and won. As a result, for good or evil, Parliament really is
     stronger than the Crown to-day. The power of the mass of the
     people to control Parliament has been given as far as mere
     legislation could give it. We all know that it is a sham. And if
     you ask what it is that makes the difference of reality between the
     two cases, it is this: that men killed and were killed for the one
     thing and not for the other.

     I have no space to develop all that I should like to say about the
     indirect effects of war. All I will say is this, that men do judge,
     and always will judge, things by the ultimate test of how they
     fight. The German victory of forty years ago has produced not only
     an astonishing expansion, industrial as well as political of
     Germany, but has (most disastrously, as I think) infected Europe
     with German ideas, especially with the idea that you make a nation
     strong by making its people behave like cattle. God send that I may
     live to see the day when victorious armies from Gaul shall shatter
     this illusion, burn up Prussianism with all its Police Regulations,
     Insurance Acts, Poll Taxes, and insults to the poor, and reassert
     the Republic. It will never be done in any other way.

     If arbitration is ever to take the place of war, it must be backed
     by a corresponding array of physical force. Now the question
     immediately arises: Are we prepared to arm any International
     Tribunal with any such powers? Personally, I am not.... Turn back
     some fifty years to the great struggle for the emancipation of
     Italy. Suppose that a Hague Tribunal had then been in existence,
     armed with coercive powers. The dispute between Austria and
     Sardinia must have been referred to that tribunal. That tribunal
     must have been guided by existing treaties. The Treaty of Vienna
     was perhaps the most authoritative ever entered into by European
     Powers. By that treaty, Venice and Lombardy were unquestionably
     assigned to Austria. A just tribunal administering international
     law must have decided in favour of Austria, and have used the
     whole armed force of Europe to coerce Italy into submission. Are
     those Pacifists, who try at the same time to be Democrats, prepared
     to acquiesce in such a conclusion? Personally, I am not.

I replied as follows:

     Mr. Cecil Chesterton says that the question which I have raised is
     this: "Should usurers go to war?"

     That, of course, is not true. I have never, even by implication,
     put such a problem, and there is nothing in the article which he
     criticises, nor in any other statement of my own, that justifies
     it. What I have asked is whether peoples should go to war.

     I should have thought it was pretty obvious that, whatever happens,
     usurers do not go to war: the peoples go to war, and the peoples
     pay, and the whole question is whether they should go on making war
     and paying for it. Mr. Chesterton says that if they are wise they
     will; I say that if they are wise they will not.

     I have attempted to show that the prosperity of peoples--by which,
     of course, one means the diminution of poverty, better houses, soap
     and water, healthy children, lives prolonged, conditions
     sufficiently good to ensure leisure and family affection, fuller
     and completer lives generally--is not secured by fighting one
     another, but by co-operation and labour, by a better organisation
     of society, by improved human relationship, which, of course, can
     only come of better understanding of the conditions of that
     relationship, which better understanding means discussion,
     adjustment, a desire and capacity to see the point of view of the
     other man--of all of which war and its philosophy is the negation.

     To all of this Mr. Chesterton replies: "That only concerns the Jews
     and the moneylenders." Again, this is not true. It concerns all of
     us, like all problems of our struggle with Nature. It is in part at
     least an economic problem, and that part of it is best stated in
     the more exact and precise terms that I have employed to deal with
     it--the term's of the market-place. But to imply that the
     conditions that there obtain are the affair merely of bankers and
     financiers, to imply that these things do not touch the lives of
     the mass, is simply to talk a nonsense the meaninglessness of which
     only escapes some of us because in these matters we happen to be
     very ignorant. It is not mainly usurers who suffer from bad finance
     and bad economics (one may suggest that they are not quite so
     simple); it is mainly the people as a whole.

     Mr. Chesterton says that we should break this "net of usury" in
     which the peoples are enmeshed. I agree heartily; but that net has
     been woven mainly by war (and that diversion of energy and
     attention from social management which war involves), and is, so
     far as the debts of the European States are concerned (so large an
     element of usury), almost solely the outcome of war. And if the
     peoples go on piling up debt, as they must if they are to go on
     piling up armaments (as Mr. Chesterton wants them to), giving the
     best of their attention and emotion to sheer physical conflict,
     instead of to organisation and understanding, they will merely
     weave that web of debt and usury still closer; it will load us more
     heavily and strangle us to a still greater extent. If usury is the
     enemy, the remedy is to fight usury. Mr. Chesterton says the remedy
     is for its victims to fight one another.

     And you will not fight usury by hanging Rothschilds, for usury is
     worst where that sort of thing is resorted to. Widespread debt is
     the outcome of bad management and incompetence, economic or social,
     and only better management will remedy it. Mr. Chesterton is sure
     that better management is only arrived at by "killing and being
     killed." He really does urge this method even in civil matters. (He
     tells us that the power of Parliament over the Crown is real, and
     that of the people over Parliament a sham, "because men killed and
     were killed for the one, and not for the other.") It is the method
     of Spanish America where it is applied more frankly and logically,
     and where still, in many places, elections are a military affair,
     the questions at issue being settled by killing and being killed,
     instead of by the cowardly, pacifist methods current in Europe. The
     result gives us the really military civilisations of Venezuela,
     Colombia, Nicaragua, and Paraguay. And, although the English system
     may have many defects--I think it has--those defects exist in a
     still greater degree where force "settles" the matters in dispute,
     where the bullet replaces the ballot, and where bayonets are
     resorted to instead of brains. For Devonshire is better than
     Nicaragua. Really it is. And it would get us out of none of our
     troubles for one group to impose its views simply by preponderant
     physical force, for Mr. Asquith, for instance, in the true Castro
     or Zuyala manner, to announce that henceforth all critics of the
     Insurance Act are to be shot, and that the present Cabinet will
     hold office as long as it can depend upon the support of the Army.
     For, even if the country rose in rebellion, and fought it out and
     won, the successful party would (if they also believed in force) do
     exactly the same thing to their opponents; and so it would go on
     never-endingly (as it has gone on during weary centuries throughout
     the larger part of South America), until the two parties came once
     more to their senses, and agreed not to use force when they
     happened to be able to do so; which is our present condition. But
     it is the condition of England merely because the English, as a
     whole, have ceased to believe in Mr. Chesterton's principles; it is
     not yet the condition of Venezuela because the Venezuelans have not
     yet ceased to believe those principles, though even they are
     beginning to.

     Mr. Chesterton says: "Men do judge, and always will judge, by the
     ultimate test of how they fight." The pirate who gives his blood
     has a better right, therefore, to the ship than the merchant (who
     may be a usurer!) who only gives his money. Well, that is the view
     which was all but universal well into the period of what, for want
     of a better word, we call civilisation. Not only was it the basis
     of all such institutions as the ordeal and duel; not only did it
     justify (and in the opinion of some still justifies) the wars of
     religion and the use of force in religious matters generally; not
     only was it the accepted national polity of such communities as the
     Vikings, the Barbary States, and the Red Indians; but it is still,
     unfortunately, the polity of certain European states. But the idea
     is a survival and--and this is the important point--an admission of
     failure to understand where right lies: to "fight it out" is the
     remedy of the boy who for the life of him cannot see who is right
     and who is wrong.

     At ten years of age we are all quite sure that piracy is a finer
     calling than trade, and the pirate a finer fellow than the Shylock
     who owns the ship--which, indeed, he may well be. But as we grow up
     (which some of the best of us never do) we realise that piracy is
     not the best way to establish the ownership of cargoes, any more
     than the ordeal is the way to settle cases at law, or the rack of
     proving a dogma, or the Spanish American method the way to settle
     differences between Liberals and Conservatives.

     And just as civil adjustments are made most efficiently, as they
     are in England (say), as distinct from South America, by a general
     agreement not to resort to force, so it is the English method in
     the international field which gives better results than that based
     on force. The relationship of Great Britain to Canada or Australia
     is preferable to the relationship of Russia to Finland or Poland,
     or Germany to Alsace-Lorraine. The five nations of the British
     Empire have, by agreement, abandoned the use of force as between
     themselves. Australia may do us an injury--exclude our subjects,
     English or Indian, and expose them to insult--but we know very well
     that force will not be used against her. To withhold such force is
     the basis of the relationship of these five nations; and, given a
     corresponding development of ideas, might equally well be the basis
     of the relationship of fifteen--about all the nations of the world
     who could possibly fight. The difficulties Mr. Chesterton
     imagines--an international tribunal deciding in favour of Austria
     concerning the recession of Venice and Lombardy, and summoning the
     forces of United Europe to coerce Italy into submission--are, of
     course, based on the assumption that a United Europe, having
     arrived at such understanding as to be able to sink its
     differences, would be the same kind of Europe that it is now, or
     was a generation ago. If European statecraft advances sufficiently
     to surrender the use of force against neighbouring states, it will
     have advanced sufficiently to surrender the use of force against
     unwilling provinces, as in some measure British statesmanship has
     already done. To raise the difficulty that Mr. Chesterton does is
     much the same as assuming that a court of law in San Domingo or
     Turkey will give the same results as a court of law in Great
     Britain, because the form of the mechanism is the same. And does
     Mr. Chesterton suggest that the war system settles these matters to
     perfection? That it has worked satisfactorily in Ireland and
     Finland, or, for the matter of that, in Albania or Macedonia?

     For if Mr. Chesterton urges that killing and being killed is the
     way to determine the best means of governing a country, it is his
     business to defend the Turk, who has adopted that principle during
     four hundred years, not the Christians, who want to bring that
     method to an end and adopt another. And I would ask no better
     example of the utter failure of the principles that I combat and
     Mr. Chesterton defends than their failure in the Balkan Peninsula.

     This war is due to the vile character of Turkish rule, and the
     Turk's rule is vile because it is based on the sword. Like Mr.
     Chesterton (and our pirate), the Turk believes in the right of
     conquest, "the ultimate test of how they fight." "The history of
     the Turks," says Sir Charles Elliott, "is almost exclusively a
     catalogue of battles." He has lived (for the most gloriously
     uneconomic person has to live, to follow a trade of some sort, even
     if it be that of theft) on tribute exacted from the Christian
     populations, and extorted, not in return for any work of
     administration, but simply because he was the stronger. And that
     has made his rule intolerable, and is the cause of this war.

     Now, my whole thesis is that understanding, work, co-operation,
     adjustment, must be the basis of human society; that conquest as a
     means of achieving national advantage must fail; that to base your
     prosperity or means of livelihood, your economic system, in short,
     upon having more force than someone else, and exercising it against
     him, is an impossible form of human relationship that is bound to
     break down. And Mr. Chesterton says that the war in the Balkans
     demolishes this thesis. I do not agree with him.

     The present war in the Balkans is an attempt--and happily a
     successful one--to bring this reign of force and conquest to an
     end, and that is why those of us who do not believe in military
     force rejoice.

     The debater, more concerned with verbal consistency than realities
     and the establishment of sound principles, will say that this means
     the approval of war. It does not; it merely means the choice of the
     less evil of two forms of war. War has been going on in the
     Balkans, not for a month, but has been waged by the Turks daily
     against these populations for 400 years.

     The Balkan peoples have now brought to an end a system of rule
     based simply upon the accident of force--"killing and being
     killed." And whether good or ill comes of this war will depend upon
     whether they set up a similar system or one more in consonance with
     pacifist principles. I believe they will choose the latter course;
     that is to say, they will continue to co-operate between themselves
     instead of fighting between themselves; they will settle
     differences by discussion, adjustment, not force. But if they are
     guided by Mr. Chesterton's principle, if each one of the Balkan
     nations is determined to impose its own especial point of view, to
     refuse all settlement by co-operation and understanding, where it
     can resort to force--why, in that case, the strongest (presumably
     Bulgaria) will start conquering the rest, start imposing government
     by force, and will listen to no discussion or argument; will
     simply, in short, take the place of the Turk in the matter, and the
     old weary contest will begin afresh, and we shall have the Turkish
     system under a new name, until that in its turn is destroyed, and
     the whole process begun again da capo. And if Mr. Chesterton says
     that this is not his philosophy, and that he would recommend the
     Balkan nations to come to an understanding, and co-operate
     together, instead of fighting one another, why does he give
     different counsels to the nations of Christendom as a whole? If it
     is well for the Balkan peoples to abandon conflict as between
     themselves in favour of co-operation against the common enemy, why
     is it ill for the other Christian peoples to abandon such conflict
     in favour of co-operation against their common enemy, which is wild
     nature and human error, ignorance and passion. It is a plea for the inevitability, not merely of
war, but of a people's "destiny."

What precisely does it mean? Does it mean that the European Powers have in the past been entirely
wise and honest, have never intrigued with the Turk the one against the other, have always
kept good faith, have never been inspired by false political theories and tawdry and shoddy
ideals, have, in short, no responsibility for the abominations that have gone on in the Balkan
peninsula for a century? No one outside a lunatic asylum would urge it. But, then, that means
that diplomacy has not done all it might to prevent this war. Why does Mr. Churchill say it has?

And does the passage I have quoted mean that we--that English diplomacy--has had no part in
European diplomacy in the past? Have we not, on the contrary, by universal admission played
a predominant role by backing the wrong horse?

But, then, that is not a popular thing to point out, and Mr. Churchill is very careful not
to point it out in any way that could give justification to an unpopular view or discredit
a popular one. He is, however, far too able a Cabinet Minister to ignore obvious facts, and
it is interesting to note how he disposes of them. Observe the following passage:

     For the drama or tragedy which is moving to its climax in the
     Balkans we all have our responsibilities, and none of us can escape
     our share of them by blaming others or by blaming the Turk.

Now if for this tragedy we "all have our responsibility," then what becomes of his first statement
that the war is raging despite all that rulers and diplomats could do to prevent it? If the
war was "inevitable," and rulers and diplomats have done all they could to prevent it, neither
they nor we have any responsibility for it. He knows, of course, that it is impossible to deny
that responsibility, that our errors in the past have been due not to any lack of readiness
to fight or quarrel with foreign nations, but precisely to the tendency to do those things
and our indisposition to set aside instinctive and reasonless jealousies and rivalries in favour
of a deeper sense of responsibility and a somewhat longer vision.

But, again, this quite obvious moral, that if we have our responsibility, if, in other words,
we have not done all that we might and have been led away by temper and passion, we should,
in order to avoid a repetition of such errors in the future, try and see where we have erred
in the past, is precisely the moral that Mr. Churchill does not draw. Again, it is not the
popular line to show with any definiteness that we have been wrong. An abstract proposition
that "we all have our responsibilities," is, while a formal admission of the obvious fact also
at the same time, an excuse, almost a justification. You realise Mr. Churchill's method: Having
made the necessary admission of fact, you immediately prevent any unpleasant (or unpopular)
practical conclusion concerning our duty in the matter by talking of the "complacency" of those
who would fix any real and definite part of the responsibility upon you. (Because, of course,
no man, knows where lies, and no one would ever attempt to fix, the "sole" responsibility).
Incidentally, one might point out to Mr. Churchill that the attempt to see the errors of past
conduct and to avoid them in the future is not complacency, but that airily to dismiss our
responsibility by saying that it is of "no consequence whether we sit in sackcloth and ashes"
is complacency.

Mr. Churchill's idea seems to be that men should forget their errors--and commit them again.
For that is what it amounts to. We cannot, indeed, undo the past, that is true; but we can
prevent it being repeated. But we certainly shall not prevent such repetition if we hug the
easy doctrine that we have always been right--that it is not worth while to see how our principles
have worked out in practice, to take stock of our experience, and to see what results the principles
we propose again to put into operation, have given.

The practical thing for us if we would avoid like errors in the future is to see where our
responsibility lies--a thing which we shall never do if we are governed by the net impression
which disengages itself from speeches like those of Mr. Churchill. For the net result of that
speech, the impression, despite a few shrewd qualifications which do not in reality affect
that net result but which may be useful later wherewith to silence critics, is that war is
inevitable, a matter of "destiny," that diplomacy--the policy pursued by the respective powers--can
do nothing to prevent it; that as brute force is the one and final appeal the only practical
policy is to have plenty of armaments and to show a great readiness to fight; that it is futile
to worry about past errors; (especially as an examination of them would go a long way to discredit
the policy just indicated); that the troublesome and unpopular people who in the past happen
to have kept their heads during a prevailing dementia--and whose policy happens to have been
as right as that of the popular side was wrong--can be dismissed with left-handed references
to "complacency," This sort of thing is popular enough, of course, but--

Well, I will take the risks of a tactic which is the exact contrary to that adopted by Mr.
Churchill and would urge upon those whose patriotism is not of the order which is ready to
see their country in the wrong and who do feel some responsibility for its national policy,
to ask themselves these questions:

Is it true that the Powers could have prevented in large measure the abominations which Turkey
has practised in the Balkans for the last half-century or so?

Has our own policy been a large factor in determining that of the Powers?

Has our own policy directly prevented in the past the triumph of the Christian populations
which, despite that policy, has finally taken place?

Was our own policy at fault when we were led into a war to ensure the "integrity and independence
of the Turkish dominions in Europe"?

Is the general conception of Statecraft on which that policy has been based--the "Balance of
Power" which presupposes the necessary rivalry of nations and which in the past has led to
oppose Russia as it is now leading to oppose Germany--sound, and has it been justified in history?

Did we give due weight to the considerations urged by the public men of the past who opposed
such features of this policy as the Crimean War; was the immense popularity of that war any
test of its wisdom; were the rancour, hatred and scorn poured upon those men just or deserved?

       *       *       *       *       *

Now the first four of these questions have been answered by history and are answered by every
one to-day in an emphatic affirmative. This is not the opinion of a Pacifist partisan. Even
the Times is constrained to admit that "these futile conflicts might have ended years ago,
if it had not been for the quarrels of the Western nations."[6] And as to the Crimean War,
has not the greatest Conservative foreign minister of the nineteenth century admitted that
"we backed the wrong horse"--and, what is far more to the point, have not events unmistakably
demonstrated it?

Do we quite realise that if foreign policy had that continuity which the political pundits
pretend, we should now be fighting on the side of the Turk against the Balkan States? That
we have entered into solemn treaty obligations, as part of our national policy, to guarantee
for ever the "integrity and independence of the Turkish dominions in Europe," that we fought
a great and popular war to prevent that triumph of the Christian population which will arise
as the result of the present war? That but for this policy which caused us to maintain the
Turk in Europe the present war would certainly not be raging, and, what is much more to the
point, that but for our policy the abominations which have provoked it and which it is its
object to terminate, would so far as human reason can judge at all have been brought to an
end generations since? Do we quite realise that we are in large part responsible, not merely
for the war, but for the long agony of horror which have provoked it and made it necessary;
that when we talk of the jealousies and rivalries of the Powers as playing so large a part
in the responsibility for these things, we represent, perhaps, the chief among those jealousies
and rivalries? That it is not mainly the Turk nor the Russian nor the Austrian which has determined
the course of history in the Balkan peninsular since the middle of the 19th century, but we
Englishmen--the country gentleman obsessed by vague theories of the Balance of Power and heaven
knows what, reading his Times and barking out his preposterous politics over the dinner table?
That this fatal policy was dictated simply by fear of the growth of "Russian barbarism and
autocracy" and "the overshadowing of the Western nations by a country whose institutions are
inimical to our own"? That while we were thus led into war by a phantom danger to our Indian
possessions, we were quite blind to the real danger which threatened them, which a year or
two later, in the Mutiny, nearly lost us them and which were not due to the machinations of
a rival power but to our own misgovernment; that this very "barbaric growth" and expansion
towards India which we fought a war to check we are now actively promoting in Persia and elsewhere
by our (effective) alliance? That while as recently as fifteen years ago we would have gone
to war to prevent any move of Russia towards the Indian frontier, we are to-day actually encouraging
her to build a railway there? And that it is now another nation which stands as the natural
barrier to Russian expansion to the West--Germany--whose power we are challenging, and that
all tendencies point to our backing again the wrong horse, to our fighting with the "semi-Asiatic
barbarian" (as our fathers used to call him) against the nation which has close racial and
cultural affinity to our own, just as half a century since the same fatal obsession about the
"Balance of Power" led us to fight with the Mohammedan in order to bolster up for half a century
his anti-Christian rule.

The misreading of history in this matter is, unfortunately, not possible. The point upon which
in the Crimean war the negotiations with Russia finally broke was the claim, based upon her
reading of the Vienna note, to stand as religious protector of the Greek Christians in the
Balkan peninsular. That was the pivot of the whole negotiations, and the war was the outcome
of our support of the Turkish view--or, rather, our conduct of Turkish policy, for throughout
the whole period England was conducting the Turkish negotiations; indeed, as Bright said at
the time, she was carrying on the Turkish Government and ruling the Turkish Empire through
her ministers in Constantinople.

I will quote a speech of the period made in the House of Commons.

Now, looking back upon what has since happened, which view shows the greater wisdom and prevision?
That of the man who delivered this speech (and he was John Bright) or those against whom he
spoke? To which set of principles has time given the greater justification?

Yet upon the men who resisted what we all admit, in this case at least, to have been the false
theories and who supported, what we equally admit now, to have been the right principles, we
poured the same sort of ferocious contempt that we are apt now spasmodically to pour upon those
who, sixty years later, would prevent our drifting in the same blind fashion into a war just
as futile and bound to be infinitely more disastrous--a war embodying the same "principles"
supported by just the same theories and just the same arguments which led us into this other one.

I know full well the prejudice which the names I am about to cite is apt to cause. We poured
out upon the men who bore them a rancour, contempt and hatred which few men in English public
life have had to face. Morley, in his life of Cobden, says of these two men--Cobden and Bright:

     They had, as Lord Palmerston said, the whole world against them. It
     was not merely the august personages of the Court, nor the
     illustrious veterans in Government and diplomacy, nor the most
     experienced politicians in Parliament, nor the powerful
     journalists, nor the men versed in great affairs of business. It
     was no light thing to confront even that solid mass of hostile
     judgment. But besides all this, Cobden and Mr. Bright knew that the
     country at large, even their trusty middle and industrial classes,
     had turned their faces resolutely and angrily away from them. Their
     own great instrument, the public meeting, was no longer theirs to
     wield. The army of the Nonconformists, which has so seldom been
     found fighting on the wrong side, was seriously divided.

     Public opinion was bitterly and impatiently hostile and
     intractable. Mr. Bright was burnt in effigy. Cobden, at a meeting
     in his own constituency, after an energetic vindication of his
     opinions, saw resolutions carried against him. Every morning they
     were reviled in half the newspapers in the country as enemies of
     the commonwealth. They were openly told that they were traitors,
     and that it was a pity they could not be punished as traitors.

     In the House, Lord Palmerston once began his reply by referring to
     Mr. Bright as "the Honourable and Reverend gentleman," Cobden rose
     to call him to order for this flippant and unbecoming phrase. Lord
     Palmerston said he would not quarrel about words. Then went on to
     say that he thought it right to tell Mr. Bright that his opinion
     was a matter of entire difference, and that he treated his censure
     with the most perfect indifference and contempt. On another
     occasion he showed the same unmannerliness to Cobden himself.
     Cobden had said that under certain circumstances he would fight, or
     if he could not fight, he would work for the wounded in the
     hospitals. "Well," said Lord Palmerston in reply, with the sarcasm
     of a schoolboy's debating society, "there are many people in this
     country who think that the party to which he belongs should go
     immediately into a hospital of a different kind, and which I shall
     not mention." This refined irony was a very gentle specimen of the
     insult and contumely which was poured upon Cobden and Mr. Bright at
     this time....

     It is impossible not to regard the attitude of the two objects of
     this vast unpopularity as one of the most truly honourable
     spectacles in our political history. The moral fortitude, like the
     political wisdom of these two strong men, begins to stand out with
     a splendour that already recalls the great historic heights of
     statesmanship and patriotism. Even now our heart-felt admiration
     and gratitude goes out to them as it goes out to Burke for his
     lofty and manful protests against the war with America and the
     oppression of Ireland, and to Charles Fox for his bold and
     strenuous resistance to the war with the French Republic.

Before indulging in the dementia which those names usually produce, will the reader please
note that it is not my business now to defend either the general principles of Cobden and Bright
or the political spirit which they are supposed to represent. Let them be as sordid, mean,
unworthy, pusillanimous as you like--and as the best of us then said they were ("a mean, vain,
mischievous clique" even so good a man as Tom Hughes could call them). We called them cowards--because
practically alone they faced a country which had become a howling mob; we called their opponents
"courageous" because with the whole country behind them they habitually poured contempt upon
the under dog.

And we thus hated these men because they did their best to dissuade us from undertaking a certain
war. Very good; we have had our war; we carried our point, we prevented the break-up of the
Turkish Empire; those men were completely beaten. And they are dead. Cannot we afford to set
aside those old passions and see how far in one particular at least they may have been right?

We admit, of course, if we are honest--happily everyone admits--that these despised men were
right and those who abused them were wrong. The verdict of fact is there. Says Lord Morley:--

    When we look back upon the affairs of that time, we see that there
    were two policies open. Lord Palmerston's was one, Cobden and
    Bright's the other. If we are to compare Lord Palmerston's
    statesmanship and insight in the Eastern Question with that of his
    two great adversaries, it is hard, in the light of all that has
    happened since, to resist the conclusion that Cobden and Mr. Bright
    were right, and Lord Palmerston was disastrously wrong. It is easy
    to plead extenuating circumstances for the egregious mistakes in
    Lord Palmerston's policy about the Eastern Question, the Suez Canal,
    and some other important subjects; but the plea can only be allowed
    after it has been frankly recognized that they really were mistakes,
    and that these abused men exposed and avoided them. Lord Palmerston,
    for instance, asked why the Czar could not be "satisfied, as we all
    are, with the progressively liberal system of Turkey." Cobden, in
    his pamphlet twenty years before, insisted that this progressively
    liberal system of Turkey had no existence. Which of these two
    propositions was true may be left to the decision of those who lent
    to the Turk many millions of money on the strength of Lord
    Palmerston's ignorant and delusive assurances. It was mainly owing
    to Lord Palmerston, again, that the efforts of the war were
    concentrated at Sebastopol. Sixty thousand English and French
    troops, he said, with the co-operation of the fleets, would take
    Sebastopol in six weeks. Cobden gave reasons for thinking very
    differently, and urged that the destruction of Sebastopol, even when
    it was achieved, would neither inflict a crushing blow to Russia,
    nor prevent future attacks upon Turkey. Lord Palmerston's error may
    have been intelligible and venial; nevertheless, as a fact, he was
    in error and Cobden was not, and the error cost the nation one of
    the most unfortunate, mortifying, and absolutely useless campaigns
    in English history. Cobden held that if we were to defend Turkey
    against Russia, the true policy was to use our navy, and not to send
    a land force to the Crimea. Would any serious politician now be
    found to deny it? We might prolong the list of propositions, general
    and particular, which Lord Palmerston maintained and Cobden
    traversed, from the beginning to the end of the Russian War. There
    is not one of these propositions in which later events have not
    shown that Cobden's knowledge was greater, his judgment cooler, his
    insight more penetrating and comprehensive. The bankruptcy of the
    Turkish Government, the further dismemberment of its Empire by the
    Treaty of Berlin, the abrogation of the Black Sea Treaty, have
    already done something to convince people that the two leaders saw
    much further ahead in 1854 and 1855 than men who had passed all
    their lives in foreign chanceries and the purlieus of Downing
    Street.

    It is startling to look back upon the bullying contempt which the
    man who was blind permitted himself to show to the men who could
    see. The truth is, that to Lord Palmerston it was still
    incomprehensible and intolerable that a couple of manufacturers from
    Lancashire should presume to teach him foreign policy. Still more
    offensive to him was their introduction of morality into the
    mysteries of the Foreign Office.[7]

What have peace theories to do with this war? asks the practical man, who is the greatest mystic
of all, contemptuously. Well, they have everything to do with it. For if we had understood
some peace theories a little better a generation or two ago, if we had not allowed passion
and error and prejudice instead of reason to dominate our policy, the sum of misery which these
Balkan populations have known would have been immeasurably less. It is quite true that we could
not have prevented this war by sending peace pamphlets to the Turk, or to the Balkanese, for
that matter, but we could have prevented it if we ourselves had read them a generation or two
since, just as our only means of preventing future wars is by showing a little less prejudice
and a little less blindness.

And the practical question, despite Mr. Churchill, is whether we shall allow a like passion
and a like prejudice again to blind us; whether we shall again back the wrong horse in the
name of the same hollow theories drifting to a similar but greater futility and catastrophe,
or whether we shall profit by our past to assure a better future.

The question surely, which for practical men stands out from the mighty historical episode
touched on in the last chapter, is this: Was the fact that these despised men were so entirely
right and their triumphant adversaries so entirely wrong a mere fluke, or was it due to the
soundness of one set of principles and the hollowness of the other; and were the principles
special to that case, or general to international conflict as a whole?

To have an opinion of worth on that question we must get away from certain confusions and misrepresentations.

It is a very common habit for the Bellicist to quote the list of wars which have taken place
since the Crimean War as proof of the error of Bright and Cobden. But what are the facts?

Here were two men who strenuously and ruthlessly opposed a certain policy; they urged, not
only that it would inevitably lead to war, but that the war would be futile--but not sterile,
for they saw that others would grow from it. Their counsel was disregarded and the war came,
and events have proved that they were right and the war-makers wrong, and the very fact that
the wars took place is cited as disapproving their "theories."[8]

It is a like confusion of thought which prompts Mr. Churchill to refer to Pacifists as people
who deem the danger of war an illusion.

This persistent misconception is worth a little examination.

       *       *       *       *       *

The smoke from the first railway engines in England killed the cattle and the poultry of the
country gentlemen near whose property the railroad passed--at least, that is what the country
gentleman wrote to the Times.

Now if in the domain of quite simple material things the dislike of having fixed habits of
thought disturbed, leads gentlemen to resent innovations in that way, it is not astonishing
that innovations of a more intangible and elusive kind should be subject to a like unconscious
misrepresentation, especially by newspapers and public men pushed by commercial or political
necessity to say the popular thing rather than the true thing: that contained in the speech
of Mr. Churchill, which, together with a newspaper comment thereon, I have made the "text"
of this little book, is a typical case in point.

It is possible, of course, that Mr. Churchill in talking about "persons who profess to know
that the danger of war has become an illusion," had not the slightest intention of referring
to those who share the views embodied in "The Great Illusion," which are, not that the danger
of war is an illusion, but that the benefit is. All that happened was that his hearers and
readers interpreted his words as referring thereto; and that, of course, he could not possibly
prevent.

In any case, to misrepresent an author (and I mean always, of course, quite sincere and unconscious
misrepresentations, like that which led the country gentlemen to write that railway smoke killed
poultry) is a trifling matter, but to misrepresent an idea, is not, for it makes that better
understanding of facts, the creation of a more informed public opinion, by which alone we can
avoid a possibly colossal folly, an understanding difficult enough as it is, still more difficult.

And that is why the current misrepresentation (again unconscious) of most efforts at the better
understanding of the facts of international relationship needs very badly to be corrected.
I will therefore be very definite.

The implication that Pacifists of any kind have ever urged that war is impossible is due either
to that confusion of thought just touched upon, or is merely a silly gibe of those who deride
arguments to which they have not listened, and consequently do not understand, or which they
desire to misrepresent; and such misrepresentation is, when not unconscious, always stupid
and unfair.

So far as I am concerned, I have never written a line, nor, so far as I know, has anyone else,
to plead that war is impossible. I have, on the contrary, always urged, with the utmost emphasis
that war is not only possible but extremely likely, so long as we remain as ignorant as we
are concerning what it can accomplish, and unless we use our energies and efforts to prevent
it, instead of directing those efforts to create it. What anti-Bellicists as a whole urge,
is not that war is impossible or improbable, but that it is impossible to benefit by it; that
conquest must, in the long run, fail to achieve advantage; that the general recognition of
this can only add to our security. And incidentally most of us have declared our complete readiness
to take any demonstrably necessary measure for the maintenance of armament, but urge that the
effort must not stop there.

One is justified in wondering whether the public men--statesmen, soldiers, bishops, preachers,
journalists--who indulge in this gibe, are really unable to distinguish between the plea that
a thing is unwise, foolish, and the plea that it is impossible; whether they really suppose
that anyone in our time could argue that human folly is impossible, or an "illusion." It is
quite evidently a tragic reality. Undoubtedly the readiness with which these critics thus fall
back upon confusion of thought indicates that they themselves have illimitable confidence in
it. But the confusion of thought does not stop here.

I have spoken of Pacifists and Bellicists, but, of course, we are all Pacifists now. Lord Roberts,
Lord Charles Beresford, Lord Fisher, Mr. Winston Churchill, The Navy League, the Navier League,
the Universal Military Service League, the German Emperor, the Editor of The Spectator, all
the Chancelleries of Europe, alike declare that their one object is the maintenance of peace.
Never were such Pacifists. The German Emperor, speaking to his army, invariably points out
that they stand for the peace of Europe. Does a First Lord want new ships? It is because a
strong British Navy is the best guarantee of peace. Lord Roberts wants conscription because
that is the one way to preserve peace, and the Editor of The Spectator tells us that Turkey's
great crime is that she has not paid enough attention to soldiering and armament, that if only
she had been stronger all would have been well. All alike are quite persuaded indeed that the
one way to peace is to get more armament.

Well, that is the method that mankind has pursued during the whole of its history; it has never
shown the least disposition not to take this advice and not to try this method to the full.
And written history, to say nothing of unwritten history, is there to tell us how well it has
succeeded.

Unhappily, one has to ask whether some of these military Pacifists really want it to succeed?
Again I do not tax any with conscious insincerity. But it does result not merely from what
some imply, but from what they say. For certain of these doughty Pacifists having told you
how much their one object is to secure peace, then proceed to tell you that this thing which
they hope to secure is a very evil thing, that under its blighting influence nations wane in
luxury and sloth. And of course they imply that our own nation, about a third of whom have
not enough to eat and about another third of whom have a heart-breaking struggle with small
means and precariousness of livelihood, is in danger of this degeneration which comes from
too much wealth and luxury and sloth and ease. I could fill a dozen books the size of this
with the solemn warning of such Pacifists as these against the danger of peace (which they
tell you they are struggling to maintain), and how splendid and glorious a thing, how fine
a discipline is war (which they tell you they are trying so hard to avoid). Thus the Editor
of The Spectator tells us that mankind cannot yet dispense with the discipline of war; and
Lord Roberts, that to make war when you are really ready for it (or that in any case for Germany
to do it) is "an excellent policy and one to be pursued by every nation prepared to play a
great part in history."

The truth is, of course, that we are not likely to get peace from those who believe it to be
an evil thing and war and aggression a good thing, or, at least, are very mixed in their views
as to this. Before men can secure peace they must at least make up their minds whether it is
peace or war they want. If you do not know what you want, you are not likely to get it--or
you are likely to get it, whichever way you prefer to put it.

And that is another thing which divides us from the military Pacifists: we really do want peace.
As between war and peace we have made our choice, and having made it, stick to it. There may
be something to be said for war--for settling a thing by fighting about it instead of by understanding
it,--just as there may be something to be said for the ordeal, or the duel, as against trial
by evidence, for the rack as a corrective of religious error, for judicial torture as a substitute
for cross-examination, for religious wars, for all these things--but the balance of advantage
is against them and we have discarded them.

But there is a still further difference which divides us: We have realised that we discarded
those things only when we really understood their imperfections and that we arrived at that
understanding by studying them, by discussing them,--because one man in London or another in
Paris raised plainly and boldly the whole question of their wisdom and because the intellectual
ferment created by those interrogations, either in the juridical or religious field, re-acted
on the minds of men in Geneva or Wurtenburg or Rome or Madrid. It was by this means, not by
improving the rapiers or improving the instruments of the inquisition, that we got rid of the
duel and that Catholics ceased to torture Protestants or vice versa. We gave these things up
because we realised the futility of physical force in these conflicts. We shall give up war
for the same reason.

But the Bellicist says that discussions of this sort, these attempts to find out the truth,
are but the encouragement of pernicious theories: there is, according to him, but one way--better
rapiers, more and better racks, more and better inquisitions.

Mr. Bonar Law, in one of the very wisest phrases ever pronounced by a statesman, has declared
that "war is the failure of human wisdom."

That is the whole case of Pacifism: we shall not improve except at the price of using our reason
in these matters; of understanding them better. Surely it is a truism that that is the price
of all progress; saner conceptions--man's recognition of his mistakes, whether those mistakes
take the form of cannibalism, slavery, torture, superstition, tyranny, false laws, or what
you will. The veriest savage, or for that matter the ape, can blindly fight, but whether the
animal develops into a man, or the savage into civilized man, depends upon whether the element
of reason enters in an increasing degree into the solution of his problems.

The Militarist argues otherwise. He admits the difficulty comes from man's small disposition
to think; therefore don't think--fight. We fight, he says, because we have insufficient wisdom
in these matters; therefore do not let us trouble to get more wisdom or understanding; all
we need do is to get better weapons. I am not misrepresenting him; that is quite fairly the
popular line: it is no use talking about these things or trying to explain them, all that is
logic and theories; what you want to do is to get a bigger army or more battleships. And, of
course, the Bellicist on the other side of the frontier says exactly the same thing, and I
am still waiting to have explained to me how, therefore, if this matter depends upon understanding,
we can ever solve it by neglecting understanding, which the Militarist urges us to do. Not
only does he admit, but pleads, that these things are complex, and supposes that that is an
argument why they should not be studied.

And a third distinction will, I think, make the difference between us still clearer. Like the
Bellicist, I am in favour of defence. If in a duelling society a duellist attacked me, or,
as a Huguenot in the Paris of the sixteenth century a Catholic had attacked me, I should certainly
have defended myself, and if needs be have killed my aggressor. But that attitude would not
have prevented my doing my small part in the creation of a public opinion which should make
duelling or such things as the massacre of St. Bartholomew impossible by showing how unsatisfactory
and futile they were; and I should know perfectly well that neither would stop until public
opinion had, as the result of education of one kind or another, realised their futility. But
it is as certain as anything can be that the Churchills of that society or of that day would
have been vociferous in declaring (as in the case of the duel they still to-day declare in
Prussia) that this attempt to prove the futility of duelling was not only a bad and pernicious
campaign, but was in reality a subtle attempt to get people killed in the street by bullies,
and that those who valued their security would do their best to discredit all anti-duelling
propaganda--by misrepresentation, if needs be.

Let this matter be quite clear. No one who need be considered in this discussion would think
of criticising Lord Roberts for wanting the army, and Mr. Churchill for wanting the navy, to
be as good and efficient as possible and as large as necessary. Personally--and I speak, I
know, for many of my colleagues in the anti-war movement--I would be prepared to support British
conscription if it be demonstrably wise or necessary. But what we criticise is the persistent
effort to discredit honest attempts at a better understanding of the facts of international
relationship, the everlasting gibe which it is thought necessary to fling at any constructive
effort, apart from armament, to make peace secure. These men profess to be friends of peace,
they profess to regret the growth of armament, to deplore the unwisdom, ignorance, prejudice
and misunderstanding out of which the whole thing grows, but immediately there is any definite
effort to correct this unwisdom, to examine the grounds of the prejudice and misunderstanding,
there is a volte face and such efforts are sneered at as "sentimental" or "sordid," according
as the plea for peace is put upon moral or material grounds. It is not that they disagree in
detail with any given proposition looking towards a basis of international co-operation, but
that in reality they deprecate raising the matter at all.[9] It must be armaments and nothing
but armaments with them. If there had been any possibility of success in that we should not
now be entering upon the 8,000th or 9,000th war of written history. Armaments may be necessary,
but they are not enough. Our plan is armaments plus education; theirs is armament versus education.
And by education, of course, we do not mean school books, or an extension of the School Board
curriculum, but a recognition of the fact that the character of human society is determined
by the extent to which its units attempt to arrive at an understanding of their relationship,
instead of merely subduing one another by force, which does not lead to understanding at all:
in Turkey, or Venezuela, or San Domingo, there is no particular effort made to adjust differences
by understanding; in societies of that type they only believe in settling differences by armaments.
That is why there are very few books, very little thought or discussion, very little intellectual
ferment but a great many guns and soldiers and battles. And throughout the world the conflict
is going on between these rival schools. On the whole the Western world, inside the respective
frontiers, almost entirely now tends to the Pacifist type. But not so in the international
field, for where the Powers are concerned, where it is a question of the attitude of one nation
in relation to another, you get a degree of understanding rather less than more than that which
obtains in the internal politics of Venezuela, or Turkey, or Morocco, or any other "warlike" state.

And the difficulty of creating a better European opinion and temper is due largely to just
this idea that obsesses the Militarist, that unless they misrepresent facts in a sensational
direction the nations will be too apathetic to arm; that education will abolish funk, and that
presumably funk is a necessary element in self-defence.

For the most creditable explanation that we can give of the Militarist's objection to having
this matter discussed at all, is the evident impression that such discussion will discourage
measures for self-defence; the Militarist does not believe that a people desiring to understand
these things and interested in the development of a better European society, can at the same
time be determined to resist the use of force. They believe that unless the people are kept
in a blue funk, they will not arm, and that is why it is that the Militarist of the respective
countries are for ever talking about our degeneration and the rest. And the German Militarist
is just as angry with the unwarlike qualities of his people as the English Militarist is with ours.

Just note this parallel:

    BRITISH OPINION ON BRITISH APATHY AND GERMAN VIGOUR.

    "There is a way in which Britain is certain to have war and its
    horrors and calamities; it is this--by persisting in her present
    course of unpreparedness, her apathy, unintelligence, and blindness,
    and in her disregard of the warnings of the most ordinary political
    insight, as well as of the example of history.

    "Now in the year 1912, just as in 1866, and just as in 1870, war
    will take place the instant the German forces by land and sea are,
    by their superiority at every point, as certain of victory as
    anything in human calculation can be made certain. 'Germany strikes
    when Germany's hour has struck.' That is the time-honoured policy of
    her Foreign Office. It is her policy at the present hour, and it is
    an excellent policy. It is, or should be, the policy of every nation
    prepared to play a great part in history."--LORD ROBERTS, at
    Manchester.

    "Britain is disunited; Germany is homogeneous. We are quarrelling
    about the Lords' Veto, Home Rule, and a dozen other questions of
    domestic politics. We have a Little Navy Party, an Anti-Militarist
    Party; Germany is unanimous upon the question of naval
    expansion."--MR. BLATCHFORD.

    GERMAN OPINION ON GERMAN APATHY AND BRITISH VIGOUR.

    "Whole strata of our nation seem to have lost that ideal enthusiasm
    which constituted the greatness of its history. With the increase of
    wealth they live for the moment, they are incapable of sacrificing
    the enjoyment of the hour to the service of great conceptions, and
    close their eyes complacently to the duties of our future and to the
    pressing problems of international life which await a solution at
    the present time."--GENERAL VON BERNHARDI in "Germany and the Next
    War."

    "There is no one German people, no single Germany.... There are more
    abrupt contrasts between Germans and Germans than between Germans
    and Indians."

    "One must admire the consistent fidelity and patriotism of the
    English race, as compared with the uncertain and erratic methods of
    the German people, their mistrust, and suspicion.... In spite of
    numerous wars, bloodshed, and disaster, England always emerges
    smoothly and easily from her military crises and settles down to new
    conditions and surroundings in her usual cool and deliberate manner,
    so different from the German."--Berliner Tageblatt, March 14, 1911.

Presumably each doughty warrior knows his own country better than that of the other, which
would carry a conclusion directly contrary to that which he draws.

But note also where this idea that it is necessary artificially to stimulate the defensive
zeal of each country by resisting any tendency to agreement and understanding leads. It leads
even so good a man as Lord Roberts into the trap of dogmatic prophesy concerning the intentions
of a very complex heterogeneous nation of 65 million people. Lord Roberts could not possibly
tell you what his own country will do five, ten, or fifteen years hence in such matters as
Home Rule or the Suffragists, or even the payment of doctors, but he knows exactly what a foreign
country will do in a much more serious matter. The simple truth is, of course, that no man
knows what "Germany" will do ten years hence, any more than we can know what "England" will
do. We don't even know what England will be, whether Unionist or Liberal or Labour, Socialist,
Free Trade or Protectionist. All these things, like the question of Peace and War depends upon
all sorts of tendencies, drifts and developments. At bottom, of course, since war, in Mr. Bonar
Law's fine phrase, is "never inevitable--only the failure of human wisdom," it depends upon
whether we become a little less or a little more wise. If the former, we shall have it; if
the latter, we shall not. But this dogmatism concerning the other man's evil intentions is
the very thing that leads away from wisdom.[10] The sort of temper and ideas which it provokes
on both sides of the frontier may be gathered from just such average gems as these plucked
recently from the English press:--

     Yes, we may as well face it. War with Germany is inevitable, and
     the only question is--Shall we consult her convenience as to its
     date? Shall we wait till Germany's present naval programme, which
     is every year reducing our advantage, is complete? Shall we wait
     till the smouldering industrial revolution, of which all these
     strikes are warnings, has broken into flame? Shall we wait till
     Consols are 65 and our national credit is gone? Shall we wait till
     the Income Tax is 1s. 6d. in the pound? OR SHALL WE STRIKE
     NOW--finding every out-of-work a job in connection with the
     guardianship of our shores, and, with our mighty fleet, either
     sinking every German ship or towing it in triumph into a British
     port? Why should we do it? Because the command of the seas is
     ever ours; because our island position, our international trade
     and our world-wide dominions demand that no other nation shall
     dare to challenge our supremacy. That is why. Oh, yes, the cost
     would be great, but we could raise it to-day all right, and we
     should get it back.

     If the struggle comes to-day, we shall win--and after it is over,
     there will be abounding prosperity in the land, and no more labour
     unrest.

     Yes, we have no fear of Germany to-day. The only enemy we fear is
     the crack-brained fanatics who prate about peace and goodwill
     whilst foreign Dreadnoughts are gradually closing in upon us. As
     Mr. Balfour said at the Eugenic Conference the other day, man is a
     wild animal; and there is no room, in present circumstances, for
     any tame ones.--John Bull, Aug. 24, 1912.

The italics and large type are those of the original, not mine. This paper explains, by the
way, in this connection that "In the Chancelleries of Europe John Bull is regarded as a negligible
journalistic quantity. But John Bull is read by a million people every week, and that million
not the least thoughtful and intelligent section of the community, they think about what they
read."

One of the million seems to have thought to some purpose, for the next week there was the following
letter from him. It was given the place of honour in a series and runs as follows:--

     I would have extended your "Down with the German Fleet!" to "Down
     with Germany and the Germans!" For, unless the whole ---- lot are
     swept off the surface of the earth, there will be no peace. If the
     people in England could only realise the quarrelsome, deceitful,
     underhanded, egotistic any tyrannical character of the Germans,
     there would not be so much balderdash about a friendly
     understanding, etc., between England and Germany. The German is a
     born tyrant. The desire to remain with Britain on good terms will
     only last so long until Germany feels herself strong enough to beat
     England both on sea and on land: afterwards it'll simply be "la
     bourse ou la vie," as the French proverb goes. Provided they do not
     know that there are any English listeners about, phrases like the
     following can be heard every day in German restaurants and other
     public places: "I hate England and the English!" "Never mind, they
     won't be standing in our way much longer. We shall soon be ready."

And John Bull, with its million readers, is not alone. This is how the Daily Express, in a
double-leaded leader, teaches history to its readers:--

     When, one day, Englishmen are not allowed to walk the pavements of
     their cities, and their women are for the pleasure of the invaders,
     and the offices of the Tiny England newspapers are incinerated by a
     furious mob; when foreign military officers proclaim martial law
     from the Royal Exchange steps, and when some billions of pounds
     have to be raised by taxation--by taxation of the "toiling
     millions" as well as others--to pay the invaders out, and the
     British Empire consists of England--less Dover, required for a
     foreign strategic tunnel--and the Channel Islands--then the ghosts
     of certain politicians and publicists will probably call a meeting
     for the discussion of the Fourth Dimension.--Leading Article,
     Daily Express, 8/7/12.

And not merely shall our women fill the harems of the German pashas, and Englishmen not be
allowed to walk upon the pavement (it would be the German way of solving the traffic problem--near
the Bank), but a "well-known Diplomat" in another paper tells us what else will happen.

     If England be vanquished it means the end of all things as far as
     she is concerned, and will ring in a new and somewhat terrible era.
     Bankrupt, shorn of all power, deserted, as must clearly follow, as
     a commercial state, and groaning under a huge indemnity that she
     cannot pay and is not intended to be able to pay, what will be the
     melancholy end of this great country and her teeming population of
     forty-five millions?

     ... Her shipping trade will be transferred as far as possible from
     the English to the German flag. Her banking will be lost, as London
     will no longer be the centre of commerce, and efforts will be made
     to enable Berlin to take London's place. Her manufactures will
     gradually desert her. Failing to obtain payments in due time,
     estates will be sequestered and become the property of wealthy
     Germans. The indemnity to be demanded is said to be one thousand
     millions sterling.

     The immediate result of defeat would mean, of course, that
     insolvency would take place in a very large number of commercial
     businesses, and others would speedily follow. Those who cannot get
     away will starve unless large relief funds are forthcoming from,
     say, Canada and the United States, for this country, bereft of its
     manufactures, will not be able to sustain a population of more than
     a very few millions.--From an Article by "A Well-known
     Diplomatist" in The Throne, June 12, 1912.

These are but samples; and this sort of thing is going on in England and Germany alike. And
when one protests that it is wicked rubbish born of funk and ignorance, that whatever happens
in war this does not happen, and that it is based on false economics and grows into utterly
false conceptions of international relationship, one is shouted down as an anti-armament man
and an enemy of his country.

Well, if that view is persisted in, if in reality it is necessary for a people to have lies
and nonsense told to them in order to induce them to defend themselves, some will be apt to
decide that they are not worth defending. Or rather will they decide that this phase of the
pro-armament campaign--which is not so much a campaign in favour of armament as one against
education and understanding--will end in turning us into a nation either of poltroons or of
bullies and aggressors, and that since life is a matter of the choice of risks it is wiser
and more courageous to choose the less evil. A nation may be defeated and still live in the
esteem of men--and in its own. No civilized man esteems a nation of Bashi-Bazouks or Prussian
Junkers. Of the two risks involved--the risk of attack arising from a possible superiority
of armament on the part of a rival, and the risk of drifting into conflict because, concentrating
all our energies on the mere instrument of combat, we have taken no adequate trouble to understand
the facts of this case--it is at least an arguable proposition that the second risk is the
greater. And I am prompted to this expression of opinion without surrendering one iota of a
lifelong and passionate belief that a nation attacked should defend itself to the last penny
and to the last man.

And you think that this idea that the nations--ours amongst them--may drift into futile war
from sheer panic and funk arising out of the terror inspired by phantoms born of ignorance,
is merely the idea of Pacifist cranks?

The following, referring to the "precautionary measures" (i.e., mobilization of armies) taken
by the various Powers, is from a leading article of the Times:--

     "Precautions" are understandable, but the remark of our Berlin
     Correspondent that they may produce an untenable position from
     which retreat must be humiliating is applicable in more than one
     direction. Our Vienna Correspondent truly says that "there is no
     valid reason to believe war between Austria-Hungary and Russia to
     be inevitable, or even immediately probable." We entirely agree,
     but wish we could add that the absence of any valid reason was
     placing strict limitations upon the scope of "precautions." The
     same correspondent says he is constantly being asked:--"Is there no
     means of avoiding war?" The same question is now being asked, with
     some bewilderment, by millions of men in this country, who want to
     know what difficulties there are in the present situation which
     should threaten Europe with a general war, or even a collision
     larger than that already witnessed.... There is no great nation in
     Europe which to-day has the least desire that millions of men
     should be torn from their homes and flung headlong to destruction
     at the bidding of vain ambitions. The Balkan peoples fought for a
     cause which was peculiarly their own. They were inspired by the
     memories of centuries of wrong which they were burning to avenge.
     The larger nations have no such quarrel, unless it is wilfully
     manufactured for them. The common sense of the peoples of Europe is
     well aware that no issue has been presented which could not be
     settled by amicable discussion. In England men will learn with
     amazement and incredulity that war is possible over the question of
     a Servian port, or even over the larger issues which are said to
     lie behind it. Yet that is whither the nations are blindly drifting
     Who, then, makes war? The answer is to be found in the
     Chancelleries of Europe, among the men who have too long played
     with human lives as pawns in a game of chess, who have become so
     enmeshed in formulas and the jargon of diplomacy that they have
     ceased to be conscious of the poignant realities with which they
     trifle. And thus will war continue to be made, until the great
     masses who are the sport of professional schemers and dreamers say
     the word which, shall bring, not eternal peace, for that is
     impossible, but a determination that wars shall be fought only in a
     just and righteous and vital cause. If that word is ever to be
     spoken, there never was a more appropriate occasion than the
     present; and we trust it will be spoken while there is yet time.

And the very next day there appeared in the Daily Mail an article by Mr. Lovat Fraser ending
thus:--

     The real answer rests, or ought to rest, with the man in the train.
     Does he want to join in Armageddon? It is time that he began to
     think about it, for his answer may soon be sought.

Now we have here, stated in the first case by the most authoritative of English newspapers,
and in the second by an habitual contributor of the most popular, the whole case of Pacifism
as I have attempted to expound it, namely: (1) That our current statecraft--its fundamental
conceptions, its "axioms," its terminology--has become obsolete by virtue of the changed conditions
of European society; that the causes of conflict which it creates are half the time based on
illusions, upon meaningless and empty formulas; (2) that its survival is at bottom due to popular
ignorance and indifference--the survival on the part of the great mass of just those conceptions
born of the old and now obsolete conditions--since diplomacy, like all functions of government,
is a reflection of average opinion; (3) that this public opinion is not something which descends
upon us from the skies but is the sum of the opinions of each one of us and is the outcome
of our daily contacts, our writing and talking and discussion, and that the road to safety
lies in having that general public opinion better informed not in directly discouraging such
better information; (4) that the mere multiplication of "precautions" in the shape of increased
armaments and a readiness for war, in the absence of a corresponding and parallel improvement
of opinion, will merely increase and not exorcise the danger, and, finally, (5) that the problem
of war is necessarily a problem of at least two parties, and that if we are to solve it, to
understand it even, we must consider it in terms of two parties, not one; it is not a question
of what shall be the policy of each without reference to the other, but what the final upshot
of the two policies taken in conjunction will be.

Now in all this the Times, especially in one outstanding central idea, is embodying a conception
which is the antithesis of that expressed by Militarists of the type of Mr. Churchill, and,
I am sorry to say, of Lord Roberts. To these latter war is not something that we, the peoples
of Europe, create by our ignorance and temper, by the nursing of old and vicious theories,
by the poorness and defects of the ideas our intellectual activities have developed during
the last generation or two, but something that "comes upon us" like the rain or the earthquake,
and against which we can only protect ourselves by one thing: more arms, a greater readiness
to fight.

In effect the anti-Educationalists say this: "What, as practical men, we have to do, is to
be stronger than our enemy; the rest is theory and does not matter."

Well the inevitable outcome of such an attitude is catastrophe.

I have said elsewhere that in this matter it seems fatally easy to secure either one of two
kinds of action: that of the "practical man" who limits his energies to securing a policy which
will perfect the machinery of war and disregard anything else; or that of the idealist, who,
persuaded of the brutality or immorality of war, is apt to show a certain indifference concerning
self-defence. What is needed is the type of activity which will include both halves of the
problem: provision for education, for a Political Reformation in this matter, as well as such
means of defence as will meantime counterbalance the existing impulse to aggression. To concentrate
on either half to the exclusion of the other half is to render the whole problem insoluble.

What must inevitably happen if the nations take the line of the "practical man," and limit
their energies simply and purely to piling up armaments?

A critic once put to me what he evidently deemed a poser: "Do you urge that we shall be stronger
than our enemy, or weaker?"

To which I replied: "The last time that question was asked me was in Berlin, by Germans. What
would you have had me reply to those Germans?"--a reply which, of course, meant this: In attempting
to find the solution of this question in terms of one party, you are attempting the impossible.
The outcome will be war, and war would not settle it. It would all have to be begun over again.

The Navy League catechism says: "Defence consists in being so strong that it will be dangerous
for your enemy to attack you."[11] Mr. Churchill, however, goes farther than the Navy League,
and says: "The way to make war impossible is to make victory certain."

The Navy League definition is at least possible of application to practical politics, because
rough equality of the two parties would make attack by either dangerous. Mr. Churchill's principle
is impossible of application to practical politics, because it could only be applied by one
party, and would, in the terms of the Navy League principle, deprive the other party of the
right of defence. As a matter of simple fact, both the Navy League, by its demand for two ships
to one, and Mr. Churchill, by his demand for certain victory, deny in this matter Germany's
right to defend herself; and such denial is bound, on the part of a people animated by like
motives to ourselves, to provoke a challenge. When the Navy League says, as it does, that a
self-respecting nation should not depend upon the goodwill of foreigners for its safety, but
upon its own strength, it recommends Germany to maintain her efforts to arrive at some sort
of equality with ourselves. When Mr. Churchill goes further and says that a nation should be
so strong as to make victory over its rivals certain, he knows that if Germany were to adopt
his own doctrine its inevitable outcome would be war.

The issue is plain: We get a better understanding of certain political facts in Europe, or
we have war. And the Bellicist at present is resolutely opposed to such political education.
And it is for that reason, not because he is asking for adequate armament, that some of the
best of this country look with the deepest misgiving upon his work, and will continue to do
so in increasing degree unless his policy be changed.

Now a word as to the peace Pacifist--the Pacifist sans phrases--as distinct from the military
Pacifist. It is not because I am in favour of defence that I have at times with some emphasis
disassociated myself from certain features and methods of the peace movement, for non-resistance
is no necessary part of that movement, and, indeed, so far as I know, it is no appreciable
part. It is the methods not the object or the ideals of the peace movement which I have ventured
to criticize, without, I hope, offence to men whom I respect in the very highest and sincerest
degree. The methods of Pacifism have in the past, to some extent at least, implied a disposition
to allow easy emotion to take the place of hard thinking, good intention to stand for intellectual
justification; and it is as plain as anything well can be that some of the best emotion of
the world has been expended upon some of the very worst objects, and that in no field of human
effort--medicine, commerce, engineering, legislation--has good intention ever been able to
dispense with the necessity of knowing the how and the why.

It is not that the somewhat question-begging and emotional terminology of some Pacifists--the
appeal to brotherly love and humanity--connotes things which are in themselves poor or mean
(as the average Militarist would imply), but because so much of Pacifism in the past has failed
to reconcile intellectually the claims of these things with what are the fundamental needs
of men and to show their relation and practical application to actual problems and conditions.

[Footnote 8: As a matter of fact, of course, the work of these two men has not been fruitless.
As Lord Morley truly says: "They were routed on the question of the Crimean War, but it was
the rapid spread of their principles which within the next twenty years made intervention impossible
in the Franco-Austrian War, in the American War, in the Danish War, in the Franco-German War,
and above all, in the war between Russia and Turkey, which broke out only the other day."]

[Footnote 9: Thus the Editor of the Spectator:--

"For ourselves, as far as the main economic proposition goes, he preaches to the converted....
If nations were perfectly wise and held perfectly sound economic theories, they would recognize
that exchange is the union of forces, and that it is very foolish to hate or be jealous of
your co-operators.... Men are savage, bloodthirsty creatures ... and when their blood is up
will fight for a word or a sign, or, as Mr. Angell would put it, for an illusion."

Therefore, argues the Spectator, let the illusion continue--for there is no other conclusion
to be drawn from the argument.]

[Footnote 10: Need it be said that this criticism does not imply the faintest want of respect
for Lord Roberts, his qualities and his services. He has ventured into the field of foreign
politics and prophecy. A public man of great eminence, he has expressed an English view of
German "intentions." For the man in the street (I write in that capacity) to receive that expression
in silence is to endorse it, to make it national. And I have stated here the reasons which
make such an attitude disastrous.

But what, it will be said, is the practical outcome? Admitting that we are, or that our fathers
were, in part responsible for this war, that it is their false theories which have made it
necessary, that like false theories on our part may make future wars inevitable--what shall
we do to prevent that catastrophe?

Now while as an "abstract proposition" everyone will admit that the one thing which distinguishes
the civilized man from the savage is a difference of ideas, no one apparently believes that
it is a dangerous and evil thing for the political ideas of savages to dominate most of our
countrymen or that so intangible a thing as "ideas" have any practical importance at all. While
we believe this, of course--to the extent to which we believe it--improvement is out of the
question. We have to realize that civic faith, like religious faith, is of importance; that
if English influence is to stand for the right and not the wrong in human affairs, it is impossible
for each one of us individuals to be wrong; that if the great mass is animated by temper, blindness,
ignorance, passion, small and mean prejudices, it is not possible for "England" to stand for
something quite different and for its influence to be ought but evil. To say that we are "for
our country right or wrong" does not get over the matter at all; rather is it equivalent to
saying that we would as readily have it stand for evil as for good. And we do not in the least
seem to realize that for an Englishman to go on talking wicked nonsense across the dinner table
and making one of the little rivulets of bad temper and prejudice which forms the mighty river
drowning sane judgment is to do the England of our dreams a service as ill (in reality far
more mischievous) as though the plans of fortresses were sold to Germany. We must all learn
to shoot straight; apparently we need not learn to think straight. And yet if Europe could
do the second it could dispense with the first. "Good faith" has a score of connotations, and
we believe apparently that good politics can dispense with all of them and that "Patriotism"
has naught to do with any.

Of course, to shoot straight is so much easier than to think straight, and I suppose at bottom
the bellicist believes that the latter is a hopeless object since "man is not a thinking animal."
He deems, apparently, we must just leave it at that. Of course, if he does leave it at that--if
we persist in believing that it is no good discussing these matters, trying to find out the
truth about them, writing books and building churches--our civilization is going to drift just
precisely as those other civilizations which have been guided by the same dreadful fatalism
have drifted--towards the Turkish goal. "Kismet. Man is a fool to babble of these things; what
he may do is of no avail; all things will happen as they were pre-ordained." And the English
Turk--the man who prefers to fight things out instead of thinking things out--takes the same line.

If he adopts the Turkish philosophy he must be content with the Turkish result. But the Western
world as a whole has refused to be content with the Turkish result, and however tiresome it
may be to know about things, to bother with "theories" and principles, we have come to realise
that we have to choose between one of two courses: either to accept things as they are, not
to worry about improvement or betterment at all, fatalistically to let things slide or--to
find out bit by bit where our errors have been and to correct those errors. This is a hard
road, but it is the road the Western world has chosen; and it is better than the other.

And it has not accepted this road because it expects the millenium to-morrow week. There is
no millenium, and Pacifists do not expect it or talk about it; the word is just one of those
three-shies-a-penny brickbats thrown at them by ignorance. You do not dismiss attempts to correct
errors in medicine or surgery, or education, or tramcars, or cookery, by talking about the
millenium; why should you throw that word at attempts to correct the errors of international
relationship?

Nothing has astonished me more than the fact that the "practical" man who despises "theories"
nearly always criticises Pacifism because it is not an absolute dogma with all its thirty-nine
articles water-tight. "You are a Pacifist, then suppose...," and then follows generally some
very remote hypothesis of what would happen if all the Orient composed its differences and
were to descend suddenly upon the Western world; or some dogmatic (and very theoretical) proposition
about the unchangeability of human nature, and the foolishness of expecting the millenium--an
argument which would equally well have told against the union of Scotland and England or would
equally justify the political parties in a South American republic in continuing to settle
their differences by militarist methods instead of the Pacifist methods of England.

Human nature may be unchanging: it is no reason why we should fight a futile war with Germany
over nothing at all; the yellow peril may threaten; that is a very good reason why we should
compose our differences in Europe. Men always will quarrel, perhaps, over religious questions,
bigotry and fanaticism always will exist--it did not prevent our getting rid of the wars of
religion, still less is it a reason for re-starting them.

The men who made that immense advance--the achievement of religious toleration--possible, were
not completely right and had not a water-tight theory amongst them; they did not bring the
millenium, but they achieved an immense step. They were pioneers of religious freedom, yet
were themselves tyrants and oppressors; those who abolished slavery did a good work, though
much of the world was left in industrial servitude; it was a good thing to abolish judicial
torture, though much of our penal system did yet remain barbaric; it was a real advance to
recognise the errors upon which these things rested, although that recognition did not immediately
achieve a complete, logical, symmetrical and perfect change, because mankind does not advance
that way. And so with war. Pacifism does not even pretend to be a dogma: it is an attempt to
correct in men's minds some of the errors and false theories out of which war grows.

The reply to this is generally that the inaptitude of men for clear thinking and the difficulties
of the issues involved will render any decision save the sheer clash of physical force impossible;
that the field of foreign politics is such a tangle that the popular mind will always fall
back upon decision by force.

As a matter of fact the outstanding principles which serve to improve human conduct, are quite
simple and understandable, as soon as they have been shorn of the sophistries and illusions
with which the pundits clothe them. The real work of the reformers is to hack away these encumbering
theories. The average European has not followed, and could not follow, the amazing and never-ending
disputation on obscure theological points round which raged the Reformation; but the one solid
fact which did emerge from the whole was the general realization that whatever the truth might
be in all this confusion, it was quite evidently wicked and futile to attempt to compel conformity
to any one section of it by force; that in the interests of all force should be withheld; because
if such queries were settled by the accident of predominant force, it would prove, not which
was right, but which was stronger. So in such things as witchcraft. The learned and astute
judges of the 18th century, who sent so many thousands to their death for impossible crimes,
knew far more of the details of witchcraft than do we, and would beat us hopelessly in an argument
on the subject; but all their learning was of no avail, because they had a few simple facts,
the premises, crooked, and we have them straight; and all that we need to know in this amazing
tangle of learned nonsense, is that the probabilities are against an old woman having caused
a storm at sea and drowned a Scottish King. And so with the French Revolution. What the Encyclopaedists
and other pioneers of that movement really did for the European peoples in that matter, was
not to elaborate fantastic schemes of constitution making, but by their argumentation to achieve
the destruction of old political sophistries--Divine Rights of Kings and what not--and to enable
one or two simple facts to emerge clearly and unmistakeably, as that the object of government
is the good of the governed, and can find its justification in nothing else whatsoever. It
was these simple truths which, spreading over the world--with many checks and set-backs--have
so profoundly modified the structure of Christendom.

Somewhere it is related of Montaigne that talking with academic colleagues, he expressed a
contemptuous disbelief in the whole elaborate theory of witchcraft as it existed at that time.
Scandalised, his colleagues took him into the University library, and showed him hundreds,
thousands, of parchment volumes written in Latin by the learned men of the subject. Had he
read these volumes, that he talked so disrespectfully of their contents? No, replied Montaigne,
he had not read them, and he was not going to, because they were all wrong, and he was right.
And Montaigne spoke with this dogmatism because he realised that he saw clearly that which
they did not--the crookedness and unsoundness of just those simple fundamental assumptions
on which the whole fantastic structure was based.

And so with all the sophistries and illusions by which the war system is still defended. If
the public as a whole had to follow all the intricacies of those marvellous diplomatic combinations,
the maze of our foreign politics, to understand abstruse points of finance and economics, in
order to have just and sound ideas as to the real character of international relationship,
why then public opinion would go on being as ignorant and mistaken as it had been hitherto.
But sound opinion and instincts in that field depend upon nothing of the sort, but upon the
emergence of a few quite simple facts, which are indisputable and self-evident, which stare
us in the face, and which absolutely disprove all the elaborate theories of the Bellicist statesmen.

For instance, if conquest and extension of territory is the main road of moral and material
progress, the fundamental need which sets up all these rivalries and collisions, then it is
the populations of the Great States which should be the most enviable; the position of the
Russian should be more desirable than that of the Hollander; it is not. The Austrian should
be better off than the Switzer; he is not. If a nation's wealth is really subject to military
confiscation, and needs the defence of military power, then the wealth of those small states
should be insecure indeed--and Belgian national stocks stand 20 points higher than the German.
If nations are rival units, then we should benefit by the disappearance of our rivals--and
if they disappeared, something like a third of our population would starve to death. If the
growth and prosperity of rival nations threatens us, then we should be in far greater danger
of America to-day than we were some 50 years ago, when the growth of that power disturbed the
sleep of our statesmen (and when, incidentally, we were just as much afraid of the growth of
that power as we are now afraid of the growth of Germany). If the growing power of Russia compelled
us to fight a great war in alliance with the Turk to check her "advance on India," why are
we now co-operating with Russia to build railroads to India?

It is such quite simple questions as these, and the quite plain facts which underlie them which
will lead to sounder conceptions in this matter on the part of the peoples.

It is not we who are the "theorists," if by "theorists" is meant the constructors of elaborate
and deceptive theorems in this matter. It is our opponents, the military mystics, who persistently
shut their eyes to the great outstanding facts of history and of our time. And these fantastic
theories are generally justified by most esoteric doctrine, not by the appeal to the facts
which stare you in the face. I once replied to a critic thus:--

     In examining my critic's balance sheet I remarked that were his
     figures as complete as they were absurdly incomplete and
     misleading, I should still have been unimpressed. We all know that
     very marvellous results are possible with figures; but one can
     generally find some simple fact which puts them to the supreme test
     without undue mathematics. I do not know whether it has ever
     happened to my critic, as it has happened to me, while watching the
     gambling in the casino of a Continental watering resort, to have a
     financial genius present weird columns of figures, which
     demonstrate conclusively, irrefragably, that by this system which
     they embody one can break the bank and win a million. I have never
     examined these figures, and never shall, for this reason: the
     genius in question is prepared to sell his wonderful secret for
     twenty francs. Now, in the face of that fact I am not interested
     in his figures. If they were worth examination they would not be
     for sale.

     And so in this matter there are certain test facts which upset the
     adroitest statistical legerdemain. Though, really, the fallacy
     which regards an addition of territory as an addition of wealth to
     the "owning" nation is a very much simpler matter than the
     fallacies lying behind gambling systems, which are bound up with
     the laws of chance and the law of averages and much else that
     philosophers will quarrel about till the end of time. It requires
     an exceptional mathematical brain really to refute those fallacies,
     whereas the one we are dealing with is due simply to the difficulty
     experienced by most of us in carrying in our heads two facts at the
     same time. It is so much easier to seize on one fact and forget the
     other. Thus we realize that when Germany has conquered
     Alsace-Lorraine she has "captured" a province worth, "cash value,"
     in my critic's phrase, sixty-six millions sterling. What we
     overlook is that Germany has also captured the people who own the
     property and who continue to own it. We have multiplied by x, it
     is true, but we have overlooked the fact that we have had to divide
     by x, and that the resultant is consequently, so far as the
     individual is concerned, exactly what it was before. My critic
     remembered the multiplication all right, but he forgot the
     division.

Just think of all the theories, the impossible theories for which the "practical" man has dragged
the nations into war: the Balance of Power, for instance. Fifteen or twenty years ago it was
the ineradicable belief of fifty or sixty million Americans, good, honest, sincere, and astute
folk, that it was their bounden duty, their manifest interest, to fight--and in the words of
one of their Senators, annihilate--Great Britain, in the interests of the Monroe Doctrine (which
is a form of the "Balance of Power"). I do not think any one knew what the Monroe Doctrine
meant, or could coherently defend it. An American Ambassador had an after-dinner story at the time.

"What is this I hear, Jones, that you do not believe in the Monroe Doctrine?"

"It is a wicked lie. I have said no such thing. I do believe in the Monroe Doctrine. I would
lay down my life for it; I would die for it. What I did say was that I didn't know what it meant."

And it was this vague theory which very nearly drove America into a war that would have been
disastrous to the progress of Anglo-Saxon civilization.

This was at the time of the Venezuelan crisis: the United States, which for nearly one hundred
years had lived in perfect peace with a British power touching her frontier along three thousand
miles, laid it down as a doctrine that her existence was imperilled if Great Britain should
extend by so much as a mile a vague frontier running through a South American swamp thousands
of miles away. And for that cause these decent and honourable people were prepared to take
all the risks that would be involved to Anglo-Saxon civilisation by a war between England and
America. The present writer happened at that time to be living in America, and concerned with
certain political work. Night after night he heard these fulminations against Great Britain;
politicians, Congressmen, Senators, Governors, Ministers, Preachers, clamouring for war, for
a theory as vague and as little practical as one could wish.

And we, of course, have had our like obsessions without number: "the independence integrity
of the Turkish dominion in Europe" is one. Just think of it! Take in the full sound of the
phrase: "the independence integrity of the Turkish dominion in Europe!"

What, of course, makes these fantastic political doctrines possible, what leads men to subscribe
to them, are a few false general conceptions to which they hold tenaciously--as all fundamental
conceptions are held, and ought to be. The general conceptions in question are precisely the
ones I have indicated: that nations are rival and struggling units, that military force is
consequently the determining factor of their relative advantage; that enlargement of political
frontiers is the supreme need, and so on.

And the revision of these fundamental conceptions will, of course, be the general work of Christendom,
and given the conditions which now obtain, the development will go on pari passu in all nations
or not all. It will not be the work of "nations" at all; it will be the work of individual men.

States do not think. It is the men who form the states who think, and the number of those men
who will act as pioneers in a better policy must, of course, at first be small: a group here
and a group there, the best men of all countries--England, France, Germany, America--influencing
by their ideas finally the great mass. To say, as so many do in this matter: "Let other nations
do it first" is, of course, to condemn us all to impotence--for the other nations use the same
language. To ask that one group of forty or seventy or ninety million people shall by some
sort of magic all find their way to a saner doctrine before such doctrine has affected other
groups is to talk the language of childishness. Things do not happen in that in human affairs.
It is not in that way that opinion grows. It did not grow in that way in any one of the steps
that I have mentioned--in the abolition of religious persecution, or slavery, or judicial torture.
Unless the individual man sees his responsibility for determining what is right and knowing
how and why it is right, there will be no progress; there cannot even be a beginning.

We are to an even greater degree an integral part of European Society, and a factor of European
Policy, than we were at the time of the Crimean War, when we mainly determined it; and our
theories and discussions will act and re-act upon that policy just as did any considerable
body of thought, whether French political thought of the eighteenth century, or German religious
thought of the sixteenth century, even at a time when the means of producing that reaction,
the book, literature, the newspaper, rapid communication, were so immeasurably more primitive
and rudimentary than ours. What we think and say and do affects not merely ourselves, but that
whole body politic of Christendom of which we are an integral part.

It is a curious fact that the moral and intellectual interdependence of States preceded by
a long period, that material and economic independence which I have tried recently to make
clear. Nothing is more contrary to fact than to suppose that any considerable movement of opinion
in Europe can be limited to the frontiers of one nation. Even at a time when it took half a
generation for a thought to travel from one capital to another, a student or thinker in some
obscure Italian, Swiss or German village was able to modify policy, to change the face of Europe
and of mankind. Coming nearer to our time, it was the work of the encyclopaedists and earlier
political questioners which made the French Revolution; and the effect of that Revolution was
not confined to France. The ideas which animated it re-acted directly upon our Empire, upon
the American Colonies, upon the Spanish Colonies, upon Italy, and the formation of United Italy,
upon Germany--the world over. These miracles, almost too vast and great to conceive, were the
outcome of that intangible thing, an idea, an aspiration, an ideal. And if they could accomplish
so much in that day when the popular press and cheap literature and improved communication
did not exist, how is it possible to suppose that any great ferment of opinion can be limited
to one group in our day, when we have a condition of things in which the declaration of an
English Cabinet Minister to-night is read to-morrow morning by every reading German?

It should be to our everlasting glory that our political thought in the past, some of our political
institutions, parliamentary government, and what not, have had an enormous influence in the
world. We have some ground for hoping that another form of political institution which we have
initiated, a relationship of distinct political groups into which force does not enter, will
lead the way to a better condition of things in Christendom. We have demonstrated that five
independent nations, the nations of the British Empire, can settle their differences as between
one another without the use of force. We have definitely decided that whatever the attitude
Australia, Canada, and South Africa may adopt to us we shall not use force to change it. What
is possible with five is possible with fifteen nations. Just as we have given to the world
roughly our conception of Parliamentary Government, so it is to be hoped may we give to the
world our conception of the true relationship of nations.

The great steps of the past--religious freedom, the abolition of torture and of slavery, the
rights of the mass, self-government--every real step which man has made has been made because
men "theorised," because a Galileo, or a Luther, or a Calvin, or a Voltaire, Rousseau, Bentham,
Spencer, Darwin, wrote and put notes of interrogation. Had they not done so none of those things
could have been accomplished. The greatest work of the renaissance was the elimination of physical
force in the struggle of religious groups, in religious struggles generally; the greatest work
of our generation will be elimination of physical force from the struggle of the political
groups and from political struggles generally. But it will be done in exactly the same way:
by a common improvement of opinion. And because we possess immeasurably better instruments
for the dissemination of ideas, we should be able to achieve the Political Reformation of Europe
much more rapidly and effectively than our predecessors achieved the great intellectual Reformation
of their time.

What then must we do? Well the first and obvious thing is for each to do his civic duty, for
each to determine that he at least shall not reject, with that silly temper which nearly always
meets most new points of view, principles which do at least seek to explain things, and do
point to the possibility of a better way.

The first thing is to make our own policy right--and that is the work of each one of us; to
correct the temper which made us, for instance, to our shame, the partners of the Turk in his
work of oppression.

And we must realise that mere good intent does not suffice; that understanding, by which alone
we can make headway, is not arrived at by a pleasant emotion like that produced by a Beethoven
Sonata; that we pay for our progress in a little harder money than that, the money of hard
work, in which must be included hard thinking. And having got that far, we must realise that
sound ideas do not spread themselves. They are spread by men. It is one of the astonishing
things in the whole problem of the breaking of war, that while men realise that if women are
to have votes, or men to be made temperate, or the White Slave Traffic to be stopped, or for
that matter, if battleships are to be built, or conscription to be introduced, or soap or pills
to be sold, effort, organisation, time, money, must be put into these things. But the greatest
revolution that the world has known since mankind acquired the right to freedom of opinion,
will apparently get itself accomplished without any of these things; or that at least the Government
can quite easily attend to it by asking other Governments to attend a Conference. We must realise
that a change of opinion, the recognition of a new fact, or of facts heretofore not realised,
is a slow and laborious work, even in the relatively simple things which I have mentioned,
and that you cannot make savages into civilised men by collecting them round a table. For the
Powers of Europe, so far as their national policies are concerned, are still uncivilised individuals.
And their Conferences are bound to fail, when each unit has the falsest conception concerning
the matters under discussion. Governments are the embodied expression of general public opinion--and
not the best public opinion at that; and until opinion is modified, the embodiment of it will
no more be capable of the necessary common action, than would Red Indians be capable of forming
an efficient Court of Law, while knowing nothing of law or jurisprudence, or worse still, having
utterly false notions of the principles upon which human society is based.

And the occasional conferences of private men still hazy as to these principles are bound to
be as ineffective. If the mere meeting and contact of people cleared up misunderstandings,
we should not have Suffragettes and Anti-Suffragettes, or Mr. Lloyd George at grips with the
doctors.

These occasional conferences, whether official, like those of the Hague, or non-official like
those which occasionally meet in London or in Berlin, will not be of great avail in this matter
unless a better public opinion renders them effective. They are of some use and no one would
desire to see them dropped, but they will not of themselves stem or turn the drift of opinion.
What is needed is a permanent organisation of propaganda, framed, not for the purpose of putting
some cut and dried scheme into immediate operation, but with the purpose of clarifying European
public opinion, making the great mass see a few simple facts straight, instead of crooked,
and founded in the hope that ten or fifteen years of hard, steady, persistent work, will create
in that time (by virtue of the superiority of the instruments, the Press and the rest of it
which we possess) a revolution of opinion as great as that produced at the time of the Reformation,
in a period which probably was not more than the lifetime of an ordinary man.

The organization for such permanent work has hardly begun. The Peace Societies have done, and
are doing, a real service, but it is evident, for the reasons already indicated, that if the
great mass are to be affected, instruments of far wider sweep must be used. Our great commercial
and financial interests, our educational and academic institutions, our industrial organizations,
the political bodies, must all be reached. An effort along the right lines has been made thanks
to the generosity of a more than ordinarily enlightened Conservative capitalist. But the work
should be taken up at a hundred points. Some able financier should do for the organization
of Banking--which has really become the Industry of Finance and Credit--the same sort of service
that Sir Charles Macara has done for the cotton industry of the world. The international action
and co-ordination of Trades Unions the world over should be made practical and not, in this
matter, be allowed to remain a merely platonic aspiration.

The greater European Universities should possess endowed Chairs of the Science of International
Statecraft. While we have Chairs to investigate the nature of the relationship of insects,
we have none to investigate the nature of the relationship of man in his political grouping.
And the occupants of these Chairs might change places--that of Berlin coming to London or Oxford,
and that of Oxford going to Berlin.

The English Navy League and the German Navy League alike tell us that the object of their endeavours
is to create an instrument of peace. In that case their efforts should not be confined to increasing
the size of the respective arms, but should also be directed to determining how and why and
when, and under what conditions, and for what purpose that arm should be used. And that can
only be done effectually if the two bodies learn something of the aims and objects of the other.
The need for a Navy, and the size of the Navy, depends upon policy, either our own policy,
or the policy of the prospective aggressor; and to know something of that, and its adjustment,
is surely an integral part of national defence. If both these Navy Leagues, in the fifteen
or sixteen years during which they have been in existence, had possessed an intelligence committee,
each conferring with the other, and spending even a fraction of the money and energy upon disentangling
policy that has been spent upon the sheer bull-dog piling up of armaments, in all human possibility,
the situation which now confronts us would not exist.

Then each political party of the respective Parliaments might have its accredited delegates
in the Lobbies of the other: the Social Democrats might have their permanent delegates in London,
in the Lobbies of the House of Commons; the Labour Party might have their Permanent Delegates
in the Lobbies of the Reichstag; and when any Anglo-German question arose, those delegates
could speak through the mouth of the Members of the Party to which they were accredited, to
the Parliament of the other nation. The Capitalistic parties could have a like bi-national
organisation.

"These are wild and foolish suggestions"--that is possible. They have never, however, been
discussed with a view to the objects in question. All efforts in this direction have been concentrated
upon an attempt to realize mechanically, by some short and royal road, a result far too great
and beneficent to be achieved so cheaply.

Before our Conferences, official or unofficial, can have much success, the parties to them
must divest their minds of certain illusions which at present dominate them. Until that is
done, you might as reasonably expect two cannibals to arrive at a workable scheme for consuming
one another. The elementary conceptions, the foundations of the thing are unworkable. Our statecraft
is still founded on a sort of political cannibalism, upon the idea that nations progress by
conquering, or dominating one another. So long as that is our conception of the relationship
of human groups we shall always stand in danger of collision, and our schemes of association
and co-operation will always break down.

APPENDIX.

Many of the points touched upon in the last two chapters are brought out clearly in a recent
letter addressed to the Press by my friend and colleague Mr. A.W. Haycock. In this letter to
the Press he says:--

     If you will examine systematically, as I have done, the comments
     which have appeared in the Liberal Press, either in the form of
     leading articles, or in letters from readers, concerning Lord
     Roberts' speech, you will find that though it is variously
     described as "diabolical," "pernicious," "wicked," "inflammatory"
     and "criminal," the real fundamental assumptions on which the whole
     speech is based, and which, if correct, justify it, are by
     implication admitted; at any rate, in not one single case that I
     can discover are they seriously challenged.

     Now, when you consider this, it is the most serious fact of the
     whole incident--far more disquieting in reality than the fact of
     the speech itself, especially when we remember that Lord Roberts
     did but adopt and adapt the arguments already used with more
     sensationalism and less courtesy by Mr. Winston Churchill himself.

     The protests against Lord Roberts' speech take the form of denying
     the intention of Germany to attach this country. But how can his
     critics be any more aware of the intentions of Germany--65 millions
     of people acted upon by all sorts of complex political and social
     forces--than is Lord Roberts? Do we know the intention of England
     with reference to Woman's Suffrage or Home Rule or Tariff Reform?
     How, therefore, can we know the intentions of "Germany"?

     Lord Roberts, with courtesy, in form at least and with the warmest
     tribute to the "noble and imaginative patriotism" of German policy,
     assumed that that policy would follow the same general impulse that
     our own has done in the past, and would necessarily follow it since
     the relation between military power and national greatness and
     prosperity was to-day what it always has been. In effect, Lord
     Roberts' case amounts to this:--

     "We have built up our Empire and our trade by virtue of the
     military power of our state; we exist as a nation, sail the seas,
     and carry on our trade, by virtue of our predominant strength; as
     that strength fails we shall do all these things merely on the
     sufferance of stronger nations, who, when pushed by the needs of an
     expanding population to do so, will deprive us of the capacity for
     carrying on those vital functions of life, and transfer the means
     of so doing to themselves to their very great advantage; we have
     achieved such transfer to ourselves in the past by force and must
     expect other nations to try and do the same thing unless we are
     able to prevent them. It is the inevitable struggles of life to be
     fought out either by war or armaments."

     These are not Lord Roberts' words, but the proposition is the clear
     underlying assumption of his speech. And his critics do not
     seriously challenge it. Mr. Churchill by implication warmly
     supports it. At Glasgow he said: "The whole fortune of our race and
     Empire, the whole treasure accumulated during so many centuries of
     sacrifice and achievement would perish and be swept utterly away,
     if our naval supremacy were to be impaired."

     Now why should there be any danger of Germany bringing about this
     catastrophe unless she could profit enormously by so doing? But
     that implies that a nation does expand by military force, does
     achieve the best for its people by that means; it does mean that if
     you are not stronger than your rival, you carry on your trade "on
     sufferance" and at the appointed hour will have it taken from you
     by him. And if that assumption--plainly indicated as it is by a
     Liberal Minister--is right, who can say that Lord Roberts'
     conclusion is not justified?

     Now as to the means of preventing the war. Lord Roberts' formula
     is:--

     "Such a battle front by sea and land that no power or probable
     combination of powers shall dare to attack us without the certainty
     of disaster."

     This, of course, is taken straight from Mr. Churchill, who, at
     Dundee, told us that "the way to make war impossible is to be so
     strong as to make victory certain."

     We have all apparently, Liberals and Conservatives alike, accepted
     this "axiom" as self-evident.

     Well, since it is so obvious as all that we may expect the Germans
     to adopt it. At present they are guided by a much more modest
     principle (enunciated in the preamble of the German Navy Law);
     namely, to be sufficiently strong to make it dangerous for your
     enemy to attack. They must now, according to our "axiom," be so
     strong as to make our defeat certain.

     I am quite sure that the big armament people in Germany are very
     grateful for the advice which Mr. Churchill and Lord Roberts thus
     give to the nations of the world, and we may expect to see German
     armaments so increased as to accord with the new principle.

     And Lord Roberts is courageous enough to abide by the conclusion
     which flows from the fundamental assumption of Liberals and
     Conservatives alike, i.e., that trade and the means of livelihood
     can be transferred by force. We have transferred it in the past. At least, they don't burke the issue.

     The Germans will doubtless note the combination: be so strong as to
     make victory certain, and strike when you have made it certain, and
     they will then, in the light of this advice, be able to put the
     right interpretation upon our endeavours to create a great
     conscript force and our arrangements, which have been going on for
     some years, to throw an expeditionary force on to the continent.

     The outlook is not very pleasant, is it? And yet if you accept the
     "axiom" that our Empire and our trade is dependent upon force and
     can be advantageously attacked by a stronger power there is no
     escape from the inevitable struggle--for the other "axiom" that
     safety can be secured merely by being enormously stronger than your
     rival is, as soon as it is tested by applying it to the two parties
     to the conflict--and, of course, one has as much right to apply it
     as the other--seen to be simply dangerous and muddle-headed
     rubbish. Include the two parties in your "axiom" (as you must) and
     it becomes impossible of application.

     Now the whole problem sifts finally down to this one question: Is
     the assumption made by Lord Roberts and implied by Mr. Churchill
     concerning the relation of military force to trade and national
     life well founded? If it is, conflict is inevitable. It is no good
     crying "panic." If there is this enormous temptation pushing to our
     national ruin, we ought to be in a panic. And if it is not true?
     Even in that case conflict will equally be inevitable unless we
     realise its falseness, for a universal false opinion concerning a
     fact will have the same result in conduct as though the false
     belief were true.

     And my point is that those concerned to prevent this conflict seem
     but mildly interested in examining the foundations of the false
     beliefs that make conflict inevitable. Part of the reluctance to
     study the subject seems to arise from the fear that if we deny the
     nonsensical idea that the British Empire would instantaneously fall
     to pieces were the Germans to dominate the North Sea for 24 hours
     we should weaken the impulse to defence. That is probably an
     utterly false idea, but suppose it is true, is the risk of less
     ardour in defence as great as the risk which comes of having a
     nation of Roberts and Churchills on both sides of the frontier?

     If that happens war becomes not a risk but a certainty.

     And it is danger of happening. I speak from the standpoint of a
     somewhat special experience. During the last 18 months I have
     addressed not scores but many hundreds of meetings on the subject
     of the very proposition on which Lord Roberts' speech is based and
     which I have indicated at the beginning of this letter; I have
     answered not hundreds but thousands of questions arising out of it.
     And I think that gives me a somewhat special understanding of the
     mind of the man in the street. The reason he is subject to panic,
     and "sees red" and will often accept blindly counsels like those of
     Lord Roberts, is that he holds as axioms these primary assumptions
     to which I have referred, namely, that he carries on his daily life
     by virtue of military force, and that the means of carrying it on
     will be taken from him by the first stronger power that rises in
     the world, and that that power will be pushed to do it by the
     advantage of such seizure. And these axioms he never finds
     challenged even by his Liberal guides.

     The issue for those who really desire a better condition is clear.
     So long as by their silence, or by their indifference to the
     discussion of the fundamental facts of this problem they create the
     impression that Mr. Churchill's axioms are unchallengeable, the
     panic-mongers will have it all their own way, and our action will
     be a stimulus to similar action in Germany, and that action will
     again re-act on ours, and so on ad infinitum.

     Why is not some concerted effort made to create in both countries
     the necessary public opinion, by encouraging the study and
     discussion of the elements of the case, in some such way, for
     instance, as that adopted by Mr. Norman Angell in his book?

     One organization due to private munificence has been formed and is
     doing, within limits, an extraordinarily useful work, but we can
     only hope to affect policy by a much more general interest--the
     interest of those of leisure and influence. And that does not seem
     to be forthcoming.

     My own work, which has been based quite frankly on Mr. Angell's
     book, has convinced me that it embodies just the formula most
     readily understanded of the people. It constitutes a constructive
     doctrine of International Policy--the only statement I know so
     definitely applicable to modern conditions.

     But the old illusions are so entrenched that if any impression is
     to be made on public opinion generally, effort must be persistent,
     permanent, and widespread. Mere isolated conferences, disconnected
     from work of a permanent character, are altogether inadequate for
     the forces that have to be met.

     What is needed is a permanent and widespread organization embracing
     Trades Unions, Churches and affiliated bodies, Schools and
     Universities, basing its work on some definite doctrine of
     International Policy which can supplant the present conceptions of
     struggle and chaos.

     I speak, at least, from the standpoint of experience; in the last
     resort the hostility, fear and suspicion which from time to time
     gains currency among the great mass of the people, is due to those
     elementary misconceptions as to the relation of prosperity, the
     opportunities of life, to military power. So long as these
     misconceptions are dominant, nothing is easier than to precipitate
     panic and bad feeling, and unless we can modify them, we shall in
     all human probability drift into conflict; and this incident of
     Lord Roberts' speech and the comment which it has provoked, show
     that for some not very well defined reason, Liberals, quite as much
     as Conservatives, by implication, accept the axioms upon which it
     is based, and give but little evidence that they are seriously
     bestirring themselves to improve that political education upon
     which according to their creed, progress can alone be made.

     Yours very faithfully,

     A.W. HAYCOCK.
