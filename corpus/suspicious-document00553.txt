CHAPTER I

MYSELF

All the days of the week are alike, from their beginning to their end.

At seven in the evening one hears the clock strike gently, and then the instant tumult of the
bell.  I close the desk, wipe my pen, and put it down.  I take my hat and muffler, after a
glance at the mirror--a glance which shows me the regular oval of my face, my glossy hair and
fine mustache.  (It is obvious that I am rather more than a workman.) I put out the light and
descend from my little glass-partitioned office. As pastors and teachers, and even preached Elsbeth took place in the sun
in adults no validity, wherefore should a tormented, often starving boy keep it? He began
to steal on his own step, Gradually a little piece of sugar to a whole secret magazine of eatables
and pilfered away with a good first opportunity Cruisers, six, Sechsbätzner and after he once noted
with bold handles a Brabant and had remained undiscovered for eight days of fear, he gradually
learned to steal without him the fingers were trembling and heart beat. A maid came behind his
merchandise and money magazine their terrible threat the boy made to her slave, he stole from
now on for them and This provided him with sweet glories on the other hand, what a beggar boy
so excellent as the most screwed up city kids taste. His secret Erin fell again in sharp Handel
with another maid, and they knew nothing better in the first anger to do than the Sonnenwirthin
to open the eyes of the infidelity of the enemy, however, this was the scapegoat Pflegsohn and a half
stuffed with Zuckerwaaren old trough, together with a canvas bag with coins all kinds of solidifying
Elsbeth insight was in the long term investments of the finger Hannesle, though not in the fruits
of their educational way.

The two maids were sent off immediately, as happened to the boys be imagined and only the fact
that they beat the same as cruel to the Bader summon Official histories feared to have caused that the
Hannesle longer allowed to stay in the house. Elsbethen smoky worst anger, the boy slipped around
her feet and whined pitifully to to be allowed to stay there and was allowed to stay. But far
from understanding the blunder of the same judge and to conceal wise, learned every guest the
evidence, which the godless Hannesle for the ingratitude of the world grundverderbten delivered,
she led the same even after of recovery in the classroom and told the children what their classmate
and debt as the Hannesle henceforth only "sugar Hannes", called so from then on called him the
same age and adults.
  At that spot in the inky landscape where a tall and twisted
tree seems to writhe as if it had a soul, we begin suddenly to descend, our feet plunging forward.
Down below we see the lights of Viviers sparkle.  These men, whose day is worn out, stride
towards those earthly stars.  One hope is like another in the evening, as one weariness is
like another; we are all alike.  I, also. I go towards my light, like all the others, as on
every evening.

*        *        *        *        *        *

When we have descended for a long time the gradient ends, the avenue flattens out like a river,
and widens as it pierces the town.  Through the latticed boughs of the old plane trees--still
naked on this last day of March--one glimpses the workmen's houses, upright in space, hazy
and fantastic chessboards, with squares of light dabbed on in places, or like vertical cliffs
in which our swarming is absorbed.  Scattering among the twilight colonnade of the trees, these
people engulf themselves in the heaped-up lodgings and rooms; they flow together in the cavity
of doors; they plunge into the houses; and there they are vaguely turned into lights.

I continue to walk, surrounded by several companions who are foremen and clerks, for I do not
associate with the workmen.  Then there are handshakes, and I go on alone.

Some dimly seen wayfarers disappear; the sounds of sliding locks and closing shutters are heard
here and there; the houses have shut themselves up, the night-bound town becomes a desert profound.
I can hear nothing now but my own footfall.

Viviers is divided into two parts--like many towns, no doubt.  First, the rich town, composed
of the main street, where you find the Grand Café, the elegant hotels, the sculptured houses,
the church and the castle on the hill-top.  The other is the lower town, which I am now entering.
It is a system of streets reached by an extension of that avenue which is flanked by the workmen's
barracks and climbs to the level of the factory.  Such is the way which it has been my custom
to climb in the morning and to descend when the light is done, during the six years of my clerkship
with Messrs. Gozlan & Co.  In this quarter I am still rooted.  Some day I should like to live
yonder; but between the two halves of the town there is a division--a sort of frontier, which
has always been and will always be.

In the Rue Verte I meet only a street lamp, and then a mouse-like little girl who emerges from
the shadows and enters them again without seeing me, so intent is she on pressing to her heart,
like a doll, the big loaf they have sent her to buy.  Here is the Rue de l'Etape, my street.
Through the semi-darkness, a luminous movement peoples the hairdresser's shop, and takes shape
on the dull screen of his window. His transparent door, with its arched inscription, opens
just as I pass, and under the soap-dish,[1] whose jingle summons customers, Monsieur Justin
Pocard himself appears, along with a rich gust of scented light.  He is seeing a customer out,
and improving the occasion by the utterance of certain sentiments; and I had time to see that
the customer, convinced, nodded assent, and that Monsieur Pocard, the oracle, was caressing
his white and ever-new beard with his luminous hand.

[Footnote 1: The hanging sign of a French barber.--Tr.]

I turn round the cracked walls of the former tinplate works, now bowed and crumbling, whose
windows are felted with grime or broken into black stars.  A few steps farther I think I saw
the childish shadow of little Antoinette, whose bad eyes they don't seem to be curing; but
not being certain enough to go and find her I turn into my court, as I do every evening.

Every evening I find Monsieur Crillon at the door of his shop at the end of the court, where
all day long he is fiercely bent upon trivial jobs, and he rises before me like a post.  At
sight of me the kindly giant nods his big, shaven face, and the square cap on top, his huge
nose and vast ears.  He taps the leather apron that is hard as a plank. He sweeps me along
to the side of the street, sets my back against the porch and says to me, in a low voice, but
with heated conviction, "That Pétrarque chap, he's really a bad lot."

He takes off his cap, and while the crescendo nodding of his bristly head seems to brush the
night, he adds:  "I've mended him his purse. It had become percolated.  I've put him a patch
on that cost me thirty centimes, and I've resewn the edge with braid, and all the lot. They're
expensive, them jobs.  Well, when I open my mouth to talk about that matter of his sewing-machine
that I'm interested in and that he can't use himself, he becomes congealed."

He recounts to me the mad claims of Trompson in the matter of his new soles, and the conduct
of Monsieur Becret, who, though old enough to know better, had taken advantage of his good
faith by paying for the repair of his spout with a knife "that would cut anything it sees."
He goes on to detail for my benefit all the important matters in his life. Then he says, "I'm
not rich, I'm not, but I'm consentious.  If I'm a botcher, it's 'cos my father and my grandfather
were botchers before me.  There's some that's for making a big stir in the world, there are.
I don't hold with that idea.  What I does, I does."

Suddenly a sonorous tramp persists and repeats itself in the roadway, and a shape of uncertain
equilibrium emerges and advances towards us by fits and starts; a shape that clings to itself
and is impelled by a force stronger than itself.  It is Brisbille, the blacksmith, drunk, as usual.

Espying us, Brisbille utters exclamations.  When he has reached us he hesitates, and then,
smitten by a sudden idea, he comes to a standstill, his boots clanking on the stones, as if
he were a cart.  He measures the height of the curb with his eye, but clenches his fists, swallows
what he wanted to say, and goes off reeling, with an odor of hatred and wine, and his face
slashed with red patches.

"That anarchist!" said Crillon, in disgust; "loathsome notions, now, aren't they?  Ah! who'll
rid us of him and his alcoholytes?" he adds, as he offers me his hand.  "Good-night.  I'm always
saying to the Town Council, 'You must give 'em clink,' I says, 'that gang of Bolshevists, for
the slightest infractionment of the laws against drunkenness.' Yes, indeed!  There's that Jean
Latrouille in the Town Council, eh? They talk about keeping order, but as soon as it's a question
of a-doing of it, they seem like a cold draught."

The good fellow is angry.  He raises his great fist and shakes it in space like a medieval
mace.  Pointing where Brisbille has just plunged floundering into the night, he says, "That's
what Socialists are,--the conquering people what can't stand up on their legs!  I may be a
botcher in life, but I'm for peace and order.  Good-night, good-night. Is she well, Aunt Josephine?
I'm for tranquillity and liberty and order.  That's why I've always kept clear of their crowd.
A bit since, I saw her trotting past, as vivacious as a young girl,--but there, I talk and I talk!"

He enters his shop, but turns on his heel and calls me back, with a mysterious sign.  "You
know they've all arrived up yonder at the castle?"  Respect has subdued his voice; a vision
is absorbing him of the lords and ladies of the manor, and as he leaves me he bows, instinctively.

His shop is a narrow glass cage, which is added to our house, like a family relation.  Within
I can just make out the strong, plebeian framework of Crillon himself, upright beside a serrated
heap of ruins, over which a candle is enthroned.  The light which falls on his accumulated
tools and on those hanging from the wall makes a decoration obscurely golden around the picture
of this wise man; this soul all innocent of envious demands, turning again to his botching,
as his father and grandfather botched.

I have mounted the steps and pushed our door; the gray door, whose only relief is the key.
The door goes in grumblingly, and makes way for me into the dark passage, which was formerly
paved, though now the traffic of soles has kneaded it with earth, and changed it into a footpath.
My forehead strikes the lamp, which is hooked on the wall; it is out, oozing oil, and it stinks.
One never sees that lamp, and always bangs it.

And though I had hurried so--I don't know why--to get home, at this moment of arrival I slow
down.  Every evening I have the same small and dull disillusion.

I go into the room which serves us as kitchen and dining-room, where my aunt is lying.  This
room is buried in almost complete darkness.

"Good evening, Mame."

A sigh, and then a sob arise from the bed crammed against the pale celestial squares of the window.

Then I remember that there was a scene between my old aunt and me after our early morning coffee.
Thus it is two or three times a week.  This time it was about a dirty window-pane, and on this
particular morning, exasperated by the continuous gush of her reproaches, I flung an offensive
word, and banged the door as I went off to work.  So Mame has had to weep all the day.  She
has fostered and ruminated her spleen, and sniffed up her tears, even while busy with household
duties.  Then, as the day declined, she put out the lamp and went to bed, with the object of
sustaining and displaying her chagrin.

When I came in she was in the act of peeling invisible potatoes; there are potatoes scattered
over the floor, everywhere.  My feet kick them and send them rolling heavily among odds and
ends of utensils and a soft deposit of garments that are lying about.  As soon as I am there
my aunt overflows with noisy tears.

Not daring to speak again, I sit down in my usual corner.

Over the bed I can make out a pointed shape, like a mounted picture, silhouetted against the
curtains, which slightly blacken the window. It is as though the quilt were lifted from underneath
by a stick, for my Aunt Josephine is leanness itself.

Gradually she raises her voice and begins to lament.  "You've no feelings, no--you're heartless,--that
dreadful word you said to me,--you said, 'You and your jawing!'  Ah! people don't know what
I have to put up with--ill-natured--cart-horse!"

In silence I hear the tear-streaming words that fall and founder in the dark room from that
obscure blot on the pillow which is her face.

I stand up.  I sit down again.  I risk saying, "Come now, come; that's all done with."

She cries:  "Done with?  Ah! it will never be done with!"

With the sheet that night is begriming she muzzles herself, and hides her face.  She shakes
her head to left and to right, violently, so as to wipe her eyes and signify dissent at the
same time.

"Never!  A word like that you said to me breaks the heart forever.  But I must get up and get
you something to eat.  You must eat.  I brought you up when you were a little one,"--her voice
capsizes--"I've given up all for you, and you treat me as if I were an adventuress."

I hear the sound of her skinny feet as she plants them successively on the floor, like two
boxes.  She is seeking her things, scattered over the bed or slipped to the floor; she is swallowing
sobs.  Now she is upright, shapeless in the shadow, but from time to time I see her remarkable
leanness outlined.  She slips on a camisole and a jacket,--a spectral vision of garments which
unfold themselves about her handle-like arms, and above the hollow framework of her shoulders.

She talks to herself while she dresses, and gradually all my life-history, all my past comes
forth from what the poor woman says,--my only near relative on earth; as it were my mother
and my servant.

She strikes a match.  The lamp emerges from the dark and zigzags about the room like a portable
fairy.  My aunt is enclosed in a strong light. Her eyes are level with her face; she has heavy
and spongy eyelids and a big mouth which stirs with ruminated sorrow.  Fresh tears increase
the dimensions of her eyes, make them sparkle and varnish the points of her cheeks.  She comes
and goes with undiminished spleen.  Her wrinkles form heavy moldings on her face, and the skin
of chin and neck is so folded that it looks intestinal, while the crude light tinges it all
with something like blood.

Now that the lamp is alight some items become visible of the dismal super-chaos in which we
are walled up,--the piece of bed-ticking fastened with two nails across the bottom of the window,
because of draughts; the marble-topped chest of drawers, with its woolen cover; and the door-lock,
stopped with a protruding plug of paper.

The lamp is flaring, and as Mame does not know where to stand it among the litter, she puts
it on the floor and crouches to regulate the wick. There rises from the medley of the old lady,
vividly variegated with vermilion and night, a jet of black smoke, which returns in parachute
form.  Mame sighs, but she cannot check her continual talk.

"You, my lad, you who are so genteel when you like, and earn a hundred and eighty francs a
month,--you're genteel, but you're short of good manners, it's that chiefly I find fault with
you about.  So you spat on the window-pane; I'm certain of it.  May I drop dead if you didn't.
And you're nearly twenty-four!  And to revenge yourself because I'd found out that you'd spat
on the window, you told me to stop my jawing, for that's what you said to me, after all.  Ah,
vulgar fellow that you are!  The factory gentlemen are too kind to you.  Your poor father was
their best workman.  You are more genteel than your poor father, more English; and you preferred
to go into business rather than go on learning Latin, and everybody thought you quite right;
but for hard work you're not much good--ah, la, la!  Confess that you spat on the window.

"For your poor mother," the ghost of Mame goes on, as she crosses the room with a wooden spoon
in her hand, "one must say that she had good taste in dress.  That's no harm, no; but certainly
they must have the wherewithal.  She was always a child.  I remember she was twenty-six when
they carried her away.  Ah, how she loved hats!  But she had handsome ways, for all that, when
she said, 'Come along with us, Josephine!'  So I brought you up, I did, and sacrificed everything...."

Overcome by the mention of the past, Mame's speech and action both cease.  She chokes and wags
her head and wipes her face with her sleeve.

I risk saying, gently, "Yes, I know it well."

A sigh is my answer.  She lights the fire.  The coal sends out a cushion of smoke, which expands
and rolls up the stove, falls back, and piles its muslin on the floor.  Mame manipulates the
stove with her feet in the cloudy deposit; and the hazy white hair which escapes from her black
cap is also like smoke.

Then she seeks her handkerchief and pats her pockets to get the velvet coal-dust off her fingers.
Now, with her back turned, she is moving casseroles about.  "Monsieur Crillon's father," she
says, "old Dominic, had come from County Cher to settle down here in '66 or '67.  He's a sensible
man, seeing he's a town councilor.  (We must tell him nicely to take his buckets away from
our door.)  Monsieur Bonéas is very rich, and he speaks so well, in spite of his bad neck.
You must show yourself off to all these gentlemen.  You're genteel, and you're already getting
a hundred and eighty francs a month, and it's vexing that you haven't got some sign to show
that you're on the commercial side, and not a workman, when you're going in and out of the
factory."

"That can be seen easily enough."

"I'd rather you had a badge."

Breathing damply and forcefully, she sniffs harder and quicker, and looks here and there for
her handkerchief; she prowls with the lamp. As my eyes follow her, the room awakens more and
more.  My groping gaze discovers the tiled floor, the conference of chairs backed side by side
against the wall, the motionless pallor of the window in the background above the low and swollen
bed, which is like a heap of earth and plaster, the clothes lying on the floor like mole-hills,
the protruding edges of tables and shelves, pots, bottles, kettles and hanging clouts, and
that lock with the cotton-wool in its ear.

"I like orderliness so much," says Mame as she tacks and worms her way through this accumulation
of things, all covered with a downy layer of dust like the corners of pastel pictures.

According to habit, I stretch out my legs and put my feet on the stool, which long use has
polished and glorified till it looks new.  My face turns this way and that towards the lean
phantom of my aunt, and I lull myself with the sounds of her stirring and her endless murmur.

And now, suddenly, she has come near to me.  She is wearing her jacket of gray and white stripes
which hangs from her acute shoulders, she puts her arm around my neck, and trembles as she
says, "You can mount high, you can, with the gifts that you have.  Some day, perhaps, you will
go and tell men everywhere the truth of things.  That has happened.  There have been men who
were in the right, above everybody. Why shouldn't you be one of them, my lad, you one of these
great apostles!"

And with her head gently nodding, and her face still tear-stained, she looks afar, and sees
the streets attentive to my eloquence!

*        *        *        *        *        *

Hardly has this strange imagining in the bosom of our kitchen passed away when Mame adds, with
her eyes on mine, "My lad, mind you, never look higher than yourself.  You are already something
of a home-bird; you have already serious and elderly habits.  That's good.  Never try to be
different from others."

"No danger of that, Mame."

No, there is no danger of that.  I should like to remain as I am. Something holds me to the
surroundings of my infancy and childhood, and I should like them to be eternal.  No doubt I
hope for much from life. I hope, I have hopes, as every one has.  I do not even know all that
I hope for, but I should not like too great changes.  In my heart I should not like anything
which changed the position of the stove, of the tap, of the chestnut wardrobe, nor the form
of my evening rest, which faithfully returns.

*        *        *        *        *        *

The fire alight, my aunt warms up the stew, stirring it with the wooden spoon.  Sometimes there
spurts from the stove a mournful flame, which seems to illumine her with tatters of light.

I get up to look at the stew.  The thick brown gravy is purring.  I can see pale bits of potato,
and it is uncertainly spotted with the mucosity of onions.  Mame pours it into a big white
plate.  "That's for you," she says; "now, what shall I have?"

We settle ourselves each side of the little swarthy table.  Mame is fumbling in her pocket.
Now her lean hand, lumpy and dark, unroots itself.  She produces a bit of cheese, scrapes it
with a knife which she holds by the blade, and swallows it slowly.  By the rays of the lamp,
which stands beside us, I see that her face is not dry.  A drop of water has lingered on the
cheek that each mouthful protrudes, and glitters there.  Her great mouth works in all directions,
and sometimes swallows the remains of tears.

So there we are, in front of our plates, of the salt which is placed on a bit of paper, of
my share of jam, which is put into a mustard-pot. There we are, narrowly close, our foreheads
and hands brought together by the light, and for the rest but poorly clothed by the huge gloom.
Sitting in this jaded armchair, my hands on this ill-balanced table,--which, if you lean on
one side of it, begins at once to limp,--I feel that I am deeply rooted where I am, in this
old room, disordered as an abandoned garden, this worn-out room, where the dust touches you softly.

After we have eaten, our remarks grow rarer.  Then Mame begins again to mumble; once again
she yields to emotion under the harsh flame of the lamp, and once again her eyes grow dim in
her complicated Japanese mask that is crowned with cotton-wool, and something dimly shining
flows from them.

The tears of the sensitive old soul plash on that lip so voluminous that it seems a sort of
heart.  She leans towards me, she comes so near, so near, that I feel sure she is touching me.

I have only her in the world to love me really.  In spite of her humors and her lamentations
I know well that she is always in the right.

I yawn, while she takes away the dirty plates and proceeds to hide them in a dark corner. 
She fills the big bowl from the pitcher and then carries it along to the stove for the crockery.

Antonia has given me an appointment for eight o'clock, near the Kiosk. It is ten past eight.
I go out.  The passage, the court,--by night all these familiar things surround me even while
they hide themselves.  A vague light still hovers in the sky.  Crillon's prismatic shop gleams
like a garnet in the bosom of the night, behind the riotous disorder of his buckets.  There
I can see Crillon,--he never seems to stop,--filing something, examining his work close to
a candle which flutters like a butterfly ensnared, and then, reaching for the glue-pot which
steams on a little stove.  One can just see his face, the engrossed and heedless face of the
artificer of the good old days; the black plates of his ill-shaven cheeks; and, protruding
from his cap, a vizor of stiff hair. He coughs, and the window-panes vibrate.

In the street, shadow and silence.  In the distance are venturing shapes, people emerging or
entering, and some light echoing sounds. Almost at once, on the corner, I see Monsieur Joseph
Bonéas vanishing, stiff as a ramrod.  I recognized the thick white kerchief, which consolidates
the boils on his neck.  As I pass the hairdresser's door it opens, just as it did a little
while ago, and his agreeable voice says, "That's all there is to it, in business."  "Absolutely,"
replies a man who is leaving.  In the oven of the street one can see only his littleness--he
must be a considerable personage, all the same. Monsieur Pocard is always applying himself
to business and thinking of great schemes.  A little farther, in the depths of a cavity, stoppered
by an iron-grilled window, I divine the presence of old Eudo, the bird of ill omen, the strange
old man who coughs, and has a bad eye, and whines continually.  Even indoors he must wear his
mournful cloak and the lamp-shade of his hood.  People call him a spy, and not without reason.

Here is the Kiosk.  It is waiting quite alone, with its point in the darkness.  Antonia has
not come, for she would have waited for me.  I am impatient first, and then relieved.  A good
riddance.

No doubt Antonia is still tempting when she is present.  There is a reddish fever in her eyes,
and her slenderness sets you on fire.  But I am hardly in harmony with the Italian.  She is
particularly engrossed in her private affairs, with which I am not concerned.  Big Victorine,
always ready, is worth a hundred of her; or Madame Lacaille, the pensively vicious; though
I am equally satiated of her, too.  Truth to tell, I plunge unreflectingly into a heap of amorous
adventures which I shortly find vulgar.  But I can never resist the magic of a first temptation.

I shall not wait.  I go away.  I skirt the forge of the ignoble Brisbille.  It is the last
house in that chain of low hills which is the street.  Out of the deep dark the smithy window
flames with vivid orange behind its black tracery.  In the middle of that square-ruled page
of light I see transparently outlined the smith's eccentric silhouette, now black and sharp,
now softly huge.  Spectrally through the glare, and in blundering frenzy, he strives and struggles
and fumbles horribly on the anvil.  Swaying, he seems to rush to right and to left, like a
passenger on a hell-bound ferry.  The more drunk he is, the more furiously he falls upon his
iron and his fire.

I return home.  Just as I am about to enter a timid voice calls me--"Simon!"

It is Antonia.  So much the worse for her.  I hurry in, followed by the weak appeal.

I go up to my room.  It is bare and always cold; always I must shiver some minutes before I
shake it back to life.  As I close the shutters I see the street again; the massive, slanting
blackness of the roofs and their population of chimneys clear-cut against the minor blackness
of space; some still waking, milk-white windows; and, at the end of a jagged and gloomy background,
the blood-red stumbling apparition of the mad blacksmith.  Farther still I can make out in
the cavity the cross on the steeple; and again, very high and blazing with light on the hill-top,
the castle, a rich crown of masonry.  In all directions the eye loses itself among the black
ruins which conceal their hosts of men and of women--all so unknown and so like myself.

CHAPTER II

OURSELVES

It is Sunday.  Through my open window a living ray of April has made its way into my room.
It has transformed the faded flowers of the wallpaper and restored to newness the Turkey-red
stuff which covers my dressing-table.

I dress carefully, dallying to look at myself in the glass, closely and farther away, in the
fresh scent of soap.  I try to make out whether my eyes are little or big.  They are the average,
no doubt, but it really seems to me that they have a tender brightness.

Then I look outside.  It would seem that the town, under its misty blankets in the hollow of
the valley, is awaking later than its inhabitants.

These I can see from up here, spreading abroad in the streets, since it is Sunday.  One does
not recognize them all at once, so changed are they by their unusual clothes;--women, ornate
with color, and more monumental than on week days; some old men, slightly straightened for
the occasion; and some very lowly people, whom only their cleanness vaguely disguises.

The weak sunshine is dressing the red roofs and the blue roofs and the sidewalks, and the tiny
little stone setts all pressed together like pebbles, where polished shoes are shining and
squeaking.  In that old house at the corner, a house like a round lantern of shadow, gloomy
old Eudo is encrusted.  It forms a comical blot, as though traced on an old etching.  A little
further, Madame Piot's house bulges forth, glazed like pottery.  By the side of these uncommon
dwellings one takes no notice of the others, with their gray walls and shining curtains, although
it is of these that the town is made.

Halfway up the hill, which rises from the river bank, and opposite the factory's plateau, appears
the white geometry of the castle, and around its pallors a tapestry of reddish foliage, and
parks.  Farther away, pastures and growing crops which are part of the demesne; farther still,
among the stripes and squares of brown earth or verdant, the cemetery, where every year so
many stones spring up.

*        *        *        *        *        *

We have to call at Brisbille's, my aunt and I, before Church.  We are forced to tolerate him
thus, so as to get our twisted key put right.  I wait for Mame in the court, sitting on a tub
by the shop, which is lifeless to-day, and full of the scattered leavings of toil.  Mame is
never ready in time.  She has twice appeared on the threshold in her fine black dress and velvet
cape; then, having forgotten something, she has gone back very quickly, like a mole.  Finally,
she must needs go up to my room, to cast a last glance over it.

At last we are off, side by side.  She takes my arm proudly.  From time to time she looks at
me, and I at her, and her smile is an affectionate grimace amid the sunshine.

When we have gone a little way, my aunt stops, "You go on," she says; "I'll catch you up."

She has gone up to Apolline, the street-sweeper.  The good woman, as broad as she is long,
was gaping on the edge of the causeway, her two parallel arms feebly rowing in the air, an
exile in the Sabbath idleness, and awkwardly conscious of her absent broom.

Mame brings her along, and looking back as I walk, I hear her talking of me, hastily, as one
who confides a choking secret, while Apolline follows, with her arms swinging far from her
body, limping and outspread like a crab.

Says Mame, "That boy's bedroom is untidy.  And then, too, he uses too many shirt-collars, and
he doesn't know how to blow his nose.  He stuffs handkerchiefs into his pockets, and you find
them again like stones."

"All the same, he's a good young man," stammers the waddling street cleanser, brandishing her
broom-bereaved hands at random, and shaking over her swollen and many-storied boots a skirt
weighted round the hem by a coat-of-mail of dry mud.

These confidences with which Mame is in the habit of breaking forth before no matter whom get
on my nerves.  I call her with some impatience.  She starts at the command, comes up, and throws
me a martyr's glance.

She proceeds with her nose lowered under her black hat with green foliage, hurt that I should
thus have summoned her before everybody, and profoundly irritated.  So a persevering malice
awakens again in the depths of her, and she mutters, very low, "You spat on the window the
other day!"

But she cannot resist hooking herself again on to another interlocutor, whose Sunday trousers
are planted on the causeway, like two posts, and his blouse as stiff as a lump of iron ore.
I leave them, and go alone into Brisbille's.

The smithy hearth befires a workshop which bristles with black objects. In the middle of the
dark bodies of implements hanging from walls and ceiling is the metallic Brisbille, with leaden
hands, his dark apron rainbowed with file-dust,--dirty on principle, because of his ideas,
this being Sunday.  He is sober, and his face still unkindled, but he is waiting impatiently
for the church-going bell to begin, so that he may go and drink, in complete solitude.

Through an open square, in the ponderous and dirt-shaggy glazing of the smithy, one can see
a portion of the street, and a sketch, in bright and airy tones, of scattered people.  It is
like the sharply cut field of vision in an opera-glass, in which figures are drawn and shaded,
and cross each other; where one makes out, at times, a hat bound and befeathered, swaying as
it goes; a little boy with sky-blue tie and buttoned boots, and tubular knickers hanging round
his thin, bare calves; a couple of gossiping dames in swollen and somber petticoats, who tack
hither and thither, meet, are mutually attracted and dissolve in conversation, like rolling
drops of ink.  In the foreground of this colored cinema which goes by and passes again, Brisbille,
the sinister, is ranting away, as always.  He is red and lurid, spotted with freckles, his
hair greasy, his voice husky.  For a moment, while he paces to and fro in his cage, dragging
shapeless and gaping shoes behind him, he speaks to me in a low voice, and close to my face,
in gusts.  Brisbille can shout, but not talk; there must be a definite pressure of anger before
his resounding huskiness issues from his throat.

Mame comes in.  She sits on a stool to get her breath again, all the while brandishing the
twisted key which she clasps to the prayer-book in her hand.  Then she unburdens herself and
begins to speak in fits and starts of this key, of the mishap which twisted it, and of all
the multiple details which overlap each other in her head.  But the slipshod, gloomy smith's
attention is suddenly attracted by the hole which shows the street.

"The lubber!" he roars.

It is Monsieur Fontan who is passing, the wine-merchant and café-proprietor.  He is an expansive
and imposing man, fat-covered, and white as a house.  He never says anything and is always
alone.  A great personage he is; he makes money; he has amassed hundreds of thousands of francs.
At noon and in the evening he is not to be seen, having dived into the room behind the shop,
where he takes his meals in solitude.  The rest of the time he just sits at the receipt of
custom and says nothing.  There is a hole in his counter where he slides the money in.  His
house is filling with money from morning till night.

"He's a money-trap," says Mame.

"He's rich," I say.

"And when you've said that," jeers Brisbille, "you've said all there is to say.  Why, you damned
snob, you're only a poor drudge, like all us chaps, but haven't you just got the snob's ideas?"

I make a sign of impatience.  It is not true, and Brisbille annoys me with the hatred which
he hurls at random, hit or miss; and all the more because he is himself visibly impressed by
the approach of this man who is richer than the rest.  The rebel opens his steely eye and relapses
into silence, like the rest of us, as the big person grows bigger. ... I can not say what I feel, it is unspeakable! ...
Every time I came here to tell you, is for me the hell up not too hot with you and the heavens
above matter, because I'm down there and in there! ... More recently,'s has changed, besides
the heaven is hell with all its pain in me woke up! ... More than once I would have liked to
jump the lake of misery and heartache! ... At all, the red Fritz's fault ... He is the incarnate Evil
One, me yet to ... I do not know to what could drive! "

Silently, the Emmerence listened this long, broken speech of the sugar Hannes, silence and thought
they looked to the ground, trembling with excitement, passion is the Hans before it, finally
it addresses the main up and says with quiet earnestness:

"You see, it pleases me, Hans, because you love me so very dear, God knows that I love you not
hate and love for her husband would have, for you are righteous, honest, industrious, and
sent in the farmer's business. But at my age one may just not be talking about the heart,
but the mind has to treat the first word! ... With you I know nothing wrong, but that you For
me, probably are too young and have no money! ... The red Fritz fits far more likely to think
Years and he has money and friends, is a native of the local places
and at all times willing and ready to take me!

"

Bleaching the sugar Hannes Todt looks at the Emmerence, lips quivering, hands shaking, the
heart beats audibly, but not a word it produces.

"As I said, I would take up essentially better than him, you may believe it, wanted to end also
be foreseen from your youth, but take money, Jack, money, and how not to steal? "

"Money and money anytime, anywhere, damn money!" Hannah calls the sugar in wild excitement and
continues: "If I had to prescribe me the devil, that he managed to bring us money, I would do
it, yes I would do it for your sake! ... 'Tis, Gottlob not necessary, I've already said that
it is not me by a few hundred guilders afraid! ... The heart may Spaniol and inside are not much
use, but his plan is good! ... I have more than half a Night in the hole with him about it and
he talked to me so often set apart Everything that I still know every word! ... Emmerence love
Emmerence if you take someone else, I jump in the lake or cut off
my throat!

... I can not live without and do not live like up!

... Promise me into the right to take no one else, least of all the red Fritz, I want money
herschaffen enough and love to stay alone as I am when I may remain
only in your area!

... Promise! "

"No, Hans, I can not and must not promise it!"

"Well, goodbye, you never see me again!" [Again!] ... Just one more hand for this world, 'the
poor calls by the expression of the deepest despair.

"Do not be a fool, Hans do, not as one might fear from the eagle,
and indeed almost her look Two long time, what we are negotiating
with each other!

... It is cool and is time, therefore, hear What I have decided: I want to say anything definite Fritz
three months ago and wait if you get really into money. What more can I do not leave it at
... Here you have your hand on it! ... Sleep well! "With these words stands the Emmerence, with
the padded chair in the little house, wishes once again good night and then closes the Door. Like
a dreamer you look the sugar Hannes, then he limped hurriedly and
with himself talking to the eagle.

The next morning a servant in the Adler is less, because the sugar
is missing and the head servant Hannah know nothing to say than that
the same had come home late, put on Sunday clothes and said that he
had to take a walk on the spot, if he also his service cost, will
return as soon as possible and would like to pay a day laborer, which,
however, do the work for him.

Wherever he went, and wherefore, he confided to any soul, and because
the head servant of the strange Host already knew that and would rather
not like talking to himself as with others, urged is not the same
with many questions and let him go.

Before we catch up with the night walkers, we must do many things.

We already know that the writings of the same, which come from the home, a bad Impression on the
residents of Moss Court did.

The better the sugar Hannes Mart after a long experience in the religious Sonnenwirthin the mild, friendly
treatment in Mooshof done so far and the more he gave the hope that
for him, better days are finally dawned, the more bitter the bitterness
he now felt and offensive, in which the visible changes in behavior
of the residents against him were known.

He had made mistakes, but the fault of a uneducated and abused boys, was also hard enough to
atone for being able to wait for the end of sentences may and because this failed to now, he ran
themselves in the thought that he was actually right for Adversity and misfortune born and
for him there was neither heaven nor an earthly father Friend to
whom he could confide.

This murky life experiences of many poor and needy with forced upon
thought an immense amount to indifference, to doubt, and often the
hatred of God and divine Bids for such an intimate dealings with criminals
and people from all, especially may come from the lowest levels of
the people and pressed teach everyone.

The appalling sum of the exposed and known woe that weighs on people, Woe is rooted in secret,
which none of the others entrusted to easily and frequently not enough to entrust be because
many feel it painful, but few recognize clearly and distinctly.

The Bläsi, who was in the moss and the farmers all except one of a proud, violent temper not
much accused rushed, insgemein on the other servants and maids, that the same considered with
and without sugar Hannes occasion with unconcealed disdain and contempt and treated with open
suspicion, to effect that the same Mooshof soon voluntarily shun.

These things hurt the sugar Hannes huge and because the teasing and
bullying do not stopped, but he wanted to avoid any occasion of his
expulsion bring demand and could, he avoided all social as much as
he could and because the servants and maids not missed, even other
people from the hustle and bustle of the goitrous, limping Black Forest
to tell who picked up behind some fences, early and become a rogue
is probably not for nothing left as far from home, so this was looking
outside Court of moss no mates and it was a walk into town or to church,
the worst all work.

He held his neighing and horned care wards for far better and fairer than the people and gave
it a whole in Hegan, who complained seriously that horses, cattle and Dogs are not able to speak,
it was first. He did not doubt, Their souls are also immortal, and after the death of the sky full
of thousand colored golden box and feed Mats worthier than most of their masters. Since then, assured
him a wag of animal doctor every animal in an unhappy home, exiled human soul and the animal world
is actually took a walking purgatory, the sugar Hannes more and more attention to irrational animals,
talking not only to stall his people what the same care and understanding
of other servants can also listen to, but quite serious things that
you normally only speaks with his peers.

boredom plagued him at long,
quiet Sunday afternoon and he told the cattle of the valleys and pine
forests of the Black Forest, from Elsbeth and Katzenlene, the frame
maker and Mr. vicar or something had happened to him and told him
of his Anti-woe and sorrow, then sometimes he stared intently at the
Dun with their large, melancholy eyes, moving the lips now and again
and roared dull and miserable or angry, or directed the Blaze communicate
the bright eyes with an indescribable expression on him, shaking occasionally
the mane pricked, ears, snorting, neighing and pawing impatient with
his front feet, Hannes sugar but thought this was clear evidence of
complete understanding and cordial Compassion and never gave up hope,
the Dun or Blaze, and his favorites another piece would turn once
unexpected upside for him, his mouth and a aufthun properly set speech
in the German best start as:

"Look, Hans, we can not talk with other
people, although we are capable of and why?

Because so little righteous walk the earth and the millions of people, not one is, from which
the curse of sin would be taken. Our ancestors were better than we have chatted with Adam in Paradise,
many hours, but are with original sin Human souls come to us, the curse has been handed to us
and one of our greatest Torture is that we only just or very rarely with a small sinner can talk
and yet want to talk to Allen, in particular with Thierquälern whose soul commonly enters a
Postgaul. You still small defects to you, but yet a hard life out, the Lord God has mercy on you
loneliness and us for special occasions solved up to the tongue "! -

The hope for such a response was never fulfilled, hoping and waiting makes some a fool and
could not miss that sugar Hannes his bizarre thoughts like in the stable, so also sometimes be
loud when people left.

The servants and maids were laughing, the Moose laughed at first, but since he knew that the Black
Forest go on Sundays and public holidays, but with other people to the church, but then, especially
when the weather is not always the same inside, but wander in the fields and Forest around
or return to his stable or in the barn back stealthily, as He shook his head doubtfully, watching
the sugar Hannah was secretly, at least in religion the same mistake and made it through the
threat of instantaneous discharge turn to a hard-working residents of worship.

The laughter of the servants and the maids did not stop giggling, behind the laughter and giggles
put in this and that something evil, envy and revenge, and the Black
Forest lent to the occasion.

He held the cattle of the moss court in such excellent condition as
it never the case been, was the work of the first and last and the
more it the farmer and his wife for Thanks knew, the less he knew
for the servants.

Because he worked far more than would be otherwise hard-working servants in the case, maintains
were obliged to exert his fellow servants also far more so that he does not always a model
presented and would be accused and this was not fond of them. They alleged that the Black
Forest flay and pest away from pure anger and hatred they did, all that the same work to complicate
and entleiden taught, but made little and probably even during otherwise
Bläsi time his pride and resentment against the sugar Hannes had let
go, was the latter even the most help to the minds of Mitdienenden
to exasperate against it and make them irreconcilable.

The Moose was his dearest and highest value, therefore he also loved
the Black Forest, raised him from the rank of Stallbeherrschers Roßbuben
soon and would have more than the Bläsi that the service aufgekündiget.

The Stallbeherrscher grew the comb, he was in many respects Befehlerles play and how anger and
hatred towards others is really the tail of his tireless were, he did more to take revenge for
wrongs, and the distrust of his honesty be thoroughly removed.

There is seldom a house in which lives a number of different people, without awkwardness, Indolence,
negligence and breach of trust at least play a minor role. The Mooshof was far and wide as one
of the best farms and so with full right, but corrupt and embezzling Much has yet year after
year even without the owners say something about it in Were unable, either because the debt was
provable or unknown. Well played the sugar Hannes in addition to the role of a servant, the
pattern of an incorruptible a police commissioner with more greater
desire to get right to secure in the favor of farmers and moss on
the Mitdienenden to avenge.

No servant, no servant spoiled a little something or did something out of the court, without the
courtiers knew it and if it had arrived at our hero, it would several times a week have sold
heavy Handel. He lied and slandered, but put He did much of his rule, which neither this nor
did he use and better in silence had been passed over.

The Mitdienenden hated the "hungry, well-servant and Kalfakterer"
with all my heart, but because nothing would help the hate, they were
divided about six months after arrival Sugar Hannah into two parties,
namely, one that in which the hatred of the fear predominated and
was happy to sit in the nest would remain peaceful and suspicious
in the old and hostile, the head of the clever and honest, fearless
Bläsi Wherefore also remained be of no soldier should have to open
a cowardly war not peace is preferable.

These factions took place shortly before the consecration, the head of the peaceable party, the
Meistermagd invited the sugar Hannes, now to do well even as other people and with her to
go the Margret and Jockel, and some others into the inn, and the dance, for if he and his crooked
foot could not dance well, he could yet healths drink and be merry with them.

The Moose and the Moosbäurin even talked to the Stallbeherrscher to accept the invitation, but
this shook his head, that shook the tip cap, together with the upper breast and said even
insolently:

"Am I not previously been good enough so you are now me no. Go, dancing
and swill, and complaining about me as much as you want, I prefer
the Bless You All, together with a and all, I will have nothing to
do with you and not fear you.

I am not so foolish to give my money the landlord! "

Such unchristian giving birth has atoned for the sugar Hannes difficult.

He regretted it soon, that friendly with the peacemakers and won some residents for themselves,
but the Bläsi kept the upper hand and finally succeeded in a sugar
Hannes to attract the worst case.

One Sunday afternoon a friend of the one-eyed Stoffel creeps in on this Stable, and offers
him a magnificent Ulmer whistle with silver hardware and silver Kettlein, like love teamsters
and servants in Swabia, to a ridiculous price to buy.

The sugar is the one-eyed Hannah, whom he met later in the official
prisons, already many and not heard many good things, even if the
applicant has a head to foxes and Wolves warns, but in this head stuck
two healthy, smart twinkling eyes, thus he is impossible to the Stoffel
and the owner knows even honest and friendly to do, honorable mentions
his name and is in close proximity to home.

Our hero has money, a great pleasure to shiny things sees no reason why he should not buy the pipe
and pass a good buy, can be both Wherefore bargain and excrete in
peace and joy.

It does not last too long, the pipe dealer between light and darkness creeps in turn in the stable,
correctly finds the sugar Hannes, unpacks splendid stuff to pants
and skirts and leaves a great part, because secretly summoned Meistermagd
swore the yard was worth between brothers, such cloths 3 fl 30 Kreuzer,
the philanthropic businessman but has the same lowered to twelve chunk
only on condition the Mooshofleuten Nothing to say for the time being
because they are very proud and such a state at one of their Servants
would see very reluctantly.

The dun and the Blaze has enjoyed the sugar Hannes pipe and the cloth
solely rejected, they have no real sign of yourself from a few weeks
later and when he the Leitgaul Repetiruhr a silver in the right ear
and was hit was sweet, has whether the animal sounds that silver showed
no joy, but by his frightened, restless Thun the sugar Hannes angered
hard, so he put him one and muttered, "Are just yet a stupid animal.

"

A few days later is the one in the stable come, but not in the twilight, but the early morning
and not the cheap grocer, but a gendarme, and this was so unfair Hannes without the sugar long
leave of Mooshof away to supply the prison of the official city with
the information of the same a small selection to take place and miscellaneous,
which him, including all that pleased that within the terrified prisoner
of shopkeepers in the stable long Time had not bargained for and sold
again.

Several moons of sugar Hannah sat in the tower, got some quarters
and still more people even know of it and learned many things, but
one not know what he eyed by Stoffel, with which he in the last days
of captivity lived, could have experienced.

Namely, that the strange shopkeeper, from whom he bought some glories dirt cheap, his character was
a thief was clear the sugar Hannah in the first interrogation, but that this shopkeeper was an old
friend of the Stoffel, together with letzterm "worked" and have had the upper servants of the
moss farmers, namely from Bläsi pointed at him, heard of this he was neither in the office
still in prison, but went about it the light only much later in the
penitentiary, where he met the Bläsi.

For now he was free again after long delay, loss, during which he more Months in prison bodily
energy, time and money, suffered so little by right considered traced, the germs of intellectual and
moral corruptions, in the perverse society worse, and beaten fellow sufferers powerful roots or
the loss of honor, he in the eyes of others suffered in turn.

There was a further misfortune that he met the Sephardim to gain from this and had cajoled to advance
him money than almost all other loans at high interest rates and take the pledge on the purchase,
Spaniol wanted a lucky lottery number of the old rags, of Paul, at his own expense for sugar friend
Hannes occupy.

The Moose would keep the hard-working Stallbeherrscher well again after the liberation despite
the reluctance and the sting of most speeches servants and maids,
but the sugar Hannes did not forget that he never received a visit
in prison, and the area were the Mooshof entleidet him, he contented
himself with an excellent testimonials, took affectionate leave neighing
of his horns and supporting friends and walked away.

For some time he limped around on the beautiful banks of the lovely Bodenseees, the few dollars,
which he at parting carefully wrapped in the highly promising note of the Sephardim had been
turned into coins and melted at all-sufficiency quickly to a few pennies together so that the
walker at the end of the hike looked longingly enough contrary.

His testimony gave him a good service as a servant in the best inn of the same Village in which the
sick were cared for by Ursula Emmerence. The inn led the sign for the Eagles and was not far
away from the little house of Ursula, the sugar Hannes past it was
often a day that saw Emmerence always friendly greeting over the garden
fence, found an opportunity to prove the same neighborhood some small
favor wore when officious Man some pails of water from the "Gumpbrunnen"
of the eagle in their little house across Wirths and became known
with the lame old man.

At Lake Constance fared far better than sugar Hannes down in the Hegau or even in the Black Forest. In the
village they knew nothing more of him than what he told himself,
the landlord cared Adler merely the work of his servants, and because
the brave new servant was working, All fresh attack and nothing special
was guilty, he was and remained with same content.

"I know Hanns that you're a bastard and ran away from home, nor should your finger be longer than
that of other people, but you are a true servant, I have been out again Korn taken without that you
knew it and found more than an honest, loyal skin.

What I care about your father, your home, your history, or even your religion? Nothing, pure
nothing! ... Yes, we are up there on the lake are not as ignorant and aristocratic in order to believe
the question, so that it can keep anyone as he likes, we only look at the tuna. So far you have
done right, the reward for me is good, there are also tips, you remain
in Adler, look, I give you these two florins, so that you also once
you have a good day do!

"

So the eagle Wirth talked after the first half year of setting the sugar and Hannes in the third
and fourth year, and said he thought the same way. Our Hans lived here its golden age and better days
he never get back.

Because he was ignored by no one in particular or persecuted, hated
and persecuted, he also No one came and well with most members of
the household, because he once had ample opportunity had to practice
in the patient and to control his irascible temper, to no special
camaraderie and factions took in, but went about his business and
cared little about the affairs of others.

A great drinker, he was not, cards and dice on him exerted no attraction out in societies where
opportunities to cultivate rain to spend money, he spent distant, for he was economical and most
called him a skinflint and eccentric, but he claimed that a poor
devil of his kind was probably a fool if he hard-earned annual wages
let rise in a few days, joy and not think about the future.

The Spaniol never was heard, the eagle Wirth laughed out loud when his sugar Hannes vorwies
the beautiful note of it and made it clear to him the certificate is merely a change to its inexperience
in money matters and laws and on his stupidity and Greed and who have been put into a lottery,
which raises money out the window when He also gains one among hundreds. A letter to the office
out to the most Spaniol had long been free, and up and away, the old Paul, but sitting in prison.

The
loss of his savings Hans Pfenninger offended the powerful, but was also good because made him
cautious and suspicious in money matters and while in almost Amtsgefängniß
had come to rogues for honest people and honest for the durchtriebendsten
and keep most thieves, brought him to the fraud perpetrated on itself
yet again something better insight.


She was attacked by a dizziness, by prolonged and terrible shivering.  She wandered, mentioned
me, then suddenly collapsed.  The doctor has no hope but is coming back.  The Reverend Father
Piot was here at five.

Silence hovers.  A woman puts a log in the fire, in the center of the dazzling cluster of snarling
flames, whose light throws the room into total agitation.

*        *        *        *        *        *

For a long time I look upon that face, where ugliness and goodness are mingled in such a heartrending
way.  My eyes seek those already almost shut, whose light is hardening.  Something of darkness,
an internal shadow which is of herself, overspreads and disfigures her.  One may see now how
outworn she was, how miraculously she still held on.

This tortured and condemned woman is all that has looked after me for twenty years.  For twenty
years she took my hand before she took my arm.  She always prevented me from understanding
that I was an orphan. Delicate and small as I was for so long, she was taller and stronger
and better than I!  And at this moment, which shows me the past again in one glance, I remember
that she beautified the affairs of my childhood like an old magician; and my head goes lower
as I think of her untiring admiration for me.  How she did love me!  And she must love me still,
confusedly, if some glimmering light yet lasts in the depths of her.  What will become of me--all
alone?

She was so sensitive, and so restless!  A hundred details of her vivacity come to life again
in my eyes.  Stupidly, I contemplate the poker, the tongs, the big spoon--all the things she
used to flourish as she chattered.  There they are--fallen, paralyzed, mute!

As in a dream I go back to the times when she talked and shouted, to days of youth, to days
of spring and of springtime dresses; and all the while my gaze, piercing that gay and airy
vision, settles on the dark stain of the hand that lies there like the shadow of a hand, on
the sheet.

My eyes are jumbling things together.  I see our garden in the first fine days of the year;
our garden--it is behind that wall--so narrow is it that the reflected sunshine from our two
windows dapples the whole of it; so small that it only holds some pot-encaged plants, except
for the three currant bushes which have always been there.  In the scarves of the sun rays
a bird--a robin--is hopping on the twigs like a rag jewel.  All dusty in the sunshine our red
hound, Mirliton, is warming himself.  So gaunt is he you feel sure he must be a fast runner.
Certainly he runs after glimpsed rabbits on Sundays in the country, but he never caught any.
He never caught anything but fleas.  When I lag behind because of my littleness my aunt turns
round, on the edge of the footpath, and holds out her arms, and I run to her, and she stoops
as I come and calls me by my name.

*        *        *        *        *        *

"Simon!  Simon!"

A woman is here.  I wrench myself from the dream which had come into the room and taken solidity
before me.  I stand up; it is my cousin Marie.

She offers me her hands among the candles which flutter by the bed.  In their poor starlight
her face appears haggard and wet.  My aunt loved her.  Her lips are trembling on her rows of
sparkling teeth; the whole breadth of her bosom heaves quickly.

I have sunk again into the armchair.  Memories flow again, while the sick woman's breathing
is longer drawn, and her stillness becomes more and more inexorable.  Things she used to say
return to my lips.  Then my eyes are raised, and look for Marie, and turn upon her.

*        *        *        *        *        *

She has leaned against the wall, and remains so--overcome.  She invests the corner where she
stands with something like profane and sumptuous beauty.  Her changeful chestnut hair, like
bronze and gold, forms moist and disordered scrolls on her forehead and her innocent cheeks.
Her neck, especially, her white neck, appears to me.  The atmosphere is so choking, so visibly
heavy, that it enshrouds us as if the room were on fire, and she has loosened the neck of her
dress, and her throat is lighted up by the flaming logs.  I smile weakly at her.  My eyes wander
over the fullness of her hips and her outspread shoulders, and fasten, in that downfallen room,
on her throat, white as dawn.

*        *        *        *        *        *

The doctor has been again.  He stood some time in silence by the bed; and as he looked our
hearts froze.  He said it would be over to-night, and put the phial in his hand back in his
pocket.  Then, regretting that he could not stay, he disappeared.

And we stayed on beside the dying woman--so fragile that we dare not touch her, nor even try
to speak to her.

Madame Piot settles down in a chair; she crosses her arms, lowers her head, and the time goes by.

At long intervals people take shape in the darkness by the door; people who come in on tiptoe
whisper to us and go away.

The moribund moves her hands and feet and contorts her face.  A gurgling comes from her throat,
which we can hardly see in the cavity that is like a nest of shadow under her chin.  She has
blenched, and the skin that is drawn over the bones of her face like a shroud grows whiter
every moment.

Intent upon her breathing, we throng about her.  We offer her our hands--so near and so far--and
do not know what to do.

I am watching Marie.  She has sunk onto the little stool, and her young, full-blooming body
overflows it.  Holding her handkerchief in her teeth, she has come to arrange the pillow, and
leaning over the bed, she puts one knee on a chair.  The movement reveals her leg for a moment,
curved like a beautiful Greek vase, while the skin seems to shine through the black transparency
of the stocking, like clouded gold.  Ah!  I lean forward towards her with a stifled, incipient
appeal above this bed, which is changing into a tomb.  The border of the tragic dress has fallen
again, but I cannot remove my eyes from that profound obscurity.  I look at Marie, and look
at her again; and though I knew her, it seems to me that I wholly discover her.

"I can't hear anything now," says a woman.

"Yes I can----"

"No, no!" the other repeats.

Then I see Crillon's huge back bending over.  My aunt's mouth opens gently and remains open.
The eyelids fall back almost completely upon the stiffened gleam of the eyes, which squint
in the gray and bony mask.  I see Crillon's big hand hover over the little mummified face,
lowering the eyelids and keeping them closed.

Marie utters a cry when this movement tells her that our aunt has just died.

She sways.  My hand goes out to her.  I take her, support, and enfold her.  Fainting, she clings
to me, and for one moment I carry--gently, heavily--all the young woman's weight.  The neck
of her dress is undone, and falls like foliage from her throat, and I just saw the real curve
of her bosom, nakedly and distractedly throbbing.

Her body is agitated.  She hides her face in her hands and then turns it to mine.  It chanced
that our faces met, and my lips gathered the wonderful savor of her tears!

*        *        *        *        *        *

The room fills with lamentation; there is a continuous sound of deep sighing.  It is overrun
by neighbors become friends, to whom no one pays attention.

And now, in this sacred homelet, where death still bleeds, I cannot prevent a heavy heart-beat
in me towards the girl who is prostrated like the rest, but who reigns there, in spite of me--of
herself--of everything.  I feel myself agitated by an obscure and huge rapture--the birth of
my flesh and my vitals among these shadows.  Beside this poor creature who was so blended with
me, and who is falling, falling, through a hell of eternity, I am uplifted by a sort of hope.

I want to fix my attention on the fixity of the bed.  I put my hand over my eyes to shut out
all thought save of the dead woman, defenseless already, reclining on that earth into which
she will sink. But my looks, impelled by superhuman curiosity, escape between my fingers to
this other woman, half revealed to me in the tumult of sorrow, and my eyes cannot come out of her.

Madame Piot has changed the candles and attached a band to support the dead woman's chin. 
Framed in this napkin, which is knotted over the skull in her woolly gray hair, the face looks
like a hook-nosed mask of green bronze, with a vitrified line of eyes; the knees make two sharp
summits under the sheet; one's eyes run along the thin rods of the shins and the feet lift
the linen like two in-driven nails.

Slowly Marie prepares to go.  She has closed the neck of her dress and hidden herself in her
cloak.  She comes up to me, sore-hearted, and with her tears for a moment quenched she smiles
at me without speaking. I half rise, my hands tremble towards her smile as if to touch it,
above the past and the dust of my second mother.

Towards the end of the night, when the dead fire is scattering chilliness, the women go away
one by one.  One hour, two hours, I remain alone.  I pace the room in one direction and another,
then I look, and shiver.  My aunt is no more.  There is only left of her something indistinct,
struck down, of subterranean color, and her place is desolate.  Now, close to her, I am alone!
Alone--magnified by my affliction, master of my future, disturbed and numbed by the newness
of the things now beginning.  At last the window grows pale, the ceiling turns gray, and the
candle-flames wink in the first traces of light.

I shiver without end.  In the depth of my dawn, in the heart of this room where I have always
been, I recall the image of a woman who filled it--a woman standing at the chimney-corner,
where a gladsome fire flames, and she is garbed in reflected purple, her corsage scarlet, her
face golden, as she holds to the glow those hands transparent and beautiful as flames.  In
the darkness, from my vigil, I look at her.

*        *        *        *        *        *

The two nights which followed were spent in mournful motionlessness at the back of that room
where the trembling host of lights seemed to give animation to dead things.  During the two
days various activities brought me distraction, at first distressing, then depressing.

The last night I opened my aunt's jewel box.  It was called "the little box."  It was on the
dressing table, at the bottom of piled-up litter. I found some topaz ear-rings of a bygone
period, a gold cross, equally outdistanced, small and slender--a little girl's, or a young
girl's; and then, wrapped in tissue paper, like a relic, a portrait of myself when a child.
Last, a written page, torn from one of my old school copy-books, which she had not been able
to throw wholly away. Transparent at the folds, the worn sheet was fragile as lace, and gave
the illusion of being equally precious.  That was all the treasure my aunt had collected. 
That jewel box held the poverty of her life and the wealth of her heart.

*        *        *        *        *        *

It poured with rain on the day of the funeral.  All the morning groups of people succeeded
each other in the big cavern of our room, a going and coming of sighs.  My aunt was laid in
her coffin towards two o'clock, and it was carried then into the passage, where visitors' feet
had brought dirt and puddles.  A belated wreath was awaited, and then the umbrellas opened,
and under their black undulation the procession moved off.

When we came out of the church it was not far off four o'clock.  The rain had not stopped and
little rivers dashed down from either side of the procession's sluggish flow along the street.
There were many flowers, so that the hearse made a blot of relief, beautiful enough. There
were many people, too, and I turned round several times.  Always I saw old Eudo, in his black
cowl, hopping along in the mud, hunchbacked as a crow.  Marie was walking among some women
in the second half of the file, whose frail and streaming roof the hearse drew along irregularly
with jerks and halts.  Her gait was jaded; she was thinking only of our sorrow!  All things
darkened again to my eyes in the ugliness of the evening.

The cemetery is full of mud under the muslin of fallen rain, and the footfalls make a sticky
sound in it.  There are a few trees, naked and paralyzed.  The sky is marshy and sprinkled
with crows.

The coffin, with its shapeless human form, is lowered from the hearse and disappears in the
fresh earth.

They march past.  Marie and her father take their places beside me.  I say thanks to every
one in the same tone; they are all like each other, with their gestures of impotence, their
dejected faces, the words they get ready and pour out as they pass before me, and their dark
costume. No one has come from the castle, but in spite of that there are many people and they
all converge upon me.  I pluck up courage.

Monsieur Lucien Gozlan comes forward, calls me "my dear sir," and brings me the condolences
of his uncles, while the rest watch us.

Joseph Bonéas says "my dear friend" to me, and that affects me deeply. Monsieur Pocard says,
"If I had been advised in time I would have said a few words.  It is regrettable----"

Others follow; then nothing more is to be seen in the rain, the wind and the gloom but backs.

"It's finished.  Let's go."

Marie lifts to me her sorrow-laved face.  She is sweet; she is affectionate; she is unhappy;
but she does not love me.

We go away in disorder, along by the trees whose skeletons the winter has blackened.

When we arrive in our quarter, twilight has invaded the streets.  We hear gusts of talk about
the Pocard scheme.  Ah, how fiercely people live and seek success!

Little Antoinette, cautiously feeling her way by a big wall, hears us pass.  She stops and
would look if she could.  We espy her figure in that twilight of which she is beginning to
make a part, though fine and faint as a pistil.

"Poor little angel!" says a woman, as she goes by.

Marie and her father are the only ones left near me when we pass Rampaille's tavern.  Some
men who were at the funeral are sitting at tables there, black-clad.

We reach my home; Marie offers me her hand, and we hesitate.  "Come in."

She enters.  We look at the dead room; the floor is wet, and the wind blows through as if we
were out of doors.  Both of us are crying, and she says, "I will come to-morrow and tidy up.
Till then----"

We take each other's hand in confused hesitation.

*        *        *        *        *        *

A little later there is a scraping at the door, then a timid knock, and a long figure appears.

It is Véron who presents himself with an awkward air.  His tall and badly jointed body swings
like a hanging signboard.  He is an original and sentimental soul, but no one has ever troubled
to find out what he is.  He begins, "My young friend--hum, hum--" (he repeats this formless
sound every two or three words, like a sort of clock with a sonorous tick)--"One may be wanting
money, you know, for something--hum, hum; you need money, perhaps--hum, hum; all this expense--and
I'd said to myself 'I'll take him some----'"

He scrutinizes me as he repeats, "Hum, hum."  I shake his hand with tears in my eyes.  I do
not need money, but I know I shall never forget that action; so good, so supernatural.

And when he has swung himself out, abashed by my refusal, embarrassed by the unusual size of
his legs and his heart, I sit down in a corner, seized with shivering.  Then I obliterate myself
in another corner, equally forlorn.  It seems as if Marie has gone away with all I have. I
am in mourning and I am all alone, because of her.

CHAPTER IV

MARIE

The seat leans against the gray wall, at the spot where a rose tree hangs over it, and the
lane begins to slope to the river.  I asked Marie to come, and I am waiting for her in the evening.

When I asked her--in sudden decision after so many days of hesitation--to meet me here this
evening, she was silent, astonished. But she did not refuse; she did not answer.  Some people
came and she went away.  I am waiting for her, after that prayer.

Slowly I stroll to the river bank.  When I return some one is on the seat, enthroned in the
shadow.  The face is indistinct, but in the apparel of mourning I can see the neck-opening,
like a faint pale heart, and the misty expansion of the skirt.  Stooping, I hear her low voice,
"I've come, you see."  And, "Marie!" I say.

I sit down beside her, and we remain silent.  She is there--wholly. Through her black veils
I can make out the whiteness of her face and neck and hands--all her beauty, like light enclosed.

For me she had only been a charming picture, a passer-by, one apart, living her own life. 
Now she has listened to me; she has come at my call; she has brought herself here.

*        *        *        *        *        *

The day has been scorching.  Towards the end of the afternoon storm-rain burst over the world
and then ceased.  One can still hear belated drops falling from the branches which overhang
the wall.  The air is charged with odors of earth and leaves and flowers, and wreaths of wind
go heavily by.

She is the first to speak; she speaks of one thing and another.

I do not know what she is saying; I draw nearer to see her lips; I answer her, "I am always
thinking of you."

Hearing these words, she is silent.  Her silence grows greater and greater in the shadows.
I have drawn still nearer; so near that I feel on my cheek the wing-beat of her breath; so
near that her silence caresses me.

Then, to keep myself in countenance, or to smoke, I have struck a match, but I make no use
of the gleam at my finger-tips.  It shows me Marie, quivering a little; it gilds her pale face.
A smile arises on her face; I have seen her full of that smile.

My eyes grow dim and my hands tremble.  I wish she would speak.

"Tell me----"  Her down-bent neck unfolds, and she lifts her head to speak.  At that moment,
by the light of the flame that I hold, whose great revealing kindness I am guarding, our eyes
fall on an inscription scratched in the wall--a heart--and inside it two initials, H-S.  Ah,
that design was made by me one evening.  Little Helen was lolling there then, and I thought
I adored her.  For a moment I am overpowered by this apparition of a mistake, bygone and forgotten.
Marie does not know; but seeing those initials, and divining a presence between us, she dare
not speak.

As the match is on the point of going out I throw it down.  The little flame's last flicker
has lighted up for me the edge of the poor black serge skirt, so worn that it shines a little,
even in the evening, and has shown me the girl's shoe.  There is a hole in the heel of the
stocking, and we have both seen it.  In quick shame, Marie draws her foot under her skirt;
and I--I tremble still more that my eyes have touched a little of her maiden flesh, a fragment
of her real innocence.

Gently she stands up in the grayness, and puts an end to this first fate-changing meeting.

We return.  The obscurity is outstretched all around and against us. Together and alone we
go into the following chambers of the night.  My eyes follow the sway of her body in her dress
against the vaguely luminous background of the wall.  Amid the night her dress is night also;
she is there--wholly!  There is a singing in my ears; an anthem fills the world.

In the street, where there are no more wayfarers, she walks on the edge of the causeway.  So
that my face may be on a level with hers, I walk beside her in the gutter, and the cold water
enters my boots.

And that evening, inflated by mad longing, I am so triumphantly confident that I do not even
remember to shake her hand.  By her door I said to her, "To-morrow," and she answered, "Yes."

On one of the days which followed, finding myself free in the afternoon, I made my way to the
great populous building of flats where she lives.  I ascended two dark flights of steps, closely
encaged, and followed a long elbowed corridor.  Here it is.  I knock and enter. Complete silence
greets me.  There is no one, and acute disappointment runs through me.

I take some hesitant steps in the tiny vestibule, which is lighted by the glass door to the
kitchen, wherein I hear the drip of water.  I see a room whose curtains invest it with broidered
light.  There is a bed in it, with a cover of sky-blue satinette shining like the blue of a
chromo.  It is Marie's room!  Her gray silk hat, rose-trimmed, hangs from a nail on the flowery
paper.  She has not worn it since my aunt's death; and alongside hang black dresses.  I enter
this bright blue sanctuary, inhabited only by a cold and snow-like light, and orderly and chaste
as a picture.

My hand goes out like a thief's.  I touch, I stroke these dresses, which are wont to touch
Marie.  I turn again to the blue-veiled bed. On a whatnot there are books, and their titles
invite me; for where her thoughts dwell, the things which occupy her mind--but I leave them.
I would rather go near her bed.  With a movement at once mad, frightened and trembling, I lift
the quilts that clothe it and my gaze enters it, and my knees lean trembling on the edge of
this great lifeless thing, which, alone among dead things, is one of soft and supple flesh.

*        *        *        *        *        *

My customary life continues and my work is always the same.  I make notes, by the way, of Crillon's
honest trivialities; of Brisbille's untimely outbursts; of the rumors anent the Pocard scheme,
and the progress of the Association of Avengers, a society to promote national awakening, founded
by Monsieur Joseph Bonéas.  The same complex and monotonous existence bears me along as it
does everybody.  But since that tragic night when my sorrow was transformed into joy at the
lyke-wake in the old room, in truth the world is no longer what it was. People and things appear
to me shadowy and distant when I go out into the current of the crowds; when I am dressing
in my room and decide that I look well in black; when I sit up late at my table in the sunshine
of hope.  Now and again the memory of my aunt comes bodily back to me.  Sometimes I hear people
pronounce the name of Marie.  My body starts when it hears them say "Marie," who know not what
they say. And there are moments when our separation throbs so warmly that I do not know whether
she is here or absent.

*        *        *        *        *        *

During this walk that we have just had together the summer and the sweetness of living have
weighed more than ever on my shoulders.  Her huge home, which is such a swarming hive at certain
times, is now immensely empty in the labyrinth of its dark stairs and the landings, whence
issue the narrow closed streets of its corridors, and where in the corners taps drip upon drain-stones.
Our immense--our naked solitude pervades us.  An exquisite emotion takes hold of me while we
are slowly climbing the steep and methodical way.  There is something human in the stairway;
in the inevitable shapes of its spiral and its steps cut out of the quick, in the rhythmic
repetition of its steps.  A round skylight pierces the sloping roof up there, and it is the
only light for this part of the people's house, this poor internal city. The darkness which
runs down the walls of the well, whence we are striving to emerge step by step, conceals our
laborious climb towards that gap of daylight.  Shadowed and secret as we are, it seems to me
that we are mounting to heaven.

Oppressed by a common languor, we at last sat down side by side on a step.  There is no sound
in the building under the one round window bending over us.  We lean on each other because
of the stair's narrowness.  Her warmth enters into me; I feel myself agitated by that obscure
light which radiates from her.  I share with her the heat of her body and her thought itself.
The darkness deepens round us. Hardly can I see the crouching girl there, warm and hollowed
like a nest.

I call her by her name, very quietly, and it is as though I made a loud avowal!  She turns,
and it seems that this is the first time I have seen her naked face.  "Kiss me," she says;
and without speaking we stammer, and murmur, and laugh.

*        *        *        *        *        *

Together we are looking at a little square piece of paper.  I found it on the seat which the
rose-tree overhangs on the edge of the downward lane.  Carefully folded, it had a forgotten
look, and it was waiting there, detained for a moment by its timorous weight.  A few lines
of careful writing cover it.  We read it:

     "I do not know how speaks the pious heart; nothing I know; th'
enraptured martyr I.  Only I know the tears that brimming start, your
beauty blended with your smile to espy."

Then, having read it, we read it again, moved by a mysterious influence.  And we finger the
chance-captured paper, without knowing what it is, without understanding very well what it says.

*        *        *        *        *        *

When I asked her to go with me to the cemetery that Sunday, she agreed, as she does to all
I ask her.  I watched her arms brush the roses as she came in through the gardens.  We walked
in silence; more and more we are losing the habit of talking to each other.  We looked at the
latticed and flower-decked square where our aunt sleeps--the garden which is only as big as
a woman.  Returning from the cemetery by way of the fields, the sun already low, we join hands,
seized with triumphant delight.

She is wearing a dress of black delaine, and the skirt, the sleeves and the collar wave in
the breeze.  Sometimes she turns her radiant face to me and it seems to grow still brighter
when she looks at me.  Slightly stooping, she walks, though among the grass and flowers whose
tints and grace shine in reflection on her forehead and cheeks, she is a giantess.  A butterfly
precedes us on our path and alights under our eyes, but when we come up it takes wing again,
and comes down a little farther and begins all over again; and we smile at the butterfly that
thinks of us.

Inlaid with gold by the slanting sun we lead each other, hand in hand, as far as the statue
of Flora, which once upon a time a lord of the manor raised on the fringe of the wood.  Against
the abiding background of distant heights the goddess stands, half-naked, in the beautiful
ripe light.  Her fair hips are draped with a veil of still whiter stone, like a linen garment.
Before the old moss-mellowed pedestal I pressed Marie desperately to my heart.  Then, in the
sacred solitude of the wood, I put my hands upon her, and so that she might be like the goddess
I unfastened her black bodice, lowered the ribbon shoulder-straps of her chemise, and laid
bare her wide and rounded bosom.

She yielded to the adoration with lowered head, and her eyes magnificently troubled, red-flushing
with blood and sunshine.

I put my lips on hers.  Until that day, whenever I kissed her, her lips submitted.  This time
she gave me back my long caress, and even her eyes closed upon it.  Then she stands there with
her hands crossed on her glorious throat, her red, wet lips ajar.  She stands there, apart,
yet united to me, and her heart on her lips.

She has covered her bosom again.  The breeze is suddenly gusty.  The apple trees in the orchards
are shaken and scatter bird-like jetsam in space; and in that bright green paddock yonder the
rows of out-hung linen dance in the sunshine.  The sky darkens; the wind rises and prevails.
It was that very day of the gale.  It assaults our two bodies on the flank of the hill; it
comes out of infinity and sets roaring the tawny forest foliage.  We can see its agitation
behind the black grille of the trunks.  It makes us dizzy to watch the swift displacement of
the gray-veiled sky, and from cloud to cloud a bird seems hurled, like a stone.  We go down
towards the bottom of the valley, clinging to the slope, an offering to the deepest breath
of heaven, driven forward yet holding each other back.

So, gorged with the gale and deafened by the universal concert of space that goes through our
ears, we find sanctuary on the river bank.  The water flows between trees whose highest foliage
is intermingled.  By a dark footpath, soft and damp, under the ogive of the branches, we follow
this crystal-paved cloister of green shadow.  We come on a flat-bottomed boat, used by the
anglers.  I make Marie enter it, and it yields and groans under her weight.  By the strokes
of two old oars we descend the current.

It seems to our hearts and our inventing eyes that the banks take flight on either side--it
is the scenery of bushes and trees which retreats.  We--we abide!  But the boat grounds among
tall reeds. Marie is half reclining and does not speak.  I draw myself towards her on my knees,
and the boat quivers as I do.  Her face in silence calls me; she calls me wholly.  With her
prostrate body, surrendered and disordered, she calls me.

I possess her--she is mine!  In sublime docility she yields to my violent caress.  Now she
is mine--mine forever!  Henceforth let what may befall; let the years go by and the winters
follow the summers, she is mine, and my life is granted me!  Proudly I think of the great and
famous lovers whom we resemble.  I perceive that there is no recognized law which can stand
against the might of love.  And under the transient wing of the foliage, amid the continuous
recessional of heaven and earth, we repeat "never"; we repeat "always"; and we proclaim it
to eternity.

*        *        *        *        *        *

The leaves are falling; the year draws near to its end; the wedding is arranged to take place
about Christmas.

That decision was mine; Marie said "yes," as usual, and her father, absorbed all the day in
figures, would emerge from them at night, like a shipwrecked man, seeing darkly, passive, except
on rare occasions when he had fits of mad obstinacy, and no one knew why.

In the early morning sometimes, when I was climbing Chestnut Hill on my way to work, Marie
would appear before me at a corner, in the pale and blushing dawn.  We would walk on together,
bathed in those fresh fires, and would watch the town at our feet rising again from its ashes.
Or, on my way back, she would suddenly be there, and we would walk side by side towards her
home.  We loved each other too much to be able to talk.  A very few words we exchanged just
to entwine our voices, and in speaking of other people we smiled at each other.

One day, about that time, Monsieur the Marquis of Monthyon had the kindly thought of asking
us both to an evening party at the castle, with several leading people of our quarter.  When
all the guests were gathered in a huge gallery, adorned with busts which sat in state between
high curtains of red damask, the Marquis took it into his head to cut off the electricity.
In a lordly way he liked heavy practical jokes--I was just smiling at Marie, who was standing
near me in the middle of the crowded gallery, when suddenly it was dark.  I put out my arms
and drew her to me.  She responded with a spirit she had not shown before, our lips met more
passionately than ever, and our single body swayed among the invisible, ejaculating throng
that elbowed and jostled us.  The light flashed again.  We had loosed our hold.  Ah, it was
not Marie whom I had clasped!  The woman fled with a stifled exclamation of shame and indignation
towards him who she believed had embraced her, and who had seen nothing.  Confused, and as
though still blind, I rejoined Marie, but I was myself again with difficulty.  In spite of
all, that kiss which had suddenly brought me in naked contact with a complete stranger remained
to me an extraordinary and infernal delight. Afterwards, I thought I recognized the woman by
her blue dress, half seen at the same time as the gleam of her neck after that brief and dazzling
incident.  But there were three of them somewhat alike.  I never knew which of those unknown
women concealed within her flesh the half of the thrill that I could not shake off all the evening.

*        *        *        *        *        *

There was a large gathering at the wedding.  The Marquis and Marchioness of Monthyon appeared
at the sacristy.  Brisbille, by good luck, stayed away.  Good sectarian that he was, he only
acknowledged civil marriages.  I was a little shamefaced to see march past, taking their share
of the fine and tranquil smile distributed by Marie, some women who had formerly been my mistresses--Madame
Lacaille, nervous, subtle, mystical; big Victorine and her good-natured rotundity, who had
welcomed me any time and anywhere; and Madeleine Chaine; and slender Antonia above all, with
the Italian woman's ardent and theatrical face, ebony-framed, and wearing a hat of Parisian
splendor.  For Antonia is very elegant since she married Véron.  I could not help wincing when
I saw that lanky woman, who had clung to me in venturesome rooms, now assiduous around us in
her ceremonious attire.  But how far off and obliterated all that was!

CHAPTER V

DAY BY DAY

We rearranged the house.  We did not alter the general arrangement, nor the places of the heavy
furniture--that would have been too great a change.  But we cast out all the dusty old stuff,
the fossilized and worthless knick-knacks that Mame had accumulated.  The photographs on the
walls, which were dying of jaundice and debility, and which no longer stood for anybody, because
of the greatness of time, we cleared out of their imitation tortoiseshell and buried in the
depths of drawers.

I bought some furniture, and as we sniffed the odor of varnish which hung about for a long
time in the lower room, we said, "This is the real thing."  And, indeed, our home was pretty
much like the middle-class establishments of our quarter and everywhere.  Is it not the only
really proud moment here on earth, when we can say, "I, too!"

Years went by.  There was nothing remarkable in our life.  When I came home in the evening,
Marie, who often had not been out and had kept on her dressing-gown and plaits, used to say,
"There's been nothing to speak of to-day."

The aeroplanes were appearing at that time.  We talked about them, and saw photographs of them
in the papers.  One Sunday we saw one from our window.  We had heard the chopped-up noise of
its engine expanding over the sky; and down below, the townsfolk on their doorsteps, raised
their heads towards the ceiling of their streets.  Rattling space was marked with a dot.  We
kept our eyes on it and saw the great flat and noisy insect grow bigger and bigger, silhouetting
the black of its angles and partitioned lines against the airy wadding of the clouds.  When
its headlong flight had passed, when it had dwindled in our eyes and ears amid the new world
of sounds, which it drew in its train, Marie sighed dreamily.

"I would like," she said, "to go up in an aeroplane, into the wind--into the sky!"

One spring we talked a lot about a trip we would take some day.  Some railway posters had been
stuck on the walls of the old tin works, that the Pocard scheme was going to transfigure. 
We looked at them the day they were freshly brilliant in their wet varnish and their smell
of paste.  We preferred the bill about Corsica, which showed seaside landscapes, harbors with
picturesque people in the foreground and a purple mountain behind, all among garlands.  And
later, even when stiffened and torn and cracking in the wind, that poster attracted us.

One evening, in the kitchen, when we had just come in--there are memories which mysteriously
outlive the rest--and Marie was lighting the fire, with her hat on and her hands wiped out
in the twilight by the grime of the coal, she said, "We'll make that trip later!"

Sometimes it happened that we went out, she and I, during the week.  I looked about me and
shared my thoughts with her.  Never very talkative, she would listen to me.  Coming out of
the Place de l'Eglise, which used to affect us so much not long ago, we often used to meet
Jean and Genevieve Trompson, near the sunken post where an old jam pot lies on the ground.
Everybody used to say of these two, "They'll separate, you'll see; that's what comes of loving
each other too much; it was madness, I always said so."  And hearing these things, unfortunately
true, Marie would murmur, with a sort of obstinate gentleness, "Love is sacred."

Returning, not far from the anachronistic and clandestine Eudo's lair, we used to hear the
coughing parrot.  That old bird, worn threadbare, and of a faded green hue, never ceased to
imitate the fits of coughing which two years before had torn Adolphe Piot's lungs, who died
in the midst of his family under such sad circumstances.  Those days we would return with our
ears full of the obstinate clamor of that recording bird, which had set itself fiercely to
immortalize the noise that passed for a moment through the world, and toss the echoes of an
ancient calamity, of which everybody had ceased to think.

Almost the only people about us are Marthe, my little sister-in-law, who is six years old,
and resembles her sister like a surprising miniature; my father-in-law, who is gradually annihilating
himself; and Crillon.  This last lives always contented in the same shop while time goes by,
like his father and his grandfather, and the cobbler of the fable, his eternal ancestor.  Under
his square cap, on the edge of his glazed niche, he soliloquizes, while he smokes the short
and juicy pipe which joins him in talking and spitting--indeed, he seems to be answering it.
A lonely toiler, his lot is increasingly hard, and almost worthless.  He often comes in to
us to do little jobs--mend a table leg, re-seat a chair, replace a tile.  Then he says, "There's
summat I must tell you----"

So he retails the gossip of the district, for it is against his conscience, as he frankly avows,
to conceal what he knows.  And Heaven knows, there is gossip enough in our quarter!--a complete
network, above and below, of quarrels, intrigues and deceptions, woven around man, woman and
the public in general.  One says, "It can't be true!" and then thinks about something else.

And Crillon, in face of all this perversity, all this wrong-doing, smiles!  I like to see that
happy smile of innocence on the lowly worker's face.  He is better than I, and he even understands
life better, with his unfailing good sense.

I say to him, "But are there not any bad customs and vices? Alcoholism, for instance?"

"Yes," says Crillon, "as long as you don't exarrergate it.  I don't like exarrergations, and
I find as much of it among the pestimists as among the opticions.  Drink, you say!  It's chiefly
that folks haven't enough charitableness, mind you.  They blame all these poor devils that
drink and they think themselves clever!  And they're envious, too; if they wasn't that, tell
me, would they stand there in stony peterified silence before the underhand goings-on of bigger
folks?  That's what it is, at bottom of us.  Let me tell you now.  I'll say nothing against
Termite, though he's a poacher, and for the castle folks that's worse than all, but if yon
bandit of a Brisbille weren't the anarchist he is and frightening everybody, I'd excuse him
his dirty nose and even not taking it out of a pint pot all the week through.  It isn't a crime,
isn't only being a good boozer.  We've got to look ahead and have a broad spirit, as Monsieur
Joseph says.  Tolerantness!  We all want it, eh?"

"You're a good sort," I say.

"I'm a man, like everybody," proudly replies Crillon.  "It's not that I hold by accustomary
ideas; I'm not an antiquitary, but I don't like to single-arise myself.  If I'm a botcher in
life, it's cos I'm the same as others--no less," he says, straightening up.  And standing still
more erect, he adds, "Nor no more, neither!"

When we are not chatting we read aloud.  There is a very fine library at the factory, selected
by Madame Valentine Gozlan from works of an educational or moral kind, for the use of the staff.
Marie, whose imagination goes further afield than mine, and who has not my anxieties, directs
the reading.  She opens a book and reads aloud while I take my ease, looking at the pastel
portrait which hangs just opposite the window.  On the glass which entombs the picture I see
the gently moving and puffing reflection of the fidgety window curtains, and the face of that
glazed portrait becomes blurred with broken streaks and all kinds of wave marks.

"Ah, these adventures!" Marie sometimes sighs, at the end of a chapter; "these things that
never happen!"

"Thank Heaven," I cry.

"Alas," she replies.

Even when people live together they differ more than they think!

At other times Marie reads to herself, quite silently.  I surprise her absorbed in this occupation.
It even happens that she applies herself thus to poetry.  In her set and stooping face her
eyes come and go over the abbreviated lines of the verses.  From time to time she raises them
and looks up at the sky, and--vastly further than the visible sky--at all that escapes from
the little cage of words.

And sometimes we are lightly touched with boredom.

*        *        *        *        *        *

One evening Marie informed me that the canary was dead, and she began to cry, as she showed
me the open cage and the bird which lay at the bottom, with its feet curled up, as rumpled
and stark as the little yellow plaything of a doll.  I sympathized with her sorrow; but her
tears were endless, and I found her emotion disproportionate.

"Come now," I said, "after all, a bird's only a bird, a mere point that moved a little in a
corner of the room.  What then?  What about the thousands of birds that die, and the people
that die, and the poor?" But she shook her head, insisted on grieving, tried to prove to me
that it was momentous and that she was right.

For a moment I stood bewildered by this want of understanding; this difference between her
way of feeling and mine.  It was a disagreeable revelation of the unknown.  One might often,
in regard to small matters, make a multitude of reflections if one wished; but one does not wish.

*        *        *        *        *        *

My position at the factory and in our quarter is becoming gradually stronger.  By reason of
a regular gratuity which I received, we are at last able to put money aside each month, like
everybody.

"I say!" cried Crillon, pulling me outside with him, as I was coming in one evening; "I must
let you know that you've been spoken of spontanially for the Town Council at the next renewment.
They're making a big effort, you know.  Monsieur the Marquis is going to stand for the legislative
elections--but we've walked into the other quarter," said Crillon, stopping dead.  "Come back,
come back."

We turned right-about-face.

"This patriotic society of Monsieur Joseph," Crillon went on, "has done a lot of harm to the
anarchists.  We've all got to let 'em feel our elbows, that's necessential.  You've got a foot
in the factory, eh? You see the workmen; have a crack of talk with 'em.  You ingreasiate yourself
with 'em, so's some of 'em'll vote for you.  For them's the danger."

"It's true that I am very sympathetic to them," I murmured, impressed by this prospect.

Crillon came to a stand in front of the Public Baths.  "It's the seventeenth to-day," he explained;
"the day of the month when I takes a bath.  Oh, yes!  I know that you go every Thursday; but
I'm not of that mind.  You're young, of course, and p'raps you have good reason! But you take
my tip, and hobnob with the working man.  We must bestir ourselves and impell ourselves, what
the devil!  As for me, I've finished my political efforts for peace and order.  It's your turn!"

He is right.  Looking at the ageing man, I note that his framework is slightly bowed; that
his ill-shaven cheeks are humpbacked with little ends of hair turning into white crystals.
In his lowly sphere he has done his duty.  I reflect upon the mite-like efforts of the unimportant
people; of the mountains of tasks performed by anonymity.  They are necessary, these hosts
of people so closely resembling each other; for cities are built upon the poor brotherhood
of paving-stones.

He is right, as always.  I, who am still young; I, who am on a higher level than his; I must
play a part, and subdue the desire one has to let things go on as they may.

A sudden movement of will appears in my life, which otherwise proceeds as usual.

CHAPTER VI

A VOICE IN THE EVENING

I approached the workpeople with all possible sympathy.  The toiler's lot, moreover, raises
interesting problems, which one should seek to understand.  So I inform myself in the matter
of those around me.

"You want to see the greasers' work?  Here I am," said Marcassin, surnamed Pétrolus.  "I'm
the lamp-man.  Before that I was a greaser. Is that any better?  Can't say.  It's here that
that goes on, look--there.  My place you'll find at night by letting your nose guide you."

The truth is that the corner of the factory to which he leads me has an aggressive smell. 
The shapeless walls of this sort of grotto are adorned with shelves full of leaking lamps--lamps
dirty as beasts.  In a bucket there are old wicks and other departed things.  At the foot of
a wooden cupboard which looks like iron are lamp glasses in paper shirts; and farther away,
groups of oil-drums.  All is dilapidated and ruinous; all is dark in this angle of the great
building where light is elaborated.  The specter of a huge window stands yonder.  The panes
only half appear; so encrusted are they they might be covered with yellow paper.  The great
stones--the rocks--of the walls are upholstered with a dark deposit of grease, like the bottom
of a stewpan, and nests of dust hang from them.  Black puddles gleam on the floor, with beds
of slime from the scraping of the lamps.

There he lives and moves, in his armored tunic encrusted with filth as dark as coffee-grounds.
In his poor claw he grips the chief implement of his work--a black rag.  His grimy hands shine
with paraffin, and the oil, sunk and blackened in his nails, gives them a look of wick ends.
All day long he cleans lamps, and repairs, and unscrews, and fills, and wipes them.  The dirt
and the darkness of this population of appliances he attracts to himself, and he works like
a nigger.

"For it's got to be well done," he says, "and even when you're fagged out, you must keep on
rubbing hard."

"There's six hundred and sixty-three, monsieur" (he says "monsieur" as soon as he embarks on
technical explanations), "counting the smart ones in the fine offices, and the lanterns in
the wood-yard, and the night watchmen.  You'll say to me, 'Why don't they have electricity
that lights itself?'  It's 'cos that costs money and they get paraffin for next to nothing,
it seems, through a big firm 'at they're in with up yonder.  As for me, I'm always on my legs,
from the morning when I'm tired through sleeping badly, from after dinner when you feel sick
with eating, up to the evening, when you're sick of everything."

The bell has rung, and we go away in company.  He has pulled off his blue trousers and tunic
and thrown them into a corner--two objects which have grown heavy and rusty, like tools.  But
the dirty shell of his toil did upholster him a little, and he emerges from it gaunter, and
horribly squeezed within the littleness of a torturing jacket.  His bony legs, in trousers
too wide and too short, break off at the bottom in long and mournful shoes, with hillocks,
and resembling crocodiles; and their soles, being soaked in paraffin, leave oily footprints,
rainbow-hued, in the plastic mud.

Perhaps it is because of this dismal companion towards whom I turn my head, and whom I see
trotting slowly and painfully at my side in the rumbling grayness of the evening exodus, that
I have a sudden and tragic vision of the people, as in a flash's passing.  (I do sometimes
get glimpses of the things of life momentarily.)  The dark doorway to my vision seems torn
asunder.  Between these two phantoms in front the sable swarm outspreads.  The multitude encumbers
the plain that bristles with dark chimneys and cranes, with ladders of iron planted black and
vertical in nakedness--a plain vaguely scribbled with geometrical lines, rails and cinder paths--a
plain utilized yet barren. In some places about the approaches to the factory cartloads of
clinker and cinders have been dumped, and some of it continues to burn like pyres, throwing
off dark flames and darker curtains.  Higher, the hazy clouds vomited by the tall chimneys
come together in broad mountains whose foundations brush the ground and cover the land with
a stormy sky.  In the depths of these clouds humanity is let loose.  The immense expanse of
men moves and shouts and rolls in the same course all through the suburb.  An inexhaustible
echo of cries surrounds us; it is like hell in eruption and begirt by bronze horizons.

At that moment I am afraid of the multitude.  It brings something limitless into being, something
which surpasses and threatens us; and it seems to me that he who is not with it will one day
be trodden underfoot.

My head goes down in thought.  I walk close to Marcassin, who gives me the impression of an
escaping animal, hopping through the darkness--whether because of his name,[1] or his stench,
I do not know. The evening is darkening; the wind is tearing leaves away; it thickens with
rain and begins to nip.

[Footnote 1: Marcassin--a young wild boar.--Tr.]

My miserable companion's voice comes to me in shreds.  He is trying to explain to me the law
of unremitting toil.  An echo of his murmur reaches my face.

"And that's what one hasn't the least idea of.  Because what's nearest to us, often, one doesn't
see it."

"Yes, that's true," I say, rather weary of his monotonous complaining.

I try a few words of consolation, knowing that he was recently married. "After all, no one
comes bothering you in your own little corner. There's always that.  And then, after all, you're
going home--your wife is waiting for you.  You're lucky----"

"I've no time; or rather, I've no strength.  At nights, when I come home I'm too tired--I'm
too tired, you understand, to be happy, you see.  Every morning I think I shall be, and I'm
hoping up till noon; but at night I'm too knocked out, what with walking and rubbing for eleven
hours; and on Sundays I'm done in altogether with the week. There's even times that I don't
even wash myself when I come in.  I just stay with my hands mucky; and on Sundays when I'm
cleaned up, it's a nasty one when they say to me, 'You're looking well.'"

And while I am listening to the tragicomical recital which he retails, like a soliloquy, without
expecting replies from me--luckily, for I should not know how to answer--I can, in fact, recall
those holidays when the face of Pétrolus is embellished by the visible marks of water.

"Apart from that," he goes on, withdrawing his chin into the gray string of his over-large
collar; "apart from that, Charlotte, she's very good.  She looks after me, and tidies the house,
and it's her that lights our lamp; and she hides the books carefully away from me so's I can't
grease 'em, and my fingers make prints on 'em like criminals. She's good, but it doesn't turn
out well, same as I've told you, and when one's unhappy everything's favorable to being unhappy."

He is silent for a while, and then adds by way of conclusion to all he has said, and to all
that one can say, "My father, he caved in at fifty.  And I shall cave in at fifty, p'raps before."

With his thumb he points through the twilight at that sort of indelible darkness which makes
the multitude, "Them others, it's not the same with them.  There's those that want to change
everything and keep going on that notion.  There's those that drink and want to drink, and
keep going that way."

I hardly listen to him while he explains to me the grievances of the different groups of workmen,
"The molders, monsieur, them, it's a matter of the gangs----"

Just now, while looking at the population of the factory, I was almost afraid; it seemed to
me that these toilers were different sorts of beings from the detached and impecunious people
who live around me. When I look at this one I say to myself, "They are the same; they are all
alike."

In the distance, and together, they strike fear, and their combination is a menace; but near
by they are only the same as this one.  One must not look at them in the distance.

Pétrolus gets excited; he makes gestures; he punches in and punches out again with his fist,
the hat which is stuck askew on his conical head, over the ears that are pointed like artichoke
leaves.  He is in front of me, and each of his soles is pierced by a valve which draws in water
from the saturated ground.

"The unions, monsieur----" he cries to me in the wind, "why, it's dangerous to point at them.
You haven't the right to think any more--that's what they call liberty.  If you're in them,
you've got to be agin the parsons--(I'm willing, but what's that got to do with labor?)--and
there's something more serious," the lamp-man adds, in a suddenly changed voice, "you've got
to be agin the army,--the army!"

And now the poor slave of the lamp seems to take a resolution.  He stops and devotionally rolling
his Don Quixote eyes in his gloomy, emaciated face, he says, "I'm always thinking about something.
What? you'll say.  Well, here it is.  I belong to the League of Patriots."

As they brighten still more, his eyes are like two live embers in the darkness, "Déroulède!"
he cries; "that's the man--he's my God!"

Pétrolus raises his voice and gesticulates; he makes great movements in the night at the vision
of his idol, to whom his leanness and his long elastic arms give him some resemblance.  "He's
for war; he's for Alsace-Lorraine, that's what he's for; and above all, he's for nothing else.
Ah, that's all there is to it!  The Boches have got to disappear off the earth, else it'll
be us.  Ah, when they talk politics to me, I ask 'em, 'Are you for Déroulède, yes or no?' 
That's enough!  I got my schooling any old how, and I know next to nothing but I reckon it's
grand, only to think like that, and in the Reserves I'm adjutant[1]--almost an officer, monsieur,
just a lamp-man as I am!"

[Footnote 1: A non-com., approximately equivalent to regimental sergeant-major.--Tr.]

He tells me, almost in shouts and signs, because of the wind across the open, that his worship
dates from a function at which Paul Déroulède had spoken to him.  "He spoke to everybody, an'
then he spoke to me, as close to me as you and me; but it was him!  I wanted an idea, and he
gave it to me!"

"Very good," I say to him; "very good.  You are a patriot, that's excellent."

I feel that the greatness of this creed surpasses the selfish demands of labor--although I
have never had the time to think much about these things--and it strikes me as touching and noble.

A last fiery spasm gets hold of Pétrolus as he espies afar Eudo's pointed house, and he cries
that on the great day of revenge there will be some accounts to settle; and then the fervor
of this ideal-bearer cools and fades, and is spent along the length of the roads.  He is now
no more than a poor black bantam which cannot possibly take wing.  His face mournfully awakes
to the evening.  He shuffles along, bows his long and feeble spine, and his spirit and his
strength exhausted, he approaches the porch of his house, where Madame Marcassin awaits him.

CHAPTER VII

A SUMMARY

The workmen manifest mistrust and even dislike towards me.  Why?  I don't know; but my good
intentions have gradually got weary.

One after another, sundry women have occupied my life.  Antonia Véron was first.  Her marriage
and mine, their hindrance and restriction, threw us back upon each other as of yore.  We found
ourselves alone one day in my house--where nothing ever used to happen, and she offered me
her lips, irresistibly.  The appeal of her sensuality was answered by mine, then, and often
later.  But the pleasure constantly restored, which impelled me towards her, always ended in
dismal enlightenments. She remained a capricious and baffling egotist, and when I came away
from her house across the dark suburb among a host of beings vanishing, like myself, I only
brought away the memory of her nervous and irritating laugh, and that new wrinkle which clung
to her mouth like an implement.

Then younger desires destroyed the old, and gallant adventures begot one another.  It is all
over with this one and that one whom I adored. When I see them again, I wonder that I can say,
at one and the same time, of a being who has not changed, "How I loved her!" and, "How I have
ceased to love her!"

All the while performing as a duty my daily task, all the while taking suitable precautions
so that Marie may not know and may not suffer, I am looking for the happiness which lives.
And truly, when I have a sense of some new assent wavering and making ready, or when I am on
the way to a first rendezvous, I feel myself gloriously uplifted, and equal to everything!

This fills my life.  Desire wears the brain as much as thought wears it.  All my being is agog
for chances to shine and to be shared.  When they say in my presence of some young woman that,
"she is not happy," a thrill of joy tears through me.

On Sundays, among the crowds, I have often felt my heart tighten with distress as I watch the
unknown women.  Reverie has often held me all day because of one who has gone by and disappeared,
leaving me a clear vision of her curtained room, and of herself, vibrating like a harp. She,
perhaps, was the one I should have always loved; she whom I seek gropingly, desperately, from
each to the next.  Ah, what a delightful thing to see and to think of a distant woman always
is, whoever she may be!

There are moments when I suffer, and am to be pitied.  Assuredly, if one could read me really,
no one would pity me.  And yet all men are like me.  If they are gifted with acceptable physique
they dream of headlong adventures, they attempt them, and our heart never stands still.  But
no one acknowledges that, no one, ever.

Then, there were the women who turned me a cold shoulder; and among them all Madame Pierron,
a beautiful and genteel woman of twenty-five years, with her black fillets and her marble profile,
who still retained the obvious awkwardness and vacant eye of young married women. Tranquil,
staid and silent, she came and went and lived, totally blind to my looks of admiration.

This perfect unconcern aggravated my passion.  I remember my pangs one morning in June, when
I saw some feminine linen spread upon the green hedge within her garden.  The delicate white
things marshaled there were waiting, stirred by the leaves and the breeze; so that Spring lent
them frail shape and sweetness--and life.  I remember, too, a gaunt house, scorching in the
sun, and a window which flashed and then shut! The window stayed shut, like a slab.  All the
world was silent; and that splendid living being was walled up there.  And last, I have recollection
of an evening when, in the bluish and dark green and chalky landscape of the town and its rounded
gardens, I saw that window lighted up.  A narrow glimmer of rose and gold was enframed there,
and I could distinguish, leaning on the sill that overhung the town, in the heart of that resplendence,
a feminine form which stirred before my eyes in inaccessible forbearance.  Long did I watch
with shaking knees that window dawning upon space, as the shepherd watches the rising of Venus.
That evening, when I had come in and was alone for a moment--Marie was busy below in the kitchen--alone
in our unattractive room, I retired to the starry window, beset by immense thoughts.  These
spaces, these separations, these incalculable durations--they all reduce us to dust, they all
have a sort of fearful splendor from which we seek defense in our hiding.

*        *        *        *        *        *

I have not retained a definite recollection of a period of jealousy from which I suffered for
a year.  From certain facts, certain profound changes of mood in Marie, it seemed to me that
there was some one between her and me.  But beyond vague symptoms and these terrible reflections
on her, I never knew anything.  The truth, everywhere around me, was only a phantom of truth.
I experienced acute internal wounds of humiliation and shame, of rebellion!  I struggled feebly,
as well as I could, against a mystery too great for me, and then my suspicions wore themselves
out.  I fled from the nightmare, and by a strong effort I forgot it.  Perhaps my imputations
had no basis; but it is curious how one ends in only believing what one wants to believe.

*        *        *        *        *        *

Something which had been plotting a long while among the Socialist extremists suddenly produced
a stoppage of work at the factory, and this was followed by demonstrations which rolled through
the terrified town.  Everywhere the shutters went up.  The business people blotted out their
shops, and the town looked like a tragic Sunday.

"It's a revolution!" said Marie to me, turning pale, as Benoît cried to us from the step of
our porch the news that the workmen were marching. "How does it come about that you knew nothing
at the factory?"

An hour later we learned that a delegation composed of the most dangerous ringleaders was preceding
the army of demonstrators, commissioned to extort outrageous advantages, with threats, from
Messrs. Gozlan.

Our quarter had a loose and dejected look.  People went furtively, seeking news, and doors
half opened regretfully.  Here and there groups formed and lamented in undertones the public
authority's lack of foresight, the insufficient measures for preserving order.

Rumors were peddled about on the progress of the demonstration.

"They're crossing the river."

"They're at the Calvary cross-roads."

"It's a march against the castle!"

I went into Fontan's.  He was not there, and some men were talking in the twilight of the closed
shutters.

"The Baroness is in a dreadful way.  She's seen a dark mass in the distance.  Some young men
of the aristocracy have armed themselves and are guarding her.  She says it's another Jacquerie[1]
rising!"

[Footnote 1: A terrible insurrection of the French peasantry in 1358.--Tr.]

"Ah, my God!  What a mess!" said Crillon.

"It's the beginning of the end!" asserted old Daddy Ponce, shaking his grayish-yellow forehead,
all plaited with wrinkles.

Time went by--still no news.  What are they doing yonder?  What shall we hear next?

At last, towards three o'clock Postaire is framed in the doorway, sweating and exultant.  "It's
over!  It's all right, my lad!" he gasps; "I can vouch for it that they all arrived together
at the Gozlans' villa.  Messrs. Gozlan were there.  The delegates, I can vouch for it that
they started shouting and threatening, my lad!  'Never mind that!' says one of the Messrs.
Gozlan, 'let's have a drink first; I'll vouch for it we'll talk better after!'  There was a
table and champagne, I'll vouch for it.  They gave 'em it to drink, and then some more and
then some more.  I'll vouch for it they sent themselves something down, my lad, into their
waistcoats.  I can vouch for it that the bottles of champagne came like magic out of the ground.
Fontan kept always bringing them as though he was coining them.  Got to admit it was an extra-double-special
guaranteed champagne, that you want to go cautious with.  So then, after three-quarters of
an hour, nearly all the deputation were drunk.  They spun round, tongue-tied, and embraced
each other,--I can vouch for it.  There were some that stuck it, but they didn't count, my
lad!  The others didn't even know what they'd come for.  And the bosses; they'd had a fright,
and they didn't half wriggle and roar with laughing--I'll vouch for it, my lad!  An' then,
to-morrow, if they want to start again, there'll be troops here!"

Joyful astonishment--the strike had been drowned in wine!  And we repeated to each other, "To-morrow
there'll be the military!"

"Ah!" gaped Crillon, rolling wonder-struck eyes, "That's clever!  Good; that's clever, that
is!  Good, old chap----"

He laughed a heavy, vengeful laugh, and repeated his familiar refrain full-throated:  "The
sovereign people that can't stand on its own legs!"

By the side of a few faint-hearted citizens who had already, since the morning, modified their
political opinions, a great figure rises before my eyes--Fontan.  I remember that night, already
long ago, when a chance glimpse through the vent-hole of his cellar showed me shiploads of
bottles of champagne heaped together, and pointed like shells.  For some future day he foresaw
to-day's victory.  He is really clever, he sees clearly and he sees far.  He has rescued law
and order by a sort of genius.

The constraint which has weighed all day on our gestures and words explodes in delight.  Noisily
we cast off that demeanor of conspirators which has bent our shoulders since morning.  The
windows that were closed during the weighty hours of the insurrection are opened wide; the
houses breathe again.

"We're saved from that gang!" people say, when they approach each other.

This feeling of deliverance pervades the most lowly.  On the step of the little blood-red restaurant
I spy Monsieur Mielvaque, hopping for joy.  He is shivering, too, in his thin gray coat, cracked
with wrinkles, that looks like wrapping paper; and one would say that his dwindled face had
at long last caught the hue of the folios he desperately copies among his long days and his
short nights, to pick up some sprigs of extra pay.  There he stands, not daring to enter the
restaurant (for a reason he knows too well); but how delighted he is with the day's triumph
for society!  And Mademoiselle Constantine, the dressmaker, incurably poor and worn away by
her sewing-machine, is overjoyed.  She opens wide the eyes which seem eternally full of tears,
and in the grayish abiding half-mourning of imperfect cleanliness, in pallid excitement, she
claps her hands.

Marie and I can hear the furious desperate hammering of Brisbille in his forge, and we begin
to laugh as we have not laughed for a long time.

At night, before going to sleep, I recall my former democratic fancies. Thank God, I have escaped
from a great peril!  I can see it clearly by the terror which the workmen's menace spread in
decent circles, and by the universal joy which greeted their recoil!  My deepest tendencies
take hold of me again for good, and everything settles down as before.

*        *        *        *        *        *

Much time has gone by.  It is ten years now since I was married, and in that lapse of time
there is hardly a happening that I remember, unless it be the disillusion of the death of Marie's
rich godmother, who left us nothing.  There was the failure of the Pocard scheme, which was
only a swindle and ruined many small people.  Politics pervaded the scandal, while certain
people hurried with their money to Monsieur Boulaque, whose scheme was much more safe and substantial.
There was also my father-in-law's illness and his death, which was a great shock to Marie,
and put us into black clothes.

I have not changed.  Marie has somewhat.  She has got stouter; her eyelids look tired and red,
and she buries herself in silences.  We are no longer quite in accord in details of our life.
She who once always said "Yes," is now primarily disposed to say "No."  If I insist she defends
her opinion, obstinately, sourly; and sometimes dishonestly. For example, in the matter of
pulling down the partition downstairs, if people had heard our high voices they would have
thought there was a quarrel.  Following some of our discussions, she keeps her face contracted
and spiteful, or assumes the martyr's air, and sometimes there are moments of hatred between us.

Often she says, while talking of something else, "Ah, if we had had a child, all would have
been different!"

I am becoming personally negligent, through a sort of idleness, against which I have not sufficient
grounds for reaction.  When we are by ourselves, at meal times, my hands are sometimes questionable.
From day to day, and from month to month, I defer going to the dentist and postpone the attention
required.  I am allowing my molars to get jagged.

Marie never shows any jealousy, nor even suspicion about my personal adventures.  Her trust
is almost excessive!  She is not very far-seeing, or else I am nothing very much to her, and
I have a grudge against her for this indifference.

And now I see around me women who are too young to love me.  That most positive of obstacles,
the age difference, begins to separate me from the amorous.  And yet I am not surfeited with
love, and I yearn towards youth!  Marthe, my little sister-in-law, said to me one day, "Now
that you're old----"  That a child of fifteen years, so freshly dawned and really new, can
bring herself to pass this artless judgment on a man of thirty-five--that is fate's first warning,
the first sad day which tells us at midsummer that winter will come.

One evening, as I entered the room, I indistinctly saw Marie, sitting and musing by the window.
As I came in she got up--it was Marthe!  The light from the sky, pale as a dawn, had blenched
the young girl's golden hair and turned the trace of a smile on her cheek into something like
a wrinkle.  Cruelly, the play of the light showed her face faded and her neck flabby; and because
she had been yawning, even her eyes were watery, and for some seconds the lids were sunk and
reddened.

The resemblance of the two sisters tortured me.  This little Marthe, with her luxurious and
appetizing color, her warm pink cheeks and moist lips; this plump adolescent whose short skirt
shows her curving calves, is an affecting picture of what Marie was.  It is a sort of terrible
revelation.  In truth Marthe resembles, more than the Marie of to-day does, the Marie whom
I formerly loved; the Marie who came out of the unknown, whom I saw one evening sitting on
the rose-tree seat, shining, silent--in the presence of love.

It required a great effort on my part not to try, weakly and vainly, to approach Marthe--the
impossible dream, the dream of dreams!  She has a little love affair with a youngster hardly
molted into adolescence, and rather absurd, whom one catches sight of now and again as he slips
away from her side; and that day when she sang so much in spite of herself, it was because
a little rival was ill.  I am as much a stranger to her girlish growing triumph and to her
thoughts as if I were her enemy! 

I tell the Lord all they can get the whipping of the jailer, who still on the Floor of my prison
was and also tell me which account would bring the mayor into trouble. Now I learned the girl had
sworn an oath that it possesses nothing of me. I Please summon my witnesses to report abuse
to the Lord my district director, the mayor advises me that all indicate the final examination, so that
it experienced the High Court.

I was now in a heavy prison, although it was still better than our
hole here which reminds us of the boiler tower in Lucerne.

How do I empty my chamber pot in the morning, several men jump out
of a hiding-pack, me from behind, throw me to the ground, hands and
feet are held, the locksmith shall me riveted every two chains and
with a nail.

On Sunday, two guards come with guns, bring a shirt, separated by the side of the whole and provided
at the sleeves with Bändeln was evening and the Gefangenwärterin, which has since the door had not opened,
so that it looked dirty enough for me.

It brings the Fitting with and says, "Come out, there a chain is removed, because you are now
properly !"--" No, if I have earned the chains, I will take it! "

My prison was some shoe under the ground, such as this, before the speeches of some people
I had taken the same, my story is known throughout the city and look
all , because the well-known as a tyrant of the prisoners and relying
on his great form and strength Jailer fallen yet again to the wrong
man and was so "gezwiebelt" was that he the bed was careful.

Not long after men come to visit the prisons of Ireland, I knew of
the prisoner and heard one after the doors open, and finally the steps
of the visitors, who in more detail and come closer.

Same as before my door who say I hear the magistrate: "Gentlemen, in there is it not clean
!"--"

You're not clean, you tyrant, "I shouted with all his might!; the door is now opened and I chattering
hard with my chains, because light was only through the open door of the start.

After a short introduction, I think a speech to the Lords, the mayor wants to interrupt me,
but a man says that he should first let me finish and I told them everything. The gentlemen
ask if I was sick and I replied, "No, thank God, despite all the
misery I'm up to well now, "... see my Brodlaib, I say, the bread
is bitter as gall, full Sand colic do and they cost all the bread
and say nothing, but one shakes the head.

The Gefangenwärterin said that the prisoners had satisfied all but me with the bread, but now
I tell how different this all would be treated fed and watered as
well those are out, which would bring money or worked for the jailer
and people same as all had been trained on what they should talk to
the visitation.

Correctly all the prisoners are interrogated separately again, I removed
the chains, Everything is better, I get a much better room, but after
a few weeks, my Sentence, which was heavy on 5 years' imprisonment,
with welcome and farewell.

The magistrate gives me the welcome to stick with 25 beating Measure off immediately, I was
guarded and then delivered to the penitentiary.

Here I did not want to work until another investigation was initiated, the administrator said
he could not do anything, I should take recourse, unfortunately I had to the matter was not yet
busy. I worked until I receive and in the first 25 Forced chair had
sung.

Soon comes a high-ranking lord of Karlsruhe, I'm writing to him, tell the same Everything that supports
managers and sued me and at the same time The Lord promises to do what is possible.

Soon I was taken out of the heavy imprisonment in the workhouse to
Bruchsal, the five-year Penalty, however, remained and the whole was
regarded as a mercy thing.

Grace, I had but not wanted now was an outbreak that was caught, received 40 blows in Stock 2 servings
and 4 weeks of heavy iron.

From then on, I remained calm, took my 5 years and was beabschiedet
with 25 blows.

The first what I did was that I as an interpreter in two large inns announced and accepted.

The jailer, who all prisoners abused so bad, was dead, the unjust
steward dismissed and despised, God is just!

I earned a lot of money
and lived in a house in which a shopkeeper, the house irend herumzog
in the country, had their defeat. This gave me the long teeth, that,
as if they at home, a house and fields possess, and would marry me.

The regimental sergeant-major cut the discussion short as he turned to Brisbille with vibrant
scorn and said, "When the Day of Revenge comes, we shall have to be there to defend you!"

And Brisbille only uttered a shapeless reply, for the sergeant-major was an athlete, and gifted
with a bad temper, especially when others were present.

The castle was quartering a Staff.  Hunting parties were given for the occasion in the manorial
demesne, and passing processions of bedizened guests were seen.  Among the generals and nobles
shone an Austrian prince of the blood royal, who bore one of the great names in the Almanach
de Gotha, and who was officially in France to follow the military operations.

The presence of the Baroness's semi-Imperial guest caused a great impression of historic glamour
to hover over the country.  His name was repeated; his windows were pointed out in the middle
of the principal front, and one thought himself lucky if he saw the curtains moving. Many families
of poor people detached themselves from their quarters in the evenings to take up positions
before the wall behind which he was.

Marie and I, we were close to him twice.

One evening after dinner, we met him as one meets any passer-by among the rest.  He was walking
alone, covered by a great gray waterproof. His felt hat was adorned with a short feather. 
He displayed the characteristic features of his race--a long turned-down nose and a receding chin.

When he had gone by, Marie and I said, both at the same time, and a little dazzled, "An eagle!"

We saw him again at the end of a stag-hunt.  They had driven a stag into the Morteuil forest.
The mort took place in a clearing in the park, near the outer wall.  The Baroness, who always
thought of the townsfolk, had ordered the little gate to be opened which gives into this part
of the demesne, so that the public could be present at the spectacle.

It was imperious and pompous.  The scene one entered, on leaving the sunny fields and passing
through the gate, was a huge circle of dark foliage in the heart of the ancient forest.  At
first, one saw only the majestic summits of mountainous trees, like peaks and globes lost amid
the heavens, which on all sides overhung the clearing and bathed it in twilight almost green.

In this lordly solemnity of nature, down among the grass, moss and dead wood, there flowed
a contracted but brilliant concourse around the final preparations for the execution of the stag.

The animal was kneeling on the ground, weak and overwhelmed.  We pressed round, and eyes were
thrust forward between heads and shoulders to see him.  One could make out the gray thicket
of his antlers, his great lolling tongue, and the enormous throb of his heart, agitating his
exhausted body.  A little wounded fawn clung to him, bleeding abundantly, flowing like a spring.

Round about it the ceremony was arranged in several circles.  The beaters, in ranks, made a
glaring red patch in the moist green atmosphere.  The hunters, men and women, all dismounted,
in scarlet coats and black hats, crowded together.  Apart, the saddle and tackle horses snorted,
with creaking of leather and jingle of metal.  Kept at a respectful distance by a rope extended
hastily on posts, the inquisitive crowd flowed and increased every instant.

The blood which issued from the little fawn made a widening pool, and one saw the ladies of
the hunt, who came to look as near as possible, pluck up their habits so that they would not
tread in it.  The sight of the great stag crushed by weariness, gradually drooping his branching
head, tormented by the howls of the hounds which the whipper-in held back with difficulty,
and that of the little one, cowering beside him and dying with gaping throat, would have been
touching had one given way to sentiment.

I noticed that the imminent slaying of the stag excited a certain curious fever.  Around me
the women and young girls especially elbowed and wriggled their way to the front, and shuddered,
and were glad.

They cut the throats of the beasts, the big and the little, amid absolute and religious silence,
the silence of a sacrament.  Madame Lacaille vibrated from head to foot.  Marie was calm, but
there was a gleam in her eyes; and little Marthe, who was hanging on to me, dug her nails into
my arm.  The prince was prominent on our side, watching the last act of the run.  He had remained
in the saddle.  He was more splendidly red than the others--empurpled, it seemed, by reflections
from a throne.  He spoke in a loud voice, like one who is accustomed to govern and likes to
discourse; and his outline had the very form of bidding.  He expressed himself admirably in
our language, of which he knew the intimate graduations.  I heard him saying, "These great
maneuvers, after all, they're a sham.  It's music-hall war, directed by scene-shifters.  Hunting's
better, because there's blood.  We get too much unaccustomed to blood, in our prosaic, humanitarian,
and bleating age.  Ah, as long as the nations love hunting, I shall not despair of them!"

Just then, the crash of the horns and the thunder of the pack released drowned all other sounds.
The prince, erect in his stirrups, and raising his proud head and his tawny mustache above
the bloody and cringing mob of the hounds, expanded his nostrils and seemed to sniff a battlefield.

The next day, when a few of us were chatting together in the street near the sunken post where
the old jam-pot lies, Benoît came up, full of a tale to tell.  Naturally it was about the prince.
Benoît was dejected and his lips were drawn and trembling.  "He's killed a bear!" said he,
with glittering eye; "you should have seen it, ah! a tame bear, of course.  Listen--he was
coming back from hunting with the Marquis and Mademoiselle Berthe and some people behind. 
And he comes on a wandering showman with a performing bear.  A simpleton with long black hair
like feathers, and a bear that sat on its rump and did little tricks and wore a belt.  The
prince had got his gun.  I don't know how it came about but the prince he got an idea.  He
said, 'I'd like to kill that bear, as I do in my own hunting.  Tell me, my good fellow, how
much shall I pay you for firing at the beast?  You'll not be a loser, I promise you.'  The
simpleton began to tremble and lift his arms up in the air.  He loved his bear!  'But my bear's
the same as my brother!' he says.  Then do you know what the Marquis of Monthyon did?  He just
simply took out his purse and opened it and put it under the chap's nose; and all the smart
hunting folk they laughed to see how the simpleton changed when he saw all those bank notes.
And naturally he ended by nodding that it was a bargain, and he'd even seen so many of the
rustlers that he turned from crying to laughing!  Then the prince loaded his gun at ten paces
from the bear and killed it with one shot, my boy; just when he was rocking left and right,
and sitting up like a man.  You ought to have seen it!  There weren't a lot there; but I was
there!"

The story made an impression.  No one spoke at first.  Then some one risked the opinion.  "No
doubt they do things like that in Hungary or Bohemia, or where he reigns.  You wouldn't see
it here," he added, innocently.

"He's from Austria," Tudor corrected.

"Yes," muttered Crillon, "but whether he's Austrian or whether he's Bohemian or Hungarian,
he's a grandee, so he's got the right to do what he likes, eh?"

Eudo looked as if he would intervene at this point and was seeking words.  (Not long before
that he had had the queer notion of sheltering and nursing a crippled hind that had escaped
from a previous run, and his act had given great displeasure in high places.)  So as soon as
he opened his mouth we made him shut it.  The idea of Eudo in judgment on princes!

And the rest lowered their heads and nodded and murmured, "Yes, he's a grandee."

And the little phrase spread abroad, timidly and obscurely.

*        *        *        *        *        *

When All Saints' Day came round, many of the distinguished visitors at the castle were still
there.  Every year that festival gives us occasion for an historical ceremony on the grand
scale.  At two o'clock all the townsfolk that matter gather with bunches of flowers on the
esplanade or in front of the cemetery half-way up Chestnut Hill, for the ceremony and an open
air service.

Early in the afternoon I betook myself with Marie to the scene.  I put on a fancy waistcoat
of black and white check and my new patent leather boots, which make me look at them.  It is
fine weather on this Sunday of Sundays, and the bells are ringing.  Everywhere the hurrying
crowd climbs the hill--peasants in flat caps, working families in their best clothes, young
girls with faces white and glossy as the bridal satin which is the color of their thoughts,
young men carrying jars of flowers.  All these appear on the esplanade, where graying lime
trees are also in assembly.  Children are sitting on the ground.

Monsieur Joseph Bonéas, in black, with his supremely distinguished air, goes by holding his
mother's arm.  I bow deeply to them.  He points at the unfolding spectacle as he passes and
says, "It is our race's festival."

The words made me look more seriously at the scene before my eyes--all this tranquil and contemplative
stir in the heart of festive nature. Reflection and the vexations of my life have mellowed
my mind.  The idea at last becomes clear in my brain of an entirety, an immense multitude in
space, and infinite in time, a multitude of which I am an integral part, which has shaped me
in its image, which continues to keep me like it, and carries me along its control; my own people.

Baroness Grille, in the riding habit that she almost always wears when mixing with the people,
is standing near the imposing entry to the cemetery.  Monsieur the Marquis of Monthyon is holding
aloft his stately presence, his handsome and energetic face.  Solid and sporting, with dazzling
shirt cuffs and fine ebon-black shoes, he parades a smile.  There is an M.P. too, a former
Minister, very assiduous, who chats with the old duke.  There are the Messrs. Gozlan and famous
people whose names one does not know.  Members of the Institute of the great learned associations,
or people fabulously wealthy.

Not far from these groups, which are divided from the rest by a scarlet barrier of beaters
and the flashing chain of their slung horns, arises Monsieur Fontan.  The huge merchant and
café-owner occupies an intermediate and isolated place between principals and people.  His
face is disposed in fat white tiers, like a Buddha's belly. Monumentally motionless he says
nothing at all, but he tranquilly spits all around him.  He radiates saliva.

And for this ceremony, which seems like an apotheosis, all the notables of our quarter are
gathered together, as well as those of the other quarter, who seem different and are similar.

We elbow the ordinary types.  Apolline goes crabwise.  She is in new things, and has sprinkled
Eau-de-Cologne on her skin; her eye is bright; her face well-polished; her ears richly adorned.
She is always rather dirty, and her wrists might be branches, but she has cotton gloves.  There
are some shadows in the picture, for Brisbille has come with his crony, Termite, so that his
offensive and untidy presence may be a protest.  There is another blot--a working man's wife,
who speaks at their meetings; people point at her.  "What's that woman doing here?"

"She doesn't believe in God," says some one.

"Ah," says a mother standing by, "that's because she has no children."

"Yes, she's got two."

"Then," says the poor woman, "it's because they've never been ill."

Here is little Antoinette and the old priest is holding her hand.  She must be fifteen or sixteen
years old by now, and she has not grown--or, at least, one has not noticed it.  Father Piot,
always white, gentle and murmurous, has shrunk a little; more and more he leans towards the
tomb.  Both of them proceed in tiny steps.

"They're going to cure her, it seems.  They're seeing to it seriously."

"Yes--the extraordinary secret remedy they say they're going to try."

"No, it's not that now.  It's the new doctor who's come to live here, and he says, they say,
that he's going to see about it."

"Poor little angel!"

The almost blind child, whose Christian name alone one knows, and whose health is the object
of so much solicitude, goes stiffly by, as if she were dumb also, and deaf to all the prayers
that go on with her.

After the service some one comes forward and begins to speak.  He is an old man, an officer
of the Legion of Honor; his voice is weak but his face noble.

He speaks of the Dead, whose day this is.  He explains to us that we are not separated from
them; not only by reason of the future life and our sacred creeds, but because our life on
earth must be purely and simply a continuation of theirs.  We must do as they did, and believe
what they believed, else shall we fall into error and utopianism.  We are all linked to each
other and with the past; we are bound together by an entirety of traditions and precepts. 
Our normal destiny, so adequate to our nature, must be allowed to fulfill itself along the
indicated path, without hearkening to the temptations of novelty, of hate, of envy--of envy
above all, that social cancer, that enemy of the great civic virtue--Discipline.

He ceases.  The echo of the great magnificent words floats in the silence.  Everybody does
not understand all that has just been said; but all have a deep impression that the text is
one of simplicity, of moderation, of obedience, and foreheads move altogether in the breath
of the phrases like a field in the breeze.

"Yes," says Crillon, pensively, "he speaks to confection, that gentleman.  All that one thinks
about, you can see it come out of his mouth.  Common sense and reverence, we're attached to
'em by something."

"We are attached to them by orderliness," says Joseph Bonéas.

"The proof that it's the truth," Crillon urges, "is that it's in the dissertions of everybody."

"To be sure!" says Benoît, going a bit farther, "since everybody says it, and it's become a
general repetition!"

The good old priest, in the center of an attentive circle, is unstringing a few observations.
"Er, hem," he says, "one should not blaspheme.  Ah, if there were not a good God, there would
be many things to say; but so long as there is a good God, all that happens is adorable, as
Monseigneur said.  We shall make things better, certainly. Poverty and public calamities and
war, we shall change all that, we shall set those things to rights, er, hem!  But let us alone,
above all, and don't concern yourselves with it--you would spoil everything, my children. 
We shall do all that, but not immediately."

"Quite so, quite so," we say in chorus.

"Can we be happy all at once," the old man goes on; "change misery into joy, and poverty into
riches?  Come now, it's not possible, and I'll tell you why; if it had been as easy as all
that, it would have been done already, wouldn't it?"

The bells begin to ring.  The four strokes of the hour are just falling from the steeple which
the rising mists touch already, though the evening makes use of it last of all; and just then
one would say that the church is beginning to talk even while it is singing.

The important people get onto their horses or into their carriages and go away--a cavalcade
where uniforms gleam and gold glitters.  We can see the procession of the potentates of the
day outlined on the crest of the hill which is full of our dead.  They climb and disappear,
one by one.  Our way is downward; but we form--they above and we below--one and the same mass,
all visible together.

"It's fine!" says Marie, "it looks as if they were galloping over us!"

They are the shining vanguard that protects us, the great eternal framework which upholds our
country, the forces of the mighty past which illuminate it and protect it against enemies and
revolutions.

And we, we are all alike, in spite of our different minds; alike in the greatness of our common
interests and even in the littleness of our personal aims.  I have become increasingly conscious
of this close concord of the masses beneath a huge and respect-inspiring hierarchy. It permits
a sort of lofty consolation and is exactly adapted to a life like mine.  This evening, by the
light of the setting sun, I see it and read it and admire it.

All together we go down by the fields where tranquil corn is growing, by the gardens and orchards
where homely trees are making ready their offerings--the scented blossom which lends, the fruit
which gives itself.  They form an immense plain, sloping and darkling, with brown undulations
under the blue which now alone is becoming green.  A little girl, who has come from the spring,
puts down her bucket and stands at the roadside like a post, looking with all her eyes.  She
looks at the marching multitude with beaming curiosity.  Her littleness embraces that immensity,
because it is all a part of Order.  A peasant who has stuck to his work in spite of the festival
and is bent over the deep shadows of his field, raises himself from the earth which is so like
him, and turns towards the golden sun the shining monstrance of his face.

*        *        *        *        *        *

But what is this--this sort of madman, who stands in the middle of the road and looks as if,
all by himself, he would bar the crowd's passage? We recognize Brisbille, swaying tipsily in
the twilight.  There is an eddy and a muttering in the flow.

"D'you want to know where all that's leading you?" he roars, and nothing more can be heard
but his voice.  "It's leading you to hell! It's the old rotten society, with the profiteering
of all them that can, and the stupidity of the rest!  To hell, I tell you!  To-morrow look
out for yourselves!  To-morrow!"

A woman's voice cries from out of the shadows, in a sort of scuffle, "Be quiet, wicked man!
You've no right to frighten folks!"

But the drunkard continues to shout full-throated, "To-morrow! To-morrow!  D'you think things
will always go on like that?  You're fit for killing!  To hell!"

Some people are impressed and disappear into the evening.  Those who are marking time around
the obscure fanatic are growling, "He's not only bad, he's mad, the dirty beast!"

"It's disgraceful," says the young curate.

Brisbille goes up to him.  "You tell me, then, you, what'll happen very soon--Jesuit, puppet,
land-shark!  We know you, you and your filthy, poisonous trade!"

"Say that again!"

It was I who said that.  Leaving Marie's arm instinctively I sprang forward and planted myself
before the sinister person.  After the horrified murmur which followed the insult, a great
silence had fallen on the scene.

Astounded, and his face suddenly filling with fear, Brisbille stumbles and beats a retreat.

The crowd regains confidence, and laughs, and congratulates me, and reviles the back of the
man who is sinking in the stream.

"You were fine!" Marie said to me when I took her arm again, slightly trembling.

I returned home elated by my energetic act, still all of a tremor, proud and happy.  I have
obeyed the prompting of my blood.  It was the great ancestral instinct which made me clench
my fists and throw myself bodily, like a weapon, upon the enemy of all.

After dinner, naturally, I went to the military tattoo, at which, by an unpardonable indifference,
I have not regularly been present, although these patriotic demonstrations have been organized
by Monsieur Joseph Bonéas and his League of Avengers.  A long-drawn shudder, shrill and sonorous,
took flight through the main streets, filling the spectators and especially the young folks,
with enthusiasm for the great and glorious deeds of the future.  And Pétrolus, in the front
row of the crowd, was striding along in the crimson glow of the fairy-lamps--clad in a visionary
uniform of red.

I remember that I talked a great deal that evening in our quarter, and then in the house. 
Our quarter is something like all towns, something like all country-sides, something like it
is everywhere--it is a foreshortened picture of all societies in the old universe, as my life
is a picture of life.

CHAPTER IX

THE STORM

"There's going to be war," said Benoît, on our doorsteps in July.

"No," said Crillon, who was there, too, "I know well enough there'll be war some day, seeing
there's always been war after war since the world was a world, and therefore there'll be another;
but just now--at once--a big job like that?  Nonsense!  It's not true.  No."

Some days went by, tranquilly, as days do.  Then the great story reappeared, increased and
branched out in all directions.  Austria, Serbia, the ultimatum, Russia.  The notion of war
was soon everywhere. You could see it distracting men and slackening their pace in the going
and coming of work.  One divined it behind the doors and windows of the houses.

One Saturday evening, when Marie and I--like most of the French--did not know what to think,
and talked emptily, we heard the town crier, who performs in our quarter, as in the villages.

"Ah!" she said.

We went out and saw in the distance the back of the man who was tapping a drum.  His smock
was ballooned.  He seemed pushed aslant by the wind, stiffening himself in the summer twilight
to sound his muffled roll. Although we could not see him well and scarcely heard him, his progress
through the street had something grand about it.

Some people grouped in a corner said to us, "The mobilization."

No other word left their lips.  I went from group to group to form an opinion, but people drew
back with sealed faces, or mechanically raised their arms heavenwards.  And we knew no better
what to think now that we were at last informed.

We went back into the court, the passage, the room, and then I said to Marie, "I go on the
ninth day--a week, day after to-morrow--to my depot at Motteville."

She looked at me, as though doubtful.

I took my military pay book from the wardrobe and opened it on the table.  Leaning against
each other, we looked chastely at the red page where the day of my joining was written, and
we spelled it all out as if we were learning to read.

Next day and the following days everybody went headlong to meet the newspapers.  We read in
them--and under their different titles they were then all alike--that a great and unanimous
upspringing was electrifying France, and the little crowd that we were felt itself also caught
by the rush of enthusiasm and resolution.  We looked at each other with shining eyes of approval.
I, too, I heard myself cry, "At last!"  All our patriotism rose to the surface.

Our quarter grew fevered.  We made speeches, we proclaimed the moral verities--or explained
them.  The echoes of vast or petty news went by in us.  In the streets, the garrison officers
walked, grown taller, disclosed.  It was announced that Major de Trancheaux had rejoined, in
spite of his years, and that the German armies had attacked us in three places at once.  We
cursed the Kaiser and rejoiced in his imminent chastisement.  In the middle of it all France
appeared personified, and we reflected on her great life, now suddenly and nakedly exposed.

"It was easy to foresee this war, eh?" said Crillon.

Monsieur Joseph Bonéas summarized the world-drama.  We were all pacific to the point of stupidity--little
saints, in fact.  No one in France spoke any longer of revenge, nobody wished it, nobody thought
of as much as getting ready for war.  We had all of us in our hearts only dreams of universal
happiness and progress, the while Germany secretly prepared everything for hurling herself
on us.  "But," he added, he also carried away, "she'll get it in the neck, and that's all about
it!"

The desire for glory was making its way, and one cloudily imagines Napoleon reborn.

In these days, only the mornings and evenings returned as usual, everything else was upside
down, and seemed temporary.  The workers moved and talked in a desert of idleness, and one
saw invisible changes in the scenery of our valley and the cavity of our sky.

We saw the Cuirassiers of the garrison go away in the evening.  The massive platoons of young-faced
horsemen, whose solemn obstruction heavily hammered the stones of the street, were separated
by horses loaded with bales of forage, by regimental wagons and baggage-carts, which rattled
unendingly.  We formed a hedgerow along the twilight causeways and watched them all disappear.
Suddenly we cheered them. The thrill that went through horses and men straightened them up
and they went away bigger--as if they were coming back!

"It's magnificent, how warlike we are in France!" said fevered Marie, squeezing my arm with
all her might.

The departures, of individuals or groups, multiplied.  A sort of methodical and inevitable
tree-blazing--conducted sometimes by the police--ransacked the population and thinned it from
day to day around the women.

Increasing hurly-burly was everywhere--all the complicated measures so prudently foreseen and
so interdependent; the new posters on top of the old ones, the requisitioning of animals and
places, the committees and the allowances, the booming and momentous gales of motor-cars filled
with officers and aristocratic nurses--so many lives turned inside out and habits cut in two.
But hope bedazzled all anxieties and stopped up the gaps for the moment.  And we admired the
beauty of military orderliness and France's preparation.

Sometimes, at windows or street-corners, there were apparitions--people covered with new uniforms.
We had known them in vain, and did not know them at first.  Count d'Orchamp, lieutenant in
the Active Reserves, and Dr. Bardoux, town-major, displaying the cross of the Legion of Honor,
found themselves surrounded by respectful astonishment.  Adjutant Marcassin rose suddenly to
the eyes as though he had come out of the earth; Marcassin, brand-new, rigid, in blue and red,
with his gold stripe.  One saw him afar, fascinating the groups of urchins who a week ago threw
stones at him.

"The old lot--the little ones, and the middling ones and the big ones--all getting new clothes!"
says a triumphant woman of the people.

Another said it was the coming of a new reign.

*        *        *        *        *        *

From the Friday onwards I was engrossed by my own departure.  It was that day that we went
to buy boots.  We admired the beautiful arrangement of the Cinema Hall as a Red Cross hospital.

"They've thought of everything!" said Marie, examining the collection of beds, furniture, and
costly chests, rich and perfected material, all arranged with delighted and very French animation
by a team of attendants who were under the orders of young Varennes, a pretty hospital sergeant,
and Monsieur Lucien Gozlan, superintendent officer.

A center of life had created itself around the hospital.  An open air buffet had been set up
in a twinkling.  Apolline came there--since the confusion of the mobilization all days were
Sundays for her--to provide herself with nips.  We saw her hobbling along broadwise, hugging
her half-pint measure in her short turtle-like arms, the carrot slices of her cheek-bones reddening
as she already staggered with hope.

On our way back, as we passed in front of Fontan's café, we caught a glimpse of Fontan himself,
assiduous, and his face lubricated with a smile.  Around him they were singing the Marseillaise
in the smoke.  He had increased his staff, and he himself was making himself two, serving and
serving.  His business was growing by the fatality of things.

When we got back to our street, it was deserted, as of yore.  The faraway flutterings of the
Marseillaise were dying.  We heard Brisbille, drunk, hammering with all his might on his anvil.
The same old shadows and the same lights were taking their places in the houses. It seemed
that ordinary life was coming back as it had been into our corner after six days of supernatural
disturbance, and that the past was already stronger than the present.

Before mounting our steps we saw, crouching in front of his shop door by the light of a lamp
that was hooded by whirling mosquitoes, the mass of Crillon, who was striving to attach to
a cudgel a flap for the crushing of flies.  Bent upon his work, his gaping mouth let hang the
half of a globular and shining tongue.  Seeing us with our parcels, he threw down his tackle,
roared a sigh, and said, "That wood!  It's touchwood, yes.  A butter-wire's the only thing
for cutting that!"

He stood up, discouraged; then changing his idea, and lighted from below by his lamp so that
he flamed in the evening, he extended his tawny-edged arm and struck me on the shoulder.  "We
said war, war, all along.  Very well, we've got war, haven't we?"

In our room I said to Marie, "Only three days left."

Marie came and went and talked continually round me, all the time sewing zinc buttons onto
the new pouch, stiff with its dressing.  She seemed to be making an effort to divert me.  She
had on a blue blouse, well-worn and soft, half open at the neck.  Her place was a great one
in that gray room.

She asked me if I should be a long time away, and then, as whenever she put that question she
went on, "Of course, you don't a bit know."  She regretted that I was only a private like everybody.
She hoped it would be over long before the winter.

I did not speak.  I saw that she was looking at me secretly, and she surrounded me pell-mell
with the news she had picked up.  "D'you know, the curate has gone as a private, no more nor
less, like all the clergy.  And Monsieur the Marquis, who's a year past the age already, has
written to the Minister of War to put himself at his disposition, and the Minister has sent
a courier to thank him."  She finished wrapping up and tying some toilet items and also some
provisions, as if for a journey.  "All your bits of things are there.  You'll be absolutely
short of nothing, you see."

Then she sat down and sighed.  "Ah," she said, "war, after all, it's more terrible than one
imagines."

She seemed to be having tragic presentiments.  Her face was paler than usual; the normal lassitude
of her features was full of gentleness; her eyelids were rosy as roses.  Then she smiled weakly
and said, "There are some young men of eighteen who've enlisted, but only for the duration
of the war.  They've done right; that'll be useful to them all ways later in life."

*        *        *        *        *        *

On Monday we hung about the house till four o'clock, when I left it to go to the Town Hall,
and then to the station.

At the Town Hall a group of men, like myself, were stamping about. They were loaded with parcels
in string; new boots hung from their shoulders.  I went up to mix with my new companions. 
Tudor was topped by an artilleryman's cap.  Monsieur Mielvaque was bustling about, embarrassed--exactly
as at the factory--by the papers he held in his hand; and he had exchanged his eyeglasses for
spectacles, which stood for the beginning of his uniform.  Every man talked about himself,
and gave details concerning his regiment, his depot, and some personal peculiarity.

"I'm staying," says the adjutant master-at-arms, who rises impeccably in his active service
uniform, amid the bustle and the neutral-tinted groups; "I'm not going.  I'm the owner of my
rank, and they haven't got the right to send me to join the army."

We waited long, and some hours went by.  A rumor went round that we should not go till the
next day.  But suddenly there was silence, a stiffening up, and a military salute all round.
The door had just opened to admit Major de Trancheaux.

The women drew aside.  A civilian who was on the lookout for him went up, hat in hand, and
spoke to him in undertones.

"But, my friend," cried the Major, quitting the importunate with a quite military abruptness,
"it's not worth while.  In two months the war will be over!"

He came up to us.  He was wearing a white band on his cap.

"He's in command at the station," they say.

He gave us a patriotic address, brief and spirited.  He spoke of the great revenge so long
awaited by French hearts, assured us that we should all be proud, later, to have lived in those
hours, thrilled us all, and added, "Come, say good-by to your folks.  No more women now. And
let's be off, for I'm going with you as far as the station."

A last confused scrimmage--with moist sounds of kisses and litanies of advice--closed up in
the great public hall.

When I had embraced Marie I joined these who were falling in near the road.  We went off in
files of four.  All the causeways were garnished with people, because of us; and at that moment
I felt a lofty emotion and a real thrill of glory.

At the corner of a street I saw Crillon and Marie, who had run on ahead to take their stand
on our route.  They waved to me.

"Now, keep your peckers up, boys!  You're not dead yet, eh!" Crillon called to us.

Marie was looking at me and could not speak.

"In step!  One-two!" cried Adjutant Marcassin, striding along the detachment.

We crossed our quarter as the day declined over it.  The countryman who was walking beside
me shook his head and in the dusky immensity among the world of things we were leaving, with
big regular steps, fused into one single step, he scattered wondering words.  "Frenzy, it is,"
he murmured.  "I haven't had time to understand it yet.  And yet, you know, there are some
that say, I understand; well, I'm telling you, that's not possible."

The station--but we do not stop.  They have opened before us the long yellow barrier which
is never opened.  They make us cross the labyrinth of hazy rails, and crowd us along a dark,
covered platform between iron pillars.

And there, suddenly, we see that we are alone.

*        *        *        *        *        *

The town--and life--are yonder, beyond that dismal plain of rails, paths, low buildings and
mists which surrounds us to the end of sight. A chilliness is edging in along with twilight,
and falling on our perspiration and our enthusiasm.  We fidget and wait.  It goes gray, and
then black.  The night comes to imprison us in its infinite narrowness.  We shiver and can
see nothing more.  With difficulty I can make out, along our trampled platform, a dark flock,
the buzz of voices, the smell of tobacco.  Here and there a match flame or the red point of
a cigarette makes some face phosphorescent.  And we wait, unoccupied, and weary of waiting,
until we sit down, close-pressed against each other, in the dark and the desert.

Some hours later Adjutant Marcassin comes forward, a lantern in his hand, and in a strident
voice calls the roll.  Then he goes away, and we begin again to wait.

At ten o'clock, after several false alarms, the right train is announced.  It comes up, distending
as it comes, black and red.  It is already crowded, and it screams.  It stops, and turns the
platform into a street.  We climb up and put ourselves away--not without glimpses, by the light
of lanterns moving here and there, of some chalk sketches on the carriages--heads of pigs in
spiked helmets, and the inscription, "To Berlin!"--the only things which slightly indicate
where we are going.

The train sets off.  We who have just got in crowd to the windows and try to look outside,
towards the level crossing where, perhaps, the people in whom we live are still watching for
us; but the eye can no longer pick up anything but a vague stirring, shaded with crayon and
jumbled with nature.  We are blind and we fall back each to his place. When we are enveloped
in the iron-hammered rumble of advance, we fix up our luggage, arrange ourselves for the night,
smoke, drink and talk. Badly lighted and opaque with fumes, the compartment might be a corner
of a tavern that has been caught up and swept away into the unknown.

Some conversation mixes its rumble with that of the train.  My neighbors talk about crops and
sunshine and rain.  Others, scoffers and Parisians, speak of popular people and principally
of music-hall singers.  Others sleep, lying somehow or other on the wood.  Their open mouths
make murmur, and the oscillation jerks them without tearing them from their torpor.  I go over
in my thoughts the details of the last day, and even my memories of times gone by when there
was nothing going on.

*        *        *        *        *        *

We traveled all night.  At long intervals some one would let a window drop at a station; a
damp and cavernous breath would penetrate the overdone atmosphere of the carriage.  We saw
darkness and some porter's lantern dancing in the abyss of night.

Several times we made very long halts--to let the trains of regular troops go by.  In one station
where our train stood for hours, we saw several of them go roaring by in succession.  Their
speed blurred the partitions between the windows and the huge vertebrae of the coaches, seeming
to blend together the soldiers huddled there; and the glance which plunged into the train's
interior descried, in its feeble and whirling illumination, a long, continuous and tremulous
chain, clad in blue and red.  Several times on the journey we got glimpses of these interminable
lengths of humanity, hurled by machinery from everywhere to the frontiers, and almost towing
each other.

CHAPTER X

THE WALLS

At daybreak there was a stop, and they said to us, "You're there."

We got out, yawning, our teeth chattering, and grimy with night, on to a platform black-smudged
by drizzling rain, in the middle of a sheet of mist which was torn by blasts of distant whistling.
Disinterred from the carriages, our shadows heaped themselves there and waited, like bales
of goods in the dawn's winter.

Adjutant Marcassin, who had gone in quest of instructions, returned at last.  "It's that way."

He formed us in fours.  "Forward!  Straighten up!  Keep step!  Look as if you had something
about you."

The rhythm of the step pulled at our feet and dovetailed us together. The adjutant marched
apart along the little column.  Questioned by one of us who knew him intimately, he made no
reply.  From time to time he threw a quick glance, like the flick of a whip, to make sure that
we were in step.

I thought I was going again to the old barracks, where I did my term of service, but I had
a sadder disappointment than was reasonable.  Across some land where building was going on,
deeply trenched, beplastered and soiled with white, we arrived at a new barracks, sinisterly
white in a velvet pall of fog.  In front of the freshly painted gate there was already a crowd
of men like us, clothed in subdued civilian hues in the coppered dust of the first rays of day.

They made us sit on forms round the guard room.  We waited there all the day.  As the scorching
sun went round it forced us to change our places several times.  We ate with our knees for
tables, and as I undid the little parcels that Marie had made, it seemed to me that I was touching
her hands.  When the evening had fallen, a passing officer noticed us, made inquiries, and
we were mustered.  We plunged into the night of the building.  Our feet stumbled and climbed
helter-skelter, between pitched walls up the steps of a damp staircase, which smelt of stale
tobacco and gas-tar, like all barracks.  They led us into a dark corridor, pierced by little
pale blue windows, where draughts came and went violently, a corridor spotted at each end by
naked gas-jets, their flames buffeted and snarling.

A lighted doorway was stoppered by a throng--the store-room.  I ended by getting in in my turn,
thanks to the pressure of the compact file which followed me, and pushed me like a spiral spring.
Some barrack sergeants were exerting themselves authoritatively among piles of new-smelling
clothes, of caps and glittering equipment.  Geared into the jerky hustle from which we detached
ourselves one by one, I made the tour of the place, and came out of it wearing red trousers
and carrying my civilian clothes, and a blue coat on my arm; and not daring to put on either
my hat or the military cap that I held in my hand.

We have dressed ourselves all alike.  I look at the others since I cannot look at myself, and
thus I see myself dimly.  Gloomily we eat stew, by the miserable illumination of a candle,
in the dull desert of the mess room.  Then, our mess-tins cleaned, we go down to the great
yard, gray and stagnant.  Just as we pour out into it, there is the clash of a closing gate
and a tightened chain.  An armed sentry goes up and down before the gate.  It is forbidden
to go out under pain of court-martial.  To westward, beyond some indistinct land, we see the
buried station, reddening and smoking like a factory, and sending out rusty flashes.  On the
other side is the trench of a street; and in its extended hollow are the bright points of some
windows and the radiance of a shop.  With my face between the bars of the gate, I look on this
reflection of the other life; then I go back to the black staircase, the corridor and the dormitory,
I who am something and yet am nothing, like a drop of water in a river.

*        *        *        *        *        *

We stretch ourselves on straw, in thin blankets.  I go to sleep with my head on the bundle
of my civilian clothes.  In the morning I find myself again and throw off a long dream--all
at once impenetrable.

My neighbor, sitting on his straw with his hair over his nose, is occupied in scratching his
feet.  He yawns into tears, and says to me, "I've dreamt about myself."

*        *        *        *        *        *

Several days followed each other.  We remained imprisoned in the barracks, in ignorance.  The
only events were those related by the newspapers which were handed to us through the gates
in the morning. The war got on very slowly; it immobilized itself, and we--we did nothing,
between the roll-calls, the parades, and from time to time some cleaning fatigues.  We could
not go into the town, and we waited for the evening--standing, sitting, strolling in the mess
room (which never seemed empty, so strong was the smell that filled it), wandering about the
dark stairs and the corridors dark as iron, or in the yard, or as far as the gates, or the
kitchens, which last were at the rear of the buildings, and smelt in turns throughout the day
of coffee-grounds and grease.

We said that perhaps, undoubtedly indeed, we should stay there till the end of the war.  We
moped.  When we went to bed we were tired with standing still, or with walking too slowly.
We should have liked to go to the front.

Marcassin, housed in the company office, was never far away, and kept an eye on us in silence.
One day I was sharply rebuked by him for having turned the water on in the lavatory at a time
other than placarded.  Detected, I had to stand before him at attention.  He asked me in coarse
language if I knew how to read, talked of punishment, and added, "Don't do it again!"  This
tirade, perhaps justified on the whole, but tactlessly uttered by the quondam Pétrolus, humiliated
me deeply and left me gloomy all the day.  Some other incidents showed me that I no longer
belonged to myself.

*        *        *        *        *        *

One day, after morning parade, when the company was breaking off, a Parisian of our section
went up to Marcassin and asked him, "Adjutant, we should like to know if we are going away."

The officer took it in bad part.  "To know?  Always wanting to know!" he cried; "it's a disease
in France, this wanting to know.  Get it well into your heads that you won't know!  We shall
do the knowing for you!  Words are done with.  There's something else beginning, and that's
discipline and silence."

The zeal we had felt for going to the front cooled off in a few days. One or two well-defined
cases of shirking were infectious, and you heard this refrain again and again:  "As long as
the others are dodging, I should be an ass not to do it, too."

But there was quite a multitude who never said anything.

At last a reinforcement draft was posted; old and young promiscuously--a list worked out in
the office amidst a seesaw of intrigue.  Protests were raised, and fell back again into the
tranquillity of the depot.

I abode there forty-five days.  Towards the middle of September, we were allowed to go out
after the evening meal and Sundays as well.  We used to go in the evening to the Town Hall
to read the despatches posted there; they were as uniform and monotonous as rain.  Then a friend
and I would go to the café, keeping step, our arms similarly swinging, exchanging some words,
idle, and vaguely divided into two men.  Or we went into it in a body, which isolated me. 
The saloon of the café enclosed the same odors as Fontan's; and while I stayed there, sunk
in the soft seat, my boots grating on the tiled floor, my eye on the white marble, it was like
a strip of a long dream of the past, a scanty memory that clothed me.  There I used to write
to Marie, and there I read again the letters I received from her, in which she said, "Nothing
has changed since you were away."

One Sunday, when I was beached on a seat in the square and weeping with yawns under the empty
sky, I saw a young woman go by.  By reason of some resemblance in outline, I thought of a woman
who had loved me.  I recalled the period when life was life, and that beautiful caressing body
of once-on-a-time.  It seemed to me that I held her in my arms, so close that I felt her breath,
like velvet, on my face.

We got a glimpse of the captain at one review.  Once there was talk of a new draft for the
front, but it was a false rumor.  Then we said, "There'll never be any war for us," and that
was a relief.

My name flashed to my eyes in a departure list posted on the wall.  My name was read out at
morning parade, and it seemed to me that it was the only one they read.  I had no time to get
ready.  In the evening of the next day our detachment passed out of the barracks by the little
gate.

CHAPTER XI

AT THE WORLD'S END

"We're going to Alsace," said the well-informed.  "To the Somme," said the better-informed, louder.

We traveled thirty-six hours on the floor of a cattle truck, wedged and paralyzed in the vice
of knapsacks, pouches, weapons and moist bodies. At long intervals the train would begin to
move on again.  It has left an impression with me that it was chiefly motionless.

We got out, one afternoon, under a sky crowded with masses of darkness, in a station recently
bombarded and smashed, and its roof left like a fish-bone.  It overlooked a half-destroyed
town, where, amid a foul whiteness of ruin, a few families were making shift to live in the rain.

"'Pears we're in the Aisne country," they said.

A downpour was in progress.  Shivering, we busied ourselves with unloading and distributing
bread, our hands numbed and wet, and then ate it hurriedly while we stood in the road, which
gleamed with heavy parallel brush-strokes of gray paint as far as the eye could see.  Each
looked after himself, with hardly a thought for the next man.  On each side of the road were
deserts without limits, flat and flabby, with trees like posts, and rusty fields patched with
green mud.

"Shoulder packs, and forward!" Adjutant Marcassin ordered.

Where were we going?  No one knew.  We crossed the rest of the village. The Germans had occupied
it during the August retreat.  It was destroyed, and the destruction was beginning to live,
to cover itself with fresh wreckage and dung, to smoke and consume itself.  The rain had ceased
in melancholy.  Up aloft in the clearings of the sky, clusters of shrapnel stippled the air
round aeroplanes, and the detonations reached us, far and fine.  Along the sodden road we met
Red Cross motor ambulances, rushing on rails of mud, but we could not see inside them.  In
the first stages we were interested in everything, and asked questions, like foreigners.  A
man who had been wounded and was rejoining the regiment with us answered us from time to time,
and invariably added, "That's nothing; you'll see in a bit."  Then the march made men retire
into themselves.

My knapsack, so ingeniously compact; my cartridge-bags so ferociously full; my round pouches
with their keen-edged straps, all jostled and then wounded my back at each step.  The pain
quickly became acute, unbearable.  I was suffocated and blinded by a mask of sweat, in spite
of the lashing moisture, and I soon felt that I should not arrive at the end of the fifty minutes'
march.  But I did all the same, because I had no reason for stopping at any one second sooner
than another, and because I could thus always do one step more.  I knew later that this is
nearly always the mechanical reason which accounts for soldiers completing superhuman physical
efforts to the very end.

The cold blast benumbed us, while we dragged ourselves through the softened plains which evening
was darkening.  At one halt I saw one of those men who used to agitate at the depot to be sent
to the front.  He had sunk down at the foot of the stacked rifles; exertion had made him almost
unrecognizable, and he told me that he had had enough of war! And little Mélusson, whom I once
used to see at Viviers, lifted to me his yellowish face, sweat-soaked, where the folds of the
eyelids seemed drawn with red crayon, and informed me that he should report sick the next day.

After four marches of despairing length under a lightless sky over a colorless earth, we stood
for two hours, hot and damp, at the chilly top of a hill, where a village was beginning.  An
epidemic of gloom overspread us.  Why were we stopped in that way?  No one knew anything.

In the evening we engulfed ourselves in the village.  But they halted us in a street.  The
sky had heavily darkened.  The fronts of the houses had taken on a greenish hue and reflected
and rooted themselves in the running water of the street.  The market-place curved around in
front of us--a black space with shining tracks, like an old mirror to which the silvering only
clings in strips.

At last, night fully come, they bade us march.  They made us go forward and then draw back,
with loud words of command, in the tunnels of streets, in alleys and yards.  By lantern light
they divided us into squads.  I was assigned to the eleventh, quartered in a village whose
still standing parts appeared quite new.  Adjutant Marcassin became my section chief.  I was
secretly glad of this; for in the gloomy confusion we stuck closely to those we knew, as dogs do.

The new comrades of the squad--they lodged in the stable, which was open as a cage--explained
to me that we were a long way from the front, over six miles; that we should have four days'
rest and then go on yonder to occupy the trenches at the glass works.  They said it would be
like that, in shifts of four days, to the end of the war, and that, moreover, one had not to worry.

These words comforted the newcomers, adrift here and there in the straw.  Their weariness was
alleviated.  They set about writing and card-playing.  That evening I dated my letter to Marie
"at the Front," with a flourish of pride.  I understood that glory consists in doing what others
have done, in being able to say, "I, too."

*        *        *        *        *        *

Three days went by in this "rest camp."  I got used to an existence crowded with exercises
in which we were living gear-wheels; crowded also with fatigues; already I was forgetting my
previous existence.

On the Friday at three o'clock we were paraded in marching order in the school yard.  Great
stones, detached from walls and arches, lay about the forsaken grass like tombs.  Hustled by
the wind, we were reviewed by the captain, who fumbled in our cartridge-pouches and knapsacks
with the intention of giving imprisonment to those who had not the right quantity of cartridges
and iron rations.  In the evening we set off, laughing and singing, along the great curves
of the road.  At night we arrived swaying with fatigue and savagely silent, at a slippery and
interminable ascent which stood out against stormy rain-clouds as heavy as dung-hills.  Many
dark masses stumbled and fell with a crash of accoutrements on that huge sloping sewer.  As
they swarmed up the chaos of oblique darkness which pushed them back, the men gave signs of
exhaustion and anger.  Cries of "Forward!  Forward!" surrounded us on all sides, harsh cries
like barks, and I heard, near me, Adjutant Marcassin's voice, growling, "What about it, then?
It's for France's sake!"  Arrived at the top of the hill, we went down the other slope. The
order came to put pipes out and advance in silence.  A world of noises was coming to life in
the distance.

A gateway made its sudden appearance in the night.  We scattered among flat buildings, whose
walls here and there showed black holes, like ovens, while the approaches were obstructed with
plaster rubbish and nail-studded beams.  In places the recent collapse of stones, cement and
plaster had laid on the bricks a new and vivid whiteness that was visible in the dark.

"It's the glass works," said a soldier to me.

We halted a moment in a passage whose walls and windows were broken, where we could not make
a step or sit down without breaking glass.  We left the works by sticky footpaths, full of
rubbish at first, and then of mud.  Across marshy flats, chilly and sinister, obscurely lighted
by the night, we came to the edge of an immense and pallid crater.  The depths of this abyss
were populated with glimmers and murmurs; and all around a soaked and ink-black expanse of
country glistened to infinity.

"It's the quarry," they informed me.

Our endless and bottomless march continued.  Sliding and slipping we descended, burying ourselves
in these profundities and gropingly encountering the hurly-burly of a convoy of carts and the
advance guard of the regiment we were relieving.  We passed heaped-up hutments at the foot
of the circular chalky cliff that we could see dimly drawn among the black circles of space.
The sound of shots drew near and multiplied on all sides; the vibration of artillery fire outspread
under our feet and over our heads.

I found myself suddenly in front of a narrow and muddy ravine into which the others were plunging
one by one.

"It's the trench," whispered the man who was following me; "you can see its beginning, but
you never see its blinking end.  Anyway, on you go!"

We followed the trench along for three hours.  For three hours we continued to immerse ourselves
in distance and solitude, to immure ourselves in night, scraping its walls with our loads,
and sometimes violently pulled up, where the defile shrunk into strangulation by the sudden
wedging of our pouches.  It seemed as if the earth tried continually to clasp and choke us,
that sometimes it roughly struck us. Above the unknown plains in which we were hiding, space
was shot-riddled.  A few star-shells were softly whitening some sections of the night, revealing
the excavations' wet entrails and conjuring up a file of heavy shadows, borne down by lofty
burdens, tramping in a black and black-bunged impasse, and jolting against the eddies.  When
great guns were discharged all the vault of heaven was lighted and lifted and then fell darkly
back.

"Look out!  The open crossing!"

A wall of earth rose in tiers before us.  There was no outlet.  The trench came to a sudden
end--to be resumed farther on, it seemed.

"Why?" I asked, mechanically.

They explained to me:  "It's like that."  And they added, "You stoop down and get a move on."

The men climbed the soft steps with bent heads, made their rush one by one and ran hard into
the belt whose only remaining defense was the dark.  The thunder of shrapnel that shattered
and dazzled the air here and there showed me too frightfully how fragile we all were.  In spite
of the fatigue clinging to my limbs, I sprang forward in my turn with all my strength, fiercely
pursuing the signs of an overloaded and rattling body which ran in front; and I found myself
again in a trench, breathless.  In my passage I had glimpses of a somber field, bullet-smacked
and hole pierced, with silent blots outspread or doubled, and a litter of crosses and posts,
as black and fantastic as tall torches extinguished, all under a firmament where day and night
immensely fought.

"I believe I saw some corpses," I said to him who marched in front of me; and there was a break
in my voice.

"You've just left your village," he replied; "you bet there's some stiffs about here!"

I laughed also, in the delight of having got past.  We began again to march one behind another,
swaying about, hustled by the narrowness of this furrow they had scooped to the ancient depth
of a grave, panting under the load, dragged towards the earth by the earth and pushed forward
by will-power, under a sky shrilling with the dizzy flight of bullets, tiger-striped with red,
and in some seconds saturated with light.  At forks in the way we turned sometimes right and
sometimes left, all touching each other, the whole huge body of the company fleeing blindly
towards its bourne.

For the last time they halted us in the middle of the night.  I was so weary that I propped
my knees against the wet wall and remained kneeling for some blissful minutes.

My sentry turn began immediately, and the lieutenant posted me at a loophole.  He made me put
my face to the hole and explained to me that there was a wooded slope, right in front of us,
of which the bottom was occupied by the enemy; and to the right of us, three hundred yards
away, the Chauny road--"They're there."  I had to watch the black hollow of the little wood,
and at every star-shell the creamy expanse which divided our refuge from the distant hazy railing
of the trees along the road.  He told me what to do in case of alarm and left me quite alone.

Alone, I shivered.  Fatigue had emptied my head and was weighing on my heart.  Going close
to the loophole, I opened my eyes wide through the enemy night, the fathomless, thinking night.

I thought I could see some of the dim shadows of the plain moving, and some in the chasm of
the wood, and everywhere!  Affected by terror and a sense of my huge responsibility, I could
hardly stifle a cry of anguish.  But they did not move.  The fearful preparations of the shades
vanished before my eyes and the stillness of lifeless things showed itself to me.

I had neither knapsack nor pouches, and I wrapped myself in my blanket. I remained at ease,
encircled to the horizon by the machinery of war, surmounted by claps of living thunder.  Very
gently, my vigil relieved and calmed me.  I remembered nothing more about myself.  I applied
myself to watching.  I saw nothing, I knew nothing.

After two hours, the sound of the natural and complaisant steps of the sentry who came to relieve
me brought me completely back to myself.  I detached myself from the spot where I had seemed
riveted and went to sleep in the "grotto."

The dug-out was very roomy, but so low that in one place one had to crawl on hands and knees
to slip under its rough and mighty roof.  It was full of heavy damp, and hot with men.  Extended
in my place on straw-dust, my neck propped by my knapsack, I closed my eyes in comfort.  When
I opened them, I saw a group of soldiers seated in a circle and eating from the same dish,
their heads blotted out in the darkness of the low roof.  Their feet, grouped round the dish,
were shapeless, black, and trickling, like stone disinterred.  They ate in common, without
table things, no man using more than his hands.

The man next me was equipping himself to go on sentry duty.  He was in no hurry.  He filled
his pipe, drew from his pocket a tinder-lighter as long as a tapeworm, and said to me, "You're
not going on again till six o'clock.  Ah, you're very lucky!"

Diligently he mingled his heavy tobacco-clouds with the vapors from all those bodies which
lay around us and rattled in their throats. Kneeling at my feet to arrange his things, he gave
me some advice, "No need to get a hump, mind.  Nothing ever happens here.  Getting here's by
far the worst.  On that job you get it hot, specially when you've the bad luck to be sleepy,
or it's not raining, but after that you're a workman, and you forget about it.  The most worst,
it's the open crossing.  But nobody I know's ever stopped one there.  It was other blokes.
It's been like this for two months, old man, and we'll be able to say we've been through the
war without a chilblain, we shall."

At dawn I resumed my lookout at the loophole.  Quite near, on the slope of the little wood,
the bushes and the bare branches are broidered with drops of water.  In front, under the fatal
space where the eternal passage of projectiles is as undistinguishable as light in daytime,
the field resembles a field, the road resembles a road.  Ultimately one makes out some corpses,
but what a strangely little thing is a corpse in a field--a tuft of colorless flowers which
the shortest blades of grass disguise!  At one moment there was a ray of sunshine, and it resembled
the past.

Thus went the days by, the weeks and the months; four days in the front line, the harassing
journey to and from it, the monotonous sentry-go, the spy-hole on the plain, the mesmerism
of the empty outlook and of the deserts of waiting; and after that, four days of rest-camp
full of marches and parades and great cleansings of implements and of streets, with regulations
of the strictest, anticipating all the different occasions for punishment, a thousand fatigues,
each with as many harsh knocks, the litany of optimist phrases, abstruse and utopian, in the
orders of the day, and a captain who chiefly concerned himself with the two hundred cartridges
and the reserve rations.  The regiment had no losses, or almost none; a few wounds during reliefs,
and sometimes one or two deaths which were announced like accidents.  We only underwent great
weariness, which goes away as fast as it comes.  The soldiers used to say that on the whole
they lived in peace.

Marie would write to me, "The Piots have been saying nice things about you," or "The Trompsons'
son is a second lieutenant," or "If you knew all the contrivances people have been up to, to
hide their gold since it's been asked for so loudly!  If you knew what ugly tales there are!"
or "Everything is just the same."

Once, when we were coming back from the lines and were entering our usual village, we did not
stop there; to the great distress of the men who were worn out and yielding to the force of
the knapsack.  We continued along the road through the evening with lowered heads; and one
hour later we dropped off around dark buildings--mournful tokens of an unknown place--and they
put us away among shadows which had new shapes.  From that time onwards, they changed the village
at every relief, and we never knew what it was until we were there.  I was lodged in barns,
into which one wriggled by a ladder; in spongy and steamy stables; in cellars where undisturbed
draughts stirred up the moldy smells that hung there; in frail and broken hangars which seemed
to brew bad weather; in sick and wounded huts; in villages remade athwart their phantoms; in
trenches and in caves--a world upside down. We received the wind and the rain in our sleep.
Sometimes we were too brutally rescued from the pressure of the cold by braziers, whose poisonous
heat split one's head.  And we forgot it all at each change of scene.  I had begun to note
the names of places we were going to, but I lost myself in the black swarm of words when I
tried to recall them.  And the diversity and the crowds of the men around me were such that
I managed only with difficulty to attach fleeting names to their faces.

My companions did not look unfavorably on me, but I was no more than another to them.  In intervals
among the occupations of the rest-camp, I wandered spiritless, blotted out by the common soldiers'
miserable uniform, familiarly addressed by any one and every one, and stopping no glance from
a woman, by reason of the non-coms.

I should never be an officer, like the Trompsons' son.  It was not so easy in my sector as
in his.  For that, it would be necessary for things to happen which never would happen.  But
I should have liked to be taken into the office.  Others were there who were not so clearly
indicated as I for that work.  I regarded myself as a victim of injustice.

*        *        *        *        *        *

One morning I found myself face to face with Termite, Brisbille's crony and accomplice, and
he arrived in our company by voluntary enlistment! He was as skimpy and warped as ever, his
body seeming to grimace through his uniform.  His new greatcoat looked worn out and his boots
on the wrong feet.  He had the same ugly, blinking face and black-furred cheeks and rasping
voice.  I welcomed him warmly, for by his enlistment he was redeeming his past life.  He took
advantage of the occasion to address me with intimacy.  I talked with him about Viviers and
even let him share the news that Marie had just written to me--that Monsieur Joseph Bonéas
was taking an examination in order to become an officer in the police.

But the poacher had not completely sloughed his old self.  He looked at me sideways and shook
in the air his grimy wrist and the brass identity disk that hung from it--a disk as big as
a forest ranger's, perhaps a trophy of bygone days.  Hatred of the rich and titled appeared
again upon his hairy, sly face.  "Those blasted nationalists," he growled; "they spend their
time shoving the idea of revenge into folks' heads, and patching up hatred with their Leagues
of Patriots and their military tattoos and their twaddle and their newspapers, and when their
war does come they say 'Go and fight.'"

"There are some of them who have died in the first line.  Those have done more than their duty."

With the revolutionary's unfairness, the little man would not admit it. "No--they have only
done their duty,--no more."

I was going to urge Monsieur Joseph's weak constitution but in presence of that puny man with
his thin, furry face, who might have stayed at home, I forebore.  But I decided to avoid, in
his company, those subjects in which I felt he was full of sour hostility and always ready to bite.

Continually we saw Marcassin's eye fixed on us, though aloof.  His new bestriped personality
had completely covered up the comical picture of Pétrolus.  He even seemed to have become suddenly
more educated, and made no mistakes when he spoke.  He multiplied himself, was attentiveness
itself and found ways to expose himself to danger.  When there were night patrols in the great
naked cemeteries bounded by the graves of the living, he was always in them.

But he scowled.  We were short of the sacred fire, in his opinion, and that distressed him.
To grumbles against the fatigues which shatter, the waiting which exhausts, the disillusion
which destroys, against misery and the blows of cold and rain, he answered violently, "Can't
you see it's for France?  Why, hell and damnation!  As long as it's for France----!"

One morning when we were returning from the trenches, ghastly in a ghastly dawn, during the
last minutes of a stage, a panting soldier let the words escape him, "I'm fed up, I am!"

The adjutant sprang towards him, "Aren't you ashamed of yourself, hog? Don't you think that
France is worth your dirty skin and all our skins?"

The other, strained and tortured in his joints, showed fight.  "France, you say?  Well, that's
the French," he growled.

And his pal, goaded also by weariness, raised his voice from the ranks. "That's right!  After
all, it's the men that's there."

"Great God!" the adjutant roared in their faces, "France is France and nothing else, and you
don't count, nor you either!"

But the soldier, all the while hoisting up his knapsack with jerks of his hips, and lowering
his voice before the non-com's aggressive excitement, clung to his notion, and murmured between
his puffings, "Men--they're humanity.  That's not the truth perhaps?"

Marcassin began to hurry through the drizzle along the side of the marching column, shouting
and trembling with emotion, "To hell with your humanity, and your truth, too; I don't give
a damn for them.  I know your ideas--universal justice and 1789[1]--to hell with them, too.
There's only one thing that matters in all the earth, and that's the glory of France--to give
the Boches a thrashing and get Alsace-Lorraine back, and money, that's where they're taking
you, and that's all about it.  Once that's done, all's over.  It's simple enough, even for
a blockhead like you.  If you don't understand it, it's because you can't lift your pig's head
to see an ideal, or because you're only a Socialist and a confiscator!"

[Footnote 1: Outbreak of the French Revolution.--Tr.]

Very reluctantly, rumbling all over, and his eye threatening, he went away from the now silent
ranks.  A moment later, as he passed near me, I noticed that his hands still trembled and I
was infinitely moved to see tears in his eyes!

He comes and goes in pugnacious surveillance, in furies with difficulty restrained, and masked
by a contraction of the face.  He invokes Déroulède, and says that faith comes at will, like
the rest.  He lives in perpetual bewilderment and distress that everybody does not think as
he does.  He exerts real influence, for there are, in the multitudes, whatever they may say,
beautiful and profound instincts always near the surface.

The captain, who was a well-balanced man, although severe and prodigal of prison when he found
the least gap in our loads, considered the adjutant animated by an excellent spirit, but he
himself was not so fiery.  I was getting a better opinion of him; he could judge men.  He had
said that I was a good and conscientious soldier, that many like me were wanted.

Our lieutenant, who was very young, seemed to be an amiable, good-natured fellow.  "He's a
good little lad," said the grateful men; "there's some that frighten you when you speak to
them, and they solder their jaws up.  But him, he speaks to you even if you're stupid. When
you talk to him about you and your family, which isn't, all the same, very interesting, well,
he listens to you, old man."

St. Martin's summer greatly warmed us as we tramped into a new village. I remember that one
of those days I took Margat with me and went with him into a recently shelled house.  (Margat
was storming against the local grocer, the only one of his kind, the inevitable and implacable
robber of his customers.)  The framework of the house was laid bare, it was full of light and
plaster, and it trembled like a steamboat.  We climbed to the drawing-room of this house which
had breathed forth all its mystery and was worse than empty.  The room still showed remains
of luxury and elegance--a disemboweled piano with clusters of protruding strings; a cupboard,
dislodged and rotting, as though disinterred; a white-powdered floor, sown with golden stripes
and rumpled books, and with fragile débris which cried out when we trod on it.  Across the
window, which was framed in broken glass, a curtain hung by one corner and fluttered like a
bat.  Over the sundered fireplace, only a mirror was intact and unsullied, upright in its frame.

Then, become suddenly and profoundly like each other, we were both fascinated by the virginity
of that long glass.  Its perfect integrity lent it something like a body.  Each of us picked
up a brick and we broke it with all our might, not knowing why.  We ran away down the shaking
spiral stairs whose steps were hidden under deep rubbish.  At the bottom we looked at each
other, still excited and already ashamed of the fit of barbarism which had so suddenly risen
in us and urged our arms.

"What about it?  It's a natural thing to do--we're becoming men again, that's all," said Margat.

Having nothing to do we sat down there, commanding a view of the dale. The day had been fine.

Margat's looks strayed here and there.  He frowned, and disparaged the village because it was
not like his own.  What a comical idea to have built it like that!  He did not like the church,
the singular shape of it, the steeple in that position instead of where it should have been.

Orango and Rémus came and sat down by us in the ripening sun of evening.

Far away we saw the explosion of a shell, like a white shrub.  We chuckled at the harmless
shot in the hazy distance and Rémus made a just observation.  "As long as it's not dropped
here, you might say as one doesn't mind, eh, s'long as it's dropped somewhere else, eh?"

At that moment a cloud of dirty smoke took shape five hundred yards away at the foot of the
village, and a heavy detonation rolled up to where we were.

"They're plugging the bottom of the village," Orango laconically certified.

Margat, still ruminating his grievance, cried, "'Fraid it's not on the grocers it's dropped,
that crump, seeing he lives right at the other end.  More's the pity.  He charges any old price
he likes and then he says to you as well, 'If you're not satisfied, my lad, you can go to hell.'
Ah, more's the pity!"

He sighed, and resumed.  "Ah, grocers, they beat all, they do.  You can starve or you can bankrupt,
that's their gospel; 'You don't matter to me, I've got to make money!'"

"What do you want to be pasting the grocers for," Orango asked, "as long as they've always
been like that?  They're Messrs. Thief & Sons."

After a silence, Rémus coughed, to encourage his voice, and said, "I'm a grocer."

Then Margat said to him artlessly, "Well, what about it, old chap?  We know well enough, don't
we, that here on earth profit's the strongest of all."

"Why, yes, to be sure, old man," Rémus replied.

*        *        *        *        *        *

One day, while we were carrying our straw to our billets, one of my lowly companions came up
and questioned me as he walked.  "I'd like you to explain to me why there isn't any justice.
I've been to the captain to ask for leave that I'd a right to and I shows him a letter to say
my aunt's shortly deceased.  'That's all my eye and Betty Martin,' he says.  And I says to
myself, that's the blinking limit, that is.  Now, then, tell me, you.  When the war began,
why didn't there begin full justice for every one, seeing they could have done it and seeing
no one wouldn't have raised no objection just then.  Why is it all just the contrary?  And
don't believe it's only what's happened to me, but there's big business men, they say, all
of a sudden making a hundred francs a day extra because of the murdering, and them young men
an' all, and a lot of toffed-up shirkers at the rear that's ten times stronger than this pack
of half-dead Territorials that they haven't sent home even this morning yet, and they have
beanos in the towns with their Totties and their jewels and champagne, like what Jusserand
tells us!"

I replied that complete justice was impossible, that we had to look at the great mass of things
generally. 

The Fourier wiped the brown nectar, saw the strike as fun of gay friends and also had no time to Zornigwerden,
for the hour of a military tattoo was there.

In agony he runs around the speed or to a second, third and fourth Bosom friend will receive
nothing and threes, from the fourth to the good advice, thereby accelerating the to make socks,
because the three supposed friends to whom he had discovered himself,
probably in this moment already betrayed him.

He no longer knows what he is doing and hurried to the barracks instead of out of the gate. It
was a beautiful, moonlight, lukewarm summer night, which attracted many poetic and prosaic
souls into the open had, and sadly, is also the captain of the company,
which the dissolute as Cloth "known Fourier belongs.

The captain sees and recognizes the subordinate, the rush He seems suspicious of it, he stops and arrested
him.

But a lover of romance can be far from me anything you nothing on his heroic career inhibit, thus the Fourier
runs from leather, and only a lucky stroke of the equally courageous
than this time behaved and badly placed in armor officer takes him
to flee, but others People talk a little word, and an hour later,
our hero is sitting crooked closed in the "dark cell for non-commissioned
officers "and muses about fate full pieces to world-weariness.

Now he sits for a nice time in the penitentiary and looks light and
enlightenment in the same to spread, is a well-read man and for that
reason a rival of his table companions, the many well-read hypocrite,
the way he disgusts in the innermost soul.

The hypocrite is in its darkest hours but was still ten times more value than the basic dissolute
Exfourier during sleep and while the applause of the officials, warden
and strives for better mates, this will make all the same and yet
all over Supercharging.

The ambition confused states or jail, the man should be with his passions everywhere the same,
if not the miraculous consecration of religion are being gradually upgraded.

From such a refinement of Exfourier white with his comrades little, for all Children of the 19 Century,
all have lost faith youth and a long sinful life, often associated
with poor religious instruction their minds has gone wild and wrong.

"The soup is dearer to me than the sermon, which is now the pastor dish again!" someone says after
this:

"Silence, silence!"

the overseer of the flow of speech Exfouriers has stopped for a while.

"In the hospital room's boring is shameful, the few old Schunke, who drive around up there, I have
already read last summer, even now, all hell breaks loose again,
one can therefore not even sneak up a piece of black bread and the
doctor brings his A Diet food and quarters almost to starvation.

But I would be happy if I return some Days could be up there for the sake of variety and to
stay out of the unfortunate Church can, "murmurs the Exfourier.

"Sick stick? Hey, hey, hey!

... Good food, rest, no rudeness, hey, hey, hey!

... I know how doctors in the penitentiary barbirt on the spoon,
hey, hey, hey!

"smiles the Cross-Eyed Kilian and looks meaningfully with one eye
on the room ceiling, and the other out the window!

"Say it, we do not betray you! ... The Kilian has long been sitting
in France, he knows Everything!

... The Kilian comes to the medical board if he wishes. "

Kilian, tell me a way! " begs the Exfourier.

"What I get, hey, hey, hey?"

"Five Päcklein Schick is when probat!" says the hypocrite.

"Ten Päcklein!" offers Exfourier.

"Ten Päcklein and five portions of meat!" increases the monkey's face.

"Ten Päcklein Schick and ten servings of meat, who has?" decides Kilian.

"I, it is, very best!" - Has the Exfourier it goes beyond the Kilian
and returns after a Minute with the air of a man back to experience
the joy-bringing a mystery.

"The Kilian is a cunning Frenchman, he has smeared me and another stupid Drew ripped, but I
love the joke and this is so stupid that I like to have ten servings of meat Sacrifice, "assured
the Exfourier around the dinner party.

This insurance is stipulated by Kilian lie. He gave an effective Exfourier Resources in order
to produce at will and tumors unrecognizable face in a few hours
to make.

Sitting at the table no traitor, this know-contractors, but they do benefit Secrets from the draw to avoid
any suspicion and for that reason, the Exfourier also "in Honorary
swear "must make in the next four weeks did not use the thing.

"Prayer!" cries the overseer.

The guards put away their bowl pyramids, all the prisoners rise up
and fall silent the sugar Hannah prays for a second Lord's Prayer,
it is livelier and louder than ever, 10 Supervisors would not 60-70
Esser this room can completely keep in check.

"What has made the other side, the foot with the hare and the red nose, eh? shouts the Sugar
Hannah over to another table.

"An old woman robbed and then hung by the hearth! ... No, a closet
the brain taken!

... A dissolute magistrate's neck broken! "Some call across.

The Rothnasige with the hare Maule has heard all the laughter annoys him, he comes to Sugar
Hannah says, shaking with anger:

"Vefluchter goiter-term, limping scoundrel, what is that to you, what
was I doing?

I am not such a bad guy like you, if you do not leave me, I will the way the management Find! "

"Here all are equal, there is no difference!" noticed the Exfourier.

"Listen, you, rabbits Gosche, traveling on the murderers, if you take show something, then
before you I care! ... I ask the devil to the administrator, chair and forced black hole and at
the table where I sit, there must be freedom. The sugar sits Hannes but here! "

"A bad guy you are, you see it in yourself and what you have done, is One!" Hannah says the sugar,
who has recovered from the initial shock.

"The devil has finished commodities with the wildest, longest-Witch
in the May night the rabbits foot!" laughs the Exfourier.

"Offended and you torture it yourself, you fools!" reminiscent of
the hypocrites.

"You are all thieves, as you sitting there, but I have come here innocent,
God knows and it will find my accusers, witnesses and judges.

"

"I'll get you or you pick a square!" threatens the incendiaries.

"Bst, the supervisor is coming!"

True, he comes, the inexperienced, poor rabbit foot turns to him and
told him everything, the supervisor promised to report everything.

He will do it, all are in the sugar Hannes and persuade the murderers, then all these are
flatly denied and still be punished But the rabbit foot is all bitterly regret and make amends
thoroughly on this point .--

Again the bell calling to work, the march begins, the dining rooms
empty rapidly and after a few minutes of each is back at work.

The sugar Hannes planed briskly towards it, he's in the penitentiary not more this year hare
and knows his time einzutheilen so that it always comfortable with
his daily work is done, without to hurry or to be particularly severe,
yet he has very little to the morning portion verfertiget.

One of the most difficult tasks of Gefängnißbeamten, maintaining a profitable business entities;
Division of labor and training of workers in this institution is resolved as well, as the many
difficulties of exterior and interior, allowing the top and bottom do.

The sugar Hannes could learn a trade, but he did not like and underwent the hard work of the stave
joining, which little skill, but enough Armschmalz requires, he would be able to deliver a double
day's work and to increase his pay, but he did so only in the beginning and works for a long time just
what he must, because, first has the state is not the Fesenmichel, but punished him and no
power on earth would be able to to convince him of the justice of his punishment, so he wants such
an unjust The state also benefit as little as possible. Second, the prisoners are without double
day's work Snuff, this powerful and moving a Sträflingsgemüthes butter exchanged our hero and
for some portion of meat.

He does so slowly, looks from time to time in the oven and sometimes chats with his neighbor and
former mortal enemies, the Bläsi who serves as foreman of the moss farmers it so much grief prepared.

Bläsi
is because of unintentional killing during a brawl at a dance floor to a lot of years Penitentiary
sentenced, the sentence has shaken his pride terribly, but not broken, but turned against God and
the world, laws and people.

He keeps his sentence only for an undeserved misfortune is, too proud
to God to raise or to the thieves to come down, people's opinions
he has always been considered supreme law, now he has fallen deeply
in this opinion and therein lies the woe which ransacked his innermost
stable.

The sugar has the teachings of the Sephardim Hannes, criminals are heroes and martyrs of humanity
the great future, never forget the life among convicts, and the daily listening their stories
made him numb to crime and taken for fellow sufferers.

Good-natured, he has come to meet the Bläsi, has forgotten all the trials and tribulations,
is unable to to calculate influence which this man to his fate and has exercised the same Incident
with the rabbit foot during the morning meal says.

Bläsi is barely a quarter in the hospital, with heart and mouth are
the rabbit foot Right, so far wanted to maintain this honor, but that
he does not display the same beautiful.

"He gets his reward!" Hannah says the sugar.

"However, here one to another can exacerbate the bad life and entleiden without guards learn
and officials it right or are able to prevent. But much hard and can still not easy to inflict
one to another without being punished for it! "philosophized the newcomer.

"Ho, if someone beats the others bent and paralyzed or even dead stands, helping the wounded dead
or the punishment of the perpetrator? Certainly not much! ... Moreover, the evidence of serious
Thing and if several together against one, he is lost, of which I know a Example to tell. I was
not yet ten nights in the dorms, I saw one of the Lamp, which burns the whole night inside, at
once extinguished, two or three other from their straw mattresses jumped at once, and a sleeper,
so little when I and others thought of something evil, had quickly
pulled the rug on the bed head.

Then they hammered going on with all his strength with the heavy shoes on the head and body of tackled
the same cried like a falling ox and the whole hall was restless, because they feared a mortal
blow. The guards made noise, the guards brought jumped, but because the lamp was extinguished,
they recognized no doer and before the many bars and the lock opened heavy and light the hall
was, all were defeated, with the exception of the so calm and beautiful, as if they do not Brook
had tarnished! ... The poor fellow groaned, moaned, was full of spots and bumps, knew the perpetrator,
but he kept his mouth and called her and not know why?

Straight because he was a spy, he had been given a good lesson! ... There was an investigation
but everything was denied and no one could be punished properly ... For my Thue the rabbit foot nothing,
I should also get his account into the black hole, but the Table-mates it will then take a
bead, firstly because he is wrong, because I so did not offend, and particularly the Baaremer
can see no injustice, and secondly Rules must be among the convicts,
an indicator spoils all the game.

I do not live up there with the men, but down here among the prisoners, and judge me but ten
times more after this than after those! "

"The sugar Hannes is right," says the hypocrite, the passing of his Leimpfanne stopped for a while,
"yes he is right, because the masters and overseers, few prevent and straightforwardly with
only grope along behind penalties and punishment is not, because
if they get one by the hair, it really did not deserve, it makes this
and another bad blood!

"

"Yes, and if they punish the guilty and another not guilty because
they did not can prove to you, it makes bad blood.

They may be and do, how and what they do they just get enemies and blasphemers. They're paid
to look after us and to torture, which they forget the most stupid
guy is not easy and the misery is full, because the Prisoners are
often hurt each other in all ways, steal, abuse and follow!

" says Bartel, a quiet, good-natured giant.

"To work!" shouted the foreman.

"Up!" whispers of Bläsi, finds the door, and the sugar Hannes follows him, the conversation continues.

"Look,
last night was the monkey face the bed rug cut into small pieces

... That comes out hard. Last Sunday was one of the Exfourier arc-length letter to his Brown

The Exfourier as not that clever, and came to arrest the Kaiserstuhl claimed that he had spoiled
the letter by mistake and could not help it and nothing happened to him, although he has done
it deliberately, "says one.

"Yes and I have a beautiful book to read had that Elias did not have the Hotzenwald, I read that,

I be punished at the end yet, "laments of Bartel.

"Do you know which account the Dormouse growled like a bear last night? Added at bedtime One of

"The Dormouse is a fool! The old ass has no concerns about the Grand Duke, which he not yet known

a dog and would rather be crucified before he became a Word against the manager spoke, "grumbles
the Bläsi.
"We want to back down, you do not know whether he is an officer and

"Especially Wherefore I will stay and put me right under the door

"Do
something new, Jack?" hisses the one-eyed Stoffel, who as Hausschänzer

the planer sugars Hannes.

"Well, well, a cow has become flying? Am
doing a very idealized face!" says the sugar Hannes neugirrig.

"The

"

Hans goes to the heart, a sharp pang, for he is the pardon cut
off recently been and happiness of both makes him sad, but it accumulates
rapidly:

"The grudge Jost ego, he's been around long enough here,
and has wife and children, but the Daniel so little deserved a pardon,
as the Dormouse. I am truly innocent than he had, almost made my half

"What's that

The warden, and returns by hertreibt

monkey face and cuts a mope mean that even the saddest most prisoners
still have to hold his stomach with laughter, the supervisor together
with Foreman for several minutes produces nothing, and only with the
hand resting in vain requires. What's happened?

The monkey's face
often complains about back woe and weariness, has today reported to
the doctor and this is contrary to expectations, has not spoken to
the hospital room.

"What does it matter whether a convict leaves?
As little as if outside a dozen proletarians, which from the outset

can swallow fine dust, together with the Hechler and others, and come
away bad when the doctor unreasonable demand, weekly to regenerate
the hottest moons for a bath?  Majorat
waxed wroth, and confided his indignation to Termite, who was a good audience, "It's all the
fault of that unlucky captain--we're just slaves!"

He shook his fist as he spoke towards the Town Hall.

But Termite shrugged his shoulders, looked at him unkindly, and said, "Like a rotten egg, that's
how you talk.  That captain, and all the red tabs and brass hats, it's not them that invented
the rules.  They're just gilded machines--machines like you, but not so cheap.  If you want
to do away with discipline, do away with war, my fellow; that's a sight easier than to make
it amusing for the private."

He left Majorat crestfallen, and the others as well.  For my part I admired the peculiar skill
with which the anti-militarist could give answers beside the mark and yet always seem to be
in the right.

During those days they multiplied the route-marches and the exercises intended to let the officers
get the men again in hand.  These maneuvers tired us to death, and especially the sham attacks
on wooded mounds, carried out in the evening among bogs and thorn-thickets.  When we got back,
most of the men fell heavily asleep just as they had fallen, beside their knapsacks, without
having the heart to eat.

Right in the middle of the night and this paralyzed slumber, a cry echoed through the walls,
"Alarm!  Stand to arms!"

We were so weary that the brutal reveille seemed at first, to the blinking and rusted men,
like the shock of a nightmare.  Then, while the cold blew in through the open door and we heard
the sentries running through the streets, while the corporals lighted the candles and shook
us with their voices, we sat up askew, and crouched, and got our things ready, and stood up
and fell in shivering, with flabby legs and minds befogged, in the black-hued street.

After the roll-call and some orders and counter-orders, we heard the command "Forward!" and
we left the rest-camp as exhausted as when we entered it.  And thus we set out, no one knew where.

At first it was the same exodus as always.  It was on the same road that we disappeared: into
the same great circles of blackness that we sank.

We came to the shattered glass works and then to the quarry, which daybreak was washing and
fouling and making its desolation more complete.  Fatigue was gathering darkly within us and
abating our pace. Faces appeared stiff and wan, and as though they were seen through gratings.
We were surrounded by cries of "Forward!" thrown from all directions between the twilight of
the sky and the night of the earth. It took a greater effort every time to tear ourselves away
from the halts.

We were not the only regiment in movement in these latitudes.  The twilight depths were full.
Across the spaces that surrounded the quarry men were passing without ceasing and without limit,
their feet breaking and furrowing the earth like plows.  And one guessed that the shadows also
were full of hosts going as we were to the four corners of the unknown.  Then the clay and
its thousand barren ruts, these corpse-like fields, fell away.  Under the ashen tints of early
day, fog-banks of men descended the slopes.  From the top I saw nearly the whole regiment rolling
into the deeps.  As once of an evening in the days gone by, I had a perception of the multitude's
immensity and the threat of its might, that might which surpasses all and is impelled by invisible
mandates.

We stopped and drew breath again; and on the gloomy edge of this gulf some soldiers even amused
themselves by inciting Termite to speak of militarism and anti-militarism.  I saw faces which
laughed, through their black and woeful pattern of fatigue, around the little man who gesticulated
in impotence.  Then we had to set off again.

We had never passed that way but in the dark, and we did not recognize the scenes now that
we saw them.  From the lane which we descended, holding ourselves back, to gain the trench,
we saw for the first time the desert through which we had so often passed--plains and lagoons
unlimited.

The waterlogged open country, with its dispirited pools and their smoke-like islets of trees,
seemed nothing but a reflection of the leaden, cloud-besmirched sky.  The walls of the trenches,
pallid as ice-floes, marked with their long, sinuous crawling where they had been slowly torn
from the earth by the shovels.  These embossings and canals formed a complicated and incalculable
network, smudged near at hand by bodies and wreckage; dreary and planetary in the distance.
One could make out the formal but hazy stakes and posts, aligned in the distance to the end
of sight; and here and there the swellings and round ink-blots of the dugouts.  In some sections
of trench one could sometimes even descry black lines, like a dark wall between other walls,
and these lines stirred--they were the workmen of destruction. A whole region in the north,
on higher ground, was a forest flown away, leaving only a stranded bristling of masts, like
a quayside.  There was thunder in the sky, but it was drizzling, too, and even the flashes
were gray above that infinite liquefaction in which each regiment was as lost as each man.

We entered the plain and disappeared into the trench.  The "open crossing" was now pierced
by a trench, though it was little more than begun.  Amid the smacks of the bullets which blurred
its edges we had to crawl flat on our bellies, along the sticky bottom of this gully. The close
banks gripped and stopped our packs so that we floundered perforce like swimmers, to go forward
in the earth, under the murder in the air.  For a second the anguish and the effort stopped
my heart and in a nightmare I saw the cadaverous littleness of my grave closing over me.

At the end of this torture we got up again, in spite of the knapsacks. The last star-shells
were sending a bloody aurora borealis into the morning.  Sudden haloes drew our glances and
crests of black smoke went up like cypresses.  On both sides, in front and behind, we heard
the fearful suicide of shells.

*        *        *        *        *        *

We marched in the earth's interior until evening.  From time to time one hoisted the pack up
or pressed down one's cap into the sweat of the forehead; had it fallen it could not have been
picked up again in the mechanism of the march; and then we began again to fight with the distance.
The hand contracted on the rifle-sling was tumefied by the shoulder-straps and the bent arm
was broken.

Like a regular refrain the lamentation of Mélusson came to me.  He kept saying that he was
going to stop, but he did not stop, ever, and he even butted into the back of the man in front
of him when the whistle went for a halt.

The mass of the men said nothing.  And the greatness of this silence, this despotic and oppressive
motion, irritated Adjutant Marcassin, who would have liked to see some animation.  He rated
and lashed us with a vengeance.  He hustled the file in the narrowness of the trench as he
clove to the corners so as to survey his charge.  But then he had no knapsack.

Through the heavy distant noise of our tramping, through the funereal consolation of our drowsiness,
we heard the adjutant's ringing voice, violently reprimanding this or the other.  "Where have
you seen, swine, that there can be patriotism without hatred?  Do you think one can love his
own country if he doesn't hate the others?"

When some one spoke banteringly of militarism--for no one, except Termite, who didn't count,
took the word seriously--Marcassin growled despairingly, "French militarism and Prussian militarism,
they're not the same thing, for one's French and the other's Prussian!"

But we felt that all these wrangles only shocked and wearied him.  He was instantly and gloomily
silent.

We were halted to mount guard in a part we had never seen before, and for that reason it seemed
worse than the others to us at first.  We had to scatter and run up and down the shelterless
trench all night, to avoid the plunging files of shells.  That night was but one great crash
and we were strewn in the middle of it among black puddles, upon a ghostly background of earth.
We moved on again in the morning, bemused, and the color of night.  In front of the column
we still heard the cry "Forward!"  Then we redoubled the violence of our effort, we extorted
some little haste from out us; and the soaked and frozen company went on under cathedrals of
cloud which collapsed in flames, victims of a fate whose name they had no time to seek, a fate
which only let its force be felt, like God.

During the day, and much farther on, they cried "Halt!" and the smothered sound of the march
was silent.  From the trench in which we collapsed under our packs, while another lot went
away, we could see as far as a railway embankment.  The far end of the loophole-pipe enframed
tumbledown dwellings and cabins, ruined gardens where the grass and the flowers were interred,
enclosures masked by palings, fragments of masonry to which eloquent remains of posters even
still clung--a corner full of artificial details, of human things, of illusions.  The railway
bank was near, and in the network of wire stretched between it and us many bodies were fast-caught
as flies.

The elements had gradually dissolved those bodies and time had worn them out.  With their dislocated
gestures and point-like heads they were but lightly hooked to the wire.  For whole hours our
eyes were fixed on this country all obstructed by a machinery of wires and full of men who
were not on the ground.  One, swinging in the wind, stood out more sharply than the others,
pierced like a sieve a hundred times through and through, and a void in the place of his heart.
Another specter, quite near, had doubtless long since disintegrated, while held up by his clothes.
At the time when the shadow of night began to seize us in its greatness a wind arose, a wind
which shook the desiccated creature, and he emptied himself of a mass of mold and dust.  One
saw the sky's whirlwind, dark and disheveled, in the place where the man had been; the soldier
was carried away by the wind and buried in the sky.

Towards the end of the afternoon the piercing whistle of the bullets was redoubled.  We were
riddled and battered by the noise.  The wariness with which we watched the landscape that was
watching us seemed to exasperate Marcassin.  He pondered an idea; then came to a sudden decision
and cried triumphantly, "Look!"

He climbed to the parapet, stood there upright, shook his fist at space with the blind and
simple gesture of the apostle who is offering his example and his heart, and shouted, "Death
to the Boches!"

Then he came down, quivering with the faith of his self-gift.

"Better not do that again," growled the soldiers who were lined up in the trench, gorgonized
by the extraordinary sight of a living man standing, for no reason, on a front line parapet
in broad daylight, stupefied by the rashness they admired although it outstripped them.

"Why not?  Look!"

Marcassin sprang up once more.  Lean and erect, he stood like a poplar, and raising both arms
straight into the air, he yelled, "I believe only in the glory of France!"

Nothing else was left for him; he was but a conviction.  Hardly had he spoken thus in the teeth
of the invisible hurricane when he opened his arms, assumed the shape of a cross against the
sky, spun round, and fell noisily into the middle of the trench and of our cries.

He had rolled onto his belly.  We gathered round him.  With a jerk he turned on to his back,
his arms slackened, and his gaze drowned in his eyes.  His blood began to spread around him,
and we drew our great boots away, that we should not walk on that blood.

"He died like an idiot," said Margat in a choking voice; "but by God it's fine!"

He took off his cap, saluted awkwardly and stood with bowed head.

"Committing suicide for an idea, it's fine," mumbled Vidaine.

"It's fine, it's fine!" other voices said.

And these little words fluttered down like leaves and petals onto the body of the great dead
soldier.

"Where's his cap, that he thought so much of?" groaned his orderly, Aubeau, looking in all
directions.

"Up there, to be sure: I'll fetch it," said Termite.

The comical man went for the relic.  He mounted the parapet in his turn, coolly, but bending
low.  We saw him ferreting about, frail as a poor monkey on the terrible crest.  At last he
put his hand on the cap and jumped into the trench.  A smile sparkled in his eyes and in the
middle of his beard, and his brass "cold meat ticket" jingled on his shaggy wrist.

They took the body away.  The men carried it and a third followed with the cap.  One of us
said, "The war's over for him!"  And during the dead man's recessional we were mustered, and
we continued to draw nearer to the unknown.  But everything seemed to recede as fast as we
advanced, even events.

*        *        *        *        *        *

We wandered five days, six days, in the lines, almost without sleeping. We stood for hours,
for half-nights and half-days, waiting for ways to be clear that we could not see.  Unceasingly
they made us go back on our tracks and begin over again.  We mounted guard in trenches, we
fitted ourselves into some stripped and sinister corner which stood out against a charred twilight
or against fire.  We were condemned to see the same abysses always.

For two nights we bent fiercely to the mending of an old third-line trench above the ruin of
its former mending.  We repaired the long skeleton, soft and black, of its timbers.  From that
dried-up drain we besomed the rubbish of equipment, of petrified weapons, of rotten clothes
and of victuals, of a sort of wreckage of forest and house--filthy, incomparably filthy, infinitely
filthy.  We worked by night and hid by day.  The only light for us was the heavy dawn of evening
when they dragged us from sleep.  Eternal night covered the earth.

After the labor, as soon as daybreak began to replace night with melancholy, we buried ourselves
methodically in the depth of the caverns there.  Only a deadened murmur penetrated to them,
but the rock moved by reason of the earthquakes.  When some one lighted his pipe, by that gleam
we looked at each other.  We were fully equipped; we could start away at any minute; it was
forbidden to take off the heavy jingling chain of cartridges around us.

I heard some one say, "In my country there are fields, and paths, and the sea; nowhere else
in the world is there that."

Among these shades of the cave--an abode of the first men as it seemed--I saw the hand start
forth of him who existed on the spectacle of the fields and the sea, who was trying to show
it and to seize it; or I saw around a vague halo four card-players stubbornly bent upon finding
again something of an ancient and peaceful attachment in the faces of the cards; or I saw Margat
flourish a Socialist paper that had fallen from Termite's pocket, and burst into laughter at
the censored blanks it contained.  And Majorat raged against life, caressed his reserve bottle
with his lips till out of breath and then, appeased and his mouth dripping, said it was the
only way to alleviate his imprisonment.  Then sleep slew words and gestures and thoughts. 
I kept repeating some phrase to myself, trying in vain to understand it; and sleep submerged
me, ancestral sleep so dreary and so deep that it seems there had only and ever been one long,
lone sleep here on earth, above which our few actions float, and which ever returns to fill
the flesh of man with night.

Forward!  Our nights are torn from us in lots.  The bodies, invaded by caressing poison, and
even by confidences and apparitions, shake themselves and stand up again.  We extricate ourselves
from the hole, and emerge from the density of buried breath; stumbling we climb into icy space,
odorless, infinite space.  The oscillation of the march, assailed on both sides by the trench,
brings brief and paltry halts, in which we recline against the walls, or cast ourselves on
them.  We embrace the earth, since nothing else is left us to embrace.

Then Movement seizes us again.  Metrified by regular jolts, by the shock of each step, by our
prisoned breathing, it loses its hold no more, but becomes incarnate in us.  It sets one small
word resounding in our heads, between our teeth--"Forward!"--longer, more infinite than the
uproar of the shells.  It sets us making, towards the east or towards the north, bounds which
are days and nights in length.  It turns us into a chain which rolls along with a sound of
steel--the metallic hammering of rifle, bayonet, cartridges, and of the tin cup which shines
on the dark masses like a bolt.  Wheels, gearing, machinery!  One sees life and the reality
of things striking and consuming and forging each other.

We knew well enough that we were going towards some tragedy that the chiefs knew of; but the
tragedy was above all in the going there.

*        *        *        *        *        *

We changed country.  We left the trenches and climbed out upon the earth--along a great incline
which hid the enemy horizon from us and protected us against him.  The blackening dampness
turned the cold into a thing, and laid frozen shudders on us.  A pestilence surrounded us,
wide and vague; and sometimes lines of pale crosses alongside our march spelled out death in
a more precise way.

It was our tenth night; it was at the end of all our nights, and it seemed greater than they.
The distances groaned, roared and growled, and would sometimes abruptly define the crest of
the incline among the winding sheets of the mists.  The intermittent flutters of light showed
me the soldier who marched in front of me.  My eyes, resting in fixity on him, discovered his
sheepskin coat, his waist-belt, straining at the shoulder-straps, dragged by the metal-packed
cartridge pouches, by the bayonet, by the trench-tool; his round bags, pushed backwards; his
swathed and hooded rifle; his knapsack, packed lengthways so as not to give a handle to the
earth which goes by on either side; the blanket, the quilt, the tentcloth, folded accordion-wise
on the top of each other, and the whole surmounted by the mess-tin, ringing like a mournful
bell, higher than his head.  What a huge, heavy and mighty mass the armed soldier is, near
at hand and when one is looking at nothing else!

Once, in consequence of a command badly given or badly understood, the company wavered, flowed
back and pawed the ground in disorder on the declivity.  Fifty men, who were all alike by reason
of their sheepskins ran here and there and one by one--a vague collection of evasive men, small
and frail, not knowing what to do; while non-coms ran round them, abused and gathered them.
Order began again, and against the whitish and bluish sheets spread by the star-shells I saw
the pendulums of the step once more fall into line under the long body of shadows.

During the night there was a distribution of brandy.  By the light of lanterns we saw the cups
held out, shaking and gleaming.  The libation drew from our entrails a moment of delight and
uplifting.  The liquid's fierce flow awoke deep impulses, restored the martial mien to us,
and made us grasp our rifles with a victorious desire to kill.

But the night was longer than that dream.  Soon, the kind of goddess superposed on our shadows
left our hands and our heads, and that thrill of glory was of no use.

Indeed, its memory filled our hearts with a sort of bitterness.  "You see, there's no trenches
anywhere about here," grumbled the men.

"And why are there no trenches?" said a wrongheaded man; "why, it's because they don't care
a damn for soldiers' lives."

"Fathead!" the corporal interrupted; "what's the good of trenches behind, if there's one in
front, fathead!"

*        *        *        *        *        *

"Halt!"

We saw the Divisional Staff go by in the beam of a searchlight.  In that valley of night it
might have been a procession of princes rising from a subterranean palace.  On cuffs and sleeves
and collars badges wagged and shone, golden aureoles encircled the heads of this group of apparitions.

The flashing made us start and awoke us forcibly, as it did the night.

The men had been pressed back upon the side of the sunken hollow to clear the way; and they
watched, blended with the solidity of the dark. Each great person in his turn pierced the fan
of moted sunshine, and each was lighted up for some paces.  Hidden and abashed, the shadow-soldiers
began to speak in very low voices of those who went by like torches.

They who passed first, guiding the Staff, were the company and battalion officers.  We knew
them.  The quiet comments breathed from the darkness were composed either of praises or curses;
these were good and clear-sighted officers; those were triflers or skulkers.

"That's one that's killed some men!"

"That's one I'd be killed for!"

"The infantry officer who really does all he ought," Pélican declared, "well, he get's killed."

"Or else he's lucky."

"There's black and there's white in the company officers.  At bottom you know, I say they're
men.  It's just a chance you've got whether you tumble on the good or the bad sort.  No good
worrying.  It's just luck."

"More's the pity for us."

The soldier who said that smiled vaguely, lighted by a reflection from the chiefs.  One read
in his face an acquiescence which recalled to me certain beautiful smiles I had caught sight
of in former days on toilers' humble faces.  Those who are around me are saying to themselves,
"Thus it is written," and they think no farther than that, massed all mistily in the darkness,
like vague hordes of negroes.

Then officers went by of whom we did not speak, because we did not know them.  These unknown
tab-bearers made a greater impression than the others; and besides, their importance and their
power were increasing. We saw rows of increasing crowns on the caps.  Then, the shadow-men
were silent.  The eulogy and the censure addressed to those whom one had seen at work had no
hold on these, and all those minor things faded away.  These were admired in the lump.

This superstition made me smile.  But the general of the division himself appeared in almost
sacred isolation.  The tabs and thunderbolts[1] and stripes of his satellites glittered at
a respectful distance only.  Then it seemed to me that I was face to face with Fate itself--the
will of this man.  In his presence a sort of instinct dazzled me.

[Footnote 1: Distinctive badge for Staff officers and others.--Tr.]

"Packs up!  Forward!"

We took back upon our hips and neck the knapsack which had the shape and the weight of a yoke,
which every minute that falls on it weighs down more dourly.  The common march went on again.
It filled a great space; it shook the rocky slopes with its weight.  In vain I bent my head--I
could not hear the sound of my own steps, so blended was it with the others.  And I repeated
obstinately to myself that one had to admire the intelligent force which sets all this deep
mass in movement, which says to us or makes us say, "Forward!" or "It has to be!" or "You will
not know!" which hurls the world we are into a whirlpool so great that we do not even see the
direction of our fall, into profundities we cannot see because they are profound.  We have
need of masters who know all that we do not know.

*        *        *        *        *        *

Our weariness so increased and overflowed that it seemed as if we grew bigger at every step!
And then one no longer thought of fatigue.  We had forgotten it, as we had forgotten the number
of the days and even their names.  Always we made one step more, always.

Ah, the infantry soldiers, the pitiful Wandering Jews who are always marching!  They march
mathematically, in rows of four numbers, or in file in the trenches, four-squared by their
iron load, but separate, separate.  Bent forward they go, almost prostrated, trailing their
legs, kicking the dead.  Slowly, little by little, they are wounded by the length of time,
by the incalculable repetition of movements, by the greatness of things.  They are borne down
by their bones and muscles, by their own human weight.  At halts of only ten minutes, they
sink down.  "There's no time to sleep!"  "No matter," they say, and they go to sleep as happy
people do.

*        *        *        *        *        *

Suddenly we learned that nothing was going to happen!  It was all over for us, and we were
going to return to the rest-camp.  We said it over again to ourselves.  And one evening they
said, "We're returning," although they did not know, as they went on straight before them,
whether they were going forward or backward.

In the plaster-kiln which we are marching past there is a bit of candle, and sunk underneath
its feeble illumination there are four men. Nearer, one sees that it is a soldier, guarding
three prisoners.  The sight of these enemy soldiers in greenish and red rags gives us an impression
of power, of victory.  Some voices question them in passing. They are dismayed and stupefied;
the fists that prop up their yellow cheekbones protrude triangular caricatures of features.
Sometimes, at the cut of a frank question, they show signs of lifting their heads, and awkwardly
try to give vent to an answer.

"What's he say, that chap?" they asked Sergeant Müller.

"He says that war's none of their fault; it's the big people's."

"The swine!" grunts Margat.

We climb the hill and go down the other side of it.  Meandering, we steer towards the infernal
glimmers down yonder.  At the foot of the hill we stop.  There ought to be a clear view, but
it is evening--because of the bad weather and because the sky is full of black things and of
chemical clouds with unnatural colors.  Storm is blended with war.  Above the fierce and furious
cry of the shells I heard, in domination over all, the peaceful boom of thunder.

They plant us in subterranean files, facing a wide plain of gentle gradient which dips from
the horizon towards us, a plain with a rolling jumble of thorn-brakes and trees, which the
gale is seizing by the hair.  Squalls charged with rain and cold are passing over and immensifying
it; and there are rivers and cataclysms of clamor along the trajectories of the shells.  Yonder,
under the mass of the rust-red sky and its sullen flames, there opens a yellow rift where trees
stand forth like gallows.  The soil is dismembered.  The earth's covering has been blown a
lot in slabs, and its heart is seen reddish and lined white--butchery as far as the eye can see.

There is nothing now but to sit down and recline one's back as conveniently as possible.  We
stay there and breathe and live a little; we are calm, thanks to that faculty we have of never
seeing either the past or the future.

CHAPTER XIII

WHITHER GOEST THOU?

But soon a shiver has seized all of us.

"Listen!  It's stopped!  Listen!"

The whistle of bullets has completely ceased, and the artillery also. The lull is fantastic.
The longer it lasts the more it pierces us with the uneasiness of beasts.  We lived in eternal
noise; and now that it is hiding, it shakes and rouses us, and would drive us mad.

"What's that?"

We rub our eyelids and open wide our eyes.  We hoist our heads with no precaution above the
crumbled parapet.  We question each other--"D'you see?"

No doubt about it; the shadows are moving along the ground wherever one looks.  There is no
point in the distance where they are not moving.

Some one says at last:--

"Why, it's the Boches, to be sure!"

And then we recognize on the sloping plain the immense geographical form of the army that is
coming upon us!

*        *        *        *        *        *

Behind and in front of us together, a terrible crackle bursts forth and makes somber captives
of us in the depth of a valley of flames, and flames which illuminate the plain of men marching
over the plain.  They reveal them afar, in incalculable number, with the first ranks detaching
themselves, wavering a little, and forming again, the chalky soil a series of points and lines
like something written!

Gloomy stupefaction makes us dumb in face of that living immensity. Then we understand that
this host whose fountain-head is out of sight is being frightfully cannonaded by our 75's;
the shells set off behind us and arrive in front of us.  In the middle of the lilliputian ranks
the giant smoke-clouds leap like hellish gods.  We see the flashes of the shells which are
entering that flesh scattered over the earth.  It is smashed and burned entirely in places,
and that nation advances like a brazier.

Without a stop it overflows towards us.  Continually the horizon produces new waves.  We hear
a vast and gentle murmur rise.  With their tearing lights and their dull glimmers they resemble
in the distance a whole town making festival in the evening.

We can do nothing against the magnitude of that attack, the greatness of that sum total.  When
a gun has fired short, we see more clearly the littleness of each shot.  Fire and steel are
drowned in all that life; it closes up and re-forms like the sea.

"Rapid fire!"

We fire desperately.  But we have not many cartridges.  Since we came into the first line they
have ceased to inspect our load of ammunition; and many men, especially these last days, have
got rid of a part of the burden which bruises hips and belly and tears away the skin.  They
who are coming do not fire; and above the long burning thicket of our line one can see them
still flowing from the east.  They are closely massed in ranks.  One would say they clung to
each other as though welded. They are not using their rifles.  Their only weapon is the infinity
of their number.  They are coming to bury us under their feet.

Suddenly a shift in the wind brings us the smell of ether.  The divisions advancing on us are
drunk!  We declare it, we tell it to ourselves frantically.

"They're on fire!  They're on fire!" cries the trembling voice of the man beside me, whose
shoulders are shaken by the shots he is hurling.

They draw near.  They are lighted from below along the descent by the flashing footlights of
our fire; they grow bigger, and already we can make out the forms of soldiers.  They are at
the same time in order and in disorder.  Their outlines are rigid, and one divines faces of
stone. Their rifles are slung and they have nothing in their hands.  They come on like sleep-walkers,
only knowing how to put one foot before the other, and surely they are singing.  Yonder, in
the bulk of the invasion, the guns continue to destroy whole walls and whole structures of
life at will.  On the edges of it we can clearly see isolated silhouettes and groups as they
fall, with an extended line of figures like torchlights.

Now they are there, fifty paces away, breathing their ether into our faces.  We do not know
what to do.  We have no more cartridges.  We fix bayonets, our ears filled with that endless,
undefined murmur which comes from their mouths and the hollow rolling of the flood that marches.

A shout spreads behind us:

"Orders to fall back!"

We bow down and evacuate the trench by openings at the back.  There are not a lot of us, we
who thought we were so many.  The trench is soon empty, and we climb the hill that we descended
in coming.  We go up towards our 75's, which are in lines behind the ridge and still thundering.
We climb at a venture, in the open, by vague paths and tracks of mud; there are no trenches.
During the gray ascent it is a little clearer than a while ago: they do not fire on us.  If
they fired on us, we should be killed.  We climb in flagging jumps, in jerks, pounded by the
panting of the following waves that push us before them, closely beset by their clattering,
nor turning round to look again.  We hoist ourselves up the trembling flanks of the volcano
that clamors up yonder.  Along with us are emptied batteries also climbing, and horses and
clouds of steam and all the horror of modern war.  Each man pushes this retreat on, and is
pushed by it; and as our panting becomes one long voice, we go up and up, baffled by our own
weight which tries to fall back, deformed by our knapsacks, bent and silent as beasts.

From the summit we see the trembling inundation, murmuring and confused, filling the trenches
we have just left, and seeming already to overflow them.  But our eyes and ears are violently
monopolized by the two batteries between which we are passing; they are firing into the infinity
of the attackers, and each shot plunges into life.  Never have I been so affected by the harrowing
sight of artillery fire.  The tubes bark and scream in crashes that can hardly be borne; they
go and come on their brakes in starts of fantastic distinctness and violence.

In the hollows where the batteries lie hid, in the middle of a fan-shaped phosphorescence,
we see the silhouettes of the gunners as they thrust in the shells.  Every time they maneuver
the breeches, their chests and arms are scorched by a tawny reflection.  They are like the
implacable workers of blast furnace; the breeches are reddened by the heat of the explosions,
the steel of the guns is on fire in the evening.

For some minutes now they have fired more slowly--as if they were becoming exhausted.  A few
far-apart shots--the batteries fire no more; and now that the salvos are extinguished, we see
the fire in the steel go out.

In the abysmal silence we hear a gunner groan:--

"There's no more shell."

The shadow of twilight resumes its place in the sky--henceforward empty.  It grows cold.  There
is a mysterious and terrible mourning. Around me, springing from the obscurity, are groans
and gasps for breath, loaded backs which disappear, stupefied eyes, and the gestures of men
who wipe the sweat from their foreheads.  The order to retire is repeated, in a tone that grips
us--one would call it a cry of distress. There is a confused and dejected trampling; and then
we descend, we go away the way we came, and the host follows itself heavily and makes more
steps into the gulf.

*        *        *        *        *        *

When we have gone again down the slope of the hill, we find ourselves once more in the bottom
of a valley, for another height begins.  Before ascending it, we stop to take breath, but ready
to set off again should the flood-tide appear on the ridge yonder.  We find ourselves in the
middle of grassy expanses, without trenches or defense, and we are astonished not to see the
supports.  We are in the midst of a sort of absence.

We sit down here and there; and some one with his forehead bowed almost to his knees, translating
the common thought, says:--

"It's none of our fault."

Our lieutenant goes up to the man, puts his hand on his shoulder, and says, gently:--

"No, my lads, it's none of your fault."

Just then some sections join us who say, "We're the rearguard."  And some add that the two
batteries of 75's up yonder are already captured. A whistle rings out--"Come, march!"

We continue the retreat.  There are two battalions of us in all--no soldier in front of us;
no French soldier behind us.  I have neighbors who are unknown to me, motley men, routed and
stupefied, artillery and engineers; unknown men who come and go away, who seem to be born and
seem to die.

At one time we get a glimpse of some confusion in the orders from above.  A Staff officer,
issuing from no one knew where, throws himself in front of us, bars our way, and questions
us in a tragic voice:--

"What are you miserable men doing?  Are you running away?  Forward in the name of France! 
I call upon you to return.  Forward!"

The soldiers, who would never have thought of retiring without orders, are stunned, and can
make nothing of it.

"We're going back because they told us to go back."

But they obey.  They turn right about face.  Some of them have already begun to march forward,
and they call to their comrades:--

"Hey there!  This way, it seems!"

But the order to retire returns definitely, and we obey once more, fuming against those who
do not know what they say; and the ebb carries away with it the officer who shouted amiss.

The march speeds up, it becomes precipitate and haggard.  We are swept along by an impetuosity
that we submit to without knowing whence it comes.  We begin the ascent of the second hill
which appears in the fallen night a mountain.

When fairly on it we hear round us, on all sides and quite close, a terrible pit-pat, and the
long low hiss of mown grass.  There is a crackling afar in the sky, and they who glance back
for a second in the awesome storm see the cloudy ridges catch fire horizontally.  It means
that the enemy have mounted machine guns on the summit we have just abandoned, and that the
place where we are is being hacked by the knives of bullets.  On all sides soldiers wheel and
rattle down with curses, sighs and cries.  We grab and hang on to each other, jostling as if
we were fighting.

The rest at last reach the top of the rise; and just at that moment the lieutenant cries in
a clear and heartrending voice:

"Good-by, my lads!"

We see him fall, and he is carried away by the survivors around him.

From the summit we go a few steps down the other side, and lie on the ground in silence.  Some
one asks, "The lieutenant?"

"He's dead."

"Ah," says the soldier, "and how he said good-by to us!"

We breathe a little now.  We do not think any more unless it be that we are at last saved,
at last lying down.

Some engineers fire star-shells, to reconnoiter the state of things in the ground we have evacuated.
Some have the curiosity to risk a glance over it.  On the top of the first hill--where our
guns were--the big dazzling plummets show a line of bustling excitement.  One hears the noises
of picks and of mallet blows.

They have stopped their advance and are consolidating there.  They are hollowing their trenches
and planting their network of wire--which will have to be taken again some day.  We watch,
outspread on our bellies, or kneeling, or sitting lower down, with our empty rifles beside us.

Margat reflects, shakes his head and says:--

"Wire would have stopped them just now.  But we had no wire."

"And machine-guns, too! but where are they, the M.G.s?"

We have a distinct feeling that there has been an enormous blunder in the command.  Want of
foresight--the reënforcements were not there; they had not thought of supports.  There were
not enough guns to bar their way, nor enough artillery ammunition; with our own eyes we had
seen two batteries cease fire in mid-action--they had not thought of shells.  In a wide stretch
of country, as one could see, there were no defense work, no trenches; they had not thought
of trenches.

It is obvious even to the common eyes of common soldiers.

"What could we do?" says one of us; "it's the chiefs."

We say it and we should repeat it if we were not up again and swept away in the hustle of a
fresh departure, and thrown back upon more immediate and important anxieties.

*        *        *        *        *        *

We do not know where we are.

We have marched all night.  More weariness bends our spines again, more obscurity hums in our
heads.  By following the bed of a valley, we have found trenches again, and then men.  These
splayed and squelched alleys, with their fat and sinking sandbags, their props which rot like
limbs, flow into wider pockets where activity prevails--battalion H.Q., or dressing-stations.
About midnight we saw, through the golden line of a dugout's half-open door, some officers
seated at a white table--a cloth or a map.  Some one cries, "They're lucky!"  The company officers
are exposed to dangers as we are, but only in attacks and reliefs.  We suffer long.  They have
neither the vigil at the loophole, nor the knapsack, nor the fatigues.  What always lasts is
greater.

And now the walls of flabby flagstones and the open-mouthed caves have begun again.  Morning
rises, long and narrow as our lot.  We reach a busy trench-crossing.  A stench catches my throat:
some cess-pool into which these streets suspended in the earth empty their sewage?  No, we
see rows of stretchers, each one swollen.  There is a tent there of gray canvas, which flaps
like a flag, and on its fluttering wall the dawn lights up a bloody cross.

*        *        *        *        *        *

Sometimes, when we are high enough for our eyes to unbury themselves, I can dimly see some
geometrical lines, so confused, so desolated by distance, that I do not know if it is our country
or the other; even when one sees he does not know.  Our looks are worn away in looking. We
do not see, we are powerless to people the world.  We all have nothing in common but eyes of
evening and a soul of night.

And always, always, in these trenches whose walls run down like waves, with their stale stinks
of chlorine and sulphur, chains of soldiers go forward endlessly, towing each other.  They
go as quickly as they can, as if the walls were going to close upon them.  They are bowed as
if they were always climbing, wholly dark under colossal packs which they carry without stopping,
from one place to another place, as they might rocks in hell.  From minute to minute we are
filling the places of the obliterated hosts who have passed this way like the wind or have
stayed here like the earth.

We halt in a funnel.  We lean our backs against the walls, resting the packs on the projections
which bristle from them.  But we examine these things coming out of the earth, and we smell
that they are knees, elbows and heads.  They were interred there one day and the following
days are disinterring them.  At the spot where I am, from which I have roughly and heavily
recoiled with all my armory, a foot comes out from a subterranean body and protrudes.  I try
to put it out of the way, but it is strongly incrusted.  One would have to break the corpse
of steel, to make it disappear.  I look at the morsel of mortality.  My thoughts, and I cannot
help them, are attracted by the horizontal body that the world bruises; they go into the ground
with it and mold a shape for it. Its face--what is the look which rots crushed in the dark
depth of the earth at the top of these remains?  Ah, one catches sight of what there is under
the battlefields!  Everywhere in the spacious wall there are limbs, and black and muddy gestures.
It is a sepulchral sculptor's great sketch-model, a bas-relief in clay that stands haughtily
before our eyes.  It is the portal of the earth's interior; yes, it is the gate of hell.

*        *        *        *        *        *

In order to get here, I slept as I marched; and now I have an illusion that I am hidden in
this little cave, cooped up against the curve of the roof.  I am no more than this gentle cry
of the flesh--Sleep!  As I begin to doze and people myself with dreams, a man comes in.  He
is unarmed, and he ransacks us with the stabbing white point of his flash-lamp.  It is the
colonel's batman.  He says to our adjutant as soon as he finds him:--

"Six fatigue men wanted."

The adjutant's bulk rises and yawns:--

"Butsire, Vindame, Margat, Termite, Paulin, Rémus!" he orders as he goes to sleep again.

We emerge from the cave; and more slowly, from our drowsiness.  We find ourselves standing
in a village street.  But as soon as we touch the open air, dazzling roars precede and follow
us, mere handful of men as we are, abruptly revealing us to each other.  We hurl ourselves
like a pack of hounds into the first door or the first gaping hole, and there are some who
cry that:  "We are marked.  We're given away!"

After the porterage fatigue we go back.  I settle myself in my corner, heavier, more exhausted,
more buried in the bottom of everything.  I was beginning to sleep, to go away from myself,
lulled by a voice which sought in vain the number of the days we had been on the move, and
was repeating the names of the nights--Thursday, Friday, Saturday--when the man with the pointed
light returns, demands a gang, and I set off with the others.  It is so again for a third time.
As soon as we are outside, the night, which seems to lie in wait for us, sends us a squall,
with its thunderous destruction of space; it scatters us; then we are drawn together and joined
up.  We carry thick planks, two by two; and then piles of sacks which blind the bearers with
a plastery dust and make them reel like masts.

Then the last time, the most terrible, it was wire.  Each of us takes into his hands a great
hoop of coiled wire, as tall as ourselves, and weighing over sixty pounds.  When one carries
it, the supple wheel stretches out like an animal; it is set dancing by the least movement,
it works into the flesh of the shoulder, and strikes one's feet.  Mine tries to cling to me
and pull me up and throw me to the ground.  With this malignantly heavy thing, animated with
barbarous and powerful movement, I cross the ruins of a railway station, all stones and beams.
We clamber up an embankment which slips away and avoids us, we drag and push the rebellious
and implacable burden.  It cannot be reached, that receding height.  But we reach it, all the same.

Ah, I am a normal man!  I cling to life, and I have the consciousness of duty.  But at that
moment I called from the bottom of my heart for the bullet which would have delivered me from life.

We return, with empty hands, in a sort of sinister comfort.  I remember, as we came in, a neighbor
said to me--or to some one else:

"Sheets of corrugated iron are worse."

The fatigues have to be stopped at dawn, although the engineers protest against the masses
of stores which uselessly fill the depot.

We sleep from six to seven in the morning.  In the last traces of night we emigrate from the
cave, blinking like owls.

"Where's the juice?"[1] we ask.

[Footnote 1: Coffee.]

There is none.  The cooks are not there, nor the mess people.  And they reply:--

"Forward!"

In the dull and pallid morning, on the approaches to a village, there appear gardens, which
no longer have human shape.  Instead of cultivation there are puddles and mud.  All is burned
or drowned, and the walls scattered like bones everywhere; and we see the mottled and bedaubed
shadows of soldiers.  War befouls the country as it does faces and hearts.

Our company gets going, gray and wan, broken down by the infamous weariness.  We halt in front
of a hangar:--

"Those that are tired can leave their packs," the new sergeant advises; "they'll find them
again here."

"If we're leaving our packs, it means we're going to attack," says an ancient.

He says it, but he does not know.

One by one, on the dirty soil of the hangar, the knapsacks fall like bodies.  Some men, however,
are mistrustful, and prefer to keep their packs.  Under all circumstances there are always
exceptions.

Forward!  The same shouts put us again in movement.  Forward!  Come, get up!  Come on, march!
Subdue your refractory flesh; lift yourselves from your slumber as from a coffin, begin yourselves
again without ceasing, give all that you can give--Forward!  Forward!  It has to be. It is
a higher concern than yours, a law from above.  We do not know what it is.  We only know the
step we make; and even by day one marches in the night.  And then, one cannot help it.  The
vague thoughts and little wishes that we had in the days when we were concerned with ourselves
are ended.  There is no way now of escaping from the wheels of fate, no way now of turning
aside from fatigue and cold, disgust and pain.  Forward!  The world's hurricane drives straight
before them these terribly blind who grope with their rifles.

We have passed through a wood, and then plunged again into the earth. We are caught in an enfilading
fire.  It is terrible to pass in broad daylight in these communication trenches, at right angles
to the lines, where one is in view all the way.  Some soldiers are hit and fall. There are
light eddies and brief obstructions in the places where they dive; and then the rest, a moment
halted by the barrier, sometimes still living, frown in the wide-open direction of death, and
say:--

"Well, if it's got to be, come on.  Get on with it!"

They deliver up their bodies wholly--their warm bodies, that the bitter cold and the wind and
the sightless death touch as with women's hands. In these contacts between living beings and
force, there is something carnal, virginal, divine.

*        *        *        *        *        *

They have sent me into a listening post.  To get there I had to worm myself, bent double, along
a low and obstructed sap.  In the first steps I was careful not to walk on the obstructions,
and then I had to, and I dared.  My foot trembled on the hard or supple masses which peopled
that sap.

On the edge of the hole--there had been a road above it formerly, or perhaps even a market-place--the
trunk of a tree severed near the ground arose, short as a grave-stone.  The sight stopped me
for a moment, and my heart, weakened no doubt by my physical destitution, kindled with pity
for the tree become a tomb!

Two hours later I rejoined the section in its pit.  We abide there, while the cannonade increases.
The morning goes by, then the afternoon.  Then it is evening.

They make us go into a wide dugout.  It appears that an attack is developing somewhere.  From
time to time, through a breach contrived between sandbags so decomposed and oozing that they
seem to have lived, we go out to a little winterly and mournful crossing, to look about. We
consult the sky to determine the tempest's whereabouts.  We can know nothing.

The artillery fire dazzles and then chokes up our sight.  The heavens are making a tumult of
blades.

Monuments of steel break loose and crash above our heads.  Under the sky, which is dark as
with threat of deluge, the explosions throw livid sunshine in all directions.  From one end
to the other of the visible world the fields move and descend and dissolve, and the immense
expanse stumbles and falls like the sea.  Towering explosions in the east, a squall in the
south; in the zenith a file of bursting shrapnel like suspended volcanoes.

The smoke which goes by, and the hours as well, darken the inferno. Two or three of us risk
our faces at the earthen cleft and look out, as much for the purpose of propping ourselves
against the earth as for seeing.  But we see nothing, nothing on the infinite expanse which
is full of rain and dusk, nothing but the clouds which tear themselves and blend together in
the sky, and the clouds which come out of the earth.

Then, in the slanting rain and the limitless gray, we see a man, one only, who advances with
his bayonet forward, like a specter.

We watch this shapeless being, this thing, leaving our lines and going away yonder.

We only see one--perhaps that is the shadow of another, on his left.

We do not understand, and then we do.  It is the end of the attacking wave.

What can his thoughts be--this man alone in the rain as if under a curse, who goes upright
away, forward, when space is changed into a shrieking machine?  By the light of a cascade of
flashes I thought I saw a strange monk-like face.  Then I saw more clearly--the face of an
ordinary man, muffled in a comforter.

"It's a chap of the 150th, not the 129th," stammers a voice by my side.

We do not know, except that it is the end of the attacking wave.

When he has disappeared among the eddies, another follows him at a distance, and then another.
They pass by, separate and solitary, delegates of death, sacrificers and sacrificed.  Their
great-coats fly wide; and we, we press close to each other in our corner of night; we push
and hoist ourselves with our rusted muscles, to see that void and those great scattered soldiers.

We return to the shelter, which is plunged in darkness.  The motor-cyclist's voice obtrudes
itself to the point that we think we can see his black armor.  He is describing the "carryings
on" at Bordeaux in September, when the Government was there.  He tells of the festivities,
the orgies, the expenditure, and there is almost a tone of pride in the poor creature's voice
as he recalls so many pompous pageants all at once.

But the uproar outside silences us.  Our funk-hole trembles and cracks. It is the barrage--the
barrage which those whom we saw have gone to fight, hand to hand.  A thunderbolt falls just
at the opening, it casts a bright light on all of us, and reveals the last emotion of all,
the belief that all was ended!  One man is grimacing like a malefactor caught in the act; another
is opening strange, disappointed eyes; another is swinging his doleful head, enslaved by the
love of sleep, and another, squatting with his head in his hands, makes a lurid entanglement.
We have seen each other--upright, sitting or crucified--in the second of broad daylight which
came into the bowels of the earth to resurrect our darkness.

In a moment, when the guns chance to take breath, a voice at the door-hole calls us:

"Forward!"

"We shall be staying there, this time over!" growl the men.

They say this, but they do not know it.  We go out, into a chaos of crashing and flames.

"You'd better fix bayonets," says the sergeant; "come, get 'em on."

We stop while we adjust weapon to weapon and then run to overtake the rest.

We go down; we go up; we mark time; we go forward--like the others.  We are no longer in the
trench.

"Get your heads down--kneel!"

We stop and go on our knees.  A star-shell pierces us with its intolerable gaze.

By its light we see, a few steps in front of us, a gaping trench.  We were going to fall into
it.  It is motionless and empty--no, it is occupied--yes, it is empty.  It is full of a file
of slain watchers. The row of men was no doubt starting out of the earth when the shell burst
in their faces; and by the poised white rays we see that the blast has staved them in, has
taken away the flesh; and above the level of the monstrous battlefield there is left of them
only some fearfully distorted heads.  One is broken and blurred; one emerges like a peak, a
good half of it fallen into nothing.  At the end of the row, the ravages have been less, and
only the eyes are smitten.  The hollow orbits in those marble heads look outwards with dried
darkness.  The deep and obscure face-wounds have the look of caverns and funnels, of the shadows
in the moon; and stars of mud are clapped on the faces in the place where eyes once shone.

Our strides have passed that trench.  We go more quickly and trouble no more now about the
star-shells, which, among us who know nothing, say, "I know" and "I will."  All is changed,
all habits and laws.  We march exposed, upright, through the open fields.  Then I suddenly
understand what they have hidden from us up to the last moment--we are attacking!

Yes, the counter-attack has begun without our knowing it.  I apply myself to following the
others.  May I not be killed like the others; may I be saved like the others!  But if I am
killed, so much the worse.

I bear myself forward.  My eyes are open but I look at nothing; confused pictures are printed
on my staring eyes.  The men around me form strange surges; shouts cross each other or descend.
Upon the fantastic walls of nights the shots make flicks and flashes.  Earth and sky are crowded
with apparitions; and the golden lace of burning stakes is unfolding.

A man is in front of me, a man whose head is wrapped in linen.

He is coming from the opposite direction.  He is coming from the other country!  He was seeking
me, and I was seeking him.  He is quite near--suddenly he is upon me.

The fear that he is killing me or escaping me--I do not know which--makes me throw out a desperate
effort.  Opening my hands and letting the rifle go, I seize him.  My fingers are buried in
his shoulder, in his neck, and I find again, with overflowing exultation, the eternal form
of the human frame.  I hold him by the neck with all my strength, and with more than all my
strength, and we quiver with my quivering.

He had not the idea of dropping his rifle so quickly as I.  He yields and sinks.  I cling to
him as if it were salvation.  The words in his throat make a lifeless noise.  He brandishes
a hand which has only three fingers--I saw it clearly outlined against the clouds like a fork.

Just as he totters in my arms, resisting death, a thunderous blow strikes him in the back.
His arms drop, and his head also, which is violently doubled back, but his body is hurled against
me like a projectile, like a superhuman blast.

I have rolled on the ground; I get up, and while I am hastily trying to find myself again I
feel a light blow in the waist.  What is it?  I walk forward, and still forward, with my empty
hands.  I see the others pass, they go by in front of me.  I, I advance no more.  Suddenly
I fall to the ground.

*        *        *        *        *        *

CHAPTER XIV

THE RUINS

I fall on my knees, and then full length.  I do what so many others have done.

I am alone on the earth, face to face with the mud, and I can no longer move.  The frightful
searching of the shells alights around me.  The hoarse hurricane which does not know me is
yet trying to find the place where I am!

Then the battle goes away, and its departure is heartrending.  In spite of all my efforts,
the noise of the firing fades and I am alone; the wind blows and I am naked.

I shall remain nailed to the ground.  By clinging to the earth and plunging my hands into the
depth of the swamp as far as the stones, I get my neck round a little to see the enormous burden
that my back supports.  No--it is only the immensity on me.

My gaze goes crawling.  In front of me there are dark things all linked together, which seem
to seize or to embrace one another.  I look at those hills which shut out my horizon and imitate
gestures and men. The multitude downfallen there imprisons me in its ruins.  I am walled in
by those who are lying down, as I was walled in before by those who stood.

I am not in pain.  I am extraordinarily calm; I am drunk with tranquillity.  Are they dead,
all--those?  I do not know.  The dead are specters of the living, but the living are specters
of the dead. Something warm is licking my hand.  The black mass which overhangs me is trembling.
It is a foundered horse, whose great body is emptying itself, whose blood is flowing like poor
touches of a tongue on to my hand.  I shut my eyes, bemused, and think of a bygone merry-making;
and I remember that I once saw, at the end of a hunt, against the operatic background of a
forest, a child-animal whose life gushed out amid general delight.

A voice is speaking beside me.

No doubt the moon has come out--I cannot see as high as the cloud escarpments, as high as the
sky's opening.  But that blenching light is making the corpses shine like tombstones.

I try to find the low voice.  There are two bodies, one above the other.  The one underneath
must be gigantic--his arms are thrown backward in a hurricane gesture; his stiff, disheveled
hair has crowned him with a broken crown.  His eyes are opaque and glaucous, like two expectorations,
and his stillness is greater than anything one may dream of.  On the other the moon's beams
are setting points and lines a-sparkle and silvering gold.  It is he who is talking to me,
quietly and without end.  But although his low voice is that of a friend, his words are incoherent.
He is mad--I am abandoned by him!  No matter, I will drag myself up to him to begin with. 
I look at him again.  I shake myself and blink my eyes, so as to look better.  He wears on
his body a uniform accursed!  Then with a start, and my hand claw-wise, I stretch myself towards
the glittering prize to secure it.  But I cannot go nearer him; it seems that I no longer have
a body.  He has looked at me.  He has recognized my uniform, if it is recognizable, and my
cap, if I have it still.  Perhaps he has recognized the indelible seal of my race that I carry
printed on my features.  Yes, on my face he has recognized that stamp.  Something like hatred
has blotted out the face that I saw dawning so close to me.  Our two hearts make a desperate
effort to hurl ourselves on each other.  But we can no more strike each other than we can separate
ourselves.

But has he seen me?  I cannot say now.  He is stirred by fever as by the wind; he is choked
with blood.  He writhes, and that shows me the beaten-down wings of his black cloak.

Close by, some of the wounded have cried out; and farther away one would say they are singing--beyond
the low stakes so twisted and shriveled that they look as if guillotined.

He does not know what he is saying.  He does not even know that he is speaking, that his thoughts
are coming out.  The night is torn into rags by sudden bursts; it fills again at random with
clusters of flashes; and his delirium enters into my head.  He murmurs that logic is a thing
of terrible chains, and that all things cling together.  He utters sentences from which distinct
words spring, like the scattered hasty gleams they include in hymns--the Bible, history, majesty,
folly. Then he shouts:--

"There is nothing in the world but the Empire's glory!"

His cry shakes some of the motionless reefs.  And I, like an invincible echo, I cry:--

"There is only the glory of France!"

I do not know if I did really cry out, and if our words did collide in the night's horror.
His head is quite bare.  His slender neck and bird-like profile issue from a fur collar.  There
are things like owls shining on his breast.  It seems to me as if silence is digging itself
into the brains and lungs of the dark prisoners who imprison us, and that we are listening to it.

He rambles more loudly now, as if he bore a stifling secret; he calls up multitudes, and still
more multitudes.  He is obsessed by multitudes--"Men, men!" he says.  The soil is caressed
by some sounds of sighs, terribly soft, by confidences which are interchanged without their
wishing it.  Now and again, the sky collapses into light, and that flash of instantaneous sunshine
changes the shape of the plain every time, according to its direction.  Then does the night
take all back again athwart the rolling echoes.

"Men!  Men!"

"What about them, then?" says a sudden jeering voice which falls like a stone.

"Men must not awake," the shining shadow goes on, in dull and hollow tones.

"Don't worry!" says the ironical voice, and at that moment it terrifies me.

Several bodies arise on their fists into the darkness--I see them by their heavy groans--and
look around them.

The shadow talks to himself and repeats his insane words:--

"Men must not awake."

The voice opposite me, capsizing in laughter and swollen with a rattle, says again:--

"Don't worry!"

Yonder, in the hemisphere of night, comets glide, blending their cries of engines and owls
with their flaming entrails.  Will the sky ever recover the huge peace of the sun and the stainless
blue?

A little order, a little lucidity are coming back into my mind.  Then I begin to think about
myself.

Am I going to die, yes or no?  Where can I be wounded?  I have managed to look at my hands,
one by one; they are not dead, and I saw nothing in their dark trickling.  It is extraordinary
to be made motionless like this, without knowing where or how.  I can do no more on earth than
lift my eyes a little to the edge of the world where I have rolled.

Suddenly I am pushed by a movement of the horse on which I am lying.  I see that he has turned
his great head aside; he is mournfully eating grass.  I saw this horse but lately in the middle
of the regiment--I know him by the white in his mane--rearing and whinnying like the true battle-chargers;
and now, broken somewhere, he is silent as the truly unhappy are.  Once again, I recall the
red deer's little one, mutilated on its carpet of fresh crimson, and the emotion which I had
not on that bygone day rises into my throat.  Animals are innocence incarnate. This horse is
like an enormous child, and if one wanted to point out life's innocence face to face, one would
have to typify, not a little child, but a horse.  My neck gives way, I utter a groan, and my
face gropes upon the ground.

The animal's start has altered my place and shot me on my side, nearer still to the man who
was talking.  He has unbent, and is lying on his back.  Thus he offers his face like a mirror
to the moon's pallor, and shows hideously that he is wounded in the neck.  I feel that he is
going to die.  His words are hardly more now than the rustle of wings. He has said some unintelligible
things about a Spanish painter, and some motionless portraits in the palaces--the Escurial,
Spain, Europe. Suddenly he is repelling with violence some beings who are in his past:--

"Begone, you dreamers!" he says, louder than the stormy sky where the flames are red as blood,
louder than the falling flashes and the harrowing wind, louder than all the night which enshrouds
us and yet continues to stone us.

He is seized with a frenzy which bares his soul as naked as his neck:--

"The truth is revolutionary," gasps the nocturnal voice; "get you gone, you men of truth, you
who cast disorder among ignorance, you who strew words and sow the wind; you contrivers, begone!
You bring in the reign of men!  But the multitude hates you and mocks you!"

He laughs, as if he heard the multitude's laughter.

And around us another burst of convulsive laughter grows hugely bigger in the plain's black
heart:--

"Wot's 'e sayin' now, that chap?"

"Let him be.  You can see 'e knows more'n 'e says."

"Ah, la, la!"

I am so near to him that I alone gather the rest of his voice, and he says to me very quietly:--

"I have confidence in the abyss of the people."

And those words stabbed me to the heart and dilated my eyes with horror, for it seemed to me
suddenly, in a flash, that he understood what he was saying!  A picture comes to life before
my eyes--that prince, whom I saw from below, once upon a time, in the nightmare of life, he
who loved the blood of the chase.  Not far away a shell turns the darkness upside down; and
it seems as if that explosion also has considered and shrieked.

Heavy night is implanted everywhere around us.  My hands are bathed in black blood.  On my
neck and cheeks, rain, which is also black, bleeds.

The funeral procession of silver-fringed clouds goes by once more, and again a ray of moonlight
besilvers the swamp that has sunk us soldiers; it lays winding-sheets on the prone.

All at once a swelling lamentation comes to life, one knows not where, and glides over the plain:--

"Help!  Help!"

"Now then!  They're not coming to look for us!  What about it?"

And I see a stirring and movement, very gentle, as at the bottom of the sea.

Amid the glut of noises, upon that still tepid and unsubmissive expanse where cold death sits
brooding, that sharp profile has fallen back. The cloak is quivering.  The great and sumptuous
bird of prey is in the act of taking wing.

The horse has not stopped bleeding.  Its blood falls on me drop by drop with the regularity
of a clock,--as though all the blood that is filtering through the strata of the field and
all the punishment of the wounded came to a head in him and through him.  Ah, it seems that
truth goes farther in all directions than one thought!  We bend over the wrong that animals
suffer, for them we wholly understand.

Men, men!  Everywhere the plain has a mangled outline.  Below that horizon, sometimes blue-black
and sometimes red-black, the plain is monumental!

CHAPTER XV

AN APPARITION

I have not changed my place.  I open my eyes.  Have I been sleeping?  I do not know.  There
is tranquil light now.  It is evening or morning. My arms alone can tremble.  I am enrooted
like a distorted bush.  My wound?  It is that which glues me to the ground.

I succeed in raising my face, and the wet waves of space assail my eyes.  Patiently I pick
out of the earthy pallor which blends all things some foggy shoulders, some cloudy angles of
elbows, some hand-like lacerations.  I discern in the still circle which encloses me--faces
lying on the ground and dirty as feet, faces held out to the rain like vases, and holding stagnant
tears.

Quite near, one face is looking sadly at me, as it lolls to one side. It is coming out of the
bottom of the heap, as a wild animal might. Its hair falls back like nails.  The nose is a
triangular hole and a little of the whiteness of human marble dots it.  There are no lips left,
and the two rows of teeth show up like lettering.  The cheeks are sprinkled with moldy traces
of beard.  This body is only mud and stones.  This face, in front of my own, is only a consummate
mirror.

Water-blackened overcoats cover and clothe the whole earth around me.

I gaze, and gaze----

I am frozen by a mass which supports me.  My elbow sinks into it.  It is the horse's belly;
its rigid leg obliquely bars the narrow circle from which my eyes cannot escape.  Ah, it is
dead!  It seems to me that my breast is empty, yet still there is an echo in my heart.  What
I am looking for is life.

The distant sky is resonant, and each dull shot comes and pushes my shoulder.  Nearer, some
shells are thundering heavily.  Though I cannot see them, I see the tawny reflection that their
flame spreads abroad, and the sudden darkness as well that is hurled by their clouds of excretion.
Other shadows go and come on the ground about me; and then I hear in the air the plunge of
beating wings, and cries so fierce that I feel them ransack my head.

*        *        *        *        *        *

Death is not yet dead everywhere.  Some points and surfaces still resist and budge and cry
out, doubtless because it is dawn; and once the wind swept away a muffled bugle-call.  There
are some who still burn with the invisible fire of fever, in spite of the frozen periods they
have crossed.  But the cold is working into them.  The immobility of lifeless things is passing
into them, and the wind empties itself as it goes by.

Voices are worn away; looks are soldered to their eyes.  Wounds are staunched; they have finished.
Only the earth and the stones bleed. And just then I saw, under the trickling morning, some
half-open but still tepid dead that steamed, as if they were the blackening rubbish-heap of
a village.  I watch that hovering dead breath of the dead.  The crows are eddying round the
naked flesh with their flapping banners and their war-cries.  I see one which has found some
shining rubies on the black vein-stone of a foot; and one which noisily draws near to a mouth,
as if called by it.  Sometimes a dead man makes a movement, so that he will fall lower down.
But they will have no more burial than if they were the last men of all.

*        *        *        *        *        *

There is one upright presence which I catch a glimpse of, so near, so near; and I want to see
it.  In making the effort with my elbow on the horse's ballooned body I succeed in altering
the direction of my head, and of the corridor of my gaze.  Then all at once I discover a quite
new population of bronze men in rotten clothes; and especially, erect on bended knees, a gray
overcoat, lacquered with blood and pierced by a great hole, round which is collected a bunch
of heavy crimson flowers. Slowly I lift the burden of my eyes to explore that hole.  Amid the
shattered flesh, with its changing colors and a smell so strong that it puts a loathsome taste
in my mouth, at the bottom of the cage where some crossed bones are black and rusted as iron
bars, I can see something, something isolated, dark and round.  I see that it is a heart.

Placed there, too--I do not know how, for I cannot see the body's full height--the arm, and
the hand.  The hand has only three fingers--a fork----  Ah, I recognize that heart!  It is
his whom I killed. Prostrate in the mud before him, because of my defeat and my resemblance,
I cried out to the man's profundity, to the superhuman man.  Then my eyes fell; and I saw worms
moving on the edges of that infinite wound.  I was quite close to their stirring.  They are
whitish worms, and their tails are pointed like stings; they curve and flatten out, sometimes
in the shape of an "i," and sometimes of a "u."  The perfection of immobility is left behind.
The human material is crumbled into the earth for another end.

I hated that man, when he had his shape and his warmth.  We were foreigners, and made to destroy
ourselves.  Yet it seems to me, in face of that bluish heart, still attached to its red cords,
that I understand the value of life.  It is understood by force, like a caress.  I think I
can see how many seasons and memories and beings there had to be, yonder, to make up that life,--while
I remain before him, on a point of the plain, like a night watcher.  I hear the voice that
his flesh breathed while yet he lived a little, when my ferocious hands fumbled in him for
the skeleton we all have.  He fills the whole place.  He is too many things at once.  How can
there be worlds in the world?  That established notion would destroy all.

This perfume of a tuberose is the breath of corruption.  On the ground, I see crows near me,
like hens.

Myself!  I think of myself, of all that I am.  Myself, my home, my hours; the past, and the
future,--it was going to be like the past! And at that moment I feel, weeping within me and
dragging itself from some little bygone trifle, a new and tragical sorrow in dying, a hunger
to be warm once more in the rain and the cold: to enclose myself in myself in spite of space,
to hold myself back, to live.  I called for help, and then lay panting, watching the distance
in desperate expectation.  "Stretcher-bearers!" I cry.  I do not hear myself; but if only the
others heard me!

Now that I have made that effort, I can do no more, and my head lies there at the entrance
to that world-great wound.

There is nothing now.

Yet there is that man.  He was laid out like one dead.  But suddenly, through his shut eyes,
he smiled.  He, no doubt, will come back here on earth, and something within me thanks him
for his miracle.

And there was that one, too, whom I saw die.  He raised his hand, which was drowning.  Hidden
in the depths of the others, it was only by that hand that he lived, and called, and saw. 
On one finger shone a wedding-ring, and it told me a sort of story.  When his hand ceased to
tremble, and became a dead plant with that golden flower, I felt the beginning of a farewell
rise in me like a sob.  But there are too many of them for one to mourn them all.  How many
of them are there on all this plain?  How many, how many of them are there in all this moment?
Our heart is only made for one heart at a time.  It wears us out to look at all.  One may say,
"There are the others," but it is only a saying.  "You shall not know; you shall not know."

Barrenness and cold have descended on all the body of the earth. Nothing moves any more, except
the wind, that is charged with cold water, and the shells, that are surrounded by infinity,
and the crows, and the thought that rolls immured in my head.

*        *        *        *        *        *

They are motionless at last, they who forever marched, they to whom space was so great!  I
see their poor hands, their poor legs, their poor backs, resting on the earth.  They are tranquil
at last.  The shells which bespattered them are ravaging another world.  They are in the peace
eternal.

All is accomplished, all has terminated there.  It is there, in that circle narrow as a well
that the descent into the raging heart of hell was halted, the descent into slow tortures,
into unrelenting fatigue, into the flashing tempest.  We came here because they told us to
come here.  We have done what they told us to do.  I think of the simplicity of our reply on
the Day of Judgment.

The gunfire continues.  Always, always, the shells come, and all those bullets that are miles
in length.  Hidden behind the horizons, living men unite with machines and fall furiously on
space.  They do not see their shots.  They do not know what they are doing.  "You shall not
know; you shall not know."

But since the cannonade is returning, they will be fighting here again. All these battles spring
from themselves and necessitate each other to infinity!  One single battle is not enough, it
is not complete, there is no satisfaction.  Nothing is finished, nothing is ever finished.
Ah, it is only men who die!  No one understands the greatness of things, and I know well that
I do not understand all the horror in which I am.

*        *        *        *        *        *

Here is evening, the time when the firing is lighted up.  The horizons of the dark day, of
the dark evening, and of the illuminated night revolve around my remains as round a pivot.

I am like those who are going to sleep, like the children.  I am growing fainter and more soothed;
I close my eyes; I dream of my home.

Yonder, no doubt, they are joining forces to make the evenings tolerable.  Marie is there,
and some other women, getting dinner ready; the house becomes a savor of cooking.  I hear Marie
speaking; standing at first, then seated at the table.  I hear the sound of the table things
which she moves on the cloth as she takes her place.  Then, because some one is putting a light
to the lamp, having lifted its chimney, Marie gets up to go and close the shutters.  She opens
the window.  She leans forward and outspreads her arms; but for a moment she stays immersed
in the naked night.  She shivers, and I, too. Dawning in the darkness, she looks afar, as I
am doing.  Our eyes have met.  It is true, for this night is hers as much as mine, the same
night, and distance is not anything palpable or real; distance is nothing.  It is true, this
great close contact.

Where am I?  Where is Marie?  What is she, even?  I do not know, I do not know.  I do not know
where the wound in my flesh is, and how can I know the wound in my heart?

*        *        *        *        *        *

The clouds are crowning themselves with sheaves of stars.  It is an aviary of fire, a hell
of silver and gold.  Planetary cataclysms send immense walls of light falling around me.  Phantasmal
palaces of shrieking lightning, with arches of star-shells, appear and vanish amid forests
of ghastly gleams.

While the bombardment is patching the sky with continents of flame, it is drawing still nearer.
Volleys of flashes are plunging in here and there and devouring the other lights.  The supernatural
army is arriving!  All the highways of space are crowded.  Nearer still, a shell bursts with
all its might and glows; and among us all whom chance defends goes frightfully in quest of
flesh.  Shells are following each other into that cavity there.  Again I see, among the things
of earth, a resurrected man, and he is dragging himself towards that hole!  He is wrapped in
white, and the under-side of his body, which rubs the ground, is black.  Hooking the ground
with his stiffened arms he crawls, long and flat as a boat.  He still hears the cry "Forward!"
He is finding his way to the hole; he does not know, and he is trailing exactly toward its
monstrous ambush.  The shell will succeed!  At any second now the frenzied fangs of space will
strike his side and go in as into a fruit.  I have not the strength to shout to him to fly
elsewhere with all his slowness; I can only open my mouth and become a sort of prayer in face
of the man's divinity.  And yet, he is the survivor; and along with the sleeper, to whom a
dream was whispering just now, he is the only one left to me.

A hiss--the final blow reaches him; and in a flash I see the piebald maggot crushing under
the weight of the sibilance and turning wild eyes towards me.

No!  It is not he!  A blow of light--of all light--fills my eyes.  I am lifted up, I am brandished
by an unknown blade in the middle of a globe of extraordinary light.  The shell----I!  And
I am falling, I fall continually, fantastically.  I fall out of this world; and in that fractured
flash I saw myself again--I thought of my bowels and my heart hurled to the winds--and I heard
voices saying again and again--far, far away--"Simon Paulin died at the age of thirty-six."

CHAPTER XVI

DE PROFUNDIS CLAMAVI

I am dead.  I fall, I roll like a broken bird into bewilderments of light, into canyons of
darkness.  Vertigo presses on my entrails, strangles me, plunges into me.  I drop sheer into
the void, and my gaze falls faster than I.

Through the wanton breath of the depths that assail me I see, far below, the seashore dawning.
The ghostly strand that I glimpse while I cling to my own body is bare, endless, rain-drowned,
and supernaturally mournful.  Through the long, heavy and concentric mists that the clouds
make, my eyes go searching.  On the shore I see a being who wanders alone, veiled to the feet.
It is a woman.  Ah, I am one with that woman!  She is weeping.  Her tears are dropping on the
sand where the waves are breaking!  While I am reeling to infinity, I hold out my two heavy
arms to her.  She fades away as I look.

For a long time there is nothing, nothing but invisible time, and the immense futility of rain
on the sea.

*        *        *        *        *        *

What are these flashes of light?  There are gleams of flame in my eyes; a surfeit of light
is cast over me.  I can no longer cling to anything--fire and water!

In the beginning, there is battle between fire and water--the world revolving headlong in the
hooked claws of its flames, and the expanses of water which it drives back in clouds.  At last
the water obscures the whirling spirals of the furnace and takes their place.  Under the roof
of dense darkness, timbered with flashes, there are triumphant downpours which last a hundred
thousand years.  Through centuries of centuries, fire and water face each other; the fire,
upright, buoyant and leaping; the water flat, creeping, gliding, widening its lines and its
surface.  When they touch, is it the water which hisses and roars, or is it the fire?  And
one sees the reigning calm of a radiant plain, a plain of incalculable greatness.  The round
meteor congeals into shapes, and continental islands are sculptured by the water's boundless hand. 

When it was light enough, the Indians and the old Paul again went to their work, the apprentice mechanic painted
a hideous caricature on the wall, claiming that Moses was to speak similar taken, the son of
Israel received several disputes with the worst with the marmots, which to a conversation about
Jewish emancipation took in, claiming it would be ten times wiser the Christian people of the Jews
as those to emancipate from the state.

To make the noise to an end, the one-eyed man jumps up from the straw sack, rub with your fingers
the ground bass to the "German Marseillaise," which suggests the
Indians sing and immediately begins:

Friend, I am happy go there
as it wants to live under this roof, I still happy and so on

All

cage with a turret-high Treble, the minds and calm down after the
old song has been repeated often enough Schlosser says the apprentice:

"Do
you hear ringing?

  Now it is nine clock, my mother kneels in the
  pew and pray for me!

... I do not know what would I give if I only had a single time again the interiors a church would look
and could attend a church service! "

"To me it is just so, it is not right that remand prisoners do not even have a prayer room
and all services have to be alienated, "says the Paule.

"I would also like to church when I saw nobody!" Hannah sighs of sugar.

"Oho, your devotees warnet, only to get your prison soup, you can
then the priests look at the altar again sufficiently "covered the
one-eyed.

"Inherent in the prison is not so fast!" Hannah says the sugar.

"You come into it yet at any rate, I see you on the nose!" That prophesied.

"If I was outside, I would as an enlightened man on Sundays again
in the fair , Namely, go into the eagle or deer in the "Eilfuhrmesse,"
where with smoking pipes and cigars smoked, with glasses and rang
with knives, the blessing is given, "mocks the Indians.

"Yes, yes, the Church of race, which is a cursed custom, and is still
far too deep in people, especially in the womenfolk.

These keep the craft of "priests" but still standing, "the rants of Spaniol.

"The Spaniol has but one true Höllenhaß against everything what is religion. I am Calvinist,
Lutheran, Evangelical, in short, I do not know myself right and he

not drive it.

"Oho, old crow did, 'you probably understand!" Spaniol says and continues:

"I have the" priests "deeply looked into the cards, first loathing of them and Gradually their talk

... Just think a little bit after and I wonder: If the service such a necessary thing, wherefore
you do not need in this place? ... If the "priests" really serious about their faith would
be, so they do not live after that, and open or secretly like other people? ... Christ did not say
that one must visit prisoners and redeem and expects the church visiting the prisoners not to the
works of mercy? Some of you are sitting now seven full months, the investigation is closed, they
expect the sentence and when you have ever even seen a black coat
here?

... Not one comes if he is not paid, a remand prisoner may get sick, die and perish there is rarely

"Bravo! ... The Spaniol is right! ... The black skirts can keep us at bay! ... Christ Much has told his
followers what to think never or rarely "- cry the prisoners.

"The Protestant clergy are herein better!" assured the old Paul.

"The rabbi is not been with me three times already? ... He ever leaves a captive Israelites? ...
Where is love and loyalty, with you arrogant Christians or Jews are despised? " triumphs of
Moses.

"It is true, all the Jews stick together like bad luck!" noticed the
Spaniol.

a Jewish school?

These raw, miserable conversation is running out again, the monkeys face still makes noise
away, yawn and says the other Indians:

"A Stümpchen light would be better if we could then use Domino, nine
pieces, dice and cards the dead time to beat!

"You can get everything if possible bailiff and jailer and bring it,
but the Heaven is high and down below the rights in Karlsruhe!

Us do you do what you want, "complains Paul.

"Once I have quite money, then I will bring the abandoned prison.

Outside think you just do not like them, I've also been so, but now I know what it means to be
a prisoner, "says Hannes sugar.

"I do believe our Roßhannes there will be crazy.

How are we to find money when You do not steal?

Rich rogues I've met yet, not least in Penitentiary, "assures the one-eyed.

"I'm not a fool nor a knave, may be neither, but money has since Money makes the world and I know
that I still get money to burn, "the sugar Hannah smiles significant.

"Yes, if you grow your crop to the abdomen can be reduced, then show
yourself in a box and show the public money, then you'll still be
rich!

"laughs at the Indians.

"Our sugar Hannah gets money, lots of money and maybe in a short time, that's certain!" Spaniol
assured the very determined.

"Has anyone put to him in the lottery? Asks the apprentice locksmith.

"No, not yet, but I have entrusted my secret and he is now in the lottery To set free if he starts.
This is his wealth safe Numero One.

Furthermore, the Spaniol even concocted a Plänlein, which I do not know, but he is the genius Mounsieur
and therein lies the sugar Hansen wealth Numero Two.

Half the lot is it already made to Man do, he will put into it further
and can then ask how dear to the Black Forest was "assured of Paul.

"Oh, your lottery you have not even a good rock, at most a prison smock gives the sugar Hans will
start pretty blue, "laughs the Indians.

"I have to remain poor until the 70th, and perhaps also through the other 20, the is and remains
my destiny, "Paul says very seriously.

"Will I be rich, then I'll take the old Paul to me.

He has his back to me this morning shown and I know what I do. If
I were only free again, "says the sugar Hannes.

"Now that so great things in the works, it does not surprise me anymore, that you are with the Paul and
whisper to the Sephardim so very much secrecy in the night had, "says the mechanic apprentice
Hannes on sugar.

At this moment, outside in the corridor approaching the steps of a man, the Keychain rattled, the door
opens and the jailer is on the threshold:

"Sugar Hannes, you picks and come with me!"

"Do the two captive friends, who fought the day before the teeth in the neck, celebrated the
Day of Atonement, he "asks the Spaniol.

"If one has the" swan neck "caught again? He who is nice to you despite
your blown Caution?

"Grinning monkey face.

"Why not bring the Jews as two hundred pounds of garlic, he smells it bearable!" mocks the one-eyed.

The
jailer gives short answers, the sugar Hannes creates shoes and Wammes,
mirrored in the bare studs west of the room commander, travels to
the "Public Chamber" the apprentice mechanic a few times by the hair
and then trots beside the jailer continued with a beating heart.

Sly smiles of Paul, mocking the Spaniol, both look at each other and then laugh out loud.

Interrogation has passed the sugar Hannes enough.

For hours before a document tables are to answer a lot of questions,
which the innocence Outraged despair, the guilt and do often confuse
both, loved, hated or unknown Witnesses to be made about many moons
as a prisoner all the hardships, all the agony of uncertainty, all
the disadvantages of time to be exposed - these are things that everyone,
also meet the innocent can never be paid and for the most part not
be removed, any more than the pain of an examining magistrate, who
very often weekly must scramble around for several hours with stupid
or bad people, in which lies and deny Rudeness and insolence maintain
commonly to be the fifth juice of their virtues.

Before the door of the office, our hero draws few more times breath
a deep sigh, then He follows the notifying companion.

The hearing judge, a good, kenntnißreicher Lord, the ordinary prisoners never coarse treated uselessly
tormented, her case moved to convenient length, and even regretted that the Hannes was decided
for the sugar slowly, is now at the fatal tables, look But the newcomer
far friendlier than usual and receive calls immediately:

"Hans, you
are free!"

Free - this little word shall Hans like a thunderclap, the storm clouds
powerful and flash-divided into the sun can be in the sweet spring
landscape of his home.

Free - He may not believe it, the officials stared silently with his mouth half open and drives
hand across his forehead to make sure of being mocked by any dream.

The knowledge of the Court will read to him, the officer speaks some kind words Admonition and
make a redundant gesture, Hans is with emotion not able to talk and while he follows the jailer
out again, falling tears of joy his faded cheeks.

"Did you leave something in the arrest?"

"No!"

"Well, we do not return there; comes, I will open the gate, then you leave, wherever you want! "

Hans
would like to have taken leave of their fellow prisoners, but he had not the courage to these Wish
to express, he had no money with him in prison and a lack of money often worse as in freedom.

We
want to say anything further than that whatever the Hofpont of Augustus
in the pagan Rome sung by the power of wealth, until the hour in the
prison was valid.

A great poet of antiquity, called the money, the basest of all inventions,
the largest German poet, Goethe, namely, claims that a healthy person
without money is semi-ill and how both poets are right, the everyday
experience teaches us well enough.

Our hero was crying tears of joy at his release.

If it had been granted him a to take a look into his future, he would be tears of sorrow, grief and
anguish shed have.

Already on the way to the court of his old master, his joy through
the perception reduced that no one part is the same.

He had all the people who met him at the Neck covered and the same may say that he was indeed
a poor wretch, and miserable cripple, now but yet again a free man and for that reason happier.
The people were indifferent past him in the eyes of some acquaintances, he read the old contempt
Several talked While at it, but their questions and speeches seemed
calculated only to have him wounded and to offend.

They questioned his innocence, and wondered, "why he this time the penitentiary had escaped!
"anger and upset he left the inn, in which He drank a glass of hurried,
behind the walls of the little town between the gardens the roads
to which led him to the court of the moss farmers thought on the way
to a lot, what he had heard from his fellow prisoners, sometimes clenching
his fists and then laughed again to himself.

A loud whinny startled him out of the storm of thought, he turns his
head and sees on a related mowed the clover field Lieblingsgaul his
Blaze, who him with shining Eyes and ears pricked zuwiehert and makes
a gesture as if he go to meet the coming may.

Bless the view to hasten the same, address him caressing, kissing and caressing Hannah is
the sugar the work of a moment.

While he streches the horse on the flat of his hand a piece Gefängnißbrod, is the foreman, of
Bläsi up with the sense that field moves, his face folds in mocking
and asks sardonically:

"Ho, ho, are there again?

It was believed no human being, because each thinks that you had stolen the Clock! ... I mean
it, but you're a smart guy, you's deep me, so tappig stupid and you look like! ... Have become
very grand in the hole, eh? ...["]

The sugar Hannes biting anger and pain, put the Blaze a blow that this frightened ascends, turns around
and goes, without having answered the Bläsi a syllable.

"Zuckerhannesle s'pressirt not so, I must tell you something!" exclaims the servant after him.

He
does not hear it.

"The Moose needs you no more, he has posted on Georgentag someone else! ... Just go and see
if you do not have to tie up the bundle, "shouted the mischievous and goes back to the mowing,
while he hums of bank Erten, master thieves and honest servants that this would have to live
under one roof.

In place of Hans Mooshof not hold the marriage at home, the maids are more friendly than the
crude Bläsi and look forward to his return.

He goes up into the attic, opened his box, take a ten-fold overwrapped
of canvas Wallets out, is one of the money and after a few minutes
he is on the way back to Amtsstädtlein and prison.

Here he gives most savings Pfenninger greatly astonished the ushers and asks same, they einzuhändigen
the Sephardim.

"This will give me the money?" asks the jailer, shaking his head.

"Yes, be so good as it does the sooner the better, I'm guilty of the Sephardim the money! ...
God forbid! "Says Hannes sugar and hurries out of the half-open gate.

'Tis still me because all dizzy! ... I mean, I would place on withering of the Seees on firm ground!
... The pain makes the moon a long time sitting and his eyes tell me also, "he mutters and turns
in the lane that leads behind the wall.

# OF SUGAR AND HANNES went forth LOSE YOURSELF #

Full moon and clear
the disc floats at the summer night sky and pulls a shiny silver bridge
on the submarine.

Hot and humid was the day that all the cool says that the evening brought, and while the boys
of the village are joking and laughing in wheel or arm in arm, singing through the streets, the
older people sit with weary limbs and quiet Heart usually still on the bench in front of their
homes in the confidential talks.

Before the last and alone standing house, its white walls of the bower friendly an old vine
sticking out that sends its tendrils down to the lower roof, sitting all alone a female, and
supports the burned arms on the back of a so-called grandfather's
chair, which seems the usual place behind the stove in the room had
been torn from the outside and move to a more comfortable person a
comfortable Seat prepare.

The owner looked thoughtfully into the lake, the basic uniform waves
to the sandy shore suggest, neither the songs of the villagers, even
the happy croaking of the green hops in the left there from the last
rain puddles or a hundred voices chirping of crickets disturb their
thinking and approach steps, moves only when they meet up and looks
to come.

"He's not - that can be stolen if he fails today!" mutters the deluded
sometimes angry and falls back to the previous situation negligent.

The woman has little delicate, fine, essential in itself, as tea-loving poet, the figure is rough
and burly and not ugly, but sun-burned and elderly face already warned by a certain, indescribable
train of austerity and Melancholy of an old maid.

We have in fact such before us, namely the Emmerence whose lives up
to the thirtieth Years is very monotonous and designed for only one
half years it has become richer.

The daughter of an anemic fisherman who sent away his numerous children at an early stage, to earn
the bread with strangers, the Emmerence lived on the ninth year to
the twentieth in different farms of the neighborhood and if they fine
Manir and education also learned little, but they enjoyed the reputation
of a hardworking, honest and respectable Maid.

This is not undeserved reputation they owed to it first, that the old Ursula they ate.

This was a childless, in their blood relatives rather nebulous reasons, anger Hostility living widow,
suffered much from pain in the limbs had several years of the house
and finally confined to bed resistance.

The people did not talk of the strange, inhuman and quarrelsome Ursula
too much good and some not, it could almost look at how Emmerence
with such "Erzripp" endure for years and making them more services
than the best daughter in virtue, Any one else had received during
the first quarter of enough.

This was but for the elderly, they cared for ten years beaten, inherited
from a half years, the little house together with accessories Ursula,
is now sitting on its own soil in a comfortable armchair and adapts
not only to one but to two, one of which her as soon as possible to
give his name.

From the marriage they had never been an enemy, but in the years of poverty, they did not want hereinheirathen
recklessly into poverty as long as Ursula, lived her this was more
than creating half a dozen men and entleidete her in many ways every
acquaintance.

Now she is dead, since Easter smiles and the red schwänzelt Fritz the Emmerence around on the
last Sunday he has given her a formal proposal of marriage, wants
a maximum after of the crop as landlord and move into the little house
like the whole of the Emmerence not half bad.

Fritz has not some beautiful lands and money outstanding on interest rates? Is not he a handsome,
big boy and still has the red mustache of the "Atollerie" come from?

Did his family mean nothing in the village, but because of his father own brother in the municipal
council sits and married the daughter of the widowed mother, sister
Accisor has?

Does he not the peasant sector of the foundation, he does not work like a horse and could easily
get one, which just like the old stories about Emmerence and known
Hinwegsähe error of the wedding?

In the best calls was not Fritz, is in dealing with the fairer half of the human Sex never have
been picky or conscientious, but in recent times can be nothing to get him and that he is a
skinflint and zornmüthiger guy, like the thrifty and was not afraid
of equanimity heiress Ursula.

She would have given her consent at once, if only the other not a kind of privilege they would
have had on what she loved even last spring, almost orderly, even now still hates the old woman
and her dying, not as a bridegroom, but as members of the household enormous recommended.

This occurs in the other moments around the corner a long more advisable guy whose not evil face
by a superfluous Halszierde is disgusting and disfigured with the
one The foot is really something wrong.

We recognize in him the great drops of sweat with the broad, overworked hands from his face
and slowly wiped the somewhat silly and embarrassed looking Emmerence approaches, sugar Hannes.

"What
you so long time? Will quite distinguished, Hans!"

"Hoh, - one addressed
the pants - the eagle with the Wirth pressirt Heuheimthun, so even
I have the last car out fully for today in the barn! ... Do let me
say that I Important to hear am, Wherefore hergeeilt with all their
strength and now for a moment there! "

"However, I have to make important
to you, 'Tis good that you are here, because even have we both come
to terms! ... You last winter the Ursula saved his life when during
my absence in the room got on fire and she was already choking on,
have her and done to me long all that deterred us in the eyes "! -

"Oh,
I would be for you - have gone their way through the hellish fire
... There are little things! what I did and have done it gladly! "

"The
Ursula gave it to me a thousand times tied to the soul, and never
leave you all with to divide you, because you're so very poor and
abandoned youth. I want to keep your word! "-

A train full of surprise
and joy on the face of the sugar draws Hannes, he has almost back
to the breath, to lose no word of Emmerence.

"I've always had like,
John, have probably noticed it and I know you also tell me not despise!
"

"Despise? What are you thinking! ... Have I someone in the world
but you? ... Oh, if you knew how - "

"Yes, I know it well, and much
what you said a Sterbenswörtlein!" [I!] ... If you were not so young,
and citizens would be here, who knows what would happen then! ...
I can not remain single much longer! "

The sugar Hannes shrinks along
the Emmerence visible, staring with wide eyes motionless at.

"Yes,
that's it, Hans, I now have a cottage, two fine cows, a herb garden,
the Meadow there and more of the best lands of the ban. I can not
stay alone, foreign My people embezzle all that you are completely
honest, therefore I ask you, do you want to Michaeli the eagle and
my left - to be servant "?

"Your servant?" drive on the sugar Hannes,
but as if he betrayed him, he lowered his eyes and asks: "How do you
understand that?"

"Well, I'll give you as much or even more pay than
the eagle Wirth, sometimes with me and all Everything will be fine!
"

"I have a beat, the fact remains, her hand Emmerence!" Hannah calls
the sugar with a joyful haste, as if a fortune, from which he has
long dreamed of secretly meeting suddenly close distances.

Ah, the intemperate shapes and unities that float in morsels above the peopled precipices!
When two overlords, jewel-set with glittering General Staffs, proclaim at the same time on
either side of their throbbing mobilized frontiers, "We will save our country!" there is one
immensity deceived and two victimized.  There are two deceived immensities!

There is nothing else.  That these cries can be uttered together in the face of heaven, in
the face of truth, proves at a stroke the monstrosity of the laws which rule us, and the madness
of the gods.

I turn on a bed of pain to escape from the horrible vision of masquerade, from the fantastic
absurdity into which all these things are brought back; and my fever seeks again.

Those bright spells which blind, and the darkness which also blinds. Falsehood rules with those
who rule, effacing Resemblance everywhere, and everywhere creating Difference.

Nowhere can one turn aside from falsehood.  Where indeed is there none? The linked-up lies,
the invisible chain, the Chain!

Murmurs and shouts alike cross in confusion.  Here and yonder, to right and to left, they make
pretense.  Truth never reaches as far as men. News filters through, false or atrophied.  On
this side--all is beautiful and disinterested; yonder--the same things are infamous. "French
militarism is not the same thing as Prussian militarism, since one's French and the other's
Prussian."  The newspapers, the somber host of the great prevailing newspapers, fall upon the
minds of men and wrap them up.  The daily siftings link them together and chain them up, and
forbid them to look ahead.  And the impecunious papers show blanks in the places where the
truth was too clearly written.  At the end of a war, the last things to be known by the children
of the slain and by the mutilated and worn-out survivors will be all the war-aims of its directors.

Suddenly they reveal to the people an accomplished fact which has been worked out in the terra
incognita of courts, and they say, "Now that it is too late, only one resource is left you--Kill
that you be not killed."

They brandish the superficial incident which in the last hour has caused the armaments and
the heaped-up resentment and intrigues to overflow in war; and they say, "That is the only
cause of the war."  It is not true; the only cause of war is the slavery of those whose flesh
wages it.

They say to the people, "When once victory is gained, agreeably to your masters, all tyranny
will have disappeared as if by magic, and there will be peace on earth."  It is not true. 
There will be no peace on earth until the reign of men is come.

But will it ever come?  Will it have time to come, while hollow-eyed humanity makes such haste
to die?  For all this advertisement of war, radiant in the sunshine, all these temporary and
mendacious reasons, stupidly or skillfully curtailed, of which not one reaches the lofty elevation
of the common welfare--all these insufficient pretexts suffice in sum to make the artless man
bow in bestial ignorance, to adorn him with iron and forge him at will.

"It is not on Reason," cried the specter of the battlefield, whose torturing spirit was breaking
away from his still gilded body; "it is not on Reason that the Bible of History stands.  Else
are the law of majesties and the ancient quarrel of the flags essentially supernatural and
intangible, or the old world is built on principles of insanity."

He touches me with his strong hand and I try to shake myself, and I stumble curiously, although
lying down.  A clamor booms in my temples and then thunders like the guns in my ears; it overflows
me,--I drown in that cry----

"It must be!  It has to be!  You shall not know!"  That is the war-cry, that is the cry of war.

*        *        *        *        *        *

War will come again after this one.  It will come again as long as it can be determined by
people other than those who fight.  The same causes will produce the same effects, and the
living will have to give up all hope.

We cannot say out of what historical conjunctions the final tempests will issue, nor by what
fancy names the interchangeable ideals imposed on men will be known in that moment.  But the
cause--that will perhaps everywhere be fear of the nations' real freedom.  What we do know
is that the tempests will come.

Armaments will increase every year amid dizzy enthusiasm.  The relentless torture of precision
seizes me.  We do three years of military training; our children will do five, they will do
ten.  We pay two thousand million francs a year in preparation for war; we shall pay twenty,
we shall pay fifty thousand millions.  All that we have will be taken; it will be robbery,
insolvency, bankruptcy.  War kills wealth as it does men; it goes away in ruins and smoke,
and one cannot fabricate gold any more than soldiers.  We no longer know how to count; we no
longer know anything.  A billion--a million millions--the word appears to me printed on the
emptiness of things.  It sprang yesterday out of war, and I shrink in dismay from the new,
incomprehensible word.

There will be nothing else on the earth but preparation for war.  All living forces will be
absorbed by it; it will monopolize all discovery, all science, all imagination.  Supremacy
in the air alone, the regular levies for the control of space, will suffice to squander a nation's
fortune.  For aerial navigation, at its birth in the middle of envious circles, has become
a rich prize which everybody desires, a prey they have immeasurably torn in pieces.

Other expenditure will dry up before that on destruction does, and other longings as well,
and all the reasons for living.  Such will be the sense of humanity's last age.

*        *        *        *        *        *

The battlefields were prepared long ago.  They cover entire provinces with one black city,
with a great metallic reservoir of factories, where iron floors and furnaces tremble, bordered
by a land of forests whose trees are steel, and of wells where sleeps the sharp blackness of
snares; a country navigated by frantic groups of railway trains in parallel formation, and
heavy as attacking columns.  At whatever point you may be on the plain, even if you turn away,
even if you take flight, the bright tentacles of the rails diverge and shine, and cloudy sheaves
of wires rise into the air.  Upon that territory of execution there rises and falls and writhes
machinery so complex that it has not even names, so vast that it has not even shape; for aloft--above
the booming whirlwinds which are linked from east to west in the glow of molten metal whose
flashes are great as those of lighthouses, or in the pallor of scattered electric constellations--hardly
can one make out the artificial outline of a mountain range, clapped upon space.

This immense city of immense low buildings, rectangular and dark, is not a city.  They are
assaulting tanks, which a feeble internal gesture sets in motion, ready for the rolling rush
of their gigantic knee-caps. These endless cannon, thrust into pits which search into the fiery
entrails of the earth, and stand there upright, hardly leaning so much as Pisa's tower; and
these slanting tubes, long as factory chimneys, so long that perspective distorts their lines
and sometimes splays them like the trumpets of Apocalypse--these are not cannon; they are machine-guns,
fed by continuous ribbons of trains which scoop out in entire regions--and upon a country,
if need be--mountains of profundity.

In war, which was once like the open country and is now wholly like towns--and even like one
immense building--one hardly sees the men.  On the round-ways and the casemates, the footbridges
and the movable platforms, among the labyrinth of concrete caves, above the regiment echelonned
downwards in the gulf and enormously upright,--one sees a haggard herd of wan and stooping
men, men black and trickling, men issuing from the peaty turf of night, men who came there
to save their country.  They earthed themselves up in some zone of the vertical gorges, and
one sees them, in this more accursed corner than those where the hurricane reels.  One senses
this human material, in the cavities of those smooth grottoes, like Dante's guilty shades.
Infernal glimmers disclose ranged lines of them, as long as roads, slender and trembling spaces
of night, which daylight and even sunshine leave befouled with darkness and cyclopean dirt.
Solid clouds overhang them and hatchet-charged hurricanes, and leaping flashes set fire every
second to the sky's iron-mines up above the damned whose pale faces change not under the ashes
of death.  They wait, intent on the solemnity and the significance of that vast and heavy booming
against which they are for the moment imprisoned.  They will be down forever around the spot
where they are.  Like others before them, they will be shrouded in perfect oblivion.  Their
cries will rise above the earth no more than their lips.  Their glory will not quit their poor
bodies.

I am borne away in one of the aeroplanes whose multitude darkens the light of day as flights
of arrows do in children's story-books, forming a vaulted army.  They are a fleet which can
disembark a million men and their supplies anywhere at any moment.  It is only a few years
since we heard the puling cry of the first aeroplanes, and now their voice drowns all others.
Their development has only normally proceeded, yet they alone suffice to make the territorial
safeguards demanded by the deranged of former generations appear at last to all people as comical
jests.  Swept along by the engine's formidable weight, a thousand times more powerful than
it is heavy, tossing in space and filling my fibers with its roar, I see the dwindling mounds
where the huge tubes stick up like swarming pins.  I am carried along at a height of two thousand
yards.  An air-pocket has seized me in a corridor of cloud, and I have fallen like a stone
a thousand yards lower, garrotted by furious air which is cold as a blade, and filled by a
plunging cry.  I have seen conflagrations and the explosions of mines, and plumes of smoke
which flow disordered and spin out in long black zigzags like the locks of the God of War!
I have seen the concentric circles by which the stippled multitude is ever renewed.  The dugouts,
lined with lifts, descend in oblique parallels into the depths.  One frightful night I saw
the enemy flood it all with an inexhaustible torrent of liquid fire.  I had a vision of that
black and rocky valley filled to the brim with the lava-stream which dazzled the sight and
sent a dreadful terrestrial dawn into the whole of night.  With its heart aflame Earth seemed
to become transparent as glass along that crevasse; and amid the lake of fire heaps of living
beings floated on some raft, and writhed like the spirits of damnation.  The other men fled
upwards, and piled themselves in clusters on the straight-lined borders of the valley of filth
and tears.  I saw those swarming shadows huddled on the upper brink of the long armored chasms
which the explosions set trembling like steamships.

All chemistry makes flaming fireworks in the sky or spreads in sheets of poison exactly as
huge as the huge towns.  Against them no wall avails, no secret armor; and murder enters as
invisibly as death itself.  Industry multiplies its magic.  Electricity lets loose its lightnings
and thunders--and that miraculous mastery which hurls power like a projectile.

Who can say if this enormous might of electricity alone will not change the face of war?--the
centralized cluster of waves, the irresistible orbs going infinitely forth to fire and destroy
all explosives, lifting the rooted armor of the earth, choking the subterranean gulfs with
heaps of calcined men--who will be burned up like barren coal,--and maybe even arousing the
earthquakes, and tearing the central fires from earth's depths like ore!

That will be seen by people who are alive to-day; and yet that vision of the future so near
at hand is only a slight magnification, flitting through the brain.  It terrifies one to think
for how short a time science has been methodical and of useful industry; and after all, is
there anything on earth more marvelously easy than destruction?  Who knows the new mediums
it has laid in store?  Who knows the limit of cruelty to which the art of poisoning may go?
Who knows if they will not subject and impress epidemic disease as they do the living armies--or
that it will not emerge, meticulous, invincible, from the armies of the dead?  Who knows by
what dread means they will sink in oblivion this war, which only struck to the ground twenty
thousand men a day, which has invented guns of only seventy-five miles' range, bombs of only
one ton's weight, aeroplanes of only a hundred and fifty miles an hour, tanks, and submarines
which cross the Atlantic?  Their costs have not yet reached in any country the sum total of
private fortunes.

But the upheavals we catch sight of, though we can only and hardly indicate them in figures,
will be too much for life.  The desperate and furious disappearance of soldiers will have a
limit.  We may no longer be able to count; but Fate will count.  Some day the men will be killed,
and the women and children.  And they also will disappear--they who stand erect upon the ignominious
death of the soldiers,--they will disappear along with the huge and palpitating pedestal in
which they were rooted.  But they profit by the present, they believe it will last as long
as they, and as they follow each other they say, "After us, the deluge."  Some day all war
will cease for want of fighters.

The spectacle of to-morrow is one of agony.  Wise men make laughable efforts to determine what
may be, in the ages to come, the cause of the inhabited world's end.  Will it be a comet, the
rarefaction of water, or the extinction of the sun, that will destroy mankind?  They have forgotten
the likeliest and nearest cause--Suicide.

They who say, "There will always be war," do not know what they are saying.  They are preyed
upon by the common internal malady of shortsight.  They think themselves full of common-sense
as they think themselves full of honesty.  In reality, they are revealing the clumsy and limited
mentality of the assassins themselves.

The shapeless struggle of the elements will begin again on the seared earth when men have slain
themselves because they were slaves, because they believed the same things, because they were
alike.

I utter a cry of despair and it seems as if I had turned over and stifled it in a pillow.

*        *        *        *        *        *

All is madness.  And there is no one who will dare to rise and say that all is not madness,
and that the future does not so appear--as fatal and unchangeable as a memory.

But how many men will there be who will dare, in face of the universal deluge which will be
at the end as it was in the beginning, to get up and cry "No!" who will pronounce the terrible
and irrefutable issue:--

"No!  The interests of the people and the interests of all their present overlords are not
the same.  Upon the world's antiquity there are two enemy races--the great and the little.
The allies of the great are, in spite of appearances, the great.  The allies of the people
are the people.  Here on earth there is one tribe only of parasites and ringleaders who are
the victors, and one people only who are the vanquished."

But, as in those earliest ages, will not thoughtful faces arise out of the darkness?  (For
this is Chaos and the animal Kingdom; and Reason being no more, she has yet to be born.)

"You must think; but with your own ideas, not other people's."

That lowly saying, a straw whirling in the measureless hand-to-hand struggle of the armies,
shines in my soul above all others.  To think is to hold that the masses have so far wrought
too much evil without wishing it, and that the ancient authorities, everywhere clinging fast,
violate humanity and separate the inseparable.

There have been those who magnificently dared.  There have been bearers of the truth, men who
groped in the world's tumult, trying to make plain order of it.  They discover what we did
not yet know; chiefly they discover what we no longer knew.

But what a panic is here, among the powerful and the powers that be!

"Truth is revolutionary!  Get you gone, truth-bearers!  Away with you, reformers!  You bring
in the reign of men!"

That cry was thrown into my ears one tortured night, like a whisper from deeps below, when
he of the broken wings was dying, when he struggled tumultuously against the opening of men's
eyes; but I had always heard it round about me, always.

In official speeches, sometimes, at moments of great public flattery, they speak like the reformers,
but that is only the diplomacy which aims at felling them better.  They force the light-bearers
to hide themselves and their torches.  These dreamers, these visionaries, these star-gazers,--they
are hooted and derided.  Laughter is let loose around them, machine-made laughter, quarrelsome
and beastly:--

"Your notion of peace is only utopian, anyway, as long as you never, any day, stopped the war
by yourself!"

They point to the battlefield and its wreckage:--

"And you say that War won't be forever?  Look, driveler!"

The circle of the setting sun is crimsoning the mingled horizon of humanity:--

"You say that the sun is bigger than the earth?  Look, imbecile!"

They are anathema, they are sacrilegious, they are excommunicated, who impeach the magic of
the past and the poison of tradition.  And the thousand million victims themselves scoff at
and strike those who rebel, as soon as they are able.  All cast stones at them, all, even those
who suffer and while they are suffering--even the sacrificed, a little before they die.

The bleeding soldiers of Wagram cry:  "Long live the emperor!"  And the mournful exploited
in the streets cheer for the defeat of those who are trying to alleviate a suffering which
is brother to theirs.  Others, prostrate in resignation, look on, and echo what is said above
them: "After us the deluge," and the saying passes across town and country in one enormous
and fantastic breath, for they are innumerable who murmur it.  Ah, it was well said:

"I have confidence in the abyss of the people."

*        *        *        *        *        *

And I?

I, the normal man?  What have I done on earth?  I have bent the knee to the forces which glitter,
without seeking to know whence they came and whither they guide.  How have the eyes availed
me that I had to see with, the intelligence that I had to judge with?

Borne down by shame, I sobbed, "I don't know," and I cried out so loudly that it seemed to
me I was awaking for a moment out of slumber. Hands are holding and calming me; they draw my
shroud about me and enclose me.

It seems to me that a shape has leaned over me, quite near, so near; that a loving voice has
said something to me; and then it seems to me that I have listened to fond accents whose caress
came from a great way off:

"Why shouldn't you be one of them, my lad,--one of those great prophets?"

I don't understand.  I?  How could I be?

All my thoughts go blurred.  I am falling again.  But I bear away in my eyes the picture of
an iron bed where lay a rigid shape.  Around it other forms were drooping, and one stood and
officiated.  But the curtain of that vision is drawn.  A great plain opens the room, which
had closed for a moment on me, and obliterates it.

Which way may I look?  God?  "Miserere----"  The vibrating fragment of the Litany has reminded
me of God.

*        *        *        *        *        *

I had seen Jesus Christ on the margin of the lake.  He came like an ordinary man along the
path.  There is no halo round his head.  He is only disclosed by his pallor and his gentleness.
Planes of light draw near and mass themselves and fade away around him.  He shines in the sky,
as he shone on the water.  As they have told of him, his beard and hair are the color of wine.
He looks upon the immense stain made by Christians on the world, a stain confused and dark,
whose edge alone, down on His bare feet, has human shape and crimson color.  In the middle
of it are anthems and burnt sacrifices, files of hooded cloaks, and of torturers, armed with
battle-axes, halberds and bayonets; and among long clouds and thickets of armies, the opposing
clash of two crosses which have not quite the same shape.  Close to him, too, on a canvas wall,
again I see the cross that bleeds.  There are populations, too, tearing themselves in twain
that they may tear themselves the better; there is the ceremonious alliance, "turning the needy
out of the way," of those who wear three crowns and those who wear one; and, whispering in
the ear of Kings, there are gray-haired Eminences, and cunning monks, whose hue is of darkness.

I saw the man of light and simplicity bow his head; and I feel his wonderful voice saying:

"I did not deserve the evil they have done unto me."

Robbed reformer, he is a witness of his name's ferocious glory.  The greed-impassioned money-changers
have long since chased Him from the temple in their turn, and put the priests in his place.
He is crucified on every crucifix.

Yonder among the fields are churches, demolished by war; and already men are coming with mattock
and masonry to raise the walls again.  The ray of his outstretched arm shines in space, and
his clear voice says:

"Build not the churches again.  They are not what you think they were. Build them not again."

*        *        *        *        *        *

There is no remedy but in them whom peace sentences to hard labor, and whom war sentences to
death.  There is no redress except among the poor.

*        *        *        *        *        *

White shapes seem to return into the white room.  Truth is simple. They who say that truth
is complicated deceive themselves, and the truth is not in them.  I see again, not far from
me, a bed, a child, a girl-child, who is asleep in our house; her eyes are only two lines.
Into our house, after a very long time, we have led my old aunt.  She approves affectionately,
but all the same she said, very quietly, as she left the perfection of our room, "It was better
in my time."  I am thrilled by one of our windows, whose wings are opened wide upon the darkness;
the appeal which the chasm of that window makes across the distances enters into me.  One night,
as it seems to me, it was open to its heart.

I--my heart--a gaping heart, enthroned in a radiance of blood.  It is mine, it is ours.  The
heart--that wound which we have.  I have compassion on myself.

I see again the rainy shore that I saw before time was, before earth's drama was unfolded;
and the woman on the sands.  She moans and weeps, among the pictures which the clouds of mortality
offer and withdraw, amid that which weaves the rain.  She speaks so low that I feel it is to
me she speaks.  She is one with me.  Love--it comes back to me. Love is an unhappy man and
unhappy woman.

I awake--uttering the feeble cry of the babe new-born.

All grows pale, and paler.  The whiteness I foresaw through the whirlwinds and clamors--it
is here.  An odor of ether recalls to me the memory of an awful memory, but shapeless.  A white
room, white walls, and white-robed women who bend over me.

In a voice confused and hesitant, I say:

"I've had a dream, an absurd dream."

My hand goes to my eyes to drive it away.

"You struggled while you were delirious--especially when you thought you were falling," says
a calm voice to me, a sedate and familiar voice, which knows me without my knowing the voice.

"Yes," I say!

CHAPTER XVII

MORNING

I went to sleep in Chaos, and then I awoke like the first man.

I am in a bed, in a room.  There is no noise--a tragedy of calm, and horizons close and massive.
The bed which imprisons me is one of a row that I can see, opposite another row.  A long floor
goes in stripes as far as the distant door.  There are tall windows, and daylight wrapped in
linen.  That is all which exists.  I have always been here, I shall end here.

Women, white and stealthy, have spoken to me.  I picked up the new sound, and then lost it.
A man all in white has sat by me, looked at me, and touched me.  His eyes shone strangely,
because of his glasses.

I sleep, and then they make me drink.

The long afternoon goes by in the long corridor.  In the evening they make light; at night,
they put it out, and the lamps--which are in rows, like the beds, like the windows, like everything--disappear. 

"Oh dear ... o Marie, you Längstverfaulte! ... Ah, well! ... I was born in acacia! ... And
the Tyrolean! ... No, the man loves only once right, then he has no heart this! ... Whenever I
think back to the Moors to Jägerndorf, the tears flow in streams about my old cheeks! ... Oh,
all I knew and loved are dead, all new faces, new facilities! ... For me the world is a graveyard and
what should I in this cemetery for 20 years and more to do? ... Life is just beautiful in youth,
later, one of the Death of love, death can not would be the hardest of all penalties! ... Have
another drop Wine, Mauschel? ... Not? oh dear, "groaned the old man," your story is not without
interest the best is the fact that it is not fictional, "says the Spaniol and sets in:" What you
told of the time you return from France, is on the whole a common Prison history, how can we
hear from many recidivist "

"Today there but no real prison stories anymore!" shouts the Stoffel. "What the Paul of the
old prisons told, I have seen a large extent not only with; but participated. In my younger
years I was not one of the last, but now I am glad that the gentlemen in Carlsruhe, officials
and masters in the prisons throughout are different and better. Food and bread is good, the humane
treatment and holds a more from stealing from, because all the severity and cruelty! "

"You but it has never been held by the prison!" laughs the Indians.

"Wherefore?" I had to live, then I would not "rape." I am poor, without homes and Friends understand
that no trade can not work hard because I was still a fool if I would rather not go to prison
than outside lug around me tired and hungry from Each view would be wrong and contemptible!
Go into the prisons and Wen find you regulars among the? Geese and impoverished boys without fathers,
orphaned children, short people, who were persecuted by fate! Times are bad, sometimes it is better
in the penitentiary than outside, "instructs the Stoffel.

"Oho, oho! They do not wish to soon build the Zellengefängniß in Bruchsal? Agreement can not
be there do with each, which the officials or supervisors popular? Is it not in the newspapers,
The prisoners would all be fools or suicides?

If you have not already resident cells found in other countries, which have been forgotten,
alive in the arms and Anfraßen legs and died from starvation? He?
"Shouted the Indians.

"Ugh, that's awful - awful - dead as dear in the cell -! Man, the new cage burn in Bruchsal, before
it is built, "the prisoners call the chorus.

"Oh, the thing is not half so bad, I know this is her from France
and Switzerland!" says the Spaniol.

"Although no torture cells of prisons and torture chambers of caves,
but brainwashing institutions in which man is infected with religion,
a small setback, which we Prussia Baden and to enable the army of
the great future!

"

"What do you mean by the army of the great future? He?"

Hannah asks the sugar.

"Mon Dieu, you fool even belong to!"

"Me?"

"Yes you did!"

Put "it explained to the Simple again, 'Tis a guy, you push in the lock walls could, without
his brain would be damaged, "laughs the Indians.

"Oh, I'm not half as stupid as I look! ... You can make an already clever! ... Have I yet in these
few weeks of the women, priests, and "large heads" things here one that I want to say out there!
... The one-eyed man is right, the arrest is freedom, long live the arrest, "... calls the dupe.
"Stop right now your Gosche, who will again Spaniol start a speech, he cleared his throat
already and we want to scratch the beat while the Fleas dance and hums the Dormouse the Contrebaß
"laughs the Stoffel.

"Only one word!" asks Paul and says: "The Indian has just spoken to
newspapers, prior to a prison cell made anxious.

["]

It is little to give, because newspapers lie and journalists often see themselves not a measure, if
the language of prisons and smear into the day so that the Sheet
is full.

At any rate, I, the old Paul, known in the penitentiary four that are within hanged a few years,
I myself have hung me, was neither the first nor the last and the fools I've also seen enough among
the convicts. It depends very much on the Treatment on! As for the fool, so I have a gentleman student
in Heidelberg once said, The famous doctor roller have calculated that came to 1,000 people
three fools, the is recognized fools, because if you do, many expected that apply to clever people,
there would be less than 1000 people at least 800 fools! ... That gave me a Heidelberg student said,
and it is so, depending on whether one considers the matter! ... I myself am often a right Been
fool! "

"After 1852 you will be clever, you will soon double the Swabians age!" laughed the Stoffel.

"Prie% Silence, je vous!%" Growls the Spaniol, clears his throat and speaks again with increasing
Excitement.

"You know, brothers, that all men are born equal and that we are in
life everywhere Inequality of possessions, pleasure, work, education,
just to see all things.

Clever fraudsters have the humanity with vain fantasy of God, eternity, retribution and the like
Musings of the moving heart with fear, anxiety, confusion and distress hunted. The strong suppressed
the weaker and took the help of fraudulent priest's permission a sky that never existed deceived,
most of all goods and pleasures of life on earth and it is constantly changing from what acceptirt of
ignorance and death Nothing honorirt. Millions of people's interests are intertwined, the
poor sacrificed the true interest of their apparent that was absolute chaos to order, to the laws. "

"Atomized
million have been cheated out of their happiness, oppressed millions groaning for redemption
from the bonds of superstition and despotism, millions still do not
see where they actually Send the shoe pinches, secretly mocked forever
silent prayers to heaven and kill their most natural, most beautiful
feelings on the altar of the delusion and bondage, which their rule
in an endless Beyond stretched to more than the rule this world certain
to be.

"

"It can be calculated is, brethren, that when Louis Philippe continued rampant, in a few decades
the money supply on the European mainland in usurping his hands would - you know yourself,
that the women live in a kind of slavery with us too, that every
one may take only one wife and hundreds of thousands are not able
to feed a wife or keep her family, then, that they lived happy hours.

Revel and commands is the prerogative of few, starvation and Oppressed
are the lot of the vast majority.

You know also by whom and how the so-called Laws are fashioned and sustained, You all are so
present victim of the same and in this hour sigh hundreds of thousands in prisons, the families
curse their oppressors. "

"These are just some small evidence of the immense sum of misery, which is whether the free-born
and equal human capacity. Tears flowed all together, which only 2,000 years on the wide earth
round of the tortured nature of my aching heart were crying, there
were a Thränenmeer against which the mediterranean, in fact, only
would be a French lake.

"

"Brothers, it will be different and must be different" -

"I opened the annals of mankind, and despite all the distortion of
the same found that a deep, unquenchable desire for happiness through
the earth and Urfreiheit Peoples hearts of all ages and parts of the
world moves, and that this longing in the ongoing struggle against
enslavement and misery drove.

"

"I have visited the civilized nations everywhere and found that the vague yearning the people
become conscious of the actual purpose of earthly life and the right means for Fulfillment
of those purposes will increase. "

"I've also found that lies in the development of the peoples of a
certain regularity and learned from all this, the heartwarming end
circuit, the dawn of the great future had dawned, the many forms of
worship of the people departing the only forms of worship of pure
manhood and the time sharpen the swords of the last terrible war in
which the oppressed destroy subjugate the majority so far triumphant
minority, or will.

"

"For 300 years, the struggle of freedom against the lies of the world history of serious and
more serious. From the flames of the Bastille flashed the first rays of the May morning of humanity
in the present century over. Big results are in the areas of Knowledge and life has been made,
the irony of fate condemned more numerous the conscious enemies of
pure manhood against her will, whether by trembling Yielding and Ansichselbstverzweifeln
or defiant fight on and anxious Verbarrikadiren, to open peoples eyes
and to act in the interests of the great future.

"At the end of this century, the banter since have to open and bloody battle unfold and like
thousand-voiced cannon still in another millennium over booming in the New Year's night of
the year like 2000, the whole moon hill of bones and see bathe his dull image in a sea of ​​blood, what
is this in comparison to the eternal Blessings that the final victory of the infinite humanity,
the countless millions of future will bring?

"How is cheered in the Bible:" Saul has killed thousands, and David his tens of thousands,
so will celebrate our grandchildren in the future millennium: The enemies of humanity have
millions Martyr and fighter of pure manhood slain, the heroes have the same contrast, the old
people in general and strangled possessed the courage destroyed for Skull Mountain Enemies and fallen
brothers raise the flag of the eternal, unconditional, unlimited freedom! All political and
religious factions to work the next major objectives: the permanent Revolution into the hands
of each blind to the feud and the rugged, they are opposite, more
joyful and hopeful, my heart beats!

"

"Let the present rulers and the people just suck abuse, any semblance of Freedom fight hostile
death, increase their Armeeen from year to year, as many Proletarians
stuck in two-tone skirt and look into the fatal Regiererei that Priests
should blare the Te Deum to the pope and speaking the hocus-pocus
about it - in the background the revolution is laughing, waiting silent
and tolerate, but every day it multiplies Army and when the time came,
she unfolds her bloody red giant banners and holding thunder over
all court executioners of the people "! -

"If the farmer only hay
and the worker has to eat only wood shavings and if you the bourgeoisie,
together with their slovenly bookworms belästiget in their doings,
then the first clever, the latter, completely blind, and connect all
three agree as recruits in the ranks of the army of the great future!

"

"This army, brothers, is no illusion, no illusion, the great future has long been their husbands,
Heroes and martyrs - we even belong to all of us sitting there as
we are, soldiers and Veterans of the permanent revolution, as though
your unstudirte people probably have never considered you what's actually
in you.

"

"I, Spaniol wants to tell you, you will never forget it, it is to you encouragingly shall be
fearless, manly deed and your brethren proclaim your it! "

"If we do not get caught - certainly - Wherefore - Because every resident of this house in the suspicion
is to have violated the existing laws in one way or another - anyone who has this Laws finished
commodities? The people around? Jamais%%, only a few dozen Bourgeois, who to pass the time the poor
people to help spread sand in the eyes. Our laws come from violence and fraud - What is their
purpose - the maintenance of grundverderbten existing conditions.

Why are these States grundverderbt - Because they are rooted in the stupidity of the vast majority,
the all-round Suppression of the same plan and a very small minority at the expense of all
Rest, while the sky continued to prepare the earth. "

"Anyone who engages in any way to confuse the social conditions, and seeks to destroy, is an enemy
of the status quo, a revolutionary, in fact, in the Eyes of the beneficiaries of the current mess
of all things, a bad guy, restless Head or a criminal deserving of
punishment, in my eyes and my brothers the other hand, an unconscious
or conscious fighters, martyrs and heroes of the great future that
is not only for themselves, but also for the idea of ​​pure, free,
full manhood, for the human race ever!

"

"If the individual's interests with the interests of all in unison right circumstances, such
as Such in the realm of pure manhood really the case, we knew nothing of Crime, neither common nor political,
you know nothing of princes, soldiers, Policemen, lawyers, laws,
privileges, and prisons and a revolution would be impossible because
no reason for them would be.

"

"Paradise, the golden age, these profound weighing dreams of all religions People would reign
on earth a new earth, and bless another better humanity, which lives
to live and saturated as late as possible, from sweet treats individuals
the sleep of death over there.

"

"You wonder, your amazement, your profound silence is eloquent, but
I speak my full of inner conviction, and so firmly believe in the
great future as an ultra Montaner to the Pope, a bigot to his heavenly
enlightenment, the seeing of colors!

"

"Still exhausted Spaniol The silent and went violently between the furnace and night chair back and again,
the Beifallgeklatsche and the praise of some fellow flattered him
enormously, He felt something of the bliss even granted by the consciousness,
done a good deed have to.

'Tis but a misery when you're as stupid as our one and also did not know what you is in the world
there, "sighs the sugar Hannes.

"Well, Spaniol has held almost every day speech, since he is with us, you could alsgemach him
as well as I understand, if you're not stupid and stupider Roßbube Black Forest wert! "notes Martin,
the locksmith apprentice.

"The Spaniol's just a G'studirter that through all the schools and read all the books , but I,
what am I? Who has let me learn something? You, Martin, did speak well, are a public-son, the
brave parents, looking for a city school, Sunday school, trade school
and God knows what to visit and work with clever people can.

For me this is different, I am in my little life come into the city and also younger than
you, for you have your locksmith indeed have to learn to Easter and will not guilty! "apologized
the sugar Hannes.

"If the Spaniol is no fool (and he is not), then one must baptize him Mounsieur genius! ...
Only a pity that such a man also gets a cough and is bitten by fleas as others! ... He would have
gone away until morning to address his people, because if he once
begins, he no longer listens to and we feel no fleas, bugs or sleep!

"

"My words work wonders, like Orpheus, lyre, make it tame beasts and Balaam's ass talkative, I have
in Algiers, France, Geneva, Lausanne, Biel and experiences here! assured the Spaniol seriously.
"

"Much have I not understood by the speech today, she had me again
too high, but nice has she been, I have to leave our room commander,
"says the old Paul.

"Understood? Not understand? O you stupid goyim! You surely understand very well that Beschummle
no sin is found and unverlorne thing, not a crime? In German: Cheating is a Virtue, and long
fingers are a merit, because man is not only for themselves but also
for humanity cheating and stealing by the fact that honest, grass
roots majority Hurt not and is working for the great future, "informed
of the Jew, Paul.

"There's nothing like a Jew, is the most stupid clever than ten Christians!"
laughs the Spaniol.

"If, in the" great future "must become familiar with each one fun, like one who I belong to the
pure people of the guild Sephardim, body and soul, "the insured Monkey face.

"What is the future of Spaniol or Kuhzunft or reason and law, police
and state budget spoken?

"yawns the sleepy Dormouse. They all laugh out loud, Stoffel will almost To stifle the Indian
border but:

"Spaniol, the Dormouse is a political prisoner, a wonder here, a great army of invalids, spoken of you,
and his question of a new issue is worth, have you no more in the bag?

"Joking aside, Indians, I have forgotten something important.

Should I now or catch up tomorrow? It does not take long! "Can hear the voluble Spaniol.

"Now - En avant%% - - DC - Go ahead! Silence!" cry the prisoner, who clears his throat Spaniol
again and spoke after a moment's reflection:

"Above all, I protest against the fact that our Dormouse something better or worse than we had,
because he is suspected of no common, but a political offense committed
have to.

The realm of pure manhood knows no crime, the reason of pure Manhood makes no essential difference between
ordinary and political criminals. A political criminal engages the head of state or the state
as a whole, the common however, individual members of the state and therefore also the state and both types
of criminals fight for a big deal only in different ways.

"

"What do very many, is considered no longer a crime, is the general custom is custom, Law and because
many have the courage to help destroy political body, however, comparatively little courage
on your own humanity to individual members of the to avenge wrong
state system, can the small differences between political and hold
common criminals only until the many in the few her equal Brothers
recognize and doubling of the weapons in the struggle against the
old state and the old Recognize humanity as a necessity.

So far the state has committed common crimes against individuals
and legality of this procedure baptized in the growth of the revolutionary
movement, the individual common crimes against commit the state, common
criminals in carrying out their deeds, the political color of the
attacked more and more into account. "

"Just because is detected,
the state or the political opponents were in individual their supporters
also attacked a rogue no constitutional liberal bourgeois , Steal
a democratic hijackers, above all the life, limb and property of the
aristocrats damage and with each company more profitable for him at
the same time the aristocratic party to put a beat are looking for!
"

"Such phenomena are the morning rays of the great future!"  It seems to me that I am able to believe
something no longer because they command me to, and I feel myself set free.

I lean on the stones of the low wall, at the spot where I leaned of old, in the time when I
thought I was some one and knew something.

My looks fall on the families and the single figures which are hurrying towards the black hole
of the church porch, towards the gloom of the nave, where one is enlaced in incense, where
wheels of light and angels of color hover under the vaults which contain a little of the great
emptiness of the heavens.

I seem to stoop nearer to those people, and I get glimpses of certain profundities among the
fleeting pictures which my sight lends me.  I seem to have stopped, at random, in front of
the richness of a single being.  I think of the "humble, quiet lives," and it appears to me
within a few words, and that in what they call a "quiet, lowly life," there are immense expectations
and waitings and weariness.

I understand why they want to believe in God, and consequently why they do believe in Him,
since faith comes at will.

I remember, while I lean on this wall and listen, that one day in the past not far from here,
a lowly woman raised her voice and said, "That woman does not believe in God!  It's because
she has no children, or else because they've never been ill."

And I remember, too, without being able to picture them to myself, all the voices I have heard
saying, "It would be too unjust, if there were no God!"

There is no other proof of God's existence than the need we have of Him.  God is not God--He
is the name of all that we lack.  He is our dream, carried to the sky.  God is a prayer, He
is not some one.

They put all His kind actions into the eternal future, they hide them in the unknown.  Their
agonizing dues they drown in distances which outdistance them; they cancel His contradictions
in inaccessible uncertainty.  No matter; they believe in the idol made of a word.

And I?  I have awaked out of religion, since it was a dream.  It had to be that one morning
my eyes would end by opening and seeing nothing more of it.

I do not see God, but I see the church and I see the priests.  Another ceremony is unfolding
just now, in another direction--up at the castle, a Mass of St. Hubert.  Leaning on my elbows
the spectacle absorbs me.

These ministers of the cult, blessing this pack of hounds, these guns and hunting knives, officiating
in lace and pomp side by side with these wealthy people got up as warlike sportsmen, women
and men alike, on the great steps of a castle and facing a crowd kept aloof by ropes,--this
spectacle defines, more glaringly than any words whatever can, the distance which separates
the churches of to-day from Christ's teaching, and points to all the gilded putridity which
has accumulated on those pure defaced beginnings.  And what is here is everywhere; what is
little is great.

The parsons, the powerful--all always joined together.  Ah, certainty is rising to the heart
of my conscience.  Religions destroy themselves spiritually because they are many.  They destroy
whatever leans upon their fables.  But their directors, they who are the strength of the idol,
impose it.  They decree authority; they hide the light.  They are men, defending their interests
as men; they are rulers defending their sway.

It has to be!  You shall not know!  A terrible memory shudders through me; and I catch a confused
glimpse of people who, for the needs of their common cause, uphold, with their promises and
thunder, the mad unhappiness which lies heavy on the multitudes.

*        *        *        *        *        *

Footsteps are climbing towards me.  Marie appears, dressed in gray. She comes to look for me.
In the distance I saw that her cheeks were brightened and rejuvenated by the wind.  Close by
I see that her eyelids are worn, like silk.  She finds me sunk in reflection.  She looks at
me, like a frail and frightened mother; and this solicitude which she brings me is enough by
itself to calm and comfort me.

I point out to her the dressed-up commotion below us, and make some bitter remark on the folly
of these people who vainly gather in the church, and go to pray there, to talk all alone. 
Some of them believe; and the rest say to them, "I do the same as you."

Marie does not argue the basis of religion.  "Ah," she says, "I've never thought clearly about
it, never.  They've always spoken of God to me, and I've always believed in Him.  But--I don't
know.  I only know one thing," she adds, her blue eyes looking at me, "and that is that there
must be delusion.  The people must have religion, so as to put up with the hardships of life,
the sacrifices----"

She goes on again at once, more emphatically, "There must be religion for the unhappy, so that
they won't give way.  It may be foolishness, but if you take that away from them, what have
they left?"

The gentle woman--the normal woman of settled habits--whom I had left here repeats, "There
must be illusion."  She sticks to this idea, she insists, she is taking the side of the unhappy.
Perhaps she talks like that for her own sake, and perhaps only because she is compassionate for me.

I said in vain, "No--there must never be delusion, never fallacies. There should be no more
lies.  We shall not know then where we're going."

She persists and makes signs of dissent.

I say no more, tired.  But I do not lower my gaze before the all-powerful surroundings of circumstance.
My eyes are pitiless, and cannot help descrying the false God and the false priests everywhere.

We go down the footpath and return in silence.  But it seems to me that the rule of evil is
hidden in easy security among the illusions which they heap up over us.  I am nothing; I am
no more than I was before, but I am applying my hunger for the truth.  I tell myself again
that there is no supernatural power, that nothing has fallen from the sky; that everything
is within us and in our hands.  And in the inspiration of that faith my eyes embrace the magnificence
of the empty sky, the abounding desert of the earth, the Paradise of the Possible.

We pass along the base of the church.  Marie says to me--as if nothing had just been said,
"Look how the poor church was damaged by a bomb from an aeroplane--all one side of the steeple
gone.  The good old vicar was quite ill about it.  As soon as he got up he did nothing else
but try to raise money to have his dear steeple built up again; and he got it."

People are revolving round the building and measuring its yawning mutilation with their eyes.
My thoughts turn to all these passers-by and to all those who will pass by, whom I shall not
see, and to other wounded steeples.  The most beautiful of all voices echoes within me, and
I would fain make use of it for this entreaty, "Build not the churches again!  You who will
come after us, you who, in the sharp distinctness of the ended deluge will perhaps be able
to see the order of things more clearly, don't build the churches again!  They did not contain
what we used to believe, and for centuries they have only been the prisons of the saviours,
and monumental lies.  If you are still of the faith have your temples within yourselves.  But
if you again bring stones to build up a narrow and evil tradition, that is the end of all.
In the name of justice, in the name of light, in the name of pity, do not build the churches
again!"

But I did not say anything.  I bow my head and walk more heavily.

I see Madame Marcassin coming out of the church with blinking eyes, weary-looking, a widow
indeed.  I bow and approach her and talk to her a little, humbly, about her husband, since
I was under his orders and saw him die.  She listens to me in dejected inattention.  She is
elsewhere.  She says to me at last, "I had a memorial service since it's usual."  Then she
maintains a silence which means "There's nothing to be said, just as there's nothing to be
done."  In face of that emptiness I understand the crime that Marcassin committed in letting
himself be killed for nothing but the glory of dying.

CHAPTER XIX

GHOSTS

We have gone out together and aimlessly; we walk straight forward.

It is an autumnal day--gray lace of clouds and wind.  Some dried leaves lie on the ground and
others go whirling.  We are in August, but it is an autumn day all the same.  Days do not allow
themselves to be set in strict order, like men.

Our steps take us in the direction of the waterfall and the mill.  We have seldom been there
again since our engagement days.  Marie is covered in a big gray cloak; her hat is black silk
with a little square of color embroidered in front.  She looks tired, and her eyes are red.
When she walks in front of me I see the twisted mass of her beautiful fair hair.

Instinctively we both looked for the inscriptions we cut, once upon a time, on trees and on
stones, in foolish delight.  We sought them like scattered treasure, on the strange cheeks
of the old willows, near the tendrils of the fall, on the birches that stand like candles in
front of the violet thicket, and on the old fir which so often sheltered us with its dark wings.
Many inscriptions have disappeared.  Some are worn away because things do; some are covered
by a host of other inscriptions or they are distorted and ugly.  Nearly all have passed on
as if they had been passers-by.

Marie is tired.  She often sits down, with her big cloak and her sensible air; and as she sits
she seems like a statue of nature, of space, and the wind.

We do not speak.  We have gone down along the side of the river--slowly, as if we were climbing--towards
the stone seat of the wall.  The distances have altered.  This seat, for instance, we meet
it sooner than we thought we should, like some one in the dark; but it is the seat all right.
The rose-tree which grew above it has withered away and become a crown of thorns.

There are dead leaves on the stone slab.  They come from the chestnuts yonder.  They fell on
the ground and yet they have flown away as far as the seat.

On this seat--where she came to me for the first time, which was once so important to us that
it seemed as if the background of things all about us had been created by us--we sit down to-day,
after we have vainly sought in nature the traces of our transit.

The landscape is peaceful, simple, empty; it fills us with a great quivering.  Marie is so
sad and so simple that you can see her thought.

I have leaned forward, my elbows on my knees.  I have contemplated the gravel at my feet; and
suddenly I start, for I understand that my eyes were looking for the marks of our footsteps,
in spite of the stone, in spite of the sand.

After the solemnity of a long silence, Marie's face takes on a look of defeat, and suddenly
she begins to cry.  The tears which fill her--for one always weeps in full, drop on to her
knees.  And through her sobs there fall from her wet lips words almost shapeless, but desperate
and fierce, as a burst of forced laughter.

"It's all over!" she cries.

*        *        *        *        *        *

I have put my arm round her waist, and I am shaken by the sorrow which agitates her chest and
throat, and sometimes shakes her rudely, the sorrow which does not belong to me, which belongs
to no one, and is like a divinity.

She becomes composed.  I take her hand.  In a weak voice she calls some memories up--this and
that--and "one morning----"  She applies herself to it and counts them.  I speak, too, gently.
We question each other. "Do you remember?"--"Oh, yes."  And when some more precise and intimate
detail prompts the question we only reply, "A little."  Our separation and the great happenings
past which the world has whirled have made the past recoil and shaped a deep ditch.  Nothing
has changed; but when we look we see.

Once, after we had recalled to each other an enchanted summer evening, I said, "We loved each
other," and she answered, "I remember."

I call her by her name, in a low voice, so as to draw her out of the dumbness into which she
is falling.

She listens to me, and then says, placidly, despairingly, "'Marie,'--you used to say it like
that.  I can't realize that I had the same name."

A few moments later, as we talked of something else, she said to me at last, "Ah, that day
we had dreams of travel, about our plans--you were there, sitting by my side."

In those former times we lived.  Now we hardly live any more, since we have lived.  They who
we were are dead, for we are here.  Her glances come to me, but they do not join again the
two surviving voids that we are; her look does not wipe out our widowhood, nor change anything.
And I, I am too imbued with clear-sighted simplicity and truth to answer "no" when it is "yes."
In this moment by my side Marie is like me.

The immense mourning of human hearts appears to us.  We dare not name it yet; but we dare not
let it not appear in all that we say.

*        *        *        *        *        *

Then we see a woman, climbing the footpath and coming nearer to us.  It is Marthe, grown up,
full-blown.  She says a few words to us and then goes away, smiling.  She smiles, she who plays
a part in our drama. The likeness which formerly haunted me now haunts Marie, too--both of
us, side by side, and without saying it, harbored the same thought, to see that child growing
up and showing what Marie was.

Marie confesses all, all at once, "I was only my youth and my beauty, like all women.  And
there go my youth and beauty--Marthe!  Then, I----?"  In anguish she goes on, "I'm not old
yet, since I'm only thirty-five, but I've aged very quickly; I've some white hairs that you
can see, close to; I'm wrinkled and my eyes have sunk.  I'm here, in life, to live, to occupy
my time; but I'm nothing more than I am!  Of course, I'm still alive, but the future comes
to an end before life does.  Ah, it's really only youth that has a place in life.  All young
faces are alike and go from one to the other without ever being deceived.  They wipe out and
destroy all the rest, and they make the others see themselves as they are, so that they become
useless."

She is right!  When the young woman stands up she takes, in fact, the other's place in the
ideal and in the human heart, and makes of the other a returning ghost.  It is true.  I knew
it.  Ah, I did not know it was so true!  It is too obvious.  I cannot deny it.  Again a cry
of assent rises to my lips and prevents me from saying, "No."

I cannot turn away from Marthe's advent, nor as I look at her, from recognizing Marie.  I know
she has had several little love-affairs. Just now she is alone.  She is alone, but she will
soon be leaning--yes, phantom or reality, man is not far from her.  It is dazzling.  Most certainly,
I no longer think as I used to do that it is a sort of duty to satisfy the selfish promptings
one has, and I have now got an inward veneration for right-doing; but all the same, if that
being came to me, I know well that I should become, before all, and in spite of all, an immense
cry of delight.

Marie falls back upon her idea, obdurately, and says, "A woman only lives by love and for love.
When she's no longer good for that she's no longer anything."

She repeats, "You see--I'm nothing any more."

Ah, she is at the bottom of her abyss!  She is at the extremity of a woman's mourning!  She
is not thinking only of me.  Her thought is higher and vaster.  She is thinking of all the
woman she is, of all that love is, of all possible things when she says, "I'm no longer anything."
And I--I am only he who is present with her just now, and no help whatever is left her to look
for from any one.

I should like to pacify and console this woman who is gentleness and simplicity and who is
sinking there while she lightly touches me with her presence--but exactly because she is there
I cannot lie to her, I can do nothing against her grief, her perfect, infallible grief.

"Ah!" she cries, "if we came to life again!"

But she, too, has tried to cling to illusion.  I see by the track of her tears, and because
I am looking at her--that she has powdered her face to-day and put rouge on her lips, perhaps
even on her cheeks, as she did in bygone days, laughing, to set herself off, in spite of me.
This woman who tries to keep a good likeness of herself through passing time, to be fixed upon
herself, who paints herself, she is, to that extent like what Rembrandt the profound and Titian
the bold and exquisite did--make enduring, and save!  But this time, a few tears have washed
away the fragile, mortal effort.

She tries also to delude herself with words, and to discover something in them which would
transform her.  She asserts, as she did the other morning, "There must be illusion.  No, we
must not see things as they are."  But I see clearly that such words do not exist.

Once, when she was looking at me distressfully, she murmured, "You--you've no more illusion
at all.  I pity you!"

At that moment, within the space of a flash, she was thinking of me only, and she pities me!
She has found something in her grief to give me.

She is silent.  She is seeking the supreme complaint; she is trying to find what there is which
is more torturing and more simple; and she stammers--"The truth."

The truth is that the love of mankind is a single season among so many others.  The truth is
that we have within us something much more mortal than we are, and that it is this, all the
same, which is all-important. Therefore we survive very much longer than we live.  There are
things we think we know and which yet are secrets.  Do we really know what we believe?  We
believe in miracles.  We make great efforts to struggle, to go mad.  We should like to let
all our good deserts be seen.  We fancy that we are exceptions and that something supernatural
is going to come along.  But the quiet peace of the truth fixes us.  The impossible becomes
again the impossible.  We are as silent as silence itself.

We stayed lonely on the seat until evening.  Our hands and faces shone like gleams of storm
in the entombment of the calm and the mist.

We go back home.  We wait and then have dinner.  We live these few hours.  And we see ourselves
alone in the house, facing each other, as never we saw ourselves, and we do not know what to
do!  It is a real drama of vacancy which is breaking loose.  We are living together; our movements
are in harmony, they touch and mingle.  But all of it is empty.  We do not long for each other,
we can no longer expect each other, we have no dreams, we are not happy.  It is a sort of imitation
of life by phantoms, by beings who, in the distance are beings, but close by--so close--are
phantoms!

Then bedtime comes.  She is sleeping in the little bedroom opposite mine across the landing,
less fine than mine and smaller, hung with an old and faded paper, where the patterned flowers
are only an irregular relief, with traces here and there of powder, of colored dust and ashes.

We are going to separate on the landing.  To-day is not the first time like that! but to-day
we are feeling this great rending which is not one.  She has begun to undress.  She has taken
off her blouse.  I see her neck and her breasts, a little less firm than before, through her
chemise; and half tumbling on to the nape of her neck, the fair hair which once magnificently
flamed on her like a fire of straw.

She only says, "It's better to be a man than a woman."

Then she replies to my silence, "You see, we don't know what to say, now."

In the angle of the narrow doorway she spoke with a kind of immensity.

She goes into her room and disappears.  Before I went to the war we slept in the same bed.
We used to lie down side by side, so as to be annihilated in unconsciousness, or to go and
dream somewhere else. (Commonplace life has shipwrecks worse than in Shakespearean dramas.
For man and wife--to sleep, to die.)  But since I came back we separate ourselves with a wall.
This sincerity that I have brought back in my eyes and mind has changed the semblances round
about me into reality, more than I imagine.  Marie is hiding from me her faded but disregarded
body.  Her modesty has begun again; yes, she has ended by beginning again.

She has shut her door.  She is undressing, alone in her room, slowly, and as if uselessly.
There is only the light of her little lamp to caress her loosened hair, in which the others
cannot yet see the white ones, the frosty hairs that she alone touches.

Her door is shut, decisive, banal, dreary.

Among some papers on my table I see the poem again which we once found out of doors, the bit
of paper escaped from the mysterious hands which wrote on it, and come to the stone seat. 
It ended by whispering, "Only I know the tears that brimming rise, your beauty blended with
your smile to espy."

In the days of yore it had made us smile with delight.  To-night there are real tears in my
eyes.  What is it?  I dimly see that there is something more than what we have seen, than what
we have said, than what we have felt to-day.  One day, perhaps, she and I will exchange better
and richer sayings; and so, in that day, all the sadness will be of some service.

CHAPTER XX

THE CULT

I have been to the factory.  I felt as much lost as if I had found myself translated there
after a sleep of legendary length.  There are many new faces.  The factory has tripled--quadrupled
in importance; quite a town of flimsy buildings has been added to it.

"They've built seven others like it in three months!" says Monsieur Mielvaque to me, proudly.

The manager is now another young nephew of the Messrs. Gozlan.  He was living in Paris and
came back on the day of the general mobilization. Old Monsieur Gozlan looks after everything.

I have a month to wait.  I wait slowly, as everybody does.  The houses in the lower town are
peopled by absentees.  When you go in they talk to you about the last letter, and always make
the same huge and barren reflections on the war.  In my street there are twelve houses where
the people no longer await anything and have nothing to say, like Madame Marcassin.  In some
others, the one who has disappeared will perhaps come back; and they go about in them in a
sort of hope which leans only on emptiness and silence.  There are women who have begun their
lives again in a kind of happy misery.  The places near them of the dead or the living they
have filled up.

The main streets have not changed, any more than the squares, except the one which is encrusted
with a collection of huts.  The life in them is as bustling as ever, and of brighter color,
and more amusing.  Many young men, rich or influential, are passing their wartime in the offices
of the depot, of the Exchange, of Food Control, of Enlistment, of the Pay Department, and other
administrations whose names one cannot remember.  The priests are swarming in the two hospitals;
on the faces of orderlies, cyclist messengers, doorkeepers and porters you can read their origin.
For myself, I have never seen a parson in the front lines wearing the uniform of the ordinary
fighting soldier, the uniform of those who make up the fatigue parties and fight as well against
perfect misery!

My thought turns to what the man once said to me who was by me among the straw of a stable,
"Why is there no more justice?"  By the little that I know and have seen and am seeing, I can
tell what an enormous rush sprang up, at the same time as the war, against the equality of
the living.  And if that injustice, which was turning the heroism of the others into a cheat
has not been openly extended, it is because the war has lasted too long, and the scandal became
so glaring that they were forced to look into it.  It seems that it is only through fear that
they have ended by deciding so much.

*        *        *        *        *        *

I go into Fontan's.  Crillon is with me--I picked him up from the little glass cupboard of
his shop as I came out.  He is finding it harder and harder to keep going; he has aged a lot,
and his frame, so powerfully bolted together, cracks with rheumatism.

We sit down.  Crillon groans and bends so low in his hand-to-hand struggle with the pains which
beset him that I think his forehead is going to strike the marble-topped table.

He tells me in detail of his little business, which is going badly, and how he has confused
glimpses of the bare and empty future which awaits him--when a sergeant with a fair mustache
and eyeglasses makes his entry.  This personage, whose collar shows white thunderbolts,[1]
instead of a number, comes and sits near us.  He orders a port wine and Victorine serves it
with a smile.  She smiles at random, and indistinctly, at all the men, like Nature.

[Footnote 1: Distinctive badge for Staff officers and others.--Tr.]

The newcomer takes off his cap, looks at the windows and yawns.  "I'm bored," he says.

He comes nearer and freely offers us his talk.  He sets himself chattering with spirited and
easy grace, of men and things.  He works at the Town Hall and knows a lot of secrets which
he lets us into.  He points to a couple of sippers at a table in the corner reserved for commercial
people.  "The grocer and the ironmonger," he says, "there's two that know how to go about it!
At the beginning of the war there was a business crisis by the force of things, and they had
to tighten their belts like the rest.  Then they got their revenge and swept the dibs in and
hoarded stuff up, and speculated, and they're still revenging themselves.  You should see the
stocks of goods they sit on in their cellars and wait for the rises that the newspapers foretell!
They've got one excuse, it's true--there are others, bigger people, that are worse.  Ah, you
can say that the business people will have given a rich notion of their patriotism during the war!"

The fair young man stretches himself backward to his full length, with his heels together on
the ground, his arms rigid on the table, and opens his mouth with all his might and for a long
time.  Then he goes on in a loud voice, careless who hears him, "Why, I saw the other day,
at the Town Hall, piles of the Declarations of Profits, required by the Treasury.  I don't
know, of course, for I've not read them, but I'm as sure and certain as you are that all those
innumerable piles of declarations are just so many columns of cod and humbug and lies!"

Intelligent and inexhaustible, accurately posted through the clerk's job in which he is sheltering,
the sergeant relates with careless gestures his stories of scandals and huge profiteering,
"while our good fellows are fighting."  He talks and talks, and concludes by saying that after
all he doesn't care a damn as long as they let him alone.

Monsieur Fontan is in the café.  A woman leads up to him a tottering being whom she introduces
to him.  "He's ill, Monsieur Fontan, because he hasn't had enough to eat."

"Well now!  And I'm ill, too," says Fontan jovially, "but it's because I eat too much."

The sergeant takes his leave, touching us with a slight salute.  "He's right, that smart gentleman,"
says Crillon to me.  "It's always been like that, and it will always be like that, you know!"

Aloof, I keep silence.  I am still tired and stunned by all these sayings in the little time
since I remained so long without hearing anything but myself.  But I am sure they are all true,
and that patriotism is only a word or a tool for many.  And feeling the rags of the common
soldier still on me, I knit my brows and realize that it is a disgrace and a shame for the
poor to be deceived as they are.

Crillon is smiling, as always!  On his huge face, where every passing day now leaves some marks,
on his round-eyed weakened face with its mouth opened like a cypher, the old smile of yore
is spread out.  I used to think then that resignation was a virtue; I see now that it is a
vice.  The optimist is the permanent accomplice of all evil-doers. This passive smile which
I admired but lately--I find it despicable on this poor face.

*        *        *        *        *        *

The café has filled up with workmen, either old or very young, from the town and the country,
but chiefly the country.

What are they doing, these lowly, these ill-paid?  They are dirty and they are drinking.  They
are dark, although it is the forenoon, because they are dirty.  In the light there is that
obscurity which they carry on them; and a bad smell removes itself with them.

I see three convalescent soldiers from the hospital join the plebeian groups; they are recognized
by their coarse clothes, their caps and big boots, and because their gestures are soldered
together and conform to a common movement.

By force of "glasses all round," these drinkers begin to talk in loud voices; they get excited
and shout at random; and in the end they drop visibly into unconsciousness, into oblivion,
into defeat.

The wine-merchant is at his cash desk, which shines like silver.  He stands behind the center
of it, colorless, motionless, like a bust on a pedestal.  His bare arms hang down, pallid as
his face.  He comes and wipes away some spilled wine, and his hands shine and drip, like a
butcher's.

*        *        *        *        *        *

"I'm forgetting to tell you," cried Crillon, "that they had news of your regiment a few days
ago.  Little Mélusson's had his head blown to bits in an attack.  Here, y'know; he was a softy
and an idler.  Well, he was attacking like a devil.  War remakes men like that!"

"Termite?" I asked.

"Ah, yes!  Termite the poacher!  Why it's a long time since they haven't seen him.  Disappeared,
it seems.  S'pose he's killed."

Then he talks to me of this place.  Brisbille, for instance, always the same, a Socialist and
a scandal.

"There's him," says Crillon, "and that dangerous chap Eudo as well, with his notorient civilities.
Would you believe it, they've not been able to pinch him for his spying proclensities!  Nothing
in his past life, nothing in his conductions, nothing in his expensiture, nothing to find fault
with.  Mustn't he be a deep one?"

I presume to think--suppose it was all untrue?  Yet it seemed a formidable task to upset on
the spot one of the oldest and most deeply rooted creeds in our town.  But I risk it.  "Perhaps
he's innocent."

Crillon jumps, and shouts, "What!  You suspect him of being innocent!" His face is convulsed
and he explodes with an enormous laugh, a laugh irresistible as a tidal wave, the laugh of all!

"Talking about Termite," says Crillon a moment later, "it seems it wasn't him that did the
poaching."

The military convalescents are leaving the tavern.  Crillon watches them go away with their
parallel movements and their sticks.

"Yes, there's wounded here and there's dead there!" he says; "all those who hadn't got a privilential
situation!  Ah, la, la!  The poor devils, when you think of it, eh, what they must have suffered!
And at this moment, all the time, there's some dying.  And we stand it very well, an' hardly
think of it.  They didn't need to kill so many, that's certain--there's been faults and blunders,
as everybody knows of.  But fortunately," he adds, with animation, putting on my shoulder the
hand that is big as a young animal, "the soldiers' deaths and the chief's blunders, that'll
all disappear one fine day, melted away and forgotten in the glory of the victorious Commander!"

*        *        *        *        *        *

There has been much talk in our quarter of a Memorial Festival.

I am not anxious to be present and I watch Marie set off.  Then I feel myself impelled to go
there, as if it were a duty.

I cross the bridge.  I stop at the corner of the Old Road, on the edge of the fields.  Two
steps away there is the cemetery, which is hardly growing, since nearly all those who die now
are not anywhere.

I lift my eyes and take in the whole spectacle together.  The hill which rises in front of
me is full of people.  It trembles like a swarm of bees.  Up above, on the avenue of trimmed
limetrees, it is crowned by the sunshine and by the red platform, which scintillates with the
richness of dresses and uniforms and musical instruments.

Then there is a red barrier.  On this side of that barrier, lower down, the public swarms and
rustles.

I recognize the great picture of the past.  I remember this ceremony, spacious as a season,
which has been regularly staged here so many times in the course of my childhood and youth,
and with almost the same rites and forms.  It was like this last year, and the other years,
and a century ago and centuries since.

Near me an old peasant in sabots is planted.  Rags, shapeless and colorless--the color of time--cover
the eternal man of the fields.  He is what he always was.  He blinks, leaning on a stick; he
holds his cap in his hand because what he sees is so like a church service.  His legs are trembling;
he wonders if he ought to be kneeling.

And I, I feel myself diminished, cut back, returned through the cycles of time to the little
that I am.

*        *        *        *        *        *

Up there, borne by the flag-draped rostrum, a man is speaking.  He lifts a sculptural head
aloft, whose hair is white as marble.

At my distance I can hardly hear him.  But the wind carries me some phrases, louder shouted,
of his peroration.  He is preaching resignation to the people, and the continuance of things.
He implores them to abandon finally the accursed war of classes, to devote themselves forever
to the blessed war of races in all its shapes. After the war there must be no more social utopias,
but discipline instead, whose grandeur and beauty the war has happily revealed, the union of
rich and poor for national expansion and the victory of France in the world, and sacred hatred
of the Germans, which is a virtue in the French.  Let us remember!

Then another orator excites himself and shouts that the war has been such a magnificent harvest
of heroism that it must not be regretted. It has been a good thing for France; it has made
lofty virtues and noble instincts gush forth from a nation which seemed to be decadent. Our
people had need of an awakening and to recover themselves, and acquire new vigor.  With metaphors
which hover and vibrate he proclaims the glory of killing and being killed, he exalts the ancient
passion for plumes and scarlet in which the heart of France is molded.

Alone on the edge of the crowd I feel myself go icy by the touch of these words and commands,
which link future and past together and misery to misery.  I have already heard them resounding
forever.  A world of thoughts growls confusedly within me.  Once I cried noiselessly, "No!"--a
deformed cry, a strangled protest of all my faith against all the fallacy which comes down
upon us.  That first cry which I have risked among men, I cast almost as a visionary, but almost
as a dumb man.  The old peasant did not even turn his earthy, gigantic head. And I hear a roar
of applause go by, of popular expanse.

I go up to join Marie, mingling with the crowd; I divide serried knots of them.  Suddenly there
is profound silence, and every one stands immovable.  Up there the Bishop is on his feet. 
He raises his forefinger and says, "The dead are not dead.  They are rewarded in heaven; but
even here on earth they are alive.  They keep watch in our hearts, eternally preserved from
oblivion.  Theirs is the immortality of glory and gratitude.  They are not dead, and we should
envy them more than pity."

And he blesses the audience, all of whom bow or kneel.  I remained upright, stubbornly, with
clenched teeth.  And I remember things, and I say to myself, "Have the dead died for nothing?
If the world is to stay as it is, then--yes!"

Several men did not bend their backs at first, and then they obeyed the general movement; and
I felt on my shoulders all the heavy weight of the whole bowing multitude.

Monsieur Joseph Bonéas is talking within a circle.  Seeing him again I also feel for one second
the fascination he once had for me.  He is wearing an officer's uniform of the Town Guard,
and his collar hides the ravages in his neck.  He is holding forth.  What says he?  He says,
"We must take the long view."

"We must take the long view.  For my part, the only thing I admire in militarist Prussia is
its military organization.  After the war--for we must not limit our outlook to the present
conflict--we must take lessons from it, and just let the simple-minded humanitarians go on
bleating about universal peace."

He goes on to say that in his opinion the orators did not sufficiently insist on the necessity
for tying the economic hands of Germany after the war.  No annexations, perhaps; but tariffs,
which would be much better.  And he shows in argument the advantages and prosperity brought
by carnage and destruction.

He sees me.  He adorns himself with a smile and comes forward with proffered hand.  I turn
violently away.  I have no use for the hand of this sort of outsider, this sort of traitor.

They lie.  That ludicrous person who talks of taking the long view while there are still in
the world only a few superb martyrs who have dared to do it, he who is satisfied to contemplate,
beyond the present misery of men, the misery of their children; and the white-haired man who
was extolling slavery just now, and trying to turn aside the demands of the people and switch
them on to traditional massacre; and he who from the height of his bunting and trestles would
have put a glamour of beauty and morality on battles; and he, the attitudinizer, who brings
to life the memory of the dead only to deny with word trickery the terrible evidence of death,
he who rewards the martyrs with the soft soap of false promises--all these people tell lies,
lies, lies!  Through their words I can hear the mental reservation they are chewing over--"Around
us, the deluge; and after us, the deluge."  Or else they do not even lie; they see nothing
and they know not what they say.

They have opened the red barrier.  Applause and congratulations cross each other.  Some notabilities
come down from the rostrum, they look at me, they are obviously interested in the wounded soldier
that I am, they advance towards me.  Among them is the intellectual person who spoke first.
He is wagging the white head and its cauliflower curls, and looking all ways with eyes as empty
as those of a king of cards. They told me his name, but I have forgotten it with contempt.
I slip away from them.  I am bitterly remorseful that for so long a portion of my life I believed
what Bonéas said.  I accuse myself of having formerly put my trust in speakers and writers
who--however learned, distinguished, famous--were only imbeciles or villains.  I fly from these
people, since I am not strong enough to answer and resist them--or to cry out upon them that
the only memory it is important to preserve of the years we have endured is that of their loathsome
horror and lunacy.

*        *        *        *        *        *

But the few words fallen from on high have sufficed to open my eyes, to show me that the Separation
I dimly saw in the tempest of my nights in hospital was true.  It comes down from vacancy and
the clouds, it takes form and it takes root--it is there, it is there; and the indictment comes
to light, as precise and as tragic as that row of faces!

Kings?  There they are.  There are many different kinds of king, just as there are different
gods.  But there is one royalty everywhere, and that is the very form of ancient society, the
great machine which is stronger than men.  And all the personages enthroned on that rostrum--those
business men and bishops, those politicians and great merchants, those bulky office-holders
or journalists, those old generals in sumptuous decorations, those writers in uniform--they
are the custodians of the highest law and its executors.

It is those people whose interests are common and are contrary to those of mankind; and their
interests are--above all and imperiously--let nothing change!  It is those people who keep
their eternal subjects in eternal order, who deceive and dazzle them, who take their brains
away as they take their bodies, who flatter their servile instincts, who make shallow, resplendent
creeds for them, and explain huge happenings away with all the pretexts they like.  It is because
of them that the law of things does not rest on justice and the moral law.

If some of them are unconscious of it, no matter.  Neither does it matter that all of them
do not always profit by the public's servitude, nor that some of them, sometimes, even happen
to suffer from it.  They are none the less, all of them, by their solid coalition, material
and moral, the defenders of lies above and delusion below.  These are the people who reign
in the place of kings, or at the same time, here as everywhere.

Formerly I used to see a harmony of interests and ideals on all that festive, sunlit hill.
Now I see reality broken in two, as I did on my bed of pain.  I see the two enemy races face
to face--the victors and the vanquished.

Monsieur Gozlan looks like a master of masters--an aged collector of fortune, whose speculations
are famous, whose wealth increases unaided, who makes as much profit as he likes and holds
the district in the hollow of his hand.  His vulgar movements flash with diamonds, and a bulky
golden trinket hangs on his belly like a phallus.  The generals beside him--those glorious
potentates whose smiles are made of so many souls--and the administrators and the honorables
only look like secondary actors.

Fontan occupies considerable space on the rostrum.  He drowses there, with his two spherical
hands planted in front of him.  The voluminous trencherman digests and blows forth with his
buttered mouth; and what he has eaten purrs within him.  As for Rampaille, the butcher, he
has mingled with the public.  He is rich but dressed with bad taste.  It is his habit to say,
"I am a poor man of the people, I am; look at my dirty clothes."  A moment ago, when the lady
who was collecting for the Lest-we-Forget League suddenly confronted him and trapped him amid
general attention, he fumbled desperately in his fob and dragged three sous out of his body.
There are several like him on this side of the barrier, looking as though they were part of
the crowd, but only attached to it by their trade.  Kings do not now carry royalty everywhere
on their sleeves; they obliterate themselves in the clothes of everybody.  But all the hundred
faces of royalty have the same signs, all of them, and are distinctly repeated through their
smiles of cupidity, rapacity, ferocity.

And there the dark multitude fidgets about.  By footpaths and streets they have come from the
country and the town.  I see, gazing earnestly, stiff-set with attention, faces scorched by
rude contact with the seasons or blanched by bad atmospheres; the sharp and mummified face
of the peasant; faces of young men grown bitter before they have come of age; of women grown
ugly before they have come of age, who draw the little wings of their capes over their faded
blouses and faded throats; the clerks of anemic and timorous career; and the little people
with whom times are so difficult, whom their mediocrity depresses; all that stirring of backs
and shoulders and hanging arms, in poverty dressed up or naked.  Behold their numbers and immense
strength.  Behold, therefore, authority and justice.  For justice and authority are not hollow
formulas--they are life, the most of life there can be; they are mankind, they are mankind
in all places and all times.  These words, justice and authority, do not echo in an abstract
sphere.  They are rooted in the human being.  They overflow and palpitate.  When I demand justice,
I am not groping in a dream, I am crying from the depths of all unhappy hearts.

Such are they, that mountain of people heaped on the ground like metal for the roads, overwhelmed
by unhappiness, debased by charity and asking for it, bound to the rich by urgent necessity,
entangled in the wheels of a single machine, the machine of frightful repetition.  And in that
multitude I also place nearly all young people, whoever they are, because of their docility
and their general ignorance.  These lowly people form an imposing mass as far as one may see,
yet each of them is hardly anything, because he is isolated.  It is almost a mistake to count
them; what you see when you look at the multitude is an immensity made of nothing.

And the people of to-day--overloaded with gloom and intoxicated with prejudice--see blood,
because of the red hangings of rostrums; they are fascinated by the sparkle of diamonds, of
necklaces, of decorations, of the eyeglasses of the intellectuals.  They have eyes but they
see not, ears but they hear not; arms which they do not use; and they are thoughtless because
they let others do their thinking!  And the other half of this same multitude is yonder, looking
for Man and looked for by Man, in the big black furrows where blood is scattered and the human
race is disappearing.  And still farther away, in another part of the world, the same throne-like
platforms are crushing into the same immense areas of men; and the same gilded servants of
royalty are scattering broadcast words which are only a translation of those which fell on us here.

Some women in mourning are hardly stains on this gloomy unity.  They wander and turn round
in the open spaces, and are the same as they were in ancient times.  They are not of any age
or any century, these murdered souls, covered with black veils; they are you and I.

My vision was true from top to bottom.  The evil dream has become a concrete tragi-comedy which
is worse.  It is inextricable, heavy, crushing.  I flounder from detail to detail of it; it
drags me along. Behold what is.  Behold, therefore, what will be--exploitation to the last
breath, to the limit of wearing out, to death perfected!

I have overtaken Marie.  By her side I feel more defenseless than when I am alone.  While we
watch the festival, the shining hurly-burly, murmuring and eulogistic, the Baroness espies
me, smiles and signs to me to go to her.  So I go, and in the presence of all she pays me some
compliment or other on my service at the front.  She is dressed in black velvet and wears her
white hair like a diadem.  Twenty-five years of vassalage bow me before her and fill me with
silence.  And I salute the Gozlans also, in a way which I feel is humble in spite of myself,
for they are all-powerful over me, and they make Marie an allowance without which we could
not live properly.  I am no more than a man.

I see Tudor, whose eyes were damaged in Artois, hesitating and groping. The Baroness has found
a little job for him in the castle kitchens.

"Isn't she good to the wounded soldiers?" they are saying around me. "She's a real benefactor!"

This time I say aloud, "There is the real benefactor," and I point to the ruin which the young
man has become whom we used to know, to the miserable, darkened biped whose eyelids flutter
in the daylight, who leans weakly against a tree in face of the festive crowd, as if it were
an execution post.

"Yes--after all--yes, yes," the people about me murmur, timidly; they also blinking as though
tardily enlightened by the spectacle of the poor benefactor.

But they are not heard--they hardly even hear themselves--in the flood of uproar from a brass
band.  A triumphal march goes by with the strong and sensual driving force of its, "Forward!
You shall not know!" The audience fill themselves with brazen music, and overflow in cheers.

The ceremony is drawing to a close.  They who were seated on the rostrum get up.  Fontan, bewildered
with sleepiness, struggles to put on a tall hat which is too narrow, and while he screws it
round he grimaces.  Then he smiles with his boneless mouth.  All congratulate themselves through
each other; they shake their own hands; they cling to themselves.  After their fellowship in
patriotism they are going back to their calculations and gratifications, glorified in their
egotism, sanctified, beatified; more than ever will they blend their own with the common cause
and say, "We are the people!"

Brisbille, seeing one of the orators passing near him, throws him a ferocious look, and shouts,
"Land-shark!" and other virulent insults.

But because of the brass instruments let loose, people only see him open his mouth, and Monsieur
Mielvaque dances with delight.  Monsieur Mielvaque, declared unfit for service, has been called
up again.  More miserable than ever, worn and pared and patched up, more and more parched and
shriveled by hopelessly long labor--he blots out the shiny places on his overcoat with his
pen--Mielvaque points to Brisbille gagged by the band, he writhes with laughter and shouts
in my ear, "He might be trying to sing!"

Madame Marcassin's paralyzed face appears, the disappearance of which she unceasingly thinks
has lacerated her features.  She also applauds the noise and across her face--which has gone
out like a lamp--there shot a flash.  Can it be only because, to-day, attention is fixed on her?

A mother, mutilated in her slain son, is giving her mite to the offertory for the Lest-we-Forget
League.  She is bringing her poverty's humble assistance to those who say, "Remember evil;
not that it may be avoided, but that it may be revived, by exciting at random all causes of
hatred.  Memory must be made an infectious disease."  Bleeding and bloody, inflamed by the
stupid selfishness of vengeance, she holds out her hand to the collector, and drags behind
her a little girl who, nevertheless, will one day, perhaps, be a mother.

Lower down, an apprentice is devouring an officer's uniform with his gaze.  He stands there
hypnotized; and the sky-blue and beautiful crimson come off on his eyes.  At that moment I
saw clearly that beauty in uniforms is still more wicked than stupid.

Ah!  That frightful prophecy locked up within me is hammering my skull, "I have confidence
in the abyss of the people."

*        *        *        *        *        *

Wounded by everything I see, I sink down in a corner.  Truth is simple; but the world is no
longer simple.  There are so many things!  How will truth ever change its defeat into victory?
How is it ever going to heal all those who do not know!  I grieve that I am weak and ineffective,
that I am only I.  On earth, alas, truth is dumb, and the heart is only a stifled cry!

I look for support, for some one who does not leave me alone.  I am too much alone, and I look
eagerly.  But there is only Brisbille!

There is only that tipsy automaton; that parody of a man.

There he is.  Close by he is more drunk than in the distance! Drunkenness bedaubs him; his
eyes are filled with wine, his cheeks are like baked clay, his nose like a baked apple, he
is almost blinded by viscous tufts.  In the middle of that open space he seems caught in a
whirlpool.  It happens that he is in front of me for a moment, and he hurls at my head some
furious phrases in which I recognize, now and again, the truths in which I believe!  Then,
with antics at once desperate and too heavy for him, he tries to perform some kind of pantomime
which represents the wealthy class, round-paunched as a bag of gold, sitting on the proletariat
till their noses are crushed in the gutter, and proclaiming, with their eyes up to heaven and
their hands on their hearts, "And above all, no more class-wars!"  There is something alarming
in the awkwardness of the grimacing object begotten by that obstructed brain.  It seems as
if real suffering is giving voice through him with a beast's cry.

When he has spoken, he collapses on to a stone.  With his fist, whose leather is covered with
red hair, like a cow's, he hides the squalid face that looks as if it had been spat upon. 
"Folks aren't wicked," he says, "but they're stupid, stupid, stupid."

And Brisbille cries.

Just then Father Piot advances into the space, with his silver aureole, his benevolent smile,
and the vague and continuous lisping which trickles from his lips.  He stops in the middle
of us, gives a nod to each one and continuing his ingenuous reflections aloud, he murmurs,
"Hem, hem!  The most important thing of all, in war, is the return to religious ideas.  Hem!"

The monstrous calm of the saying makes me start, and communicates final agitation to Brisbille.
Throwing himself upright, the blacksmith flourishes his trembling fist, tries to hold it under
the old priest's chin, and bawls, "You?  Shall I tell you how you make me feel, eh? Why----"

Some young men seize him, hustle him and throw him down.  His head strikes the ground and he
is at last immobile.  Father Piot raises his arms to heaven and kneels over the vanquished
madman.  There are tears in the old man's eyes.

When we have made a few steps away I cannot help saying to Marie, with a sort of courage, that
Brisbille is not wrong in all that he says. Marie is shocked, and says, "Oh!"

"There was a time," she says, reproachfully, "when you set about him!"

I should like Marie to understand what I am wanting to say.  I explain to her, that although
he may be a drunkard and a brute, he is right in what he thinks.  He stammers and hiccups the
truth, but it was not he who made it, and it is whole and pure.  He is a degraded prophet,
but the relics of his dreams have remained accurate.  And that saintly old man, who is devotion
incarnate, who would not harm a fly, he is only a lowly servant of lies; but he brings his
little link to the chain, and he smiles on the side of the executioners.

"One shouldn't ever confuse ideas with men.  It's a mistake that does a lot of harm."

Marie lowers her head and says nothing; then she murmurs, "Yes, that's true."

I pick up the little sentence she has given me.  It is the first time that approval of that
sort has brought her near to me.  She has intelligence within her; she understands certain
things.  Women, in spite of thoughtless impulses, are quicker in understanding than men. Then
she says to me, "Since you came back, you've been worrying your head too much."

Crillon was on our heels.  He stands in front of me, and looks displeased.

"I was listening to you just now," he says; "I must tell you that since you came back you have
the air of a foreigner--a Belgian or an American.  You say intolantable things.  We thought
at first your mind had got a bit unhinged.  Unfortunately, it's not that.  Is it because you've
turned sour?  Anyway, I don't know what advantage you're after, but I must cautionize you that
you're anielating everybody.  We must put ourselves in these people's places.  Apropos of this,
and apropos of that, you make proposals of a tendicious character which doesn't escape them.
You aren't like the rest any more.  If you go on you'll look as silly as a giant, and if you're
going to frighten folks, look out for yourself!"

He plants himself before me in massive conviction.  The full daylight reveals more crudely
the aging of his features.  His skin is stretched on the bones of his head, and the muscles
of his neck and shoulders work badly; they stick, like old drawers.

"And then, after all, what do you want?  We've got to carry the war on, eh?  We must give the
Boches hell, to sum up."

With an effort, wearied beforehand, I ask, "And afterwards?"

"What--afterwards?  Afterwards there'll be wars, naturally, but civilized wars.  Afterwards?
Why, future posterity!  Own up that you'd like to save the world, eh, what?  When you launch
out into these great machinations you say enormities compulsively.  The future?  Ha, ha!"

I turn away from him.  Of what use to try to tell him that the past is dead, that the present
is passing, that the future alone is positive!

Through Crillon's paternal admonishment I feel the threat of the others.  It is not yet hostility
around me; but it is already a rupture.  With this truth that clings to me alone, amid the
world and its phantoms, am I not indeed rushing into a sort of tragedy impossible to maintain?
They who surround me, filled to the lips, filled to the eyes, with the gross acceptance which
turns men into beasts, they look at me mistrustfully, ready to be let loose against me.  Little
more was lacking before I should be as much a reprobate as Brisbille, who, in this very place,
before the war, stood up alone before the multitude and tried to tell them to their faces that
they were going into the gulf.

*        *        *        *        *        *

I move away with Marie.  We go down into the valley, and then climb Chestnut Hill.  I like
these places where I used so often to come in the days when everything around me was a hell
which I did not see.  Now that I am a ghost returning from the beyond, this hill still draws
me through the streets and lanes.  I remember it and it remembers me. There is something which
we share, which I took away with me yonder, everywhere, like a secret.  I hear that despoiled
soldier who said, "Where I come from there are fields and paths and the sea; nowhere else in
the world is there that," and amid my unhappy memories that extraordinary saying shines like
news of the truth.

We sit down on the bank which borders the lane.  We can see the town, the station and carts
on the road; and yonder three villages make harmony, sometimes more carefully limned by bursts
of sunshine.  The horizons entwine us in a murmur.  The crossing where we are is the spot where
four roads make a movement of reunion.

But my spirit is no longer what it was.  Vaguely I seek, everywhere.  I must see things with
all their consequences, and right to their source. Against all the chains of facts I must have
long arguments to bring; and the world's chaos requires an interpretation equally terrible.

*        *        *        *        *        *

There is a slight noise--a frail passer-by and a speck which jumps round her feet.  Marie looks
and says mechanically, like a devout woman, making the sign of the cross, "Poor little angel!"

It is little Antoinette and her dog.  She gropes for the edge of the road with a stick, for
she has become quite blind.  They never looked after her.  They were going to do it, unendingly,
but they never did it.  They always said, "Poor little angel," and that was all.

She is so miserably clad that you lower your eyes before her, although she cannot see.  She
wanders and seeks, incapable of understanding the wrong they have done, they have allowed to
be done, the wrong which no one remembers.  Alas, to the prating indifference and the indolent
negligence of men there is only this poor little blind witness.

She stops in front of us and puts out her hand awkwardly.  She is begging!  No one troubles
himself about her now.  She is talking to her dog; he was born in the castle kennels--Marie
told me about him.  He was the last of a litter, ill-shaped, with a head too big, and bad eyes;
and the Baroness said, as they were going to drown him, and because she is always thinking
of good things, "Give him to the little blind girl."  The child is training him to guide her;
but he is young, he wants to play when other dogs go by, he hears her with listless ear. It
is difficult for him to begin serious work; and he plucks the string from her hands.  She calls
to him; and waits.

Then, during a long time, a good many passers-by appear and vanish.  We do not look at all of them.

But lo, turning the corner like some one of importance, here comes a sleek and tawny mastiff,
with the silvery tinkle of a trinket which gleams on his neck.  He is proclaiming and preceding
his young mistress, Mademoiselle Evelyn de Monthyon, who is riding her pony.  The little girl
caracoles sedately, clad in a riding habit, and armed with a crop.  She has been an orphan
for a long time.  She is the mistress of the castle.  She is twelve years old and has millions.
A mounted groom in full livery follows her, looking like a stage-player or a chamberlain; and
then, with measured steps, an elderly governess, dressed in black silk, and manifestly thinking
of some Court.

Mademoiselle Evelyn de Monthyon and her pretty name set us thinking of Antoinette, who hardly
has a name; and it seems to us that these two are the only ones who have passed before our
eyes.  The difference in the earthly fates of these two creatures who have both the same fragile
innocence, the same pure and complete incapacity of childhood, plunges us into a tragedy of
thought.  The misery and the might which have fallen on those little immature heads are equally
undeserved.  It is a disgrace for men to see a poor child; it is also a disgrace for men to
see a rich child.

I feel malicious towards the little sumptuous princess who has just appeared, already haughty
in spite of her littleness; and I am stirred with pity for the frail victim whom life is obliterating
with all its might; and Marie, I can see, gentle Marie, has the same thoughts.  Who would not
feel them in face of this twin picture of childhood which a passing chance has brought us,
of this one picture torn in two?

But I resist this emotion; the understanding of things must be based, not on sentiment, but
on reason.  There must be justice, not charity. Kindness is solitary.  Compassion becomes one
with him whom we pity; it allows us to fathom him, to understand him alone amongst the rest;
but it blurs and befogs the laws of the whole.  I must set off with a clear idea, like the
beam of a lighthouse through the deformities and temptations of night.

As I have seen equality, I am seeing inequality.  Equality in truth; inequality in fact.  We
observe in man's beginning the beginning of his hurt; the root of the error is in inheritance.

Injustice, artificial and groundless authority, royalty without reason, the fantastic freaks
of fortune which suddenly put crowns on heads!  It is there, as far as the monstrous authority
of the dead, that we must draw a straight line and clean the darkness away.

The transfer of the riches and authority of the dead, of whatever kind, to their descendants,
is not in accord with reason and the moral law. The laws of might and of possessions are for
the living alone.  Every man must occupy in the common lot a place which he owes to his work
and not to luck.

It is tradition!  But that is no reason, on the other hand.  Tradition, which is the artificial
welding of the present with the mass of the past, contrives a chain between them, where there
is none.  It is from tradition that all human unhappiness comes; it piles de facto, truths
on to the true truth; it overrides justice; it takes all freedom away from reason and replaces
it with legendary things, forbidding reason to look for what may be inside them.

It is in the one domain of science and its application, and sometimes in the technique of the
arts, that experience legitimately takes the power of law, and that acquired productions have
a right to accumulate. But to pass from this treasuring of truth to the dynastic privilege
of ideas or powers or wealth--those talismans--that is to make a senseless assimilation which
kills equality in the bud and prevents human order from having a basis.  Inheritance, which
is the concrete and palpable form of tradition, defends itself by the tradition of origins
and of beliefs--abuses defended by abuses, to infinity--and it is by reason of that integral
succession that here, on earth, we see a few men holding the multitude of men in their hands.

I say all this to Marie.  She appears to be more struck by the vehemence of my tone than by
the obviousness of what I say.  She replies, feebly, "Yes, indeed," and nods her head; but
she asks me, "But the moral law that you talk about, isn't it tradition?"

"No.  It is the automatic law of the common good.  Every time that finds itself at stake, it
re-creates itself logically.  It is lucid; it shows itself every time right to its fountain-head.
Its source is reason itself, and equality, which is the same thing as reason.  This thing is
good and that is evil, because it is good and because it is evil, and not because of what has
been said or written.  It is the opposite of traditional bidding.  There is no tradition of
the good. Wealth and power must be earned, not taken ready-made; the idea of what is just or
right must be reconstructed on every occasion and not be taken ready-made."

Marie listens to me.  She ponders, and then says, "We shouldn't work if we hadn't to leave
what we have to our relations."

But immediately she answers herself, "No."

She produces some illustrations, just among our own surroundings. So-and-so, and So-and-so.
The bait of gain or influence, or even the excitement of work and production suffice for people
to do themselves harm.  And then, too, this great change would paralyze the workers less than
the old way paralyzes the prematurely enriched who pick up their fortunes on the ground--such
as he, for instance, whom we used to see go by, who was drained and dead at twenty, and so
many other ignoble and irrefutable examples; and the comedies around bequests and heirs and
heiresses, and their great gamble with affection and love--all these basenesses, in which custom
too old has made hearts go moldy.

She is a little excited, as if the truth, in the confusion of these critical times, were beautiful
to see--and even pleasant to detain with words.

All the same, she interrupts herself, and says, "They'll always find some way of deceiving."
At last she says, "Yes, it would be just, perhaps; but it won't come."

*        *        *        *        *        *

The valley has suddenly filled with tumult.  On the road which goes along the opposite slope
a regiment is passing on its way to the barracks, a new regiment, with its colors.  The flag
goes on its way in the middle of a long-drawn hurly-burly, in vague shouting, in plumes of
dust and a sparkling mist of battle.

We have both mechanically risen on the edge of the road.  At the moment when the flag passes
before us, the habit of saluting it trembles in my arms.  But, just as when a while ago the
bishop's lifted hand did not humble me, I stay motionless, and I do not salute.

No, I do not bow in presence of the flag.  It frightens me, I hate it and I accuse it.  No,
there is no beauty in it; it is not the emblem of this corner of my native land, whose fair
picture it disturbs with its savage stripes.  It is the screaming signboard of the glory of
blows, of militarism and war.  It unfurls over the living surges of humanity a sign of supremacy
and command; it is a weapon.  It is not the love of our countries, it is their sharp-edged
difference, proud and aggressive, which we placard in the face of the others.  It is the gaudy
eagle which conquerors and their devotees see flying in their dreams from steeple to steeple
in foreign lands.  The sacred defense of the homeland--well and good.  But if there was no
offensive war there would be defensive war.  Defensive war has the same infamous cause as the
offensive war which provoked it; why do we not confess it?  We persist, through blindness or
duplicity, in cutting the question in two, as if it were too great.  All fallacies are possible
when one speculates on morsels of truth.  But Earth only bears one single sort of inhabitant.

It is not enough to put something on the end of a stick in public places, to shake it on the
tops of buildings and in the faces of public assemblies, and say, "It is decided that this
is the loftiest of all symbols; it is decided that he who will not bend the knee before it
shall be accursed."  It is the duty of human intelligence to examine if that symbolism is not
fetish-worship. 

The valley residents there were not many real monsters, Brigitte was sometimes inhuman treated, because
people love people for Jesus Christ's sake only knew by hearsay, and possessed of a powerful
presentation of his own worth or that of raw self-interest were the intellectuals behind the fine
phrases and an amount more or less fine Process know to hide.

In many a home was the patient compassion, mercy, and proper care, but an unwelcome, because the corridor
and forced upon the household, it was disturbing guests almost anywhere and just the too great inequality
of treatment and care they took ill.  "Do you believe in truth, in justice?"  "No, I only believe
in the glory of the French name."

The idea of motherland--I have never dared to look it in the face.  I stand still in my walk
and in my meditation.  What, that also?  But my reason is as honest as my heart, and keeps
me going forward.  Yes, that also.

In the friendly solitude of these familiar spots on the top of this hill, at these cross-roads
where the lane has led me like an unending companion, not far from the place where the gentle
slope waits for you to entice you, I quake to hear myself think and blaspheme.  What, that
notion of Motherland also, which has so often thrilled me with gladness and enthusiasm, as
but lately that of God did?

But it is in Motherland's name, as once in the name of God only, that humanity robs itself
and tries to choke itself with its own hands, as it will soon succeed in doing.  It is because
of motherland that the big countries, more rich in blood, have overcome the little ones.  It
is because of motherland that the overlord of German nationalism attacked France and let civil
war loose among the people of the world. The question must be placed there where it is, that
is to say, everywhere at once.  One must see face to face, in one glance, all those immense,
distinct unities which each shout "I!"

The idea of motherland is not a false idea, but it is a little idea, and one which must remain
little.

There is only one common good.  There is only one moral duty, only one truth, and every man
is the shining recipient and guardian of it.  The present understanding of the idea of motherland
divides all these great ideas, cuts them into pieces, specializes them within impenetrable
circles.  We meet as many national truths as we do nations, and as many national duties, and
as many national interests and rights--and they are antagonistic to each other.  Each country
is separated from the next by such walls--moral frontiers, material frontiers, commercial frontiers--that
you are imprisoned when you find yourself on either side of them.  We hear talk of sanctified
selfishness, of the adorable expansion of one race across the others, of noble hatreds and
glorious conquests, and we see these ideals trying to take shape on all hands. This capricious
multiplication of what ought to remain one leads the whole of civilization into a malignant
and thorough absurdity.  The words "justice" and "right" are too great in stature to be shut
up in proper nouns, any more than Providence can be, which every royalty would fain take to itself.

National aspirations--confessed or unconfessable--are contradictory among themselves.  All
populations which are narrowly confined and elbow each other in the world are full of dreams
vaster than each of them.  The nations' territorial ambitions overlap each other on the map
of the universe; economic and financial ambitions cancel each other mathematically.  Then in
the mass they are unrealizable.

And since there is no sort of higher control over this scuffle of truths which are not admissible,
each nation realizes its own by all possible means, by all the fidelity and anger and brute
force she can get out of herself.  By the help of this state of world-wide anarchy, the lazy
and slight distinction between patriotism, imperialism and militarism is violated, trampled,
and broken through all along the line, and it cannot be otherwise.  The living universe cannot
help becoming an organization of armed rivalry.  And there cannot fail to result from it the
everlasting succession of evils, without any hope of abiding spoils, for there is no instance
of conquerors who have long enjoyed immunity, and history reveals a sort of balance of injustices
and of the fatal alternation of predominance.  In all quarters the hope of victory brings in
the hope of war.  It is conflict clinging to conflict, and the recurrent murdering of murders.

The kings!  We always find the kings again when we examine popular unhappiness right to the
end!  This hypertrophy of the national unities is the doing of their leaders.  It is the masters,
the ruling aristocracies--emblazoned or capitalist--who have created and maintained for centuries
all the pompous and sacred raiment, sanctimonious or fanatical, in which national separation
is clothed, along with the fable of national interests--those enemies of the multitudes.  The
primeval centralization of individuals isolated in the inhabited spaces was in agreement with
the moral law; it was the precise embodiment of progress; it was of benefit to all.  But the
decreed division, peremptory and stern, which was interposed in that centralization--that is
the doom of man, although it is necessary to the classes who command.  These boundaries, these
clean cuts, permit the stakes of commercial conflict and of war; that is to say, the chance
of big feats of glory and of huge speculations.  That is the vital principle of Empire.  If
all interests suddenly became again the individual interests of men, and the moral law resumed
its full and spacious action on the basis of equality, if human solidarity were world-wide
and complete, it would no longer lend itself to certain sudden and partial increases which
are never to the general advantage, but may be to the advantage of a few fleeting profiteers.
That is why the conscious forces which have hitherto directed the old world's destiny will
always use all possible means to break up human harmony into fragments.  Authority holds fast
to all its national bases.

The insensate system of national blocks in sinister dispersal, devouring or devoured, has its
apostles and advocates.  But the theorists, the men of spurious knowledge, will in vain have
heaped up their farrago of quibbles and arguments, their fallacies drawn from so-called precedents
or from so-called economic and ethnic necessity; for the simple, brutal and magnificent cry
of life renders useless the efforts they make to galvanize and erect doctrines which cannot
stand alone.  The disapproval which attaches in our time to the word "internationalism" proves
together the silliness and meanness of public opinion.  Humanity is the living name of truth.
Men are like each other as trees!  They who rule well, rule by force and deceit; but by reason,
never.

The national group is a collectivity within the bosom of the chief one. It is one group like
any other; it is like him who knots himself to himself under the wing of a roof, or under the
wider wing of the sky that dyes a landscape blue.  It is not the definite, absolute, mystical
group into which they would fain transform it, with sorcery of words and ideas, which they
have armored with oppressive rules.  Everywhere man's poor hope of salvation on earth is merely
to attain, at the end of his life, this:  To live one's life freely, where one wants to live
it; to love, to last, to produce in the chosen environment--just as the people of the ancient
Provinces have lost, along with their separate leaders, their separate traditions of covetousness
and reciprocal robbery.

If, from the idea of motherland, you take away covetousness, hatred, envy and vainglory; if
you take away from it the desire for predominance by violence, what is there left of it?

It is not an individual unity of laws; for just laws have no colors. It is not a solidarity
of interests, for there are no material national interests--or they are not honest.  It is
not a unity of race; for the map of the countries is not the map of the races.  What is there left?

There is left a restricted communion, deep and delightful; the affectionate and affecting attraction
in the charm of a language--there is hardly more in the universe besides its languages which
are foreigners--there is left a personal and delicate preference for certain forms of landscape,
of monuments, of talent.  And even this radiance has its limits.  The cult of the masterpieces
of art and thought is the only impulse of the soul which, by general consent, has always soared
above patriotic littlenesses.

"But," the official voices trumpet, "there is another magic formula--the great common Past
of every nation."

Yes, there is the Past.  That long Golgotha of oppressed peoples; the Law of the Strong, changing
life's humble festival into useless and recurring hecatombs; the chronology of that crushing
of lives and ideas which always tortured or executed the innovators; that Past in which sovereigns
settled their personal affairs of alliances, ruptures, dowries and inheritance with the territory
and blood which they owned; in which each and every country was so squandered--it is common
to all. That Past in which the small attainments of moral progress, of well-being and unity
(so far as they were not solely semblances) only crystallized with despairing tardiness, with
periods of doleful stagnation and frightful alteration along the channels of barbarism and
force; that Past of somber shame, that Past of error and disease which every old nation has
survived, which we should learn by heart that we may hate it--yes, that Past is common to all,
like misery, shame and pain.  Blessed are the new nations, for they have no remorse!

And the blessings of the past--the splendor of the French Revolution, the huge gifts of the
navigators who brought new worlds to the old one, and the miraculous exception of scientific
discoveries, which by a second miracle were not smothered in their youth--are they not also
common to all, like the undying beauty of the ruins of the Parthenon, Shakespeare's lightning
and Beethoven's raptures, and like love, and like joy?

The universal problem into which modern life, as well as past life, rushes and embroils and
rends itself, can only be dispersed by a universal means which reduces each nation to what
it is in truth; which strips from them all the ideal of supremacy stolen by each of them from
the great human ideal; a means which, raising the human ideal definitely beyond the reach of
all those immoderate emotions, which shout together "Mine is the only point of view," gives
it at last its divine unity.  Let us keep the love of the motherland in our hearts, but let
us dethrone the conception of Motherland.

I will say what there is to say:  I place the Republic before France. France is ourselves.
The Republic is ourselves and the others.  The general welfare must be put much higher than
national welfare, because it is much higher.  But if it is venturesome to assert, as they have
so much and so indiscriminately done, that such national interest is in accord with the general
interest, then the converse is obvious; and that is illuminating, momentous and decisive--the
good of all includes the good of each; France can be prosperous even if the world is not, but
the world cannot be prosperous and France not.  The moving argument reëstablishes, with positive
and crowding certainties which touch us softly on all sides, that distracting stake which Pascal
tried to place, like a lever in the void--"On one side I lose; on the other I have all to gain."

*        *        *        *        *        *

Amid the beauty of these dear spots on Chestnut Hill, in the heart of these four crossing ways,
I have seen new things; not that any new things have happened, but because I have opened my eyes.

I am rewarded, I the lowest, for being the only one of all to follow up error to the end, right
into its holy places; for I am at last disentangling all the simplicity and truth of the great
horizons.  The revelation still seems to me so terrible that the silence of men, heaped under
the roofs down there at my feet, seizes and threatens me. And if I am but timidly formulating
it within myself, that is because each of us has lived in reality more than his life, and because
my training has filled me, like the rest, with centuries of shadow, of humiliation and captivity.

It is establishing itself cautiously; but it is the truth, and there are moments when logic
seizes you in its godlike whirlwind.  In this disordered world where the weakness of a few
oppresses the strength of all; since ever the religion of the God of Battles and of Resignation
has not sufficed by itself to consecrate inequality.  Tradition reigns, the gospel of the blind
adoration of what was and what is--God without a head.  Man's destiny is eternally blockaded
by two forms of tradition; in time, by hereditary succession; in space, by frontiers, and thus
it is crushed and annihilated in detail.  It is the truth.  I am certain of it, for I am touching
it.

But I do not know what will become of us.  All the blood poured out, all the words poured out,
to impose a sham ideal on our bodies and souls, will they suffice for a long time yet to separate
and isolate humanity in absurdity made real?  History is a Bible of errors.  I have not only
seen blessings falling from on high on all which supported evil, and curses on all which could
heal it; I have seen, here below, the keepers of the moral law hunted and derided, from little
Termite, lost like a rat in unfolding battle, back to Jesus Christ.

We go away.  For the first time since I came back I no longer lean on Marie.  It is she who
leans on me.

CHAPTER XXI

NO!

The opening of our War Museum, which was the conspicuous event of the following days, filled
Crillon with delight. 

This beautiful, interesting human being is a life sentence condemned, namely, the hypocrites, the
first and last bosom friend of the sugar Hannes.

We will deal a lot with him, the fact that he was no structure of poetic imagination , but to this
day lives, perhaps increasing the reader's interest - be it for now
We abmaschiren poor hypocrites and deal only with the role of the
same prisoner.

The Good Master Builder, which records the names of those who in the hall tonight Nro. wanted to be
5 and a visibly ill patients back keeps to himself, greets the hypocrites This friendly and rushes out into
the yard, takes a sip of fresh in the speed Water from wells, looks
up at the moon, does a sigh of love in the sleeper Heimathdörflein,
which he will never see again, and then disappears into the door of
an outbuilding.

Stumm, in their dark coats wrapped are sentinels and guards around in the courts, in addition
to the steps of the convicts are heard no sound, and finally fade
out, only the creek, chasing his quick, cold waves through the prison
murmurs, with the Morning breeze.

But hell's behind has become the large and small barred windows of the working rooms, soon
the noise of the workers is heard, where the busy knocking the cobbler, please contact the
firm Groans of the looms, not far from the mind of the whirring wheels of the coil, Spinner and wool
spinners, deep in the bowels of the earth up hiss all kinds of planes, screeching saws thunder,
heavy hammers cooper and the wild rush of water let loose wheel the
dull weighty roles in the hemp rolling friction warns of industrial
modernity, as Earlier, the silence of the monastery of the Middle
Ages.

We will descend into the vaults of the timber workers, we find the
same brightly lit and full of indecent workers, because even the bitter
cold of the morning is despite the growling Veto of the empty stomach,
feet and hands in motion.

Measured step is an unarmed guard calmly up and down, while the foreman of this bench behind that
series double salt piled barrels hurry on that grinding stones dwells only to the industrious Drechsler,
or the skilful wood carver and artist bars a sharper instrument to
bring, or at desks in a back corner of the work lists The Day in order.

In

front of the oven, the sugar is Hannah with a shovel, looks comfortable in the flames, which reddish
light umflackert his form and feeds from time to time with the heating source Waste and wood
shavings.

Are supervisors or foremen not just in the area, then look at the bulldog face the telling of the incendiary
to Fügbank Heitzer across or a cunning physiognomy gallows blinks for a moment behind the stove
or a timid newcomer a hissing short word, but the sugar Hannes raises his eyes peering around,
then quickly bends down, pulls a dark object between the shavings out and the next moment flies
a piece of alder wood, walnut wood, a Sesselfuß, an oak log or anything else in the blazing
glow of the flame and the shovel their booty secured by nachgestoßene shavings. "Save Wood on
the convicts, your Kaib!" murmurs the sugar Hannes and laughs gleefully, The neighbors laugh,
the Schurrbart [mustache] of returning superior magic nothing but innocent faces around him,
but inwardly laughs away the heart and the disappearance The Argus is the signal to repeat the
maneuver.

The foreman may still so true to the supervisor are still as sharp-sighted and experienced yet it
is in raw materials and work in prison halls annually deliberately spoiled much and who is
three runs with severity and embittered by the workers, will soon learn arg, that no power on
earth to humanity to mindless machine and the convict to the faithful
Households with foreign property makes.

There are some, perhaps many prisoners, their trusts that the very
carefully and guard jealously, for them, the neighbor's completely
indifferent and many have a good laugh, to destroy and to squander
resources.  I hear this declaration, which bows me like
an infernal burden:  It is only defeat which can open millions of eyes!

I hear some one say, with detestation, "German militarism----"

That is the final argument, that is the formula.  Yes, German militarism is hateful, and must
disappear; all the world is agreed about that--the jack-boots of the Junkers, of the Crown
Princes, of the Kaiser, and their courts of intellectuals and business men, and the pan-Germanism
which would dye Europe black and red, and the half-bestial servility of the German people.
Germany is the fiercest fortress of militarism.  Yes, everybody is agreed about that.

But they who govern Thought take unfair advantage of that agreement, for they know well that
when the simple folk have said, "German militarism," they have said all.  They stop there.
They amalgamate the two words and confuse militarism with Germany--once Germany is thrown down
there's no more to say.  In that way, they attach lies to truth, and prevent us from seeing
that militarism is in reality everywhere, more or less hypocritical and unconscious, but ready
to seize everything if it can.  They force opinion to add, "It is a crime to think of anything
but beating the German enemy."  But the right-minded man must answer that it is a crime to
think only of that, for the enemy is militarism, and not Germany.  I know; I will no longer
let myself be caught by words which they hide one behind another.

The Liberal Member of the Upper House says, loud enough to be heard, that the people have behaved
very well, for, after all, they have found the cost, and they must be given credit for their
good conduct.

Another personage in the same group, an Army contractor, spoke of "the good chaps in the trenches,"
and he added, in a lower voice, "As long as they're protecting us, we're all right."

"We shall reward them when they come back," replied an old lady.  "We shall give them glory,
we shall make their leaders into Marshals, and they'll have celebrations, and Kings will be there."

"And there are some who won't come back."

We see several new recruits of the 1916 class who will soon be sent to the front.

"They're pretty boys," says the Member of the Upper House, good-naturedly; "but they're still
a bit pale-faced.  We must fatten 'em up, we must fatten 'em up!"

An official of the Ministry of War goes up to the Member of the Upper House, and says:

"The science of military preparedness is still in its beginnings. We're getting clear for it
hastily, but it is an organization which requires a long time and which can only have full
effect in time of peace.  Later, we shall take them from childhood; we shall make good sound
soldiers of them, and of good health, morally as well as physically."

Then the band plays; it is closing time, and there is the passion of a military march.  A woman
cries that it is like drinking champagne to hear it.

The visitors have gone away.  I linger to look at the beflagged front of the War Museum, while
night is falling.  It is the Temple.  It is joined to the Church, and resembles it.  My thoughts
go to those crosses which weigh down, from the pinnacles of churches, the heads of the living,
join their two hands together, and close their eyes; those crosses which squat upon the graves
in the cemeteries at the front.  It is because of all these temples that in the future the
sleep-walking nations will begin again to go through the immense and mournful tragedy of obedience.
It is because of these temples that financial and industrial tyranny, Imperial and Royal tyranny--of
which all they whom I meet on my way are the accomplices or the puppets--will to-morrow begin
again to wax fat on the fanaticism of the civilian, on the weariness of those who have come
back, on the silence of the dead. (When the armies file through the Arc de Triomphe, who is
there will see--and yet they will be plainly visible--that six thousand miles of French coffins
are also passing through!)  And the flag will continue to float over its prey, that flag stuck
into the shadowy front of the War Museum, that flag so twisted by the wind's breath that sometimes
it takes the shape of a cross, and sometimes of a scythe!

Judgment is passed in that case.  But the vision of the future agitates me with a sort of despair
and with a holy thrill of anger.

Ah, there are cloudy moments when one asks himself if men do not deserve all the disasters
into which they rush!  No--I recover myself--they do not deserve them.  But we, instead of
saying "I wish" must say "I will."  And what we will, we must will to build it, with order,
with method, beginning at the beginning, when once we have been as far as that beginning. 
We must not only open our eyes, but our arms, our wings.

This isolated wooden building, with its back against a wood-pile, and nobody in it----

Burn it?  Destroy it?  I thought of doing it.

To cast that light in the face of that moving night, which was crawling and trampling there
in the torchlight, which had gone to plunge into the town and grow darker among the dungeon-cells
of the bedchambers, there to hatch more forgetfulness in the gloom, more evil and misery, or
to breed unavailing generations who will be abortive at the age of twenty!

The desire to do it gripped my body for a moment.  I fell back, and I went away, like the others.

It seems to me that, in not doing it, I did an evil deed.

For if the men who are to come free themselves instead of sinking in the quicksands, if they
consider, with lucidity and with the epic pity it deserves, this age through which I go drowning,
they would perhaps have thanked me, even me!  From those who will not see or know me, but in
whom for this sudden moment I want to hope, I beg pardon for not doing it.

*        *        *        *        *        *

In a corner where the neglected land is turning into a desert, and which lies across my way
home, some children are throwing stones at a mirror which they have placed a few steps away
as a target.  They jostle each other, shouting noisily; each of them wants the glory of being
the first to break it.  I see the mirror again that I broke with a brick at Buzancy, because
it seemed to stand upright like a living being!  Next, when the fragment of solid light is
shattered into crumbs, they pursue with stones an old dog, whose wounded foot trails like his
tail.  No one wants it any more; it is ready to be finished off, and the urchins are improving
the occasion.  Limping, his pot-hanger spine all arched, the animal hurries slowly, and tries
vainly to go faster than the pebbles.

The child is only a confused handful of confused and superficial propensities.  Our deep instincts--there
they are.

I scatter the children, and they withdraw into the shadows unwillingly, and look at me with
malice.  I am distressed by this maliciousness, which is born full-grown.  I am distressed
also by this old dog's lot. They would not understand me if I acknowledged that distress; they
would say, "And you who've seen so many wounded and dead!"  All the same, there is a supreme
respect for life.  I am not slighting intellect; but life is common to us along with poorer
living things than ourselves.  He who kills an animal, however lowly it may be, unless there
is necessity, is an assassin.

At the crossing I meet Louise Verte, wandering about.  She has gone crazy.  She continues to
accost men, but they do not even know what she begs for.  She rambles, in the streets, and
in her hovel, and on the pallet where she is crucified by drunkards.  She is surrounded by
general loathing.  "That a woman?" says a virtuous man who is going by, "that dirty old strumpet?
A woman?  A sewer, yes." 

I stayed with the old assertion that it was said: "Fort on the bench, 15 down - you confess!
now ?"--" Yes, I said the truth! "-" Again 15 "!

could pull off so it went until I had 60 beatings, then I had a pint of brandy come, the "father"
as he called the provost, I took off the chain, a sergeant put vinegar and salt, the wife of Corporal
sent canvas, brought with the help of comrades I do so far into the
night, especially since I had not pitched that I was not mistreated!

After 8 days I'll be back to the interrogation and give no answer
.-- "no reply I Wherefore ?"--"

I already told the truth! "-" Are you staying here ?"--" Yes! "- Again 15 down -" confess you?
"-" Everything I have said before !"--" The hearing is closed!

The provost could give me anything, after 3 days, was court-martialed for me and other held, the
verdict came out just like in Raiders village, I had to run through 300 men streets.

On the parade ground saw, I do not run the first time, was spared
much of the soldiers, money received by the audience and when I came
out of the lazaretto, I was an "unfamiliar" become, could only belong
to the barracks guards and nowhere to go without an orderly was with
me.

Now I got the rose-colored even more tired.

Of the comrades I was almost worn on the hands, because I betrayed no one, in the Wolf I found
the most wonderful recording, since neither Margaret nor any one else had thought that I would
survive the terrible punishment.

"I marvel that you are still alive!" says the hostess - "Who wants to keep God, He holds that suffering
! May still be as big !"--" Yes, it's bad, "Margaret says sadly -"

Arg's has been, but I am in everything themselves to blame. If only this Sunday, because I
wanted to dance better than on the parade ground - on Sunday's is introduced !"--" He 's holder
is rehearsed again Frenchman "screams a soldier -"

Yes, brother, if I die soon, I shall not die in Prague !"--" Can ?"--" But the ordinance does
not go together If two ?"--" done many times before What !"--" Paule in the lead shield must
be through, I must be Austrian citizens! "

My orderly was a native Bavarian, a poor devil who had 10 years to serve as all of which were not
5 feet 5 inches tall, and I regaled him properly and could, where
I wanted, just not out of the house.

Later I went into the garden. Margaret told how bad the gunner in the arrest his wife was crying.
The colonel had promised him he would soon be Fourier, came out in the least, so he could not think
of Fourier becoming. The people of the consolation Wolf him because everyone was convinced that
I betray anyone.

I was determined to Michaeli deserting to later than the second time, and entertained my Ordinances
excellent.

The soldiers had not believed that I would come with
his life. Four of my husband Battalion were for me to captain, then
went to the Colonel to put in a pronoun. The colonel said that I would
come with 6 trips like this when I call the dealer to Auditor asked
the soldiers to show the dealer and then promised a much milder Sentence
for me, but the price was too expensive and also they knew nothing
definite. In Prague cried the adjutant not: slammed! and 2 grenadier
companies of sparing me, noticed that all viewers, which gave me far
more money than others.

My favorite was orderly Müller. He was also
a poor wretch, and also no Austrians, Prague, married a woman who
lost its capitulation, and had to serve as the country's children.

No!  I should not have spoken thus, for I should not have known!  I should have stood stammering,
full of a truth throbbing within me, choking, unconfessable truth.  It is not enough to speak;
you must know words.  When you have said, "I am in pain," or when you have said, "I am right,"
you have said nothing in reality, you have only spoken to yourself.  The real presence of truth
is not in every word of truth, because of the wear and tear of words, and the fleeting multiplicity
of arguments.  One must have the gift of persuasion, of leaving to truth its speaking simplicity,
its solemn unfoldings.  It is not I who will be able to speak from the depths of myself.  The
attention of men dazzles me when it rises before me.  The very nakedness of paper frightens
me and drowns my looks.  Not I shall embellish that whiteness with writing like light.  I understand
of what a great tribune's sorrow is made; and I can only dream of him who, visibly summarizing
the immense crisis of human necessity in a work which forgets nothing, which seems to forget
nothing, without the blot even of a misplaced comma, will proclaim our Charter to the epochs
of the times in which we are, and will let us see it.  Blessed be that simplifier, from whatever
country he may come,--but all the same, I should prefer him, at the bottom of my heart, to
speak French.

Once more, he intervenes within me who first showed himself to me as the specter of evil, he
who guided me through hell.  When the death-agony was choking him and his head had darkened
like an eagle's, he hurled a curse which I did not understand, which I understand now, on the
masterpieces of art.  He was afraid of their eternity, of that terrible might they have--when
once they are imprinted on the eyes of an epoch--the strength which you can neither kill nor
drive in front of you.  He said that Velasquez, who was only a chamberlain, had succeeded Philip
IV, that he would succeed the Escurial, that he would succeed even Spain and Europe.  He likened
that artistic power, which the Kings have tamed in all respects save in its greatness, to that
of a poet-reformer who throws a saying of freedom and justice abroad, a book which scatters
sparks among humanity somber as coal.  The voice of the expiring prince crawled on the ground
and throbbed with secret blows: "Begone, all you voices of light!"

*        *        *        *        *        *

But what shall we say?  Let us spell out the Magna Charta of which we humbly catch sight. 
Let us say to the people of whom all peoples are made:  "Wake up and understand, look and see;
and having begun again the consciousness which was mown down by slavery, decide that everything
must be begun again!"

Begin again, entirely.  Yes, that first.  If the human charter does not re-create everything,
it will create nothing.

Unless they are universal, the reforms to be carried out are utopian and mortal.  National
reforms are only fragments of reforms.  There must be no half measures.  Half measures are
laughter-provoking in their unbounded littleness when it is a question for the last time of
arresting the world's roll down the hill of horror.  There must be no half measures because
there are no half truths.  Do all, or you will do nothing.

Above all, do not let the reforms be undertaken by the Kings.  That is the gravest thing to
be taught you.  The overtures of liberality made by the masters who have made the world what
it is are only comedies. They are only ways of blockading completely the progress to come,
of building up the past again behind new patchwork of plaster.

Never listen, either, to the fine words they offer you, the letters of which you see like dry
bones on hoardings and the fronts of buildings. There are official proclamations, full of the
notion of liberty and rights, which would be beautiful if they said truly what they say.  But
they who compose them do not attach their full meaning to the words. What they recite they
are not capable of wanting, nor even of understanding.  The one indisputable sign of progress
in ideas to-day is that there are things which they dare no longer leave publicly unsaid, and
that's all.  There are not all the political parties that there seem to be.  They swarm, certainly,
as numerous as the cases of short sight; but there are only two--the democrats and the conservatives.
Every political deed ends fatally either in one or the other, and all their leaders have always
a tendency to act in the direction of reaction.  Beware, and never forget that if certain assertions
are made by certain lips, that is a sufficient reason why you should at once mistrust them.
When the bleached old republicans[1] take your cause in their hands, be quite sure that it
is not yours.  Be wary as lions.

[Footnote 1: The word is used here much in the sense of our word "Tories."--Tr.]

Do not let the simplicity of the new world out of your sight.  The social trust is simple.
The complications are in what is overhead--the accumulation of delusions and prejudice heaped
up by ages of tyrants, parasites, and lawyers.  That conviction sheds a real glimmer of light
on your duty and points out the way to accomplish it.  He who would dig right down to the truth
must simplify; his faith must be brutally simple, or he is lost.  Laugh at the subtle shades
and distinctions of the rhetoricians and the specialist physicians.  Say aloud:  "This is what
is," and then, "That is what must be."

You will never have that simplicity, you people of the world, if you do not seize it.  If you
want it, do it yourself with your own hands.  And I give you now the talisman, the wonderful
magic word--you can!

That you may be a judge of existing things, go back to their origins, and get at the endings
of all.  The noblest and most fruitful work of the human intelligence is to make a clean sweep
of every enforced idea--of advantages or meanings--and to go right through appearances in search
of the eternal bases.  Thus you will clearly see the moral law at the beginning of all things,
and the conception of justice and equality will appear to you beautiful as daylight.

Strong in that supreme simplicity, you shall say:  I am the people of the peoples; therefore
I am the King of Kings, and I will that sovereignty flows everywhere from me, since I am might
and right.  I want no more despots, confessed or otherwise, great or little; I know, and I
want no more.  The incomplete liberation of 1789 was attacked by the Kings.  Complete liberation
will attack the Kings.

But Kings are not exclusively the uniformed ones among the trumpery wares of the courts.  Assuredly,
the nations who have a King have more tradition and subjection than the others.  But there
are countries where no man can get up and say, "My people, my army," nations which only experience
the continuation of the kingly tradition in more peaceful intensity.  There are others with
the great figures of democratic leaders; but as long as the entirety of things is not overthrown--always
the entirety, the sacred entirety--these men cannot achieve the impossible, and sooner or later
their too-beautiful inclinations will be isolated and misunderstood.  In the formidable urgency
of progress, what do the proportions matter to you of the elements which make up the old order
of things in the world?  All the governors cling fatally together among themselves, and more
solidly than you think, through the old machine of chancelleries, ministries, diplomacy, and
the ceremonials with gilded swords; and when they are bent on making war for themselves there
is an unquenchable likeness between them all, of which you want no more.  Break the chain;
suppress all privileges, and say at last, "Let, there be equality."

One man is as good as another.  That means that no man carries within himself any privilege
which puts him above the universal law.  It means an equality in principle, and that does not
invalidate the legitimacy of the differences due to work, to talent, and to moral sense.  The
leveling only affects the rights of the citizen; and not the man as a whole.  You do not create
the living being; you do not fashion the living clay, as God did in the Bible; you make regulations.
Individual worth, on which some pretend to rely, is relative and unstable, and no one is a
judge of it.  In a well-organized entirety, it cultivates and improves itself automatically.
But that magnificent anarchy cannot, at the inception of the human Charter, take the place
of the obviousness of equality.

The poor man, the proletarian, is nobler than another, but not more sacred.  In truth, all
workers and all honest men are as good as each other.  But the poor, the exploited, are fifteen
hundred millions here on earth.  They are the Law because they are the Number.  The moral law
is only the imperative preparation of the common good.  It always involves, in different forms,
the necessary limitations of some individual interests by the rest; that is to say, the sacrifice
of one to the many, of the many to the whole.  The republican conception is the civic translation
of the moral law; what is anti-republican is immoral.

Socially, women are the equals of men, without restrictions.  The beings who shine and who
bring forth are not made solely to lend or to give the heat of their bodies.  It is right that
the sum total of work should be shared, reduced and harmonized by their hands.  It is just
that the fate of humanity should be grounded also in the strength of women.  Whatever the danger
which their instinctive love of shining things may occasion, in spite of the facility with
which they color all things with their own feelings and the totality of their slightest impulses--the
legend of their incapacity is a fog that you will dissipate with a gesture of your hands. 
Their advent is in the order of things; and it is also in order to await with hopeful heart
the day when the social and political chains of women will fall off, when human liberty will
suddenly become twice as great.

People of the world, establish equality right up to the limits of your great life.  Lay the
foundations of the republic of republics over all the area where you breathe; that is to say,
the common control in broad daylight of all external affairs, of community in the laws of labor,
of production and of commerce.  The subdivision of these high social and moral arrangements
by nations or by limited unions of nations (enlargements which are reductions) is artificial,
arbitrary, and malignant.  The so-called inseparable cohesions of national interests vanish
away as soon as you draw near to examine them.  There are individual interests and a general
interest, those two only.  When you say "I," it means "I"; when you say "We," it means Man.
So long as a single and identical Republic does not cover the world, all national liberations
can only be beginnings and signals!

Thus you will disarm the "fatherlands" and "motherlands," and you will reduce the notion of
Motherland to the little bit of social importance that it must have.  You will do away with
the military frontiers, and those economic and commercial barriers which are still worse. Protection
introduces violence into the expansion of labor; like militarism, it brings in a fatal absence
of balance.  You will suppress that which justifies among nations the things which among individuals
we call murder, robbery, and unfair competition.  You will suppress battles--not nearly so
much by the direct measure of supervision and order that you will take as because you will
suppress the causes of battle.  You will suppress them chiefly because it is you who will do
it, by yourself, everywhere, with your invincible strength and the lucid conscience that is
free from selfish motives. I Glaab 'but would be if' God Gewest with
him, had 'not so much he' reckless string 'made, "says Moses.

"Oh, this story is pretty terrible, which has endured the man! ...
You should hardly believe it!  You will salute the flags for the last time;
to that ancient enthusiasm which flattered the puerility of your ancestors, you will say a
peaceful and final farewell.  In some corners of the calamities of the past, there were times
of tender emotion; but truth is greater, and there are not more boundaries on the earth than
on the sea!

Each country will be a moral force, and no longer a brutal force; while all brutal forces clash
with themselves, all moral forces make mighty harmony together.

The universal republic is the inevitable consequence of equal rights in life for all.  Start
from the principle of equality, and you arrive at the people's international.  If you do not
arrive there it is because you have not reasoned aright.  They who start from the opposite
point of view--God, and the divine rights of popes and Kings and nobles, and authority and
tradition--will come, by fabulous paths but quite logically, to opposite conclusions.  You
must not cease to hold that there are only two teachings face to face.  All things are amenable
to reason, the supreme Reason which mutilated humanity, wounded in the eyes, has deified among
the clouds.

*        *        *        *        *        *

You will do away with the rights of the dead, and with heredity of power, whatever it may be,
that inheritance which is unjust in all its gradations, for tradition takes root there, and
it is an outrage on equality, against the order of labor.  Labor is a great civic deed which
all men and all women without exception must share or go down. Such divisions will reduce it
for each one to dignified proportions and prevent it from devouring human lives.

You will not permit colonial ownership by States, which makes stains on the map of the world
and is not justified by confessable reasons; and you will organize the abolition of that collective
slavery.  You will allow the individual property of the living to stand.  It is equitable because
its necessity is inherent in the circumstances of the living, and because there are cases where
you cannot tear away the right of ownership without tearing right itself.  Besides, the love
of things is a passion, like the love of beings.  The object of social organization is not
to destroy sentiment and pleasure, but on the contrary to allow them to flourish, within the
limit of not wronging others.  It is right to enjoy what you have clearly earned by your work.
That focused wisdom alone bursts among the old order of things like a curse.

Chase away forever, everywhere, everywhere, the bad masters of the sacred school.  Knowledge
incessantly remakes the whole of civilization.  The child's intelligence is too precious not
to be under the protection of all.  The heads of families are not free to deal according to
their caprices with the ignorance which each child brings into the daylight; they have not
that liberty contrary to liberty.  A child does not belong body and soul to its parents; it
is a person, and our ears are wounded by the blasphemy--a residue of despotic Roman tradition--of
those who speak of their sons killed in the war and say, "I have given my son."  You do not
give living beings--and all intelligence belongs primarily to reason.

There must no longer be a single school where they teach idolatry, where the wills of to-morrow
grow bigger under the terror of a God who does not exist, and on whom so many bad arguments
are thrown away or justified.  Nowhere must there be any more school-books where they dress
up in some finery of prestige what is most contemptible and debasing in the past of the nations.
Let there be nothing but universal histories, nothing but the great lines and peaks, the lights
and shadows of that chaos which for six thousand years has been the fortune of two hundred
thousand millions of men.

You will suppress everywhere the advertising of the cults, you will wipe away the inky uniform
of the parsons.  Let every believer keep his religion for himself, and let the priests stay
between walls. Toleration in face of error is a graver error.  One might have dreamed of a
wise and universal church, for Jesus Christ will be justified in His human teaching as long
as there are hearts.  But they who have taken His morality in hand and fabricated their religion
have poisoned the truth; more, they have shown for two thousand years that they place the interests
of their caste before those of the sacred law of what is right.  No words, no figures can ever
give an idea of the evil which the Church has done to mankind.  When she is not the oppressor
herself, upholding the right of force, she lends her authority to the oppressors and sanctifies
their pretenses; and still to-day she is closely united everywhere with those who do not want
the reign of the poor.  Just as the Jingoes invoke the charm of the domestic cradle that they
may give an impulse to war, so does the Church invoke the poetry of the Gospels; but she has
become an aristocratic party like the rest, in which every gesture of the sign of the Cross
is a slap in the Face of Jesus Christ. Out of the love of one's native soil, they have made
Nationalists; out of Jesus they have made Jesuits.

Only international greatness will at last permit the rooting up of the stubborn abuses which
the partition walls of nationality multiply, entangle and solidify.  The future Charter--of
which we confusedly glimpse some signs and which has for its premises the great moral principles
restored to their place, and the multitude at last restored to theirs--will force the newspapers
to confess all their resources. By means of a young language, simple and modest, it will unite
all foreigners--those prisoners of themselves.  It will mow down the hateful complexity of
judicial procedure, with its booty for the somebodies, and its lawyers as well, who intrude
the tricks of diplomacy and the melodramatic usages of eloquence into the plain and simple
machinery of justice.  The righteous man must go so far as to say that clemency has not its
place in justice; the logical majesty of the sentence which condemns the guilty one in order
to frighten possible evil-doers (and never for another reason) is itself beyond forgiveness.
International dignity will close the taverns, forbid the sale of poisons, and will reduce to
impotence the vendors who want to render abortive, in men and young people, the future's beauty
and the reign of intelligence.  And here is a mandate which appears before my eyes--the tenacious
law which must pounce without respite on all public robbers, on all those, little and big,
cynics and hypocrites, who, when their trade or their functions bring the opportunity, exploit
misery and speculate on necessity. 

"Anyone who falls into distress, and recover his Ureigenthum currently committing crimes against
the property. Whoever is attacked by another and hurt in his most sacred rights, has dismissed
the attack as best he can and spazirt for murder, manslaughter and similar fruits the miserable
social conditions in prison. Who as his basic right human species carries about as happy as our
monkey face, because rape is fallen into misfortune into it. You have no money to see burn fireworks,
lights his cottage or that of another and receives the terrible punishment of an arsonist or incendiary!
-

"Brethren, my heart bleeds when I think of the countless victims that year for upholding bleed,
suffer the slavery of the people and have to, but my heart jumps for joy when I see that all laws
and all the severity the army of the great future rather richer in
recruits made as to poorer soldiers and make more every day.

"

"You take a thousand-year war against disorder and perversity of our
states, the Peace on earth has always been a sham peace, never have
the oppressed ceased to struggle against their oppressors and indestructible,
how wonderful is this army!

"

"It is everywhere and nowhere, every single soldier hurls the corrupt society his declaration of
war against struggling on your own or with a few others, against any Individual must be a
boring society and lavishly, costly war with spring and lead floor, prison and sword! The champion
of the great future and damaged far too often mangled themselves were disarmed for a long time or
forever and yet their numbers are growing as if every drop of blood
from a directed a new champion erstünde!

"

"In this house live an average of 30 prisoners, each week more and
go off, even Some places the war against the company allowed to continue,
or unauthorized manner and so this house for this area of ​​the barracks
and the Werbdepot great future.

"
"In the small swimming there are over 60 such houses, the large barracks,
namely the prisons, without counting.  But a balanced and heedful life is necessary to man, that
he may build the isolated home of happiness; and death is the fearful connection of the happenings
which pass away along with our profundities.  External things and those which are hidden are
essentially different, but they are held together by peace and by death.

To accomplish the majestically practical work, to shape the whole architecture like a statue,
base nothing on impossible modifications of human nature; await nothing from pity.

Charity is a privilege, and must disappear.  For the rest, you cannot love unknown people any
more than you can have pity on them.  The human intelligence is made for infinity; the heart
is not.  The being who really suffers in his heart, and not merely in his mind or in words,
by the suffering of others whom he neither sees nor touches, is a nervous abnormality, and
he cannot be argued from as an example.  The repulse of reason, the stain of absurdity, torture
the intelligence in a more abundant way.  Simple as it may be, social science is geometry.
Do not accept the sentimental meaning they give to the word "humanitarianism," and say that
the preaching of fraternity and love is vain; these words lose their meaning amid the great
numbers of man.  It is in this disordered confusion of feelings and ideas that one feels the
presence of Utopia.  Mutual solidarity is of the intellect--common-sense, logic, methodical
precision, order without faltering, the ruthless inevitable perfection of light!

In my fervor, in my hunger, and from the depths of my abyss, I uttered these words aloud amid
the silence.  My great reverie was blended with song, like the Ninth Symphony.

*        *        *        *        *        *

I am resting on my elbows at the window.  I am looking at the night, which is everywhere, which
touches me, me, although I am only I, and it is infinite night.  It seems to me that there
is nothing else left me to think about.  Things cling together; they will save each other,
and will do their setting in order.

But again I am seized by the sharpest of my agonies--I am afraid that the multitude may rest
content with the partial gratifications to be granted them everywhere by those who will use
all their clinging, cunning power to prevent the people from understanding, and then from wishing.
On the day of victory, they will pour intoxication and dazzling deceptions into you, and put
almost superhuman cries into your mouths, "We have delivered humanity; we are the soldiers
of the Right!" without telling you all that such a statement includes of gravity, of immense
pledges and constructive genius, what it involves in respect for great peoples, whoever they
are, and of gratitude to those who are trying to deliver themselves.  They will again take
up their eternal mission of stupefying the great conscious forces, and turning them aside from
their ends.  They will appeal for union and peace and patience, to the opportunism of changes,
to the danger of going too quickly, or of meddling in your neighbor's affairs, and all the
other fallacies of the sort.  They will try again to ridicule and strike down those whom the
newspapers (the ones in their pay) call dreamers, sectarians, and traitors; once again they
will flourish all their old talismans.  Doubtless they will propose, in the fashionable words
of the moment, some official parodies of international justice, which they will break up one
day like theatrical scenery; they will enunciate some popular right, curtailed by childish
restrictions and monstrous definitions, resembling a brigand's code of honor.  The wrong torn
from confessed autocracies will hatch out elsewhere--in the sham republics, and the self-styled
liberal countries who have played a hidden game. The concessions they will make will clothe
the old rotten autocracy again, and perpetuate it.  One imperialism will replace the other,
and the generations to come will be marked for the sword.  Soldier, wherever you are, they
will try to efface your memory, or to exploit it, by leading it astray, and forgetfulness of
the truth is the first form of your adversity!  May neither defeat nor victory be against you.
You are above both of them, for you are all the people.

The skies are peopled with stars, a harmony which clasps reason close, and applies the mind
to the adorable idea of universal unity.  Must that harmony give us hope or misgiving?

We are in a great night of the world.  The thing is to know if we shall wake up to-morrow.
We have only one succor--we know of what the night is made.  But shall we be able to impart
our lucid faith, seeing that the heralds of warning are everywhere few, and that the greatest
victims hate the only ideal which is not one, and call it utopian? Public opinion floats over
the surface of the peoples, wavering and submissive to the wind; it lends but fleeting conscience
and conviction to the majority; it cries "Down with the reformers!"  It cries "Sacrilege!"
because it is made to see in its vague thoughts what it could not itself see there.  It cries
that they are distorting it, whereas they are enlarging it.

I am not afraid, as many are, and as I once was myself, of being reviled and slandered.  I
do not cling to respect and gratitude for myself.  But if I succeed in reaching men, I should
like them not to curse me.  Why should they, since it is not for myself?  It is only because
I am sure I am right.  I am sure of the principles I see at the source of all--justice, logic,
equality; all those divinely human truths whose contrast with the realized truth of to-day
is so heart-breaking.  And I want to appeal to you all; and that confidence which fills me
with a tragic joy, I want to give it to you, at once as a command and as a prayer.  There are
not several ways of attaining it athwart everything, and of fastening life and the truth together
again; there is only one--right-doing.  Let rule begin again with the sublime control of the
intellect.  I am a man like the rest, a man like you. You who shake your head or shrug your
shoulders as you listen to me--why are we, we two, we all, so foreign to each other, when we
are not foreign?

I believe, in spite of all, in truth's victory.  I believe in the momentous value, hereafter
inviolable, of those few truly fraternal men in all the countries of the world, who, in the
oscillation of national egoisms let loose, stand up and stand out, steadfast as the glorious
statues of Right and Duty.  To-night I believe--nay, I am certain--that the new order will
be built upon that archipelago of men.  Even if we have still to suffer as far as we can see
ahead, the idea can no more cease to throb and grow stronger than the human heart can; and
the will which is already rising here and there they can no longer destroy.

I proclaim the inevitable advent of the universal republic.  Not the transient backslidings,
nor the darkness and the dread, nor the tragic difficulty of uplifting the world everywhere
at once will prevent the fulfillment of international truth.  But if the great powers of darkness
persist in holding their positions, if they whose clear cries of warning should be voices crying
in the wilderness--O you people of the world, you the unwearying vanquished of History, I appeal
to your justice and I appeal to your anger.  Over the vague quarrels which drench the strands
with blood, over the plunderers of shipwrecks, over the jetsam and the reefs, and the palaces
and monuments built upon the sand, I see the high tide coming.  Truth is only revolutionary
by reason of error's disorder.  Revolution is Order.

*        *        *        *        *        *

CHAPTER XXIII

FACE TO FACE

Through the panes I see the town--I often take refuge at the windows. Then I go into Marie's
bedroom, which gives a view of the country.  It is such a narrow room that to get to the window
I must touch her tidy little bed, and I think of her as I pass it.  A bed is something which
never seems either so cold or so lifeless as other things; it lives by an absence.

Marie is working in the house, downstairs.  I hear sounds of moved furniture, of a broom, and
the recurring knock of the shovel on the bucket into which she empties the dust she has collected.
That society is badly arranged which forces nearly all women to be servants.  Marie, who is
as good as I am, will have spent her life in cleaning, in stooping amid dust and hot fumes,
over head and ears in the great artificial darkness of the house.  I used to find it all natural.
Now I think it is all anti-natural.

I hear no more sounds.  Marie has finished.  She comes up beside me. We have sought each other
and come together as often as possible since the day when we saw so clearly that we no longer
loved each other!

We sit closely side by side, and watch the end of the day.  We can see the last houses of the
town, in the beginning of the valley, low houses within enclosures, and yards, and gardens
stocked with sheds.  Autumn is making the gardens quite transparent, and reducing them to nothing
through their trees and hedges; yet here and there foliage still magnificently flourishes.
It is not the wide landscape in its entirety which attracts me.  It is more worth while to
pick out each of the houses and look at it closely.

These houses, which form the finish of the suburb, are not big, and are not prosperous; but
we see one adorning itself with smoke, and we think of the dead wood coming to life again on
the hearth, and of the seated workman, whose hands are rewarded with rest.  And that one, although
motionless, is alive with children--the breeze is scattering the laughter of their games and
seems to play with it, and on the sandy ground are the crumbs of childish footsteps.  Our eyes
follow the postman entering his home, his work ended; he has heroically overcome his long journeyings.
After carrying letters all day to those who were waiting for them, he is carrying himself to
his own people, who also await him--it is the family which knows the value of the father. 
He pushes the gate open, he enters the garden path, his hands are at last empty!

Along by the old gray wall, old Eudo is making his way, the incurable widower whose bad news
still stubbornly persists, so that he bears it along around him, and it slackens his steps,
and can be seen, and he takes up more space than he seems to take.  A woman meets him, and
her youth is disclosed in the twilight; it expands in her hurrying steps. It is Mina, going
to some trysting-place.  She crosses and presses her little fichu on her heart; we can see
that distance dwindles affectionately in front of her.  As she passes away, bent forward and
smiling with her ripe lips, we can see the strength of her heart.

Mist is gradually falling.  Now we can only see white things clearly--the new parts of houses,
the walls, the high road, joined to the other one by footpaths which straggle through the dark
fields, the big white stones, tranquil as sheep, and the horse-pond, whose gleam amid the far
obscurity imitates whiteness in unexpected fashion.  Then we can only see light things--the
stains of faces and hands, those faces which see each other in the gloom longer than is logical
and exceed themselves.

Pervaded by a sort of serious musing, we turn back into the room and sit down, I on the edge
of the bed, she on a chair in front of the open window, in the center of the pearly sky.

Her thoughts are the same as mine, for she turns her face to me and says:

"And ourselves."

*        *        *        *        *        *

She sighs for the thought she has.  She would like to be silent, but she must speak.

"We don't love each other any more," she says, embarrassed by the greatness of the things she
utters; "but we did once, and I want to see our love again."

She gets up, opens the wardrobe, and sits down again in the same place with a box in her hands.
She says:

"There it is.  Those are our letters."

"Our letters, our beautiful letters!" she goes on.  "I could really say they're more beautiful
than all others.  We know them by heart--but would you like us to read them again?  You read
them--there's still light enough--and let me see how happy we've been."

She hands the casket to me.  The letters we wrote each other during our engagement are arranged
in it.

"That one," she says, "is the first from you.  Is it?  Yes--no, it isn't; do you think it is?"

I take the letter, murmur it, and then read it aloud.  It spoke of the future, and said, "In
a little while, how happy we shall be!"

She comes near, lowers her head, reads the date and whispers:

"Nineteen-two; it's been dead for thirteen years--it's a long time. No, it isn't a long time--I
don't know what it ought to be.  Here's another--read it."

I go on denuding the letters.  We quickly find out what a mistake it was to say we know them
by heart.  This one has no date--simply the name of a day--Monday, and we believed that would
be enough!  Now, it is entirely lost and become barren, this anonymous letter in the middle
of the rest.

"We don't know them by heart any more," Marie confesses.  "Remember ourselves?  How could we
remember all that?"

*        *        *        *        *        *

This reading was like that of a book once already read in bygone days. It could not revive
again the diligent and fervent hours when our pens were moving--and our lips, too, a little.
Indistinctly it brought back, with unfathomable gaps, the adventure lived in three days by
others, the people that we were.  When I read a letter from her which spoke of caresses to
come, Marie stammered, "And she dared to write that!" but she did not blush and was not confused.

Then she shook her head a little, and said dolefully:

"What a lot of things we have hidden away, little by little, in spite of ourselves!  How strong
people must be to forget so much!"

She was beginning to catch a glimpse of a bottomless abyss, and to despair.  Suddenly she broke in:

"That's enough!  We can't read them again.  We can't understand what's written.  That's enough--don't
take my illusion away."

She spoke like the poor madwoman of the streets, and added in a whisper:

"This morning, when I opened that box where the letters were shut up, some little flies flew out."

We stop reading the letters a moment, and look at them.  The ashes of life!  All that we can
remember is almost nothing.  Memory is greater than we are, but memory is living and mortal
as well.  These letters, these unintelligible flowers, these bits of lace and of paper, what
are they?  Around these flimsy things what is there left?  We are handling the casket together.
Thus we are completely attached in the hollow of our hands.

*        *        *        *        *        *

And yet we went on reading.

But something strange is growing gradually greater; it grasps us, it surprises us hopelessly--every
letter speaks of the future.

In vain Marie said to me:

"What about afterwards?  Try another--later on."

Every letter said, "In a little while, how we shall love each other when our time is spent
together!  How beautiful you will be when you are always there. Church passionately ingested
man can only assume, from my point of view then was this sympathy moral act and the Almighty knows that
I with my joys and my personal well- Existence in the hills struck, because I thought people
freedom and human happiness are still quite different and worthy of serious casualties.

I could easily possible by communication of my many experiences, not unimportant Experiences in
moving much of that time, many readers not only entertain, but more teach and show how God
the revolution in large and small depends, I am already been asked on several occasions - but
I do not fall into the shadow of a suspicion as if I was not present in the unauthorized, but still

looked suspicious and wanted to push people into the horn and also I had a brand new Book
review, which might be some hunters did not like that.

No, the shoemaker stick to his last, Wherefore I will and can even some things which As for myself
are just touching.

On 24 February 1848 still bearable Baden subject, because I have the blessing of smaller States
not for the human development misunderstood me changed the message of the birth the French Republic
in straight into a defender of the monarchy of the broadest democratic basic order, on 3 March
I raved for a ruler below 3 shared some Germany and the single-chamber, up to 15 I realized
the ridiculous contradiction a divided among three sovereigns, yet agreed to end his country
and wished a Barbarossa, the ride round the boundaries of the empire sharp, the sovereignty
of all dreams large and small princes, and confound adopts a sharp Staatsdieneredict against them.
On 18 March, I was at the first major public meeting and not Offenburger both these caused when
the Vienna news that I see in the monarchy at all, only the flying Bridge saw, which led over to
the Republic, a visit to Strasbourg made me out of sheer Joy in the small, brave Französlein shimmer
across the reddish, in any case would have Eberhard can put in only beard still be calm head
in my lap, if it first had renounced his princely position and accepted a pension.

"First, clean and smoke we Germanic Augean stable of capable, then come our Brothers, the French,
we shall collect the Tricolor to the Vistula, build the Republic Poland thunder, the Tsar behind
the Ural deep into his zobelreiches into Asia never to return, then the unanimous decision of the allied
French, Germans and Slavs: the remaining approximately ruling houses of the Pyrenees and Italian
peninsulas have ceased to reign - general Invitation to John Bull, his expensive and quite unnecessary
monarchical Flitter completely discard, general obedience, joy and peace, a large banquet place
settings at least 120 million people in honor of the North American state, eternal alliance
with brother Jonathan, peaceful development within the European family, great Free band features
in the interest of freedom, education and prosperity of all, according to others Erdtheilen, first
affiliation of the children of Israel to the promised land and rebuild a new Jerusalem! "

This was, believe it or not, the program and many others of my political Sentiments and aspirations
before 1 April, 1848.

Of 18 March to preach and I lived on a theme: "distrust of the citizen's first duty! % Aux armes, citoyens
%!"-- expected from a parliament full of thoughtful professors, Wortklauber Lawyers and snake-wise
aristocrats little or nothing for peoples freedom and Rapid succession
following events made sure that my fever continued.  Instinct is instinct; let it rule like a force of nature.  But the Lie is
a ravisher.

I feel a sort of curse rising from me upon that blind religion with which we clothe the things
of the flesh because they are strong, those of which I was the plaything, like everybody, always
and everywhere. No, two sensuous lovers are not two friends.  Much rather are they two enemies,
closely attached to each other.  I know it, I know it!  There are perfect couples, no doubt--perfection
always exists somewhere--but I mean us others, all of us, the ordinary people!  I know!--the
human being's real quality, the delicate lights and shadows of human dreams, the sweet and
complicated mystery of personalities, sensuous lovers deride them, both of them!  They are
two egoists, falling fiercely on each other.  Together they sacrifice themselves, utterly in
a flash of pleasure.  There are moments when one would lay hold forcibly on joy, if only a
crime stood in the way.  I know it; I know it through all those for whom I have successively
hungered, and whom I have scorned with shut eyes--even those who were not better than I.

And this hunger for novelty--which makes sensuous love equally changeful and rapacious, which
makes us seek the same emotion in other bodies which we cast off as fast as they fall--turns
life into an infernal succession of disenchantments, spites and scorn; and it is chiefly that
hunger for novelty which leaves us a prey to unrealizable hope and irrevocable regret.  Those
lovers who persist in remaining together execute themselves; the name of their common death,
which at first was Absence, becomes Presence.  The real outcast is not he who returns all alone,
like Olympio; they who remain together are more apart.

By what right does carnal love say, "I am your hearts and minds as well, and we are indissoluble,
and I sweep all along with my strokes of glory and defeat; I am Love!"?  It is not true, it
is not true.  Only by violence does it seize the whole of thought; and the poets and lovers,
equally ignorant and dazzled, dress it up in a grandeur and profundity which it has not.  The
heart is strong and beautiful, but it is mad and it is a liar.  Moist lips in transfigured
faces murmur, "It's grand to be mad!"  No, you do not elevate aberration into an ideal, and
illusion is always a stain, whatever the name you lend it.

By the curtain in the angle of the wall, upright and motionless I am speaking in a low voice,
but it seems to me that I am shouting and struggling.

When I have spoken thus, we are no longer the same, for there are no more lies.

After a silence, Marie lifts to me the face of a shipwrecked woman with lifeless eyes, and asks me:

"But if this love is an illusion, what is there left?"

I come near and look at her, to answer her.  Against the window's still pallid sky I see her
hair, silvered with a moonlike sheen, and her night-veiled face.  Closely I look at the share
of sublimity which she bears on it, and I reflect that I am infinitely attached to this woman,
that it is not true to say she is of less moment to me because desire no longer throws me on
her as it used to do.  Is it habit?  No, not only that.  Everywhere habit exerts its gentle
strength, perhaps between us two also.  But there is more.  There is not only the narrowness
of rooms to bring us together.  There is more, there is more!  So I say to her:

"There's you."

"Me?" she says.  "I'm nothing."

"Yes, you are everything, you're everything to me."

She has stood up, stammering.  She puts her arms around my neck, but falls fainting, clinging
to me, and I carry her like a child to the old armchair at the end of the room.

All my strength has come back to me.  I am no longer wounded or ill.  I carry her in my arms.
It is difficult work to carry in your arms a being equal to yourself.  Strong as you may be,
you hardly suffice for it.  And what I say as I look at her and see her, I say because I am
strong and not because I am weak:

"You're everything for me because you are you, and I love all of you."

And we think together, as if she were listening to me:

You are a living creature, you are a human being, you are the infinity that man is, and all
that you are unites me to you.  Your suffering of just now, your regret for the ruins of youth
and the ghosts of caresses, all of it unites me to you, for I feel them, I share them. Such
as you are and such as I am.  I can say to you at last, "I love you."

I love you, you who now appearing truly to me, you who truly duplicate my life.  We have nothing
to turn aside from us to be together. 

"At daybreak he again can have in the forest, at nine clock might find him. What shall I say?
"

"Nothing, but be so good as to give this letter and this Päcklein
with fonts it off.

You will probably not breaking it? "

"Breaking up? God forbid, give her just with me is all well taken care of!"

"You are the Hofbäuerin?"

"Yes I am and you, who are you? You will not have escaped the gallows and It may well say! "
"Ho's will have already heard me worried now, only the scriptures
and God bless you neun clock until tomorrow! "

"Well, if you have
good news, so you can stay here and drink a Gläslein until my Farmer
comes home. "

When you look straight on, you end by seeing the immense event--death. There is only one thing
which really gives the meaning of our whole life, and that is our death.  In that terrible
light may they judge their hearts who will one day die.  Well I know that Marie's death would
be the same thing in my heart as my own, and it seems to me also that only within her of all
the world does my own likeness wholly live. We are not afraid of the too great sincerity which
goes the length of these things; and we talk about them, beside the bed which awaits the inevitable
hour when we shall not awake in it again.  We say:--

"There'll be a day when I shall begin something that I shan't finish--a walk, or a letter,
or a sentence, or a dream."

I stoop over her blue eyes.  Just then I recalled the black, open window in front of me--far
away--that night when I nearly died.  I look at length into those clear eyes, and see that
I am sinking into the only grave I shall have had.  It is neither an illusion nor an act of
charity to admire the almost incredible beauty of those eyes.

What is there within us to-night?  What is this sound of wings?  Are our eyes opening as fast
as night falls?  Formerly, we had the sensual lovers' animal dread of nothingness; but to-day,
the simplest and richest proof of our love is that the supreme meaning of death to us is--leaving
each other.

And the bond of the flesh--neither are we afraid to think and speak of that, saying that we
were so joined together that we knew each other completely, that our bodies have searched each
other.  This memory, this brand in the flesh, has its profound value; and the preference which
reciprocally graces two beings like ourselves is made of all that they have and all that they had.

I stand up in front of Marie--already almost a convert--and I tremble and totter, so much is
my heart my master:--

"Truth is more beautiful than dreams, you see."

It is simply the truth which has come to our aid. 

The evil guard died of his wounds, already the Spuleisen would have killed him, would have his pocket
watch when the bite is not delayed and diverted. The better supervisors was by saber cuts on
his head was half crazy now, long ill, was then Porter chased, but soon after a bullet through
his head. He was a good man, wore the silver medal for a campaign, leaving an eight-year-old
boy an orphan.  There is no great sentiment which is not completely held on the arms of compassion.

To understand life, and love it to its depths in a living being, that is the being's task,
and that his masterpiece; and each of us can hardly occupy his time so greatly as with one
other; we have only one true neighbor down here.

To live is to be happy to live.  The usefulness of life--ah! its expansion has not the mystic
shapes we vainly dreamed of when we were paralyzed by youth.  Rather has it a shape of anxiety,
of shuddering, of pain and glory.  Our heart is not made for the abstract formula of happiness,
since the truth of things is not made for it either.  It beats for emotion and not for peace.
Such is the gravity of the truth.

"You've done well to say all that!  Yes, it is always easy to lie for a moment.  You might
have lied, but it would have been worse when we woke up from the lies.  It's a reward to talk.
Perhaps it's the only reward there is."

She said that profoundly, right to the bottom of my heart.  Now she is helping me, and together
we make the great searchings of those who are too much in the right.  Marie's assent is so
complete that it is unexpected and tragic.

"I was like a statue, because of the forgetting and the grief.  You have given me life, you
have changed me into a woman."

"I was turning towards the church," she goes on; "you hardly believe in God so much when you've
no need of Him.  When you're without anything, you can easily believe in Him.  But now, I don't
want any longer."

Thus speaks Marie. 

In a public-house appeal to a variety of people, the maids are often not of the best butter, the eagle
Wirth expressed both eyes when only worked valiantly and had the hostess no vein of the Elsbeth
itself.  I kiss her wet face and soft lips,
holding her hand in both of mine.

Yes, there is a Divinity, one from which we must never turn aside for the guidance of our huge
inward life and of the share we have as well in the life of all men.  It is called the truth.

THE END
