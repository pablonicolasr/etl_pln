[16] Titian's age is variously given; some authorities make it ninety-nine years, placing the
date of his death in 1570 or 7.

[17] Kugler.

[18] The term originated in the French expression, 'du genre bas.'

[19] He had a peculiar fondness for blue and bronze hues.

[20] It is due to Tintoret to say, that there are modern critics, who look below the surface,
and are at this date deeply enamoured of his pictures. Tintoret's name now stands very high in art.

[24] If I mistake not, this is the same Countess of Arundel who, in her widowhood, resided
in Italy in order to be near her young sons then at Padua. Having provoked the suspicion of
the Doge and Council of Venice, she was arrested by them on a charge of treason, and brought
before the tribunal, where she successfully pled her own cause, and obtained her release, the
only woman who ever braved triumphantly the terrible 'ten.'

[25] Here is the description of a very different Rembrandt which appears in this year's Exhibition
of the Works by Old Masters: 'There is no portrait here which equals Rembrandt's picture, from
Windsor, "A Lady Opening a Casement;" a not particularly appropriate name, because the picture
represents no such action. The lady is simply looking from an open window, her left hand raised
and resting at the side of the opening. We believe there is nothing left to tell who this lady
was, with the grave, sad eyes, and lips that seem to quiver with a trouble hardly yet assuaged
collar, almost a tippet, for it falls below her shoulders, together with lace cuffs. A triple
band of large pearls goes about her neck, and she has similar ornaments round each wrist. She
wears a mourning robe and black jewellery.... This picture, which resembles in most of its
qualities a pair, of somewhat larger size, which were here last year, and also came from the
Royal collection, is signed and dated "Rembrandt, F. 1671." It is, therefore, a late work of
his. What wonderful harmony is here, of light, of colour, of tone. How nearly perfect is the
keeping of the whole picture; as a whole, and also in respect of part to part. Could anything
be truer than the breadth of the chiaroscuro? Notice how beautifully, and with what subtle
gradations, the light reflected from her white collar strikes on her slightly faded cheek;
how tenderly it seems to play among the soft tangles of the hair that time has thinned.'--Athenæum.

[26] He had been called the Titian of flower and fruit painters. He preferred fruit for his
subject. His works are not common in England. His masterpiece, 'The Chalice of the Sacrament,'
crowned with a stately wreath, and sheaves of corn and bunches of grapes among the flowers,
is at Vienna.

[35] Madame Le Brun, whose maiden name was Vigée, born 1755, died 1842, was an excellent portrait

to represent Sir Thomas Wyatt and his secretary.

[42] Walpole.

[43] Walpole.

[44] Dwarfs figured at Charles's court, as at the court of Philip IV. of Spain.

[45] The notion that Van Dyck sacrificed truth to grace is absolutely contradicted by certain
critics, who bring forward as a proof of their contradiction what they consider the 'over-true'
picture of the Queen Henrietta Maria, shown at the last exhibition of the works of Old Masters.
The picture seems hardly to warrant the strong opinion of the critics.

[49] A lunette is a small picture, generally semicircular, surmounting the main picture in
an altar-piece.

[50] The Dutch still more than the Italian artists belonged largely to families of artists
bearing the same surnames.

[51] A picture with one door of two panels is called a diptych, with two doors of three panels
a triptych, with many doors and panels a polyptych.

[52] Fairholt's 'Homes and Haunts of Foreign Artists.'

[53] Alchemists, like hermits, still existed in the seventeenth century.

[54] Bartholomew Van der Helst, 1613-1670, was another great Dutch portrait painter. His portrait
pieces with many figures are famous. An 'Archery Festival,' commemorating the Peace of Westphalia,
includes twenty-four figures full of individuality and finely drawn and coloured. One of his
best works is 'In the Workhouse,' at Amsterdam. Two women and two men are conversing together
in the foreground. There is a man with a book, and a preacher delivering a sermon in the background.

[55] It may be that Ruysdael's straggling life was reflected in his lowering skies and stormy seas.

[56] Other eminent painters, such as Van de Velde, Wouvermans, and Berchem often supplied cattle
and figures to Hobbema's landscapes.

[57] Was the apparently greater success of these partly denaturalised Dutch landscape painters,
as contrasted with the adversity of Ruysdael and Hobbema, due to the classic mania?

[58] Peter Gysels was another painter of 'still life.' His butterflies are said to have been
rendered with 'exquisite finish.'
