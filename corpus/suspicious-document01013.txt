Certain it is, the Count's mother was an Englishwoman, who, after having been five times a
widow in one campaign, was, in the last year of the renowned Marlborough's command, numbered
among the baggage of the allied army, which she still accompanied, through pure benevolence
of spirit, supplying the ranks with the refreshing streams of choice Geneva, and accommodating
individuals with clean linen, as the emergency of their occasions required.  Nor was her philanthropy
altogether confined to such ministration; she abounded with "the milk of human kindness," which
flowed plentifully among her fellow-creatures; and to every son of Mars who cultivated her
favour, she liberally dispensed her smiles, in order to sweeten the toils and dangers of the field.

And here it will not be amiss to anticipate the remarks of the reader, who, in the chastity
and excellency of his conception, may possibly exclaim, "Good Heaven! will these authors never
reform their imaginations, and lift their ideas from the obscene objects of low life? Must
the public be again disgusted with the grovelling adventures of a waggon?  Will no writer of
genius draw his pen in the vindication of taste, and entertain us with the agreeable characters,
the dignified conversation, the poignant repartee, in short, the genteel comedy of the polite
world?"

Have a little patience, gentle, delicate, sublime critic; you, I doubt not, are one of those
consummate connoisseurs, who, in their purifications, let humour evaporate, while they endeavour
to preserve decorum, and polish wit, until the edge of it is quite worn off.  Or, perhaps,
of that class, who, in the sapience of taste, are disgusted with those very flavours in the
productions of their own country which have yielded infinite delectation to their faculties,
when imported from another clime; and d--n an author in despite of all precedent and prescription;--who
extol the writings of Petronius Arbiter, read with rapture the amorous sallies of Ovid's pen,
and chuckle over the story of Lucian's ass; yet, if a modern author presumes to relate the
progress of a simple intrigue, are shocked at the indecency and immorality of the scene;--who
delight in following Guzman d'Alfarache, through all the mazes of squalid beggary; who with
pleasure accompany Don Quixote and his squire, in the lowest paths of fortune; who are diverted
with the adventures of Scarron's ragged troop of strollers, and highly entertained with the
servile situations of Gil Blas; yet, when a character in humble life occasionally occurs in
a performance of our own growth, exclaim, with an air of disgust, "Was ever anything so mean!
sure, this writer must have been very conversant with the lowest scenes of life";--who, when
Swift or Pope represents a coxcomb in the act of swearing, scruple not to laugh at the ridiculous
execrations; but, in a less reputed author, condemn the use of such profane expletives;--who
eagerly explore the jakes of Rabelais, for amusement, and even extract humour from the dean's
description of a lady's dressing-room; yet in a production of these days, unstamped with such
venerable names, will stop their noses, with all the signs of loathing and abhorrence, at a
bare mention of the china chamber-pot;--who applauded Catullus, Juvenal, Persius, and Lucan,
for their spirit in lashing the greatest names of antiquity; yet, when a British satirist,
of this generation, has courage enough to call in question the talents of a pseudo-patron in
power, accuse him of insolence, rancour, and scurrility.

If such you be, courteous reader, I say again, have a little patience; for your entertainment
we are about to write.  Our hero shall, with all convenient despatch, be gradually sublimed
into those splendid connexions of which you are enamoured; and God forbid, that, in the meantime,
the nature of his extraction should turn to his prejudice in a land of freedom like this, where
individuals are every day ennobled in consequence of their own qualifications, without the
least retrospective regard to the rank or merit of their ancestors.  Yes, refined reader, we
are hastening to that goal of perfection, where satire dares not show her face; where nature
is castigated, almost even to still life; where humour turns changeling, and slavers in an
insipid grin; where wit is volatilised into a mere vapour; where decency, divested of all substance,
hovers about like a fantastic shadow; where the salt of genius, escaping, leaves nothing but
pure and simple phlegm; and the inoffensive pen for ever drops the mild manna of soul-sweetening
praise.

CHAPTER TWO

A SUPERFICIAL VIEW OF OUR HERO'S INFANCY.

Having thus bespoken the indulgence of our guests, let us now produce the particulars of our
entertainment, and speedily conduct our adventurer through the stage of infancy, which seldom
teems with interesting incidents.

As the occupations of his mother would not conveniently permit her to suckle this her firstborn
at her own breast, and those happy ages were now no more, in which the charge of nursing a
child might be left to the next goat or she-wolf, she resolved to improve upon the ordinances
of nature, and foster him with a juice much more energetic than the milk of goat, wolf, or
woman; this was no other than that delicious nectar, which, as we have already hinted, she
so cordially distributed from a small cask that hung before her, depending from her shoulders
by a leathern zone.  Thus determined, ere he was yet twelve days old, she enclosed him in a
canvas knapsack, which being adjusted to her neck, fell down upon her back, and balanced the
cargo that rested on her bosom.

There are not wanting those who affirm, that, while her double charge was carried about in
this situation, her keg was furnished with a long and slender flexible tube, which, when the
child began to be clamorous, she conveyed into his mouth, and straight he stilled himself with
sucking; but this we consider as an extravagant assertion of those who mix the marvellous in
all their narrations, because we cannot conceive how the tender organs of an infant could digest
such a fiery beverage, which never fails to discompose the constitutions of the most hardy
and robust. We therefore conclude that the use of this potation was more restrained, and that
it was with simple element diluted into a composition adapted to his taste and years.  Be this
as it will, he certainly was indulged in the use of it to such a degree as would have effectually
obstructed his future fortune, had not he been happily cloyed with the repetition of the same
fare, for which he conceived the utmost detestation and abhorrence, rejecting it with loathing
and disgust, like those choice spirits, who, having been crammed with religion in their childhood,
renounce it in their youth, among other absurd prejudices of education.

While he was thus dangled in a state of suspension, a German trooper was transiently smit with
the charms of his mother, who listened to his honourable addresses, and once more received
the silken bonds of matrimony; the ceremony having been performed as usual at the drum-head.
The lady had no sooner taken possession of her new name, than she bestowed it upon her son,
who was thenceforward distinguished by the appellation of Ferdinand de Fadom; nor was the husband
offended at this presumption in his wife, which he not only considered as a proof of her affection
and esteem, but also as a compliment, by which he might in time acquire the credit of being
the real father of such a hopeful child.

Notwithstanding this new engagement with a foreigner, our hero's mother still exercised the
virtues of her calling among the English troops, so much was she biassed by that laudable partiality,
which, as Horace observes, the natale solum generally inspires.  Indeed this inclination was
enforced by another reason, that did not fail to influence her conduct in this particular;
all her knowledge of the High Dutch language consisted in some words of traffic absolutely
necessary for the practice of hex vocation, together with sundry oaths and terms of reproach,
that kept her customers in awe; so that, except among her own countrymen, she could not indulge
that propensity to conversation, for which she had been remarkable from her earliest years.
Nor did this instance of her affection fail of turning to her account in the sequel.  She was
promoted to the office of cook to a regimental mess of officers; and, before the peace of Utrecht,
was actually in possession of a suttling-tent, pitched for the accommodation of the gentlemen
in the army.

Meanwhile, Ferdinand improved apace in the accomplishments of infancy; his beauty was conspicuous,
and his vigour so uncommon, that he was with justice likened unto Hercules in the cradle. 
The friends of his father-in-law dandled him on their knees, while he played with their whiskers,
and, before he was thirteen months old, taught him to suck brandy impregnated with gunpowder,
through the touch-hole of a pistol. At the same time, he was caressed by divers serjeants of
the British army, who severally and in secret contemplated his qualifications with a father's
pride, excited by the artful declaration with which the mother had flattered each apart.

Soon as the war was (for her unhappily) concluded, she, as in duty bound, followed her husband
into Bohemia; and his regiment being sent into garrison at Prague, she opened a cabaret in
that city, which was frequented by a good many guests of the Scotch and Irish nations, who
were devoted to the exercise of arms in the service of the Emperor.  It was by this communication
that the English tongue became vernacular to young Ferdinand, who, without such opportunity,
would have been a stranger to the language of his forefathers, in spite of all his mother's
loquacity and elocution; though it must be owned, for the credit of her maternal care, that
she let slip no occasion of making it familiar to his ear and conception; for, even at those
intervals in which she could find no person to carry on the altercation, she used to hold forth
in earnest soliloquies upon the subject of her own situation, giving vent to many opprobrious
invectives against her husband's country, between which and Old England she drew many odious
comparisons; and prayed, without ceasing, that Europe might speedily be involved in a general
war, so as that she might have some chance of re-enjoying the pleasures and emoluments of a
Flanders campaign.

While she wearied Heaven with these petitions, the flame of war broke out betwixt the houses
of Ottoman and Austria, and the Emperor sent forth an army into Hungary, under the auspices
of the renowned Prince Eugene.  On account of this expedition, the mother of our hero gave
up housekeeping, and cheerfully followed her customers and husband into the field; having first
provided herself with store of those commodities in which she had formerly merchandised.  Although
the hope of profit might in some measure affect her determination, one of the chief motives
for her visiting the frontiers of Turkey, was the desire of initiating her son in the rudiments
of his education, which she now thought high time to inculcate, he being, at this period, in
the sixth year of his age; he was accordingly conducted to the camp, which she considered as
the most consummate school of life, and proposed for the scene of his instruction; and in this
academy he had not continued many weeks, when he was an eye-witness of that famous victory,
which, with sixty thousand men, the Imperial general obtained over an army of one hundred and
fifty thousand Turks.

His father-in-law was engaged, and his mother would not be idle on this occasion.  She was
a perfect mistress of all the camp qualifications, and thought it a duty incumbent on her to
contribute all that lay in her power towards distressing the enemy.  With these sentiments
she hovered about the skirts of the army, and the troops were no sooner employed in the pursuit,
than she began to traverse the field of battle with a poignard and a bag, in order to consult
her own interest, annoy the foe, and exercise her humanity at the same time.  In short, she
had, with amazing prowess, delivered some fifty or threescore disabled Mussulmen of the pain
under which they groaned, and made a comfortable booty of the spoils of the slain, when her
eyes were attracted by the rich attire of an Imperial officer, who lay bleeding on the plain,
to all appearance in the agonies of death.

She could not in her heart refuse that favour to a friend and Christian she had so compassionately
bestowed upon so many enemies and infidels, and therefore drew near with the sovereign remedy,
which she had already administered with such success.  As she approached this deplorable object
of pity, her ears were surprised with an ejaculation in the English tongue, which he fervently
pronounced, though with a weak and languid voice, recommending his soul to God, and his family
to the protection of Heaven.  Our Amazon's purpose was staggered by this providential incident;
the sound of her native language, so unexpectedly heard, and so pathetically delivered, had
a surprising effect upon her imagination; and the faculty of reflection did not forsake her
in such emergency.  Though she could not recollect the features of this unhappy officer, she
concluded, from his appearance, that he was some person of distinction in the service, and
foresaw greater advantage to herself in attempting to preserve his life, than she could possibly
reap from the execution of her first resolve.  "If," said she to herself, "I can find means
of conveying him to his tent alive, he cannot but in conscience acknowledge my humanity with
some considerable recompense; and, should he chance to survive his wounds, I have everything
to expect from his gratitude and power."

Fraught with these prudential suggestions, she drew near the unfortunate stranger, and, in
a softened accent of pity and condolence, questioned him concerning his name, condition, and
the nature of his mischance, at the same time making a gentle tender of her service.  Agreeably
surprised to hear himself accosted in such a manner, by a person whose equipage seemed to promise
far other designs, he thanked her in the most grateful terms for her humanity, with the appellation
of kind countrywoman; gave her to understand that he was colonel of a regiment of horse; that
he had fallen in consequence of a shot he received in his breast at the beginning of the action;
and, finally, entreated her to procure some carriage on which he might be removed to his tent.
Perceiving him faint and exhausted with loss of blood, she raised up his head, and treated
him with that cordial which was her constant companion.  At that instant, espying a small body
of hussars returning to the camp with the plunder they had taken, she invoked their assistance,
and they forthwith carried the officer to his own quarters, where his wound was dressed, and
his preserver carefully tended him until his recovery was completed.
