     Belford, Clarke & Co.:

     Gents--If you have made up your minds that the world will
     cease to move unless these "Bad Boy" articles are given to
     the public in book form, why go ahead, and peace to your
     ashes. The "Bad Boy" is not a "myth," though there may be
     some stretches of imagination in the articles. The
     counterpart of this boy is located in every city, village
     and country hamlet throughout the land. He is wide awake,
     full of vinegar, and is ready to crawl under the canvas of a
     circus or repeat a hundred verses of the New Testament in
     Sunday School. He knows where every melon patch in the
     neighborhood is located, and at what hours the dog is
     chained up. He will tie an oyster can to a dog's tail to
     give the dog exercise, or will fight at the drop of the hat
     to protect the smaller boy or a school girl. He gets in his
     work everywhere there is a fair prospect of fun, and his
     heart is easily touched by an appeal in the right way,
     though his coat-tail is oftener touched with a boot than his
     heart is by kindness. But he shuffles through life until the
     time comes for him to make a mark in the world, and then he
     buckles on the harness and goes to the front, and becomes
     successful, and then those who said he would bring up in
     State Prison, remember that he always was a mighty smart
     lad, and they never tire of telling of some of his deviltry
     when he was a boy, though they thought he was pretty tough
     at the time. This book is respectfully dedicated to boys, to
     the men who have been boys themselves, to the girls who like
     the boys, and to the mothers, bless them, who like both the
     boys and the girls,

     Very respectfully,

     GEO. W. PECK,

CHAPTER XXV. A big dog her side of the
stairs was, and how the child belong to here at home seemed to put his head in her white dress
and licked her bare feet .-- "This is it!" Hinzelmeier said, and his steps were uncertain before
hope and expectation. And when the Virgin now her face brought against him, because he found
it like scales from his eyes and he realized at once the Girl from the Bauernkueche, only she
was wearing today is not the colorful Nfieder and the red on her Wangen was only the reflection
of light off the rose.

"Oh!" Hinzelmeier cried, "is now all, all good!"

She stretched out her arms to him, she wanted to smile but the tears sprang into her Eyes. "Where
it's so long walking around in the world?" she said.

And when he saw in her eyes, because he was frightened out of sheer joy, for there was his own Picture
but no picture, as it had stared him shortly before the copper kettle, no, a face so young and fresh
and funny that he had loud jubilation, he would have to all the world
can not koennen.-Da flowed from the street a stream of people into
the house, screaming and fencing with their hands.

"Here is the Lord of the bird!" cried a stocky little man; then pressed
towards Hinzelmeier.

This took the hand of the girl and asked, "What is it with the Ravens?"

"What is it?" said the fat man, "the Lord Mayor, he stole the wig !"--" Yes yes, "cried all,"
and now it is sitting outside on the roof gutter, the monster and
has the wig in the mouth and staring at their well-being wisdom through
his green spectacles glasses!

"
Hinzelmeier wanted to talk, but they took him in their midst and
pushed him against the door. With horror he felt the hand of the Virgin
Rose slip from his. So he came up with the Road.

Up on the eaves
of the house sat still and looked at the raven with his black eyes
lurking on the down coming out of the house.

     PRACTICAL JOKE ON THE OLD MAN--A LETTER FROM "DAISY"--

A young fellow who is pretty smart on general principles, and who is always in good humor,
went into a store the other morning limping and seemed to be broke up generally. The proprietor
asked him if he wouldn't sit down, and he said he couldn't very well, as his back was lame.
He seemed discouraged, and the proprietor asked him what was the matter. "Well," says he, as
he put his hand on his pistol pocket and groaned, "There is no encouragement for a boy to have
any fun nowadays. If a boy tries to play an innocent joke he gets kicked all over the house."
The store keeper asked him what had happened to disturb his hilarity. He said he had played
a joke on his father and had been limping ever since.

"You see, I thought the old man was a little spry. You know he is no spring chicken yourself;
and though his eyes are not what they used to be, yet he can see a pretty girl further than
I can. The other day I wrote a note in a fine hand and addressed it to him, asking him to meet
me on the corner of Wisconsin and Milwaukee streets, at 7:30 on Saturday evening, and signed
the name of 'Daisy' to it. At supper time Pa he was all shaved up and had his hair plastered
over the bald spot, and he got on some clean cuffs, and said he was going to the Consistory
to initiate some candidates from the country, and he might not be in till late. He didn't eat
much supper, and hurried off with my umbrella. I winked at Ma but didn't say anything. At 7:30
I went down town and he was standing there by the post-office corner, in a dark place. I went
by him and said, "Hello, Pa, what are you doing there?" He said he was waiting for a man. I
went down street and pretty soon I went up on the other corner by Chapman's and he was standing
there. You see, he didn't know what corner "Daisy" was going to be on, and had to cover all
four corners. I saluted him and asked him if he hadn't found his man yet, and he said no, the
man was a little late. It is a mean boy that won't speak to his Pa when he sees him standing
on a corner, I went up street and I saw Pa cross over by the drug store in a sort of a hurry,
and I could see a girl going by with a water-proof on, but she skited right along and Pa looked
kind of solemn, the way he does when I ask him for new clothes. I turned and came back and
he was standing there in the doorway, and I said, "Pa you will catch cold if you stand around
waiting for a man. You go down to the Consistory and let me lay for the man." Pa said, "never
you mind, you go about your business and I will attend to the man."

"Well, when a boy's Pa tells him to never you mind, and looks spunky, my experience is that
a boy wants to go right away from there, and I went down street. I thought I would cross over
and go up the other side, and see how long he would stay. There was a girl or two going up
ahead of me, and I see a man hurrying across from the drug store to Van Pelt's corner. It was
Pa, and as the girls went along and never looked around Pa looked mad and stepped into the
doorway. It was about eight o'clock then, and Pa was tired, and I felt sorry for him and I
went up to him and asked him for half a dollar to go to the Academy. I never knew him to shell
out so freely and so quick. He gave me a dollar, and I told him I would go and get it changed
and bring him back the half a dollar, but he said I needn't mind the change. It is awful mean
of a boy that has always been treated well to play it on his Pa that way, and I felt ashamed.
As I turned the corner and saw him standing there shivering, waiting for the man, my conscience
troubled me, and I told a policeman to go and tell Pa that "Daisy" had been suddenly taken
with worms, and would not be there that evening. I peeked around the corner and Pa and the
policeman went off to get a drink. I was glad they did cause Pa needed it, after standing around
so long. Well, when I went home the joke was so good I told Ma about it, and she was mad. I
guess she was mad at me for treating Pa that way. I heard Pa come home about eleven o'clock,
and Ma was real kind to him. She told him to warm his feet, cause they were just like chunks
of ice. Then she asked him how many they initiated in the Consistory, and he said six, and
then she asked him if they initiated "Daisy" in the Consistory, and pretty soon I heard Pa
snoring. In the morning he took me into the basement, and gave me the hardest talking to that
I over had, with a bed slat. He said he knew that I wrote, that note all the time, and he thought
he would pretend that he was looking for "Daisy," just to fool me. It don't look reasonable
that a man would catch epizootic and rheumatism just to fool his boy, does it? What did he
give me the dollar for? Ma and Pa don't seem to call each other pet any more, and as for me,
they both look at me as though I was a hard citizen. I am going to Missouri to take Jesse James's
place. There is no encouragement for a boy here. Well, good morning. If Pa comes in here asking
for me tell him that you saw an express wagon going to the morgue with the remains of a pretty
boy who acted as though he died from concussion of a bed slat on Peck's bad boy on the pistol
pocket. That will make Pa feel sorry. O, he has got the awfulest cold, though." And the boy
limped out to separate a couple of dogs that were fighting.

CHAPTER II.

     THE BAD BOY AT WORK AGAIN--THE BEST BOYS FULL OF TRICKS--THE
     OLD MAN LAYS DOWN THE LAW ABOUT JOKES--RUBBER-HOSE MACARONI--
     THE OLD MAN'S STRUGGLES--CHEWING VIGOROUSLY BUT IN VAIN--AN
     INQUEST HELD--REVELRY BY NIGHT--MUSIC IN THE WOODSHED--
     "'TWAS EVER THUS."

Of course all boys are not full of tricks, but the best of them are. That is, those who are
the readiest to play innocent jokes, and who are continually looking for chances to make Rome
howl, are the most apt to turn out to be first-class business men. There is a boy in the Seventh
Ward who is so full of fun that sometimes it makes him ache. He is the same boy who not long
since wrote a note to his father and signed the name "Daisy" to it, and got the old man to
stand on a corner for two hours waiting for the girl. After that scrape the old man told the
boy that he had no objection to innocent jokes, such as would not bring reproach upon him,
and as long as the boy confined himself to jokes that would simply cause pleasant laughter,
and not cause the finger of scorn to be pointed at a parent, he would be the last one to kick.
So the boy has been for three weeks trying to think of some innocent joke to play on his father.
The old man is getting a little near sighted, and his teeth are not as good as they used to
be, but the old man will not admit it. Nothing that anybody can say can make him own up that
his eyesight is failing, or that his teeth are poor, and he would bet a hundred dollars that
he could see as far as ever. The boy knew the failing, and made up his mind to demonstrate
to the old man that he was rapidly getting off his base.. The old person is very fond of macaroni,
and eats it about three times a week. The other day the boy was in a drug store and noticed
in a show case a lot of small rubber hose, about the size of sticks of macaroni, such as is
used on nursing bottles, and other rubber utensils. It was white and nice, and the boy's mind
was made up at once. He bought a yard of it, and took it home. When the macaroni was cooked
and ready to be served, he hired the table girl to help him play it on the old man. They took
a pair of shears and cut the rubber hose in pieces about the same length as the pieces of boiled
macaroni, and put them in a saucer with a little macaroni over the rubber pipes, and placed
the dish at the old man's plate. Well, we suppose if ten thousand people could have had reserved
seats and seen the old man struggle with the India rubber macaroni, and have seen the boy's
struggle to keep from laughing, they would have had more fun than they would at a circus, First
the old delegate attempted to cut the macaroni into small pieces, and failing, he remarked
that it was not cooked enough. The boy said his macaroni was cooked too tender, and that his
father's teeth were so poor that he would have to eat soup entirely pretty soon. The old man
said, "Never you mind my teeth, young man," and decided that he would not complain of anything
again. He took up a couple of pieces of rubber and one piece of macaroni on a fork and put
them in his mouth. The macaroni dissolved easy enough, and went down perfectly easy, but the
flat macaroni was too much for him. He chewed on it for a minute or two, and talked about the
weather in order that none of the family should see that he was in trouble, and when he found
the macaroni would not down, he called their attention to something out of the window and took
the rubber slyly from his mouth, and laid it under the edge of his plate. He was more than
half convinced that his teeth were played out, but went on eating something else for a while,
and finally he thought he would just chance the macaroni once more for luck, and he mowed away
another fork full in his mouth. It was the same old story. He chewed like a seminary girl chewing
gum, and his eyes stuck out and his face became red, and his wife looked at him as though afraid
he was going to die of apoplexy, and finally the servant girl burst out laughing, and went
out of the room with her apron stuffed in her mouth, and the boy felt as though it was unhealthy
to tarry too long at the table and he went out.

Left alone with his wife the old man took the rubber macaroni from his mouth and laid it on
his plate, and he and his wife held an inquest over it. The wife tried to spear it with a fork,
but couldn't make any impression on it, and then she see it was rubber hose, and told the old
man. He was mad and glad, at the same time; glad because he had found that his teeth where
not to blame, and mad because the grocer had sold him boarding house macaroni. Then the girl
came in and was put on the confessional, and told all, and presently there was a sound of revelry
by night, in the wood shed, and the still, small voice was saying, "O, Pa, don't! you said
you didn't care for innocent jokes. Oh!" And then the old man, between the strokes of the piece
of clap-board would say, "Feed your father a hose cart next, won't ye. Be firing car springs
and clothes wringers down me next, eh? Put some gravy on a rubber overcoat, probably, and serve
it to me for salad. Try a piece of overshoe, with a bone in it, for my beefsteak, likely. Give
your poor old father a slice of rubber bib in place of tripe to-morrow, I expect. Boil me a
rubber water bag for apple dumplings, pretty soon, if I don't look out. There! You go and split
the kindling wood." 'Twas ever thus. A boy cant have any fun now days.

CHAPTER III.

     THE BAD BOY GIVES HIS PA AWAY--PA IS A HARD CITIZEN--
     DRINKING SOZODONT--MAKING UP THE SPARE BED--THE MIDNIGHT
     WAR-DANCE--AN APPOINTMENT BY THE COAL BIN.

The bad boy's mother was out of town for a week, and when she came home she found everything
topsy turvey. The beds were all mussed up, and there was not a thing hung up anywhere. She
called the bad boy and asked him what in the deuce had been going on, and he made it pleasant
for his Pa about as follows:

"Well, Ma, I know I will get killed, but I shall die like a man. When Pa met you at the depot
he looked too innocent for any kind of use, but he's a hard citizen, and don't you forget it.
He hasn't been home a single night till after eleven o'clock, and he was tired every night,
and he had somebody come home with him."

"O, heavens, Hennery," said the mother, with a sigh, "are you sure about this?"

"Sure!" says the bad boy, "I was on to the whole racket. The first night they came home awful
tickled, and I guess they drank some of your Sozodont, cause they seemed to foam at the mouth.
Pa wanted to put his friend in the spare bed, but there were no sheets on it, and he went to
rumaging around in the drawers for sheets. He got out all the towels and table-cloths, and,
made up the bed with table-cloths, the first night, and in the morning the visitor kicked because
there was a big coffee stain on the table-cloth sheet. You know that tablecloth you spilled
the coffee on last spring, when Pa scared you by having his whiskers cut off. O, they raised
thunder around the room. Pa took your night-shirt, you know the one with the lace work all
down the front, and put a pillow in it, and set it on a chair, then took a burned match and
marked eyes and nose on the pillow, and put your bonnet on it, and then they had a war dance.
Pa hurt the bald spot on his head by hitting it against the gas chandelier, and then he said
dammit. Then they throwed pillows at each other. Pa's friend didn't have any night shirt, and
Pa gave his friend one of your'n, and the friend took that old hoop-skirt in the closet, the
one Pa always steps on when he goes in the close, after a towel and hurts his bare foot, you
know, and put it on under the night shirt, and they walked around arm in arm. O, it made me
tired to see a man Pa's age act so like a darn fool."

"Hennery," says the mother, with a deep meaning in her voice, "I want to ask you one question.
Did your Pa's friend wear a dress?"

"O, yes," said the bad boy, coolly, not noticing the pale face of his Ma, "the friend put on
that old blue dress of yours, with the pistol pocket in front, you know, and pinned a red cloth
on for a train, and they danced the can-can."

Just at this point Pa came home to dinner, and the bad boy said, "Pa, I was just telling Ma
what a nice time you had that first night she went away, with the pillows, and--"

"Hennery!" says the old gentleman severely, "you are a confounded fool."

"Izick," said the wife more severely, "Why did you bring a female home with you that night.
Have you got no--"

"O, Ma," says the bad boy, "it was not a woman. It was young Mr. Brown, Pa's clerk at the store,
you know."

"O!" said Mas with a smile and a sigh.

"Hennery," said his stern parent, "I want to see you there by the coal bin for a minute or
two. You are the gaul durndest fool I ever see. What you want to learn the first thing you
do is to keep your mouth shut," and then they went on with the frugal meal, while Hennery seemed
to feel as though something was coming.

CHAPTER IV.

     THE BAD BOY'S FOURTH OF JULY--PA IS A POINTER NOT A SETTER--
     SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY--A GRAND SUPPLY
     OF FIRE WORKS--THE EXPLOSION--THE AIR FULL OF PA AND DOG AND
     ROCKETS--THE NEW HELL--A SCENE THAT BEGGARS DESCRIPTION.

"How long do you think it will be before your father will be able to come down to the office?"
asked the druggist of the bad boy as he was buying some arnica and court plaster.

"O, the doc. says he could come down now if he would on some street where there were no horses
to scare," said the boy as he bought some gum, "but he says he aint in no hurry to come down
till his hair grows out, and he gets some new clothes made. Say, do you wet this court plaster
and stick it on?"

The druggist told him how the court plaster worked, and then asked him if his Pa couldn't ride
down town.

"Ride down? well, I guess nix. He would have to set down if he rode down town, and Pa is no
setter this trip, he is a pointer. That's where the pinwheel struck him."

"Well how did it all happen?" asked the druggist, as he wrapped a yellow paper over the bottle
of arnica, and twisted the ends, and then helped the boy stick the strip of court plaster on
his nose.

"Nobody knows how it happened but Pa, and when I come near to ask him about it he feels around
his night shirt where his pistol pocket would be if it was pants he had on, and tells me to
leave his sight forever, and I leave too, quick. You see he is afraid I will get hurt every
4th of July, and he told me if I wouldn't fire a fire-cracker all day he would let me get four
dollars' worth of nice fire-works and he would fire them off for me in the evening in the back
yard. I promised, and he gave me the money and I bought a dandy lot of fire-works, and don't
you forget it. I had a lot of rockets and Roman candles, and six pin-wheels, and a lot of nigger
chasers, and some of these cannon fire-crackers, and torpedoes, and a box of parlor matches.
I took them home and put the package in our big stuffed chair and put a newspaper over them.

"Pa always takes a nap in that stuffed chair after dinner, and he went into the sitting room
and I heard him driving our poodle dog out of the chair, and heard him ask the dog what he
was a-chewing, and just then the explosion took place, and we all rushed in there, I tell you
what I honestly think. I think that dog was chewing that box of parlor matches. This kind that
pop so when you step on them. Pa was just going to set down when the whole air was filled with
dog, and Pa, and rockets, and everything."

"When I got in there Pa had a sofa pillow trying to put the dog out, and in the meantime Pa's
linen pants were afire. I grabbed a pail of this indigo water that they had been rinsing clothes
with and throwed it on Pa, or there wouldn't have been a place on him biggern a sixpence that
wasn't burnt, and then he threw a camp chair at me and told me to go to Gehenna. Ma says that's
the new hell they have got up in the revised edition of the Bible for bad boys. When Pa's pants
were out his coat-tail blazed up and a Roman candle was firing blue and red balls at his legs,
and a rocket got into his white vest. The scene beggared description, like the Racine fire.
A nigger chaser got after Ma and treed her on top of the sofa, and another one took after a
girl that Ma invited to dinner, and burnt one of her stockings so she had to wear one of Ma's
stockings, a good deal too big for her, home. After things got a little quiet, and we opened
the doors and windows to let out the smoke and the smell of burnt dog hair, and Pa's whiskers,
the big fire crackers began to go off, and a policeman came to the door and asked what was
the matter, and Pa told him to go along with me to Gehenna, but I don't want to go with a policeman.
It would give me dead away. Well, there was nobody hurt much but the dog and Pa. I felt awful
sorry for the dog. He hasn't got hair enough to cover hisself. Pa, didn't have much hair anyway,
except by the ears, but he thought a good deal of his whiskers, cause they wasn't very gray.
Say, couldn't you send this anarchy up to the house? If I go up there Pa will say I am the
damest fool on record. This is the last 4th of July you catch me celebrating. I am going to
work in a glue factory, where nobody will ever come to see me."

And the boy went out to pick up some squib firecrackers, that had failed to explode, in front
of the drug store.

CHAPTER V.

     THE BAD BOY'S MA COMES HOME--NO DEVILTRY ONLY A LITTLE FUN--
     THE BAD BOY'S CHUM--A LADY'S WARDROBE IN THE OLD MAN'S ROOM--
     MA'S UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL--WHERE IS THE HUZZY?--DAMFINO!--THE
     BAD BOY WANTS TO TRAVEL WITH A CIRCUS.

"When is your ma coming back?" asked the grocery man, of the bad boy, as he found him standing
on the sidewalk when the grocery was opened in the morning, taking some pieces of brick out
of his coat tail pockets.

"O she got back at midnight, last night," said the boy, as he eat a few blue berries out of
a case. "That's what makes me up so early, Pa has been kicking at these pieces of brick with
his bare feet, and when I came away he had his toes in his hand and was trying to go back up
stairs on one foot. Pa haint got no sense."

"I am afraid you are a terror," said the grocery man, as he looked at the innocent face of
the boy, "You are always making your parents some trouble, and it is a wonder to me they don't
send you to some reform school. What deviltry were you up to last night to get kicked this
morning?"

"No deviltry, just a little fun. You see, Ma went to Chicago to stay a week, and she got tired,
and telegraphed she would be home last night, and Pa was down town and I forgot to give him
the dispatch, and after he went to bed, me and a chum of mine thought wo would have a 4th of July.

"You see, my chum has got a sister about as big as Ma, and we hooked some of her clothes and
after P got to snoring we put them in Pa's room. O, you'd a laffed. We put a pair of number
one slippers with blue stockings, down in front of the rocking chair, beside Pa's boots, and
a red corset on a chair, and my chum's sister's best black silk dress on another chair, and
a hat with a white feather on, on the bureau, and some frizzes on the gas bracket, and everything
we could find that belonged to a girl in my mum's sister's room. O, we got a red parasol too,
and left it right in the middle of the floor. Well, when I looked at the lay-out, and heard
Pa snoring, I thought I should die. You see, Ma knows Pa is, a darn good feller, but she is
easily excited. My chum slept with me that night, and when we heard the door bell ring I stuffed
a pillow in my mouth, There was nobody to meet Ma at the depot, and she hired a hack and came
right up. Nobody heard the bell but me, and I had to go down and let Ma in. She was pretty
hot, now you bet, at not being met at the depot. "Where's your father?" said she, as she began
to go up stairs.

"I told her I guessed Pa had gone to sleep by this time, but I heard a good deal of noise in
the room about an hour ago, and may be he was taking a bath. Then I slipped up stairs and looked
over the banisters. Ma said something about heavens and earth, and where is the huzzy, and
a lot of things I couldn't hear, and Pa said damfino and its no such thing, and the door slammed
and they talked for two hours. I s'pose they finally layed it to me, as they always do, 'cause
Pa called me very early this morning, and when I came down stairs he came out in the hall and
his face was redder'n a beet, and he tried to stab me with his big toe-nail, and if it hadn't
been for these pieces of brick he would have hurt my feelings. I see they had my chum's sister's
clothes all pinned up in a newspaper, and I s'pose when I go back I shall have to carry them
home, and then she will be down on me. I'll tell you what, I have got a good notion to take
some shoemaker's wax and stick my chum on my back and travel with a circus as a double headed
boy from Borneo. A fellow could have more fun, and not get kicked all the time."

And the boy sampled some strawberries in a case in front of the store and went down the street
whistling for his chum, who was looking out of an alley to see if the coast was clear.

CHAPTER VI.

     HIS PA IS A DARN COWARD--HIS PA HAS BEEN A MAJOR---HOW HE
     WOULD DEAL WITH BURGLARS--HIS BRAVERY PUT TO THE TEST--THE
     ICE REVOLVER--HIS PA BEGINS TO PRAY--TELLS WHERE THE CHANGE
     IS--"PLEASE MR. BURGLAR SPARE A POOR MAN'S LIFE!"--MA WAKES
     UP--THE BAD BOY AND HIS CHUM RUN--FISH-POLE SAUCE--MA WOULD
     MAKE A GOOD CHIEF OF POLICE.

"I suppose you think my Pa is a brave man," said the bad boy to the grocer, as he was trying
a new can opener on a tin biscuit box in the grocery, while the grocer was putting up some
canned goods for the boy, who said the goods where (sp.) for the folks to use at a picnic,
but which was to be taken out camping by the boy and his chum.

"O I suppose he is a brave man," said the grocer, as he charged the goods to the boy's father.
"Your Pa is called a major, and you know at the time of the reunion he wore a veteran badge,
and talked to the boys about how they suffered during the war."

"Suffered nothing," remarked the boy with a sneer, "unless they suffered from the peach brandy
and leather pies Pa sold them. Pa was a sutler, that's the kind of a veteran he was, and he
is a coward."

"What makes you think your Pa is a coward?" asked the grocer, as he saw the boy slipping some
sweet crackers into his pistol pocket.

"Well, my chum and me tried him last night, and he is so sick this morning that he can't get
up. You see, since the burglars got into Magie's, Pa has been telling what he would do if the
burglars got into our house. He said he would jump out of bed and knock one senseless with
his fist, and throw the other over the banister. I told my chum Pa was a coward, and we fixed
up like burglars, with masks on, and I had Pa's long hunting boots on, and we pulled caps down
over our eyes, and looked fit to frighten a policeman. I took Pa's meerschaum pipe case and
tied a little piece of ice over the end the stem goes in, and after Pa and Ma was asleep we
went in the room, and I put the cold muzzle of the ice revolver to Pa's temple, and when he
woke up I told him if he moved a muscle or said a word I would spatter the wall and the counterpane
with his brains. He closed his eyes and began to pray. Then I stood off and told him to hold
up his hands, and tell me where the valuables was. He held up his hands, and sat up in bed,
and sweat and trembled, and told us the change was in his left hand pants pocket, and that
Ma's money purse was in the bureau drawer in the cuff box, and my chum went and got them, Pa
shook so the bed fairly squeaked and I told him I was a good notion to shoot a few holes in
him just for fun, and he cried and said please Mr. Burglar, take all I have got, but spare
a poor old man's life, who never did any harm! Then I told him to lay down on his stomach and
pull the clothes over his head, and stick his feet over the foot board, and he did it, and
I took a shawl strap and was strapping his feet together, and he was scared, I tell you. It
would have been all right if Ma hadn't woke up. Pa trembled so Ma woke up and thought he had
the ager, and my chum turned up the light to see how much there was in Ma's purse, and Ma see
me, and asked me what I was doing and I told her I was a burglar, robbing the house. I don't
know whether Ma tumbled to the racket or not, but she threw a pillow at me, and said "get out
of here or I'll take you across my knee," and she got up and we run. She followed us to my
room, and took Pa's jointed fish pole and mauled us both until I don't want any more burgling,
and my chum says he will never speak to me again. I didn't think Ma had so much sand. She is
brave as a lion, and Pa is a regular squaw. Pa sent for me to come to his room this morning,
but I ain't well, and am going out to Pewaukee to camp out till the burglar scare is over.
If Pa comes around here talking about war times, and how he faced the enemy on many a well
fought field, you ask him if he ever threw any burglars down a banister. He is a frod (sp.),
Pa is, but Ma would make a good chief of police, and don't you let it escape you."

And the boy took his canned ham and lobster, and tucking some crackers inside the bosom of
his blue flannel shirt, started for Pewaukee, while the grocer looked at him as though he was
a hard citizen.

CHAPTER VII.

     HIS PA GETS A BITE--HIS PA GETS TOO MUCH WATER--THE DOCTOR'S
     DISAGREE--HOW TO SPOIL BOYS--HIS PA GOES TO PEWAUKEE IN
     SEARCH OF HIS SON--ANXIOUS TO FISH--"STOPER I'VE GOT A
     WHALE!"--OVERBOARD--HIS PA IS SAVED--GOES TO CUT A SWITCH--
     A DOLLAR FOR HIS PANTS.

"So the doctor thinks your Pa has ruptured a blood vessel, eh," says the street car driver
to the bad boy, as the youngster was playing sweet on him to get a free ride down town.

"Well, they don't know. The doctor at Pewaukee said Pa had dropsy, until he found the water
that they wrung out of his pants was lake water, and there was a doctor on the cars belonging
to the Insane Asylum, when we put Pa on the train, who said from the looks of his face, sort
of red and blue, that it was apoplexy, but a horse doctor that was down at the depot when we
put Pa in the carriage to take him home, said he was off his feed, and had been taking too
much water when he was hot, and got foundered. O, you can't tell anything about doctors. No
two of 'em guesses alike," answered the boy, as he turned the brake for the driver to stop
the car for a sister of charity, and then punched the mule with a fish pole, when the driver
was looking back, to see if he couldn't jerk her off the back step.

"Well, how did your Pa happen to fall out of the boat? Didn't he know the lake was wet?"

"He had a suspicion that it was damp, when his back struck the water, I think. I'll tell you
how it was. When my chum and I run away to Pewaukee, Ma thought we had gone off to be piruts,
and she told Pa it was a duty he owed to society to go and get us to come back, and be good.
She told him if he would treat me as an equal, and laugh and joke with me, I wouldn't be so
bad. She said kicking and pounding spoiled more boys than all the Sunday schools. So Pa came
out to our camp, about two miles up the lake from Pewaukee, and he was just as good natured
as though we had never had any trouble at all. We let him stay all night with us, and gave
him a napkin with a red border to sleep on under a tree, cause there was not blankets enough
to go around, and in the morning I let him have one of the soda crackers I had in my shirt
bosom and he wanted to go fishing with us. He said he would show us how to fish. So he got
a piece of pork rind at a farm house for bait, and put it on a hook, and we got in an old boat,
and my chum rowed and Pa and I trolled. In swinging the boat around Pa's line got under the
boat, and come right up near me. I don't know what possessed me, but I took hold of Pa's line
and gave it a "yank," and Pa jumped so quick his hat went off in the lake."

"Stoper," says Pa, "I've got a whale." It's mean in a man to call his chubby faced little boy
a whale, but the whale yanked again and Pa began to pull him in. I hung on, and let the line
out a little at a time, just zackly like a fish, and he pulled, and sweat, and the bald spot
on his head was getting sun burnt, and the line cut my hand, so I wound it around the oar-lock,
and Pa pulled hard enough to tip the boat over. He thought he had a forty pound musculunger,
and he stood up in the boat and pulled on that oar-lock as hard as he could. I ought not to
have done it, but I loosened the line from the oar-lock, and when it slacked up Pa went right
out over the side of the boat, and struck on his pants, and split a hole in the water as big
as a wash tub. His head went down under water, and his boot heels hung over in the boat. "What
you doin'? Diving after the fish?" says I as Pa's head came up and he blowed out the water.
I thought Pa belonged to the church, but he said "you damidyut."

"I guess he was talking to the fish. Wall, sir, my chum took hold of Pa's foot and the collar
of his coat and held him in the stern of the boat, and I paddled the boat to the shore, and
Pa crawled out and shook himself. I never had no ijee a man'-pants could hold so much water.
It was just like when they pull the thing on a street sprinkler. Then Pa took off his pants
and my chum and me took hold of the legs and Pa took hold of the summer kitchen, and we rung
the water out. Pa want so sociable after that, and he went back in the woods with his knife;
with nothing on but a linen duster and a neck-tie, while his pants were drying on a tree, to
cut a switch, and we hollered to him that a party of picnicers from Lake Side were coming ashore
right where his pants were, to pic-nic, and Pa he run into the woods. He was afraid there would
be some wimmen in the pic-nic that he knowed, and he coaxed us to come in the woods where he
was, and he said he would give us a dollar a piece and not be mad any more if we would bring
him his pants. We got his pants, and you ought to see how they was wrinkled when he put them
on. They looked as though they had been ironed with waffle irons. We went to the depot and
came home on a freight train, and Pa sneezed all the way in the caboose, and I don't think
he has ruptured any blood vessel. Well, I get off here at Mitchell's bank," and the boy turned
the brake and jumped off without paying his fare.

CHAPTER VIII.

     HE IS TOO HEALTHY. AN EMPTY CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE AND A BLACK
     EYE--HE IS ARRESTED--OCONOMOWOC FOR HEALTH--HIS PA IS AN OLD
     MASHER--DANCED TILL THE COWS CAME HOME--THE GIRL PROM THE
     SUNNY SOUTH--THE BAD BOY IS SENT HOME.

CHAPTER IX.

     HIS PA HAS GOT 'EM AGAIN! HIS PA IS DRINKING HARD--HE HAS
     BECOME A TERROR--A JUMPING DOG--THE OLD MAN IS SHAMEFULLY
     ASSAULTED--"THIS IS A HELLISH CLIMATE MY BOY!"--HIS PA
     SWEARS OFF--HIS MA STILL SNEEZING AT LAKE SUPERIOR.

'"If the dogs in our neighborhood hold out I guess I can do something that all the temperance
societies in this town have failed to do," says the bad boy to the grocery man, as he cut off
a piece of cheese and took a handful of crackers out of a box.

"Well for Heaven's sake, what have you been doing now, you little reprobate," asked the grocery
man, as he went to the desk and charged the boy's father with a pound and four ounces of cheese
and two pounds of crackers. "If you was my boy and played any of your tricks on me I would
maul the everlasting life out of you. Your father is a cussed fool that he dont send you to
the reform school. The hired girl was over this morning and says your father is sick, and I
should think he would be. What you done? Poisoned him I suppose."

"No, I didn't poison him; I just scared the liver out of him that's all."

"How was it," asked the groceryman, as he charged up a pound of prunes to the boy's father.

"Well, I'll tell you, but if you ever tell Pa I wont trade here any more. You see, Pa belongs
to all the secret societies, and when there is a grand lodge or anything here, he drinks awfully.
There was something last week, some sort of a leather apron affair, or a sash over the shoulder,
and every night he was out till the next day, and his breath smelled all the time like in front
of a vinegar store, where they keep yeast. Ever since Ma took her hay fever with her up to
Lake Superior, Pa has been a terror, and I thought something ought to be done. Since that variegated
dog trick was played on him he has been pretty sober till Ma went away, and I happened to think
of a dog a boy in the Third Ward has got, that will do tricks. He will jump up and take a man's
hat off, and bring a handkerchief, and all that. So I got the boy to come up on our street,
and Monday night, about dark, I got in the house and told the boy when Pa came along to make
the dog take his hat, and to pin a handkerchief to Pa's coat tail and make the dog take that,
and then for him and the dog to lite out for home. Well, you'd a dide. Pa came up the street
as dignified and important as though he had gone through bankruptcy, and tried to walk straight,
and just as he got near the door the boy pointed to Pa's hat and said, "Fetch it!" The dog
is a big Newfoundland, but he is a jumper, and don't you forget it. Pa is short and thick,
and when the dog struck him on the shoulder and took his hat Pa almost fell over, and then
he said get out, and he kicked and backed up toward the step, and then turned around and the
boy pointed to the handkerchief and said, "fetch it," and the dog gave one bark and went for
it, and got hold of it and a part of Pa's duster, and Pa tried to climb up the steps on his
hands and feet, and the dog pulled the other way, and it is an old last year's duster anyway,
and the whole back breadth come out, and when I opened the door there Pa stood with the front
of his coat and the sleeves on, but the back was gone, and I took hold of his arm, and he said,
"Get out," and was going to kick me, thinking I was a dog, and I told him I was his own little
boy, and asked him if anything was the matter, and he said, "M (hic) atter enough. New F (hic)
lanp dog chawing me last hour'n a half. Why didn't you come and k (hic) ill'em?" I told Pa
there was no dog at all, and he must be careful of his health or I wouldn't have no Pa at all.
He looked at me and asked me, as he felt for the place where the back of his linen duster was,
what had become of his coat-tail and hat if there was no dog, and I told him he had probably
caught his coat on that barbed wire fence down street, and he said he saw the dog and a boy
just as plain as could be, and for me to help him up stairs and go for the doctor. I got him
to the bed, and he said, "this is a hellish climate my boy," and I went for the doctor. Pa
said he wanted to be cauterised, so he wouldn't go mad. I told the doc. the Joke, and he said
he would keep it up, and he gave Pa some powders, and told him if he drank any more before
Christmas he was a dead man. Pa says it has learned him a lesson and they can never get any
more pizen down him, but don't you give me away, will you, cause he would go and complain to
the police about the dog, and they would shoot it. Ma will be back as soon as she gets through
sneezing, and I will tell her, and she will give me a cho-meo, cause she dont like to have
Pa drink only between meals. Well, good day. There's a Italian got a bear that performs in
the street, and I am going to find where he is showing, and feed the bear a cayenne pepper
lozenger, and see him clean out the Pollack settlement. Good bye."

And the boy went to look for the bear.

CHAPTER X.

     HIS PA HAS GOT RELIGION--THE BAD BOY GOES TO SUNDAY SCHOOL--
     PROMISES REFORMATION--THE OLD MAN ON TRIAL FOR SIX MONTHS--
     WHAT MA THINKS--ANTS IN PA'S LIVER-PAD--THE OLD MAN IN
     CHURCH--RELIGION IS ONE THING--ANTS ANOTHER.

"Well, that beats the devil," said the grocery man, as he stood in front of his grocery and
saw the bad boy coming along, on the way home from Sunday school, with a clean shirt on, and
a testament and some dime novels under his arm. "What has got into you, and what has come over
your Pa. I see he has braced up, and looks pale and solemn. You haven't converted him have you?"

"No, Pa has not got religion enough to hurt yet, but he has got the symptoms. He has joined
the church on prowbation, and is trying to be good so he can get in the church for keeps. He
said it was hell living the way he did, and he has got me to promise to go to Sunday school.
He said if I didn't he would maul me so my skin wouldn't hold water. You see, Ma said Pa had
got to be on trial for six months before he could get in the church, and if he could get along
without swearing and doing anything bad, he was all right, and we must try him and see if we
could cause him to swear. She said she thought a person, when they was on a prowbation, ought
to be a martyr, and try and overcome all temptations to do evil, and if Pa could go through
six months of our home life, and not cuss the hinges off the door, he was sure of a glorious
immortality beyond the grave. She said it wouldn't be wrong for me to continue to play innocent
jokes on Pa, and if he took it all right he was a Christian but if he got a hot box, and flew
around mad, he was better out of church than in it. There he comes now," said the boy as he
got behind a sign, "and he is pretty hot for a Christian. He is looking for me. You had ought
to have seen him in church this morning. You see, I commenced the exercises at home after breakfast
by putting a piece of ice in each of Pa's boots, and when he pulled on the boots he yelled
that his feet were all on fire, and we told him that it was nothing but symptoms of gout, so
he left the ice in his boots to melt, and he said all the morning that he felt as though he
had sweat his boots full. But that was not the worst. You know, Pa he wears a liver-pad. Well,
on Saturday my chum and me was out on the lake shore and we found a nest of ants, these little
red ants, and I got a pop bottle half full of the ants and took them home. I didn't know what
I would do with the ants, but ants are always handy to have in the house. This morning, when
Pa was dressing for church, I saw his liver-pad on a chair, and noticed a hole in it, and I
thought what a good place it would be for the ants. I don't know what possessed me, but I took
the liver-pad into my room, and opened the bottle, and put the hole over the mouth of the bottle
and I guess the ants thought there was something to eat in the liver-pad, cause they all went
into it, and they crawled around in the bran and condition powders inside of it, and I took
it back to Pa, and he put it on under his shirt, and dressed himself, and we went to church.
Pa squirmed a little when the minister was praying, and I guess some of the ants had come out
to view the landscape o'er. When we got up to sing the hymn Pa kept kicking, as though he was
nervous, and he felt down his neck and looked sort of wild, this way he did when he had the
jim-jams. When we sat down Pa couldn't keep still, and I like to dide when I saw some of the
ants come out of his shirt bosom and go racing around his white vest. Pa tried to look pious,
and resigned, but he couldn't keep his legs still, and he sweat mor'n a pail full. When the
minister preached about "the worm that never dieth," Pa reached into his vest and scratched
his ribs, and he looked as though he would give ten dollars if the minister would get through.
Ma she looked at Pa as though she would bite his head off, but Pa he just squirmed, and acted
as though his soul was on fire. Say, does ants bite, or just crawl around? Well, when the minister
said amen, and prayed the second round, and then said a brother who was a missionary to the
heathen would like to make a few remarks about the work of the missionaries in Bengal, and
take up a collection, Pa told Ma they would have to excuse him, and he lit out for home, slapping
himself on the legs and on the arms and on the back, and he acted crazy. Ma and me went home,
after the heathen got through, and found Pa in his bed room, with part of his clothes off,
and the liver-pad was on the floor, and Pa was stamping on it with his boots, and talking offul.

"What is the matter," says Ma.. "Don't your religion agree with you?"

"Religion be dashed," says Pa, as he kicked the liver pad. "I would give ten dollars to know
how a pint of red ants got into my liver pad. Religon is one thing, and a million ants walking
all over a man, playing tag, is another. I didn't know the liver pad was loaded. How in Gehenna
did they get in there?" and Pa scowled at Ma as though he would kill her.

"'Don't swear dear," says Ma, as she threw down her hymn book, and took off her bonnet. "You
should be patient. Remember Job was patient, and he was afflicted with sore boils."

"I don't care," says Pa, as he chased the ants out of his drawers, "Job never had ants in his
liver pad. If he had he would have swore the shingles off a barn. Here you," says Pa, speaking
to me, "you head off them ants running under the bureau. If the truth was known I believe you
would be responsible for this outrage." And Pa looked at me kind of hard.

"O, Pa," says I, with tears in my eyes, "Do you think your little Sunday school boy would catch
ants in a pop bottle on the lake shore, and bring them home, and put them in the hole of your
liver pad, just before you put it on to go to church? You are to (sp.) bad." And I shed some
tears. I can shed tears now any time I want to, but it didn't do any good this time. Pa knew
it was me, and while he was looking for the shawl strap I went to Sunday school, and now I
guess he is after me, and I will go and take a walk down to Bay View.

The boy moved off as his Pa turned a corner, and the grocery man said, "Well, that boy beats
all I ever saw. If he was mine I would give him away."

CHAPTER XI.

     HIS PA TAKES A TRICK--JAMAICA RUM AND CARDS--THE BAD BOY
     POSSESSED OF A DEVIL--THE KIND DEACON--AT PRAYER MEETING--
     THE OLD MAN TELLS HIS EXPERIENCE--THE FLYING CARDS--THE
     PRAYER MEETING SUDDENLY CLOSED.

"What is it I hear about your Pa being turned out of prayer meeting Wednesday night," asked
the grocer of the bad boy, as he came over after some cantelopes for breakfast, and plugged
a couple to see if they were ripe.

"He wasn't turned out of prayer meeting at all. The people all went away and Pa and me was
the last ones out of the church. But Pa was mad, and don't you forget it."

"Well, what seemed to be the trouble? Has your Pa become a backslider?"

"O, no, his flag is still there. But something seems to go wrong. You see, when we got ready
to go to prayer meeting last night. Pa told me to go up stairs and get him a hankerchief, and
to drop a little perfumery on it, and put it in the tail pocket of his black coat. I did it,
but I guess I got hold of the wrong bottle of fumery. There was a label on the fumery bottle
that said 'Jamaica Rum,' and I thought it was the same as Bay Rum, and I put on a whole lot.
Just afore I put the hankerchief in Pa's pocket, I noticed a pack of cards on the stand, that
Pa used to play hi lo-jack with Ma evenings when he was so sick he couldn't go down town, before
he got 'ligion, and I wrapped the hankercher around the pack of cards and put them in his pocket.
I don't know what made me do it, and Pa don't, either, I guess, 'cause he told Ma this morning
I was possessed of a devil. I never owned no devil, but I had a pair of pet goats onct, and
they played hell all around, Pa said. That's what the devil does, ain't it? Well, I must go
home with these melons, or they won't keep."

"But hold on," says the grocery man as he gave the boy a few rasins with worms in, that he
couldn't sell, to keep him, "what about the prayer meeting?"

"O, I like to forgot. Well Pa and me went to prayer meeting, and Ma came along afterwards with
a deakin that is mashed on her, I guess, 'cause he says she is to be pitted for havin' to go
through life yoked to such an old prize ox as Pa. I heard him tell Ma that, when he was helping
her put on her rubber waterprivilege to go home in the rain the night of the sociable, and
she looked at him just as she does at me when she wants me to go down to the hair foundry after
her switch, and said, "O, you dear brother," and all the way home he kept her waterprivilege
on by putting his arm on the small of her back. Ma asked Pa if he didn't think the deakin was
real kind, and Pa said, "yez, dam kind," but that was afore he got 'ligion. We sat in a pew,
at the prayer meeting, next to Ma and the deakin, and there was lots of pious folks all round
there. After the preacher had gone to bat, and an old lady had her innings, a praying, and
the singers had got out on first base, Pa was on deck, and the preacher said they would like
to hear from the recent convert, who was trying to walk in the straight and narrow way, but
who found it so hard, owing to the many crosses he had to bear. Pa knowed it was him that had
to go to bat, and he got up and said he felt it was good to be there. He said he didn't feel
that he was a full sized Christian yet, but he was getting in his work the best he could. He
said at times everything looked dark to him, and he feared he should falter by the wayside,
but by a firm resolve he kept his eye sot on the future, and if he was tempted to do wrong
he said get thee behind me, Satan, and stuck in his toe-nails for a pull for the right. He
said he was thankful to the brothers and sisters, particularly the sisters, for all they had
done to make his burden light, and hoped to meet them all in--When Pa got as far as that he
sort of broke down, I spose he was going to say heaven, though after a few minutes they all
thought he wanted to meet them in a saloon. When his eyes began to leak, Pa put his hand in
his tail pocket for his handkercher, and got hold of it, and gave it a jerk, and out came the
handkercher, and the cards. Well, if he had shuffled them, and Ma had cut them, and he had
dealt six hands, they couldn't have been dealt any better. They flew into everybody's lap.
The deakin that was with Ma got the jack of spades and three aces and a deuce, and Ma got some
nine spots and a king of hearts, and Ma nearly fainted, cause she didn't get a better hand,
I spose. The preacher got a pair of deuces, and a queen of hearts, and he looked up at Pa as
though it was a misdeal, and a old woman who sat across the aisle, she only got two cards,
but that was enough. Pa didn't see what he done at first, cause he had the handkerchief over
his eyes, but when he smelled the rum on it, he took it away, and then he saw everybody discarding,
and he thought he had struck a poker game, and he looked around as though he was mad cause
they didn't deal him a hand. The minister adjourned the prayer meeting and whispered to Pa,
and everybody went out holding their noses on account of Pa's fumery, and when Pa came home
he asked Ma what he should do to be saved. Ma said she didn't know. The deakin told her Pa
seemed wedded to his idols. Pa said the deakin better run his own idols, and Pa would run his.
I don't know how it is going to turn out, but Pa says he is going to stick to the church."

CHAPTER XII.

     HIS PA GETS PULLED. THE OLD MAN STUDIES THE BIBLE--DANIEL IN
     THE LION'S DEN--THE MULE AND THE MULE'S FATHER--MURDER IN
     THE THIRD WARD--THE OLD MAN ARRESTED--THE OLD MAN FANS THE
     DUST OUT OF HIS SON'S PANTS.

"What was you and your Ma down to the police station for so late last night?" asked the grocery
man of the bad boy, as he kicked a dog away from a basket of peaches standing on the sidewalk
"Your Ma seemed to be much affected."

"That's a family secret. But if you will give me some of those rotton peaches I will tell you,
if you won't ever ask Pa how he came to be pulled by the police."

The grocery man told him to help himself out of the basket that the dog had been smelling of,
and he filled his pockets, and the bosom of his flannel shirt, and his hat, and said:

"Well, you know Pa is studying up on the Bible, and he is trying to get me interested, and
he wants me to ask him questions, but if I ask him any questions that he can't answer, he gets
mad. When I asked him about Daniel in the den of lions, and if he didn't think Dan was traveling
with a show, and had the lions chloroformed, he said I was a scoffer, and would go to Gehenna.
Now I don't want to go to Gehenna just for wanting to get posted in the show business of old
times, do you? When Pa said Dan was saved from the jaws of the lions because he prayed three
times every day, and had faith, I told him that was just what the duffer that goes into the
lions den in Coup's circus did because I saw him in the dressing room, when me and my chum
got in for carrying water for the elephant, and he was exhorting with a girl in tights who
was going to ride two horses. Pa said I was mistaken, cause they never prayed in circus, 'cept
the lemonade butchers. I guess I know when I hear a man pray. Coup's Daniel talked just like
a deacon at class meeting, and told the girl to go to the place where the minister says we
will all go if we don't do different. Pa says it is wicked to speak of Daniel in the same breath
that you speak of a circus, so I am wicked I 'spose. Well, I couldn't help it and when he wanted
me to ask him questions about Elijah going up in a chariot of fire, I asked him if he believed
a chariot like the ones in the circus, with eight horses, could carry a man right up to the
clouds, and Pa said of course it could. Then I asked him what they did with the horses after
they got up there, or if the chariot kept running back and forth like a bust to a pic-nic,
and whether they had stalls for the horses and harness-makers to repair harnesses, and wagon-makers,
cause a chariot is liable to run off a wheel, if it strikes a cloud in turning a corner. Pa
said I made him tired. He said I had no more conception of the beauties of scripture than a
mule, and then I told Pa he couldn't expect a mule to know much unless the mule's father had
brought him up right, and where a mule's father had been a regular old bummer till he got jim-jams,
and only got religon to keep out of the inebriate asylum, that the little mule was entitled
to more charity for his short comings than the mule's Papa. That seemed to make Pa mad, and
he said the scripture lesson would be continued some other time, and I might go out and play,
and if I wasn't in before nine o'clock he would come after me and warm my jacket. Well, I was
out playing, and me and my chum heard of the murder in the Third Ward, and went down there
to see the dead and wounded, and it was after ten o'clock, and Pa was searching for me, and
I saw Pa go into an alley, in his shirt sleves and no hat on, and the police were looking for
the murderer, and I told the policeman that there was a suspicious looking man in the alley,
and the policeman went in there and jumped on his back, and held him down, and the patrol wagon
came, and they loaded Pa in, and he gnashed his teeth, and said they would pay dearly for this,
and they held his hands and told him not to talk, as he would commit himself, and they tore
off his suspender buttons, and I went home and told Ma the police had pulled Pa for being in
a suspicious place, and she said she had always been afraid he would come to some bad end,
and we went down to the station and the police let Pa go on promise that he wouldn't do so
again, and we went home and Pa fanned the dust out of my pants. But he did it in a pious manner,
and I can't complain. He was trying to explain to Ma how it was that he was pulled, when I
came away, and I guess he will make out to square himself. Say, don't these peaches seem to
have a darn queer taste. Well, good bye. I am going down to the morgue to have some fun."

CHAPTER XIII.

     HIS PA GOES TO THE EXPOSITION. THE BAD BOY ACTS AS GUIDE--
     THE CIRCUS STORY--THE OLD MAN WANTS TO SIT DOWN--TRIES TO
     EAT PANCAKES--DRINKS SOME MINERAL WATER--THE OLD MAN FALLS
     IN LOVE WITH A WAX WOMAN--A POLICEMAN INTERFERES--THE LIGHTS
     GO OUT--THE GROCERY-MAN DON'T WANT A CLERK.

"Well, everything seems to be quiet over to your house this week," says the groceryman to the
bad boy, as the youth was putting his thumb into some peaches through the mosquito netting
over the baskets, to see if they were soft enough to steal, "I suppose you have let up on the
old man, haven't you?"

"O, no. We keep it right up. The minister of the church that Pa has joined says while Pa is
on probation it is perfectly proper for us to do everything to try him, and make him fall from
grace. The minister says if Pa comes out of his six months probation without falling by the
wayside he has got the elements to make the boss christian, and Ma and me are doing all we can."

"What was the doctor at your house for this morning?" asked the groceryman, "Is your Ma sick?"

"No, Ma is worth two in the bush. It's Pa that ain't well. He is having some trouble with his
digestion. You see he went to the exposition with me as guide, and that is enough to ruin any
man's digestion. Pa is near-sighted, and he said he wanted me to go along and show him things.
Well, I never had so much fun since Pa fell out of the boat. First we went in by the fountain,
and Pa never had been in the exposition building before. Last year he was in Yourip, and he
was astonished at the magnitude of everything. First I made him jump clear across the aisle
there, where the stuffed tigers are, by the fur place. I told him the keeper was just coming
along with some meat to feed the animals, and when they smelled the meat they just clawed things.
He run against a show-case, and then wanted to go away.

"He said he traveled with a circus when he was young, and nobody knew the dangers of fooling
around wild animals better than he did. He said once he fought with seven tigers and two Nubian
lions for five hours, with Mabee's old show. I asked him if that was afore he got religin,
and he said never you mind. He is an old liar, even if he is converted. Ma says he never was
with a circus, and she has known him ever since he wore short dresses. Wall, you would a dide
to see Pa there by the furniture place, where they have got beautiful beds and chairs. There
was one blue chair under a glass case, all velvet, and a sign was over it, telling people to
keep their hands off. Pa asked me what the sign was, and I told him it said ladies and gentlemen
are requested to sit in the chairs and try them. Pa climbed over the railing and was just going
to sit down on the glass show case over the chair, when one of the walk-around fellows, with
imitation police hats, took him by the collar and yanked him back over the railing, and was
going to kick Pa's pants. Pa was mad to have his coat collar pulled up over his head, and have
the set of his coat spoiled, and he was going to sass the man, when I told Pa the man was a
lunatic from the asylum, that was on exhibition, and Pa wanted to go away from there. He said
he didn't know what they wanted to exhibit lunatics for. We went up stairs to the pancake bazar,
where they broil pancakes out of self rising flour, and put butter and sugar on them and give
them away. Pa said he could eat more pancakes than any man out of jail, and wanted me to get
him some. I took a couple of pancakes and tore out a piece of the lining of my coat and put
it between the pancakes and handed them to Pa, with a paper around the pancakes. Pa didn't
notice the paper nor the cloth, and it would have made you laff to see him chew on them. I
told him I guessed he didn't have as good teeth as he used to, and he said never you mind the
teeth, and he kept on until he swallowed the whole business, and he said he guessed he didn't
want any more. He is so sensitive about his teeth that he would eat a leather apron if anybody
told him he couldn't. When the doctor said Pa's digestion was bad, I told him if he could let
Pa swallow a seamstress or a sewing machine, to sew up the cloth, he would get well, and the
Doc. says I am going to be the death of Pa some day. But I thought I should split when Pa wanted
a drink of water. I asked him if he would druther have mineral water, and he said he guessed
it would take the strongest kind of mineral water to wash down them pancakes, so I took him
to where the fire extinguishers are, and got him to take the nozzle of the extinguisher in
his mouth, and I turned the faucet. I don't think he got more than a quart of the stuff out
of the saleratus machine down him, but he rared right up and said he be condamed if believed
that water was ever intended to drink, and he felt as though he should bust, and just then
the man who kicks the big organ struck up and the building shook, and I guess Pa thought he
had busted. The most fun was when we came along to where the wax woman is. They have got a
wax woman dressed up to kill, and she looks just as natural as if she could breathe. She had
a handkerchief in her hand, and as we came along I told Pa there was a lady that seemed to
know him. Pa is on the mash himself, and he looked at her and smiled and said good evening,
and asked me who she was.

"I told him it looked to me like the girl that sings in the choir at our church, and Pa said
corse it is, and he went right in where she was and said "pretty good show, isn't it," and
put out his hand to shake hands with her, but the woman who tends the stand came along and
thought Pa was drunk and said "old gentleman I guess you had better get out of here. This is
for ladies only."

"Pa said he didn't care nothing about her lady's only, all he wanted was to converse with an
acquaintance, and then one of the policemen came along and told Pa he had better go down to
the saloon where he belonged. Pa excused himself to the wax woman, and said he would see her
later, and told the policeman if he would come out on the sidewalk he would knock leven kinds
of stuffin out of him. The policeman told him that would be all right, and I led Pa away. He
was offul mad. But it was the best fun when the lights went out. You see the electric light
machine slipped a cog, or lost its cud, and all of a sudden the lights went out and it was
as dark as a squaw's pocket. Pa wanted to know what made it so dark, and I told him it was
not dark. He said boy don't you fool me. You see I thought it would be fun to make Pa believe
he was struck blind, so I told him his eyes must be wrong. He said do you mean to say you can
see, and I told him everything was as plain as day, and I pointed out the different things,
and explained them, and walked Pa along, and acted just as though I could see, and Pa said
it had come at last. He had felt for years as though he would some day lose his eyesight and
now it had come and he said he laid it all to that condamned mineral water. After a little
they lit some of the gas burners, and Pa said he could see a little, and wanted to go home,
and I took him home. When we got out of the building he began to see things, and said his eyes
were coming around all right. Pa is the easiest man to fool ever I saw."

"Well, I should think he would kill you," said the grocery man. "Don't he ever catch on, and
find out you have deceived him?"

"O, sometimes. But about nine times in ten I can get away with him. Say, don't you want to
hire me for a clerk?"

The grocery man said that he had rather have a spotted hyena, and the boy stole a melon and
went away.

CHAPTER XIV.

     HIS PA CATCHES OK--TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS IN THE BATH ROOM--
     RELIGION CAKES THE OLD MAN'S BREAST--THE BAD BOY'S CHUM--
     DRESSED UP AS A GIRL--THE OLD MAN DELUDED--THE COUPLE START
     FOR THE COURT HOUSE PARK--HIS MA APPEARS ON THE SCENE--"IF
     YOU LOVE ME KISS ME"--MA TO THE RESCUE--"I AM DEAD AM I?"
     HIS PA THROWS A CHAIR THROUGH THE TRANSOM.

"Where have you been for a week back," asked the grocery man of the bad boy, as the boy pulled
the tail board out of the delivery wagon accidentally and let a couple of bushels of potatoes
roll out into the gutter. "I haven't seen you around here, and you look pale. You haven't been
sick, have you?"

"No, I have not been sick. Pa locked me up in the bath-room for two days and two nights, and
didn't give me nothing to eat but bread and water. Since he has got religious he seems to be
harder than ever on me. Say, do you think religion softens a man's heart, or does it give him
a caked breast? I 'spect Pa will burn me at the stake next."

The grocery man said that when a man had truly been converted his heart was softened, and he
was always looking for a chance to do good and be kind to the poor, but if he only had this
galvanized religion, this roll plate piety, or whitewashed reformation, he was liable to be
a harder citizen than before. "What made your Pa lock you up in the bath-room on bread and
water?" he asked.

"Well," says the boy, as he eat a couple of salt pickles out of a jar on the sidewalk, "Pa
is not converted enough to hurt him, and I knowed it, and I thought it would be a good joke
to try him and see if he was so confounded good, so I got my chum to dress up in a suit of
his sister's summer clothes. Well, you wouldn't believe my chum would look so much like a girl.
He would fool the oldest inhabitant. You know how fat he is. He had to sell his bicycle to
a slim fellow that clerks in a store, cause he didn't want it any more. His neck is just as
fat and there are dimples in it, and with a dress low in the neck, and long at the trail he
looks as tall as my Ma. He busted one of his sister's slippers getting them on, and her stockings
were a good deal too big for him, but he tucked his drawers down in them and tied a suspender
around his leg above the knee, and they stayed on all right. Well, he looked killin', I should
prevaricate, with his sister's muslin dress on, starched as stiff as a shirt, and her reception
hat with a white feather as big as a Newfoundland dog's tail. Pa said he had got to go down
town to see some of the old soldiers of his regiment, and I loafed along behind. My chum met
Pa on the corner and asked him where the Lake Shore Park was. "She" said she was a stranger
from Chicago, that her husband had deserted her and she didn't know but she would jump into
the lake. Pa looked in my chum's eye and sized her up, and said it would be a shame to commit
suicide, and asked if she didn't want to take a walk, My chum said he should titter, and he
took Pa's arm and they walked up to the lake and back. Well, you may talk about joining the
church on probation all you please, but they get their arm around a girl all the same. Pa hugged
my chum till he says he thought Pa would break his sister's corset all to pieces, and he squeezed
my chum's hand till the ring cut right into his finger and he has to wear a piece of court
plaster on it. They started for the Court House park, as I told my chum to do, and I went and
got Ma. It was about time for the soldiers to go to the exposition for the evening bizness,
and I told Ma we could go down and see them go by. Ma just throwed a shawl over her head and
we started down through the park. When we got near Pa and my chum I told Ma it was a shame
for so many people to be sitting around lally-gagging right before folks, and she said it was
disgustin', and then I pointed to my chum who had his head on Pa's bosom, and Pa was patting
my chum on the cheek, while he held his other arm around his waist, They was on the iron seat,
and we came right up behind them and when Ma saw Pa's bald head I thought she would bust. She
knew his head as quick as she sot eyes on it."

"My chum asked Pa if he was married, and he said he was a widower, He said his wife died fourteen
years ago, of liver complaint. Well, Ma shook like a leaf, and I could hear her new teeth rattle
just like chewing strawberries with sand in them. Then my chum put his arms around Pa's neck
and said, "If you love me kiss me in the mouth." Pa was just leaning down to kiss my chum when
Ma couldn't stand it any longer, and she went right around in front of them, and she grabbed
my chum by the hair and it all came off, hat and all; and my chum jumped up and Ma scratched
him in the face, and my chum tried to get his hands in his pants pocket to get his handkerchief
to wipe off the blood on his nose, and Ma she turned on Pa and he turned pale, and then she
was going for my chum again when he said, "O let up on a feller," and he see she was mad and
he grabbed the hat and hair off the gravel walk and took the skirt of his sister's dress in
his hand and sifted out for home on a gallop, and Ma took Pa by the elbow and said, "You are
a nice old party, ain't you? I am dead, am I? Died of liver complaint fourteen years ago, did
I? You will find an animated corpse on your hands. Around kissing spry wimmen out in the night,
sir." When they started home Pa seemed to be as weak as a cat, and couldn't say a word, and
I asked if I could go to the exposition, and they said I could, I don't know what happened
after they got home, but Pa was setting up for me when I got back and he wanted to know what
I brought Ma down there for, and how I knew he was there.

"I thought it would help Pa out of the scrape and so I told him it was not a girl he was hugging
at all, but it was my chum, and he laffed at first, and told Ma it was not a girl, but Ma said
she knew a darn sight better. She guessed she could tell a girl.

"Then Pa was mad and he said I was at the bottom of the whole bizness, and he locked me up,
and said I was enough to paralyze a saint. I told him through the key-hole that a saint that
had any sense ought to tell a boy from a girl, and then he throwed a chair at me through the
transom. The worst of the whole thing is my chum is mad at me cause Ma scratched him, and he
says that lets him out. He don't go into any more schemes with me. Well, I must be going. Pa
is going to have my measure taken for a raw hide, he says, and I have got to stay at home from
the sparing match and learn my Sunday school lesson."

CHAPTER XV.

     HIS PA AT THE REUNION. THE OLD MAN IN MILITARY SPLENDOR--
     TELLS HOW HE MOWED DOWN THE REBELS--"I AND GRANT"--WHAT IS A
     SUTLER?--TEN DOLLARS FOR PICKELS!--"LET US HANG HIM!"--THE
     OLD MAN ON THE RUN--HE STANDS UP TO SUPPER--THE BAD BOY IS
     TO DIE AT SUNSET.

"I saw your Pa wearing a red, white, and blue badge, and a round red badge, and several other
badges, last week, during the reunion," said the grocery man to the bad boy, as the youth asked
for a piece of codfish skin to settle coffee with. "He looked like a hero, with his old black
hat, with a gold cord around it."

"Yes, he wore all the badges he could get, the first day, but after he blundered into a place
where there were a lot of fellows from his own regiment, he took off the badges, and he wasn't
very numerous around the boys the rest of the week. But he was lightning on the sham battle,"
says the boy.

"What was the matter? Didn't the old soldiers treat him well? Didn't they seem to yearn for
his society?" asked the grocery man, as the boy was making a lunch on some sweet crackers in
a tin cannister.

"Well, they were not very much mashed on Pa. You see, Pa never gets tired telling us about
how he fit in the army. For several years I didn't know what a sutler was, and when Pa would
tell about taking a musket that a dead soldier had dropped, and going into the thickest of
the light, and fairly mowing down the rebels in swaths the way they cut hay, I thought he was
the greatest man that ever was. Until I was eleven years old I thought Pa had killed men enough
to fill the Forest Home cemetery. I thought a sutler was something higher than a general, and
Pa used to talk about "I and Grant," and what Sheridan told him, and how Sherman marched with
him to the sea, and all that kind of rot, until I wondered why they didn't have pictures of
Pa on a white horse, with epaulets on, and a sword. One day at school I told a boy that my
Pa killed more men than Grant, and the boy said he didn't doubt it, but he killed them with
commissary whiskey. The boy said his Pa was in the same regiment that my Pa was sutler of,
and his Pa said my Pa charged him five dollars for a canteen of peppersauce and alcohol and
called it whiskey. Then I began to enquire into it, and found out that a sutler was a sort
of liquid peanut stand, and that his rank in the army was about the same as a chestnut roaster
on the sidewalk here at home. It made me sick, and I never had the same respect for Pa after
that. But Pa, don't care. He thinks he is a hero, and tried to get a pension on account of
losing a piece of his thumb, but when the officers found he was wounded by the explosion of
a can of baked beans, they couldn't give it to him. Pa was down town when the veterans were
here, and I was with him, and I saw a lot of old soldiers looking at Pa, and I told him they
acted as though they knew him, and he put on his glasses, and said to one of them, "How are
you Bill?" The soldier looked at Pa and called the other soldiers, and one said, That's the
old duffer that sold me the bottle of brandy peaches at Chickamauga, for three dollars, and
they eat a hole through my stummick. Another said, 'He's the cuss that took ten dollars out
of my pay for pickles that were put up in aqua fortis. Look at the corps badges he has on.'
Another said, 'The old whelp! He charged me fifty cents a pound for onions when I had the scurvy
at Atlanta.' Another said, 'He beat me out of my wages playing draw poker with a cold deck,
and the aces up his sleeve. Let us hang him.' By this time Pa's nerves got unstrung and began
to hurt him, and he said he wanted to go home, and when we got around the corner he tore off
his badges and threw them in the sewer, and said it was all a man's life was worth to be a
veteran now days. He didn't go down town again till next day, and when he heard a band playing
he would go around a block. But at the sham battle where there were no veterans hardly, he
was all right with the militia boys, and told them how he did when he was in the army. I thought
it would be fun to see Pa run, and so when one of the cavalry fellows lost his cap in the charge,
and was looking for it, I told the dragoon that the pussy old man over by the fence had stolen
his cap. That was Pa. Then I told Pa that the soldier on the horse said he was a rebel, and
he was going to kill him. The soldier started after Pa with his sabre drawn, and Pa started
to run, and it was funny you bet."

"The soldier galloped his horse, and yelled, and Pa put in his best licks, and run up the track
to where there was a board off the fence, and tried to get through, but he got stuck, and the
soldier put the point of his sabre on Pa's pants and pushed, and Pa got through the fence and
I guess he ran all the way home. At
the table should not happen. Never poking with a fork in the teeth, which is very indecent,
disgusting! Rinsing the mouth helps slightly.

In many houses it is the custom, after eating small, colored glass dishes and a glass beaker with
tepid water, mixed with a little pepper mint, introduce the guests.

This is appropriate and pleasant but not beautiful. Is it against you, so ceasing to use.

The
woman of the house stands on the board, because you have the exclusive right. It would be a
Guests queue very sick when he was getting up before the board, perhaps even with the family
blessing: "Blessed meal" The only thing is the lady of the house. It uses a decorous moment after
the end of the meal, perhaps a momentary Stagnation of general conversation, rises from her seat
and makes her the right neighbors and left a bow. Thus, the signal is given to the general collection.
The aforementioned family blessing is not usual for a long time. When he won here and there
is still applied, so that's just not a big mistake. Each master has, after to bow to both sides
with some polite words, the duty that he to him at the right hand lady sitting in the living
room leads back here with one of her Bow adopted and then visits the wife to her a few words
about binding . Say Should the latter be impossible, because the lady is just too much besieged,
so he failed also quiet, resented him, this is in any case and a subsequent Sorry it is not
necessary.

If after the end of the meal cigars are served, they must be to light only after the ladies in the
salon have been returned in order to take coffee. Young girls do well if they are extremely
careful with the wine and would rather go through the following coffee, served in the lounge will
participate. That they are absolutely forbidden liqueurs, is granted.

If no-smoking rooms available, one should establish a forum to do so.

                     

* * * * *

With the morning coffee table all appear clean and polished, washed,
combed! Nothing makes a bad impression if you unwashed fingers and
hands, shaggy hair, neglected Clothes during the show dining. You are all dressed up, and have got a clean shirt on, and your shoes
blacked, and I notice your pants are not raveled out so at the bottoms of the legs behind.
You are not in love are you?"

"Well, I should smile," said the boy, as he looked in a small mirror on the counter, covered
with fly specks. "A girl got mashed on me, and Ma says it is good for a boy who hasn't got
no sister, to be in love with a girl, and so I kind of tumbled to myself and she don't go no
where without I go with her. I take her to dancing school, and everywhere, and she loves me
like a house afire. Say, was you ever in love? Makes a fellow feel queer, don't it? Well sir,
the first time I went home with her I put my arm around her, and honest it scared me. It was
just like when you take hold of the handles of a lectric battery, and you can't let go till
the man turns the knob. Honest, I was just as weak as a cat. I thought she had needles in her
belt and was going to take my arm away, but it was just like it was glued on. I asked her if
she felt that way too, and she said she used to, but it was nothing when you got used to it.
That made me mad. But she is older than me and knows more about it. When I was going to leave
her at the gate, she kissed me, and that was worse than putting my arm around her. By gosh,
I trembled all over just like I had chills, but I was as warm as toast. She wouldn't let go
for much as a minute, and I was tired as though I had been carrying coal up stairs."

"I didn't want to go home at all, but she said it would be the best way for me to go home,
and come again the next day, and the next morning I went to her house before any of them were
up, and her Pa came out to let the cat in, and I asked him what time his girl got up, and he
laffed and said I had got it bad, and that I had better go home and not be picked till I got
ripe. Say, how much does it cost to get married?"

"Well, I should say you had got it bad," said the grocery man, as he set out a basket of beets.
"Your getting in love will be a great thing for your Pa. You won't have any time to play any
more jokes on him."

"O, I guess we can find time to keep Pa from being lonesome. Have you seen him this morning?
You ought to have seen him last night. You see, my chum's Pa has got a setter dog stuffed.
It is one that died two years ago, and he thought a great deal of it, and he had it stuffed,
for a ornament.

"Well, my chum and me took the dog and put it on our front steps, and took some cotton and
fastened it to the dog's mouth so it looked just like froth, and we got behind the door and
waited for Pa to come home from the theatre. When Pa started to come up the steps I growled
and Pa looked at the dog and said, "Mad dog, by crimus," and he started down the sidewalk,
and my chum barked just like a dog, and I "Ki-yi'd" and growled like a dog that gets licked,
and you ought to see Pa run. He went around in the alley and was going to get in the basement
window, and my chum had a revolver with some blank cartridges, and we went down in the basement
and when Pa was trying to open the window my chum began to fire towards Pa. Pa hollered that
it was only him, and not a burglar, but after my chum fired four shots Pa run and climbed over
the fence, and then we took the dog home and I stayed with my chum all night, and this morning
Ma said Pa didn't get home till four o'clock and then a policeman came with him, and Pa talked
about mad dogs and being taken for a burglar and nearly killed, and she said she was afraid
Pa had took to drinking again, and she asked me if I heard any firing of guns, and I said no,
and then she put a wet towel on Pa's head."

"You ought to be ashamed," said the grocery man "How does your Pa like your being in love with
the girl? Does he seem to encourage you in it?"

"Oh, yes, she was up to our house to borry some tea, and Pa patted her on the cheek and hugged
her and said she was a dear little daisy, and wanted her to sit in his lap, but when I wanted
him to let me have fifty cents to buy her some ice cream he said that was all nonsense. He
said: "Look at your Ma. Eating ice cream when she was a girl was what injured her health for
life." I asked Ma about it, and she said Pa never laid out ten cents for ice cream or any luxury
for her in all the five years he was sparking her. She says he took her to a circus once but
he got free tickets for carrying water for the elephant. She says Pa was tighter than the bark
to a tree. I tell you its going to be different with me. If there is anything that girl wants
she is going to have it if I have to sell Ma's copper boiler to get the money, What is the
use of having wealth if you hoard it up and don't enjoy it? This family will be run on different
principles after this, you bet. Say, how much are those yellow wooden pocket combs in the show
case? I've a good notion to buy them for her. How would one of them round mirrors, with a zinc
cover, do for a present for a girl? There's nothing too good for her."

"Go away from here now," said the grocery man to the bad boy, as he came into the store and
was going to draw some cider out of a barrel into a pint measure that had flies in it. "Get
right out of this place, and don't let me see you around here until the health officer says
you Pa has got over the small pox. I saw him this morning and his face is all covered with
postules, and they will have him in the pest house before night. You git," and he picked up
a butter tryer and went for the boy who took refuge behind a barrel of onions, and held up
his hands as though Jesse James had drawn a bead on him.

"O, you go and chase yourself. That is not small pox Pa has got. He had a fight with a nest
of hornets," said the boy.

"Hornets! Well, I'll be cussed," remarked the grocery man, as he put up the butter tryer, and
handed the boy a slice of rotten muskmelon. "How in the world did he get into a nest of hornets?
I hope you did not have anything to do with it."

The boy buried his face in the melon, until he looked as though a yellow gash had been cut
from his mouth to his ears, and after swallowing the melon, he said: "Well, Pa says I was responsible,
and he says that settles it, and I can go my way and he will go his. He said he was willing
to overlook everything I had done to make his life unbearable, but steering him onto a nest
of hornets, and then getting drunk, was too much, and I can go."

"What, you haven't been drunk," says the grocery man, "Great heavens, that will kill your poor
old father."

"O, I guess it won't kill him very much. He has been getting drunk for twenty years, and he
says he is healthier to-day than he ever was, since his liver has got to working again. You
see, Monday was a regular Indian summer day, and Pa said he would take me and my chum out in
the woods to gather hickory nuts, if we would be good. I said I would, and my chum said he
would, and we got a couple of bags and went away out to Wauwatosa, in the woods. We clubbed
the trees and got more nuts than anybody, and had a lunch, and Pa was just enjoying his relidgin
first rate. While Pa was taking a nap under a tree, my chum and me looked around and found
a hornets' nest on the lower limb of the tree we were sitting under, and my chum said it would
be a good joke to get a pole and run it into the hornet's nest, and then run. Honest, I didn't
think about Pa being under the tree, and I went into a field and got a hop pole, and put the
small end up into the nest, and gouged the nest a couple of times, and when the boss hornet
came out of the hole and looked sassy, and then looked back in the hole and whistled to the
other hornets to come out and have a circus, and they began to come out, my chum and me run
and climbed over a fence, and got behind a pile of hop poles that was stacked up."

"I guess the hornets saw my Pa just as quick as they got out of the nest, cause pretty soon
we heard Pa call to 'Helen Damnation,' or some woman we didn't know, and then he took his coat,
that he had been using for a pillow, and whipped around, and he slapped hisself on the shoulders,
and then took the lunch basket and pounded around like he was crazy, and bime-by he started
on a run towards town, holding his pants up, cause his suspenders was hanging down on his hips,
and I never see a fat man run so, and fan himself with a basket. We could hear him yell, 'come
on, boys. Hell is out for noon,' and he went over a hill, and we didn't see him any more. We
waited till near dark because we was afraid to go after the bags of nuts till the hornets had
gone to bed, and then we came home. The bags were awful heavy, and I think it was real mean
in Pa to go off and leave us, and not help carry the bags."

"I swan," says the grocery man, "You are too mean to live. But what about your getting drunk?"

"O, I was going to tell you. Pa had a bottle of liver medicine in his coat pocket, and when
he was whipping his hornets the bottle dropped out, and I picked it up to carry it home to
him. My chum wanted to smell of the liver medicine, so he took out the cork and it smelled
just like in front of a liquor store on East Water street, and my chum said his liver was bad,
too, and he took a swaller, and he said he should think it was enough to cut a feller's liver
up in slices, but it was good, and then I had a peculiar feeling in my liver, and my chum said
his liver felt better after he took a swaller, and and so I took a swaller, and it was the
offulest liver remedy I ever tasted. It scorched my throat just like the diptheria, but it
beats diptheria, or sore throat, all to pieces, and my chum and me laffed, we was so tickled.
Did you ever take liver medicine? You know how it makes you feel as if your liver had got on
top of your lights, and like you wanted to jump and holler. Well, sir, honest that liver medicine
made me dance a jig on the viaduct bridge, and an old soldier from the soldiers' home came
along and asked us what was the matter, and we told him about our livers, and the liver medicine,
and showed him the bottle, and he said he sposed he had the worst liver in the world, and said
the doctors at the home, couldn't cure him. It's a mean boy that won't help a nold vetran cure
his liver, so I told him to try Pa's liver remedy, and he took a regular cow swaller, and said,
'here's to your livers, boys.' He must have a liver bigger nor a cow's, and I guess it is better
now.

"Then my liver begun to feel curus again, and my chum said his liver was getting torpid some
more, and we both took another dose, and started home and we got generous, and give our nuts
all away to some boys. Say, does liver medicine make a feller give away all he has got? We
kept taking medicine every five blocks, and we locked arms and went down a back street and
sung 'O it is a glorious thing to be a pirut king,' and when we got home my heart felt bigger
nor a washtub and I thought p'raps my liver had gone to my head, and Pa came to the door with
his face tied up in towels, and some yellow stuff on the towels that smelted like anarchy,
and I slapped him on the shoulder and shouted, 'Hello, Gov., how's your liver,' and gave him
the bottle, and it was empty, and he asked me if we had been drinking that medicine and he
said he was ruined, and I told him he could get some more down to the saloon, and he took hold
of my collar and I lammed him in the ear, and he bounced me up stairs, and then I turned pale,
and had cramps, and I didn't remember any more till I woke up and the doctor was over me, and
Pa and Ma looked scared, and the Doc. had a tin thing like you draw water out of a country
cistern, only smaller, and Ma said if it hadn't been for the stomach pump she wouldn't have
had any little boy, and I looked at the knobs on Pa's face and I laffed and asked Pa if he
got into the hornets, too. Then the Doc. laffed, and Ma cried, and Pa swore, and I groaned,
and got sick again, and then they let me go to sleep again, and this morning I had the offulest
headache, and Pa's face looks like he had fell on a picket fence. When I got out I went to
my chum's house to see if they had got him pumped out, and his Ma drove me out with a broom,
and she says I will ruin every boy in the neighborhood. Pa says I was drunk and kicked him
in the groin when he fired me up stairs, and I asked him how I could be drunk just taking medicine
for my liver, and he said go to the devil, and I came over here. Say, give me a lemon to settle
my stomach."

"But, look-a-here," says the grocery man, as he gave the boy a little dried up lemon, about
as big as a prune, and told him he was a terror, "what is the matter of your eye winkers and
your hair? They seem to be burned off."

"O, thunder, didn't Pa tell you about the comet exploding and burning us all? That was the
worst thing since the flood, when Noar run the excursion boat from Kalamazoo to Mount Ararat.
You see we had been reading about the comet, which is visible at four o'clock in the morning,
and I heard Pa tell the hired girl to wake him and Ma up when she got up to set the pancakes
and go to early mass so they could, see the comet. The hired girl is a Cathlick, and she don't
make no fuss about it, but she has got more good, square relidgin than a dozen like Pa. It
makes a good deal of difference how relidgin affects different people, don't it. Now Pa's relidgin
makes him wild, and he wants to kick my pants, and pull my hair, but the hired girl's relidgin
makes her want to hug me, if I am abused, and she puts anarchy on my bruises, and gives me
pie. Pa wouldn't get up at four o'clock in the morning to go to early mass, unless he could
take a fish pole along and some angel worms. The hired girl prays when no one sees her but
God, but Pa wants to get a church full of sisterin', and pray loud, as though he was an auctioneer
selling tin razors. Say, it beats all what a difference liver medicine has on two people, too.
Now that hickory nut day, when me and my chum got full of Pa's liver medicine, I felt so good
natured I gave my hickory nuts away to the children, and wanted to give my coat and pants to
a poor tramp, but my chum, who ain't no bigger'n me, got on his ear and wanted to kick the
socks off a little girl who was going home from school. It's queer, ain't it. Well, about the
cornet. When I heard Pa tell the hired girl to wake him and Ma up, I told her to' wake me up
about half an hour before she waked Pa up, and then I got my chum to stay with me, and we made
a comet to play on Pa, you see my room is right over Pa's room, and I got two lengths of stove
pipe and covered them all over with phosphorus, so they looked just as bright at as a comet.
Then we got two Roman candles and a big sky rocket, and we were going to touch off the Roman
candles and the sky rocket just as Pa and Ma got to looking at the comet. I didn't know that
a sky rocket would kick back, did you? Well, you'd a dide to see that comet. We tied a piece
of white rubber garden hose to the stove pipe for a tail and went to bed, and when the girl
woke us up we laid for Pa and Ma. Pretty soon we heard Pa's window open, and I looked out,
and Pa and Ma had their heads and half their bodies out of the window. They had their night
shirts on and looked just like the pictures of Millerites waiting for the world to come to
an end. Pa looked up and seed the stove pipe and he said:

"Hanner, for God's sake, look up there. That is the damest comet I ever see. It is as bright
as day. See the tail of it. Now that is worth getting up to see."

"Just then my chum lit the two Roman candles and I touched off the rocket, and that's where
my eye winkers went. The rocket busted the joints of the stove pipe, and they fell down on
Pa, but Ma got her head inside before the comet struck, and wasn't hurt, but one length of
stove pipe struck Pa endways on the neck and almost cut a biscuit out of him, and the fire
and sparks just poured down in his hair, and burned his night shirt. Pa was scart. He thought
the world was coming to an end, and the window came down on his back, and he began to sing,
"Earth's but a desert drear, Heaven is my home." I see he was caught in the window, and I went
down stairs to put out the fire on his night shirt, and put up the window to let him in, and
he said, "My boy, your Ma and I are going to Heaven, but I fear you will go to the bad place,"
and I told him I would take my chances, and he better put on his pants if he was going anywhere
that there would be liable to be ladies present, and when he got his head in Ma told him the
world was not coming to an end, but somebody had been setting off fireworks, and she said she
guessed it was their dear little boy, and when I saw Pa feeling under the bed for a bed slat
I got up stairs pretty previous now, and don't you forget it, and Ma put cold cream on where
the sparks burnt Pa's shirt, and Pa said another day wouldn't pass over his head before he
had me in the Reform School. Well, if I go to the Reform School, somebody's got to pay attention,
you can bet your liver. A boy can't have any fun these days without everybody thinks he is
a heathen. What hurt did it do to play comet? It's a mean father that wont stand a little scorchin'
in the interests of science."

"What has your Pa got his jaw tied up for, and what makes his right eye so black and blue,"
asked the grocery man of the bad boy, as the boy came to bring some butter back that was strong
enough to work on the street. "You haven't hurt your poor old Pa, have you?"

"O, his jaw is all right now. You ought to have seen him when the gun was engaged in kicking
him," says the boy as he set the butter plate on the cheese box.

"Well, tell us about it. What had the gun against your Pa? I guess it was the son-of-a-gun
that kicked him," said the grocery man, as he winked at a servant girl who came in with her
apron over her head, after two cents worth of yeast.

"I'll tell you, if you will keep watch down street for Pa. He says he is dammed if he will
stand this foolishness any longer."

"What, does your father swear, while he is on probation?"

"Swear! Well, I should cackle. You ought to have heard him when he come to, and spit out the
loose teeth. You see, since Pa quit drinking he is a little nervous, and the doctor said he
ought to go out somewhere and get bizness off his mind, and hunt ducks, and row a boat, and
get strength, and Pa said shooting ducks was just in his hand, and for me to go and borrow
a gun, and I could go along and carry game. So I got a gun at the gun store, and some cartridges,
and we went away out west on the cars, more than fifty miles, and stayed two days. You ought
to seen Pa. He was just like a boy that was sick, and couldn't go to school. When we got out
by the lake he jumped up and cracked his heels together, and yelled. I thought he was crazy,
but he was only cunning. First I scared him nearly to death by firing off the gun behind him,
as we were going along the bank, and blowing off a piece of his coat-tail. I knew it wouldn't
hurt him, but he turned pale and told me to lay down that gun, and he picked it up and carried
it the rest of the way, and I was offul glad cause it was a heavy gun. His coat-tail smelled
like when you burn a rag to make the air in the room stop smelling so, all the forenoon. You
know Pa is a little near sighted but he don't believe it, so I got some of the wooden decoy
ducks that the hunters use, and put them in the lake, and you ought to see Pa get down on his
belly and crawl through the grass, to get up close to them.

"He shot twenty times at the wooden ducks, and wanted me to go in and fetch them out, but I
told him I was no retriever dog. Then Pa was mad, and said all he brought me along for was
to carry game, and I had come near shooting his hind leg off, and now I wouldn't carry ducks.
While he was coaxing me to go in the cold water without my pants on, I heard some wild geese
squawking, and then Pa heard them, and he was excited. He said you lay down behind the muskrat
house, and I will get a goose. I told him he couldn't kill a goose with that fine shot, and
I gave him a large cartridge the gun store man loaded for me, with a handful of powder in,
and I told Pa it was a goose cartridge, and Pa put it in the gun. The geese came along, about
a mile high, squawking, and Pa aimed at a dark cloud and fired. Well, I was offul scared, I
thought I had killed him."

"The gun just rared up and come down on his jaw, shoulder and everywhere, and he went over
a log and struck on his shoulder, the gun flew out of his hands, and Pa he laid there on his
neck, with his feet over the log, and that was the first time he didn't scold me since he got
relidgin. I felt offul sorry, and got some dirty water in my hat and poured it down his neck,
and laid him out, and pretty soon he opened his eyes and asked if any of the passengers got
ashore alive. Then his eye swelled out so it looked like a blue door-knob, and pa felt of his
jaw, and asked if the engineer and fireman jumped off, or if they went down with the engine.
He seemed dazed, and then he saw the gun, and he said take the dam thing away, it is going
to kick me again. Then he got his senses and wanted to know if he killed a goose, and I told
him no, but he nearly broke one's jaw, and then he said the gun kicked him when it went off,
and he laid down and the gun kept kicking him more than twenty times, when he was trying to
sleep. He went back to the tavern where we were stopping and wouldn't touch the gun, but made
me lug it. He told the tavern keeper that he fell over a wire fence, but I think he began to
suspect, after he spit the loose teeth out, that the gun was loaded for bear. I suppose he
will kill me some day. Don't you think he will?"

"Any coroner's jury would let him off and call it justifiable, if he should kill you. You must
be a lunatic. Has your Pa talked much about it since you got back?" asked the grocery man.

"Not much. You see he can't talk much without breaking his jaw. But he was able to throw a
chair at me. You see I thought I would joke him a little, cause when anybody feels bad a joke
kind of livens em up, so we were talking about Pa's liver, and Ma said he seemed to be better
since his liver had become more active, and I said, 'Pa, when you was a rolling over with the
gun chasing you, and kicking you every round, your liver was active enough, cause it was on
top half the time.' Then Pa throwed the chair at me. He says he believes I knew that cartridge
was loaded. But you ought to seen the fun when an old she deacon of Pa's church called to collect
some money to send to the heathens.

"Ma wasn't in, so Pa went to the parlor to stand her off, and when she see that Pa's face was
tied up, and his eye was black, and his jaw cracked, she held up both hands and said, 'O, my
dear brother, you have been drunk again. You have backslid. You will have to go back and commence
your probation all over again, and Pa said, 'Damfido,' and the old she deacon screamed and
went off without getting enough money to buy a deck of round cornered cards for the heathen.
Say, what does 'damfido,' mean? Pa has some of the queerest expressions, since he joined the
church."

CHAPTER XIX.

     HIS PA IS "NISHIATED"--ARE YOU A MASON?--NO HARM TO PLAY aT
     LODGE--WHY GOATS ARE KEPT IN STABLES--THE BAD BOY GETS THE
     GOAT UP STAIRS--THE GRAND BUMPER DEGREE--KYAN PEPPER ON THE
     GOAT'S BEARD--"BRING FORTH THE ROYAL BUMPER "--THE GOAT ON
     THE RAMPAGE.

"Say, are you a Mason, or a nodfellow, or anything?" asked the bad boy of the grocery man,
as he went to the cinnamon bag on the shelf and took out a long stick of cinnamon bark to chew. For
decades, Mr. von Hindenburg took the view that once the Russians would that they should be
forced into the Masurian Lakes. Other officers said the contrary, The Russians should not come near
the lakes. The goats are cheap ones, that have no life, and we muzzle them, and put
pillows over their heads, so they can't hurt anybody," says the grocery man, as he winked at
a brother Odd Fellow who was seated on a sugar barrel, looking mysterious, "But why do you ask?"

"O, nothin, only I wish me and my chum had muzzled our goat with a pillow. Pa would have enjoyed
his becoming a member of our lodge better. You see, Pa had been telling us how much good the
Masons and Odd Fellers did, and said we ought to try and grow up good so we could jine the
lodges when we got big, and I asked Pa if it would do any hurt for us to have a play lodge
in my room, and purtend to nishiate, and Pa said it wouldn't do any hurt. He said it would
improve our minds and learn us to be men. So my chum and me borried a goat that lives in a
livery stable. Say, did you know they keep a goat in a livery stable so the horses won't get
sick? They get used to the smell of the goat, and after that nothing can make them sick but
a glue factory. I wish my girl boarded in a livery stable, then she would get used to the smell.
I went home with her from church Sunday night, and the smell of the goat on my clothes made
her sick to her stummick, and she acted just like an excursion on the lake, and said if I didn't
go and bury myself and take the smell out of me she wouldn't never go with me again. She was
just as pale as a ghost, and the prespiration on her lip was just zif she had been hit by a
street sprinkler. You see my chum and me had to carry the goat up to my room when Pa and Ma
was out riding, and he blatted so we had to tie a handkerchief around his nose, and his feet
made such a noise on the floor that we put some baby's socks on his feet. Gosh, how frowy a
goat smells, don't it? I should think you Masons must have strong stummix, Why don't you have
a skunk or a mule for a trade mark. Take a mule, and annoint it with limburg cheese and you
could initiate and make a candidate smell just as bad as with a gosh darn mildewed goat.

"Well, my chum and me practiced with that goat until he could bunt the picture of a goat every
time. We borried a buck beer sign from a saloon man and hung it on the back of a chair, and
the goat would hit it every time. That night Pa wanted to know what we were doing up in my
room, and I told him we were playing lodge, and improving our minds, and Pa said that was right,
there was nothing that did boys of our age half so much good as to imitate men, and store by
useful nollidge. Then my chum asked Pa if he didn't want to come up and take the grand bumper
degree, and Pa laffed and said he didn't care if he did, just to encourage us boys in innocent
pastime, that was so improving to our intellex.

"We had shut the goat up in a closet in my room, and he had got over blatting, so we took off
the handkerchief, and he was eating some of my paper collars, and skate straps. We went up
stairs, and told Pa to come up pretty soon and give three distinct raps, and when we asked
him who comes there he must say, 'a pilgrim who wants to join your ancient order and ride the
goat.' Ma wanted to come up too, but we told her if she come in it would break up the lodge,
cause a woman couldn't keep a secret, and we didn't have any side saddle for the goat. Say,
if you never tried it, the next time you nitiate a man in your Mason's lodge you sprinkle a
little kyan pepper on the goat's beard just afore you turn him loose. You can get three times
as much fun to the square inch of goat. You wouldn't think it was the same goat. Well, we got
all fixed and Pa rapped, and we let him in and told him he must be blindfolded, and he got
on his knees a laffing and I tied a towel around his eyes, and then I turned him around and
made him get down on his hands also, and then his back was right towards the closet door, and
I put the buck beer sign right against Pa's clothes. He was a laffing all the time, and said
we boys were as full of fun as they made 'em, and we told him it was a solemn occasion, and
we wouldn't permit no levity, and if he didn't stop laffing we couldn't give him the grand
bumper degree."

"Then everything was ready, and my chum had his hand on the closet door, and some kyan pepper
in his other hand, and I asked Pa in low bass tones if he felt as though he wanted to turn
back, or if he had nerve enough to go ahead and take the degree. I warned him that it was full
of dangers, as the goat was loaded for bear, and told him he yet had time to retrace his steps
if he wanted to. He said he wanted the whole bizness, and we could go ahead with the menagerie.
Then I said to Pa that if he had decided to go ahead, and not blame us for the consequences,
to repeat after me the following: 'Bring forth the Royal Bumper and let him Bump.' Pa repeated
the words, and my chum sprinkled the kyan pepper on the goat's moustache, and he sneezed once
and looked sassy, and then he see the lager beer goat raring up, and he started for it, just
like a cow catcher, and blatted. Pa is real fat, but he knew he got hit, and he grunted, and
said, 'Hell's-fire, what you boys doin?'"

"And then the goat gave him another degree, and Pa pulled off the towel and got up and started
for the stairs, and so did the goat, and Ma was at the bottom of the stairs listening, and
when I looked over the banisters Pa and Ma and the goat were all in a heap, and Pa was yelling
murder, and Ma was screaming fire, and the goat was blatting, and sneezing, and bunting, and
the hired girl came into the hall and the goat took after her and she crossed herself just
as the goat struck her and said, 'Howly mother, protect me!' and went down stairs the way we
boys slide down hill, with both hands on herself, and the goat rared up and blatted, and Pa
and Ma went into their room and shut the door, and then my chum and me opened the front door
and drove the goat out. The minister, who comes to see Ma every three times a week, was just
ringing the bell and the goat thought he wanted to be nishiated too, and gave him one, for
luck, and then went down the sidewalk, blatting, and sneezing, and the minister came in the
parlor and said he was stabbed, and then Pa came out of his room with his suspenders hanging
down, and he didn't know the minister was there, and he said cuss words, and Ma cried and told
Pa he would go to hell sure, and Pa said he didn't care, he would kill that kussid goat afore
he went, and I told Pa the minister was in the parlor, and he and Ma went down and said the
weather was propitious for a revival, and it seemed as though an outpouring of the spirit was
about to be vouchsafed to His people, and none of them sot down but Ma, cause the goat didn't
hit her, and while they were talking relidgin, with their mouths, and kussin the goat inwardly,
my chum and me adjourned the lodge, and I went and stayed with him all night, and I haven't
been home since. But I don't believe Pa will lick me, cause he said he would not hold us responsible
for the consequences. He ordered the goat hisself, and we filled the order, don't you see?
Well, I guess I will go and sneak in the back way, and find out from the hired girl how the
land lays. She won't go back on me, cause the goat was not loaded for hired girls. She just
happened to get in at the wrong time. Good bye, sir, Remember and give your goat kyan pepper
in your lodge."

As the boy went away, and skipped over the back fence, the grocery man said to his brother
odd fellow,

"If that boy don't beat the devil then I never saw one that did. The old man ought to have
him sent to a lunatic asylum."

"Now you git right away from here," said the grocery man to the bad boy, as he came in with
a hungry look on his face, and a wild light in his eye. "I am afraid of you. I wouldn't be
surprised to see you go off half cocked and blow us all up. I think you are a devil. You may
have a billy goat, or a shot gun or a bottle of poison concealed about you. Condemn you, the
police ought to muzzle you. You will kill somebody yet. Here take a handful of prunes and go
off somewhere and enjoy yourself, and keep away from here," and the grocery man went on sorting
potatoes, and watching the haggard face of the boy. "What ails you anyway?" he added, as the
boy refused the prunes, and seemed to be sick to the stomach.

"O, I am a wreck," said the boy, as he grated his teeth, and looked wicked. "You see before
you a shadow. I have drank of the sweets of life, and now only the dregs remain. I look back
at the happiness of the past two weeks, during which I have been permitted to gaze into the
fond blue eyes of my loved one, and carry her rubbers to school for her to wear home when it
rained, to hear the sweet words that fell from her lips as she lovingly told me I was a terror,
and as I think it is all over, and that I shall never again place my arm around her waist,
I feel as if the world had been kicked off its base and was whirling through space, liable
to be knocked into a cocked hat, and I don't care a darn. My girl has shook me."

"Sho! You don't say so," says the grocery man as he threw a rotten potato into a basket of
good ones that were going to the orphan asylum. "Well, she showed sense. You would have blown
her up, or broken her neck, or something. But don't feel bad. You will soon find another girl
that will discount her, and you will forget this one."

"Never!" said the the boy, as he nibbled at a piece of codfish that he had picked off. "I shall
never allow my affections to become entwined about another piece of calico. It unmans me, sir.
Henceforth I am a hater of the whole girl race. From this out I shall harbor revenge in my
heart, and no girl can cross my path and live. I want to grow up to become a he school ma'am,
or a he milliner, or something, where I can. grind girls into the dust under the heel of a
terrible despotism, and make them sue for mercy. To think that girl, on whom I have lavished
my heart's best love and over thirty cents, in the past two weeks, could let the smell of a
goat on my clothes come between us, and break off, an acquaintance that seemed to be the forerunner
of a happy future, and say "ta-ta" to me, and go off to dancing school with a telegraph messenger
boy who wears a sleeping car porter uniform, is too much, and my heart is broken. I will lay
for that messenger some night, when he is delivering a message in our ward, and I will make
him think lightning has struck the wire and run in on his bench. O, you don't know anything
about the woe there is in this world. You never loved many people, did you?"

The grocery man admitted he never loved very hard, but he knew a little something about it
from-an aunt of his, who got mashed on a Chicago drummer. "But your father must be having a
rest while your whole mind is occupied with your love affair," said he.

"Yes," says the boy, with a vacant look, "I take no interest in the pleasure of the chase any
more, though I did have a little quiet fun this morning at the breakfast table. You see Pa
is the contrariest man ever was. If I complain that anything at the table don't taste good,
Pa says it is all right. This morning I took the syrup pitcher and emptied out the white syrup
and put in some cod liver oil that Ma is taking for her cough. I put some on my pancakes and
pretended to taste of it, and I told Pa the syrup was sour and not fit to eat. Pa was mad in
a second, and he poured out some on his pancakes, and said I was getting too confounded particular.
He said the syrup was good enough for him, and he sopped his pancakes in it and fired some
down his neck. He is a gaul durned hypocrite, that's what he is. I could see by his face that
the cod liver oil was nearly killing him, but he said that syrup was all right, and if I didn't
eat mine he would break my back, and by gosh, I had to eat it, and Pa said he guessed he hadn't
got much appetite, and he would just drink a cup of coffee and eat a donut.

"I like to dide, and that is one thing, I think, that makes this disappointment in love harder
to bear. But I felt sorry for Ma. Ma ain't got a very strong stummick, and when she got some
of that cod liver oil in her mouth she went right up stairs, sicker'n a horse, and Pa had to
help her, and she had noo-ralgia all the morning. I eat pickles to take the taste out of my
mouth, and then I laid for the hired girls. They eat too much syrup, anyway, and when they
got on to that cod liver oil, and swallowed a lot of it, one of them, a nirish girl, she got
up from the table and put her hand on her corset, and said, "howly Jaysus," and went out in
the kitchen, as pale as Ma is when she has powder on her face, and the other girl who is Dutch,
she swallowed a pancake and said, "Mine Gott, vas de matter from me," and she went out and
leaned on the coal bin, then they talked Irish and Dutch, and got clubs, and started to look
for me, and I thought I would come over here.

"The whole family is sick, but it is not from love, like my illness, and they will get over
it, while I shall fill an early grave, but not till I have made that girl and the telegraph
messenger wish they were dead. Pa and I are going to Chicago next week, and I'll bet we'll
have some fun. Pa says I need a change of air, and I think he is going to try and lose me.
It's a cold day when I get left anywhere that I can't find my way back, Well, good bye, old
rotten potatoes."

CHAPTEE XXI.

     HE AND HIS PA IN CHICAGO--NOTHING LIKE TRAVELING TO GIVE
     TONE--LAUGHING IN THE WRONG PLACE--A DIABOLICAL PLOT--HIS PA
     ARRESTED AS A KIDNAPPER--THE NUMBERS ON THE DOORS CHANGED--
     THE WRONG ROOM--"NOTHIN THE MAZZER WITH ME, PET!"--THE TELL-
     TALE HAT.

"What is this I hear about your Pa's being arrested in Chicago," said the grocery man to the
bad boy, as he came in with a can for kerosene and a jug for vinegar.

"Well, it was true, but the police let him go after they hit him a few licks and took him to
the station," said the boy, as he got the vinegar into the kerosene can, and the kerosene in
the jug. "You see, Pa and me went down there to stay over night, and have fun. Ma said she
druther we would be away then not when they were cleaning house, and Pa thought it would do
me good to travel, and sort of get tone, and he thought maybe I'd be better, and not play jokes,
but I guess it is born in me. Do you know I actually think of mean things to do when I am in
the most solemn places. They took me to a funeral once; and I got to thinking what a stampede
there would be if the corpse would come to life and sit up in the coffin, and I snickered right
out, and Pa took me out doors and kicked my pants. I don't think he orter kicked me for it,
cause I didn't think of it a purpose. Such things have occurred, and I have read about them,
and a poor boy ought to be allowed to think, hadn't he?"

"Yes, but what about his being arrested. Never mind the funeral," said the grocery man, as
he took his knife and picked some of the lead out of the weights on the scales.

"We went down on the cars, and Pa had a headache, because he had been out all night electioneering
for the prohibition ticket, and he was cross, and scolded me, and once he pulled my ear cause
I asked him if he knew the girl he was winking at in a seat across the aisle. I didn't enjoy
myself much, and some men were talking about kidnapping children, and it gave me an ijee, and
just before I got to Chicago I went after a drink of water at the other end of the car, and
I saw a man who looked as though he wouldn't stand any fooling, and I whispered to him and
told him that the bald-headed man I was sitting with was taking me away from my home in Milwaukee,
and I mistrusted he was going to make a thief or a pickpocket of me. I said 's-h-h-h,' and
told him not to say anything or the man would maul me. Then I went back to the seat and asked
Pa to buy me a gold watch, and he looked mad and cuffed me on the ear. The man that I whispered
too got talking with some other men, and when we got off the cars at Chicago a policeman came
up to Pa and took him by the neck and said, 'Mr. Kidnapper, I guess we will run you in.' Pa
was mad and tried to jerk away, and the cop choked him, and another cop came along and helped,
and the passengers crowded around and wanted to lynch Pa, and Pa wanted to know what they meant,
and they asked him where he stole the kid, and he said I was his kid, and asked me if I wasn't,
and I looked scarred, as though I was afraid to say no, and I said 'Y-e-s S-e-r, I guess so.'
Then the police said the poor boy was scart, and they would take us both to the station, and
they made Pa walk spry, and when he held back they jerked him along. He was offul mad and said
he would make somebody smart for this, and I hoped it wouldn't be me. At the station they charged
Pa with kidnapping a boy from Milwaukee, and he said it was a lie, and I was his boy, and I
said of course I was, and the boss asked who told the cops Pa was a kidnapper, and they said
'damfino,' and then the boss told Pa he could go, but not to let it occur again, and Pa and
me went away. I looked so sorry for Pa that he never tumbled to me, that I was to blame. We
walked around town all day, and went to the stores, and at night Pa was offul tired, and he
put me to bed in the tavern and he went out to walk around and get rested. I was not tired,
and I walked all around the hotel. I thought Pa had gone to a theatre, and that made me mad,
and I thought I would play a joke on him. Our room was 210 and the next was 212, and there
was a old maid with a scotch terrier occupied 212. I saw her twice and she called me names,
cause she thought I wanted to steal her dog. That made me mad at her, and so I took my jack
knife and drew the tacks out of the tin thing that the numbers were painted on, and put the
old maid's number on our door and our number on her door, and then I went to bed. I tried to
keep awake, so as to help Pa if he had any difficulty, but I guess I got asleep, but woke up
when the dog barked. If the dog had not woke me up, the woman's scream would, and if that hadn't,
Pa would. You see, Pa came home from the theatre about 'leven, and he had been drinking. He
says everybody drinks when they go to Chicago, even the minister. Pa looked at the numbers
on the doors all along the hall till he found 210, and walked right in and pulled off his coat
and threw it on the lounge where the dog was. The old maid was asleep, but the dog barked,
and Pa said, 'That cussed boy has bought a dog.' and he kicked the dog, and then the old maid
said, 'what is the matter pet?'"

"Pa laffed and said, 'Nothin the mazzer with me, pet,' and then you ought to have heard the
yelling. The old maid covered her head and kicked and yelled, and the dog snarled and bit Pa
on the pants, and Pa had his vest off and his suspenders unbuttoned, and he got scared and
took his coat and vest and went out in the hall, and I opened our door and told Pa he was in
the wrong room, and he said he guessed he knowed it, and he came in our room and I locked the
door, and then the bell boy, and the porter, and the clerk came up to see what ailed the old
maid, and she said a burglar got in the room, and they found Pa's hat on the lounge, and they
took it and told her to be quiet and they would find the burglar. The bugler recognized
the danger. Quickly decided he blew the French withdrawal signal. The French were deceived, followed
the signal and turned back. The horn player was with the iron Cross awards.

The engine driver.

An Austrian engineer had to convey to a train with shooting pool. The Russian artillery had shelled
the message get away and train. Although they are far was removed, but hit the balls in close
proximity to the train and his valuable Charge was in serious danger. Then came the engineer
a good idea. As another Projectile exploded nearby, he quickly opened the steam valve, so that
the steam by force escaped and disappeared into the whole train in a white cloud. The Russians
in the distance had to think their bullets had blown the engine in the air. They put their
fire , and the train was saved.

The Front Page.

In a German school for girls, the decision has been made to fall victim to For use. Whoever did it
must appeal in the slightest in the Red Cross fund. In a short time
has a class collected 13 marks.

But the editor of the daily paper is replaced by the girls this class a letter of content: "It
costs us our pocket money, if you daily spend an extra edition, for
we must always pay in the slightest when we say The Front Page ".

The editor of the paper was sorry for the class and already the next day appeared in him a special
sheet.

The commonly understood language.

A German troops came under
heavy fighting in a French village just ingested. For 24 hours they
had had nothing to eat and the strongest hunger with raw potatoes
satisfied, they sometimes dug out of the field.

     SLEWED!--HIS PA UNDER THE MULES.

"Well, I guess I will go to hell. I will see you later," said the bad boy to the grocery man,
as he held a cracker under the faucet of the syrup keg, and then sat down on a soap box by
the stove and proceeded to make a lunch, while the grocery man charged the boy's father with
a gallon of syrup and a pound of crackers.

"What do you mean, you profane wretch, talking about meeting me later in Hades," said the indignant
grocery man. "I expect to pass by the hot place where you are sizzling, and go to the realms
of bliss, where there is one continued round of hap-hiness, and angels playing on golden harps,
and singing hymns of praise."

"Why, Pa says I will surely go to hell, and I thought you would probably be there, as it costs
something to get to heaven, and you can get to the other place for nothing. Say, you would
be a healthy delegate to go to heaven, with a lot of girl angels, wouldn't you, smelling of
frowy butter, as you always do, and kerosene, and herring, and bar soap, and cheese, and rotten
potatoes. Say, an angel wouldn't stay on the same golden street with you, without holding her
handkerchief to her nose, and you couldn't get in there, anyway, cause you would want to pay
your entrance fee out of the store.

"Say, you get out of here, condemn you. You are getting sassy. There is no one that is more
free hearted than I am," said the grocery man.

"O, give us a siesta. I am onto you bigger than an elevator. When they had the oyster sociable
at the church, you gave four pounds of musty crackers with worms in, and they tasted of kerosene,
and when the minister prayed for those who had generously contributed to the sociable, you
raised up your head as though you wanted them all to know he meant you. If a man can get to
heaven on four pounds of musty crackers, done up in a paper that has been around mackerel,
then what's the use of a man being good, and giving sixteen ounces to the pound? But, there,
don't blush, and cry. I will use my influence to get your feet onto the golden streets of the
New Jerusalem, but you have got to quit sending those small potatoes to our house, with a few
big ones on top of the basket. I'll tell you how it was that Pa told me I would go to hell.
You see Pa has been reading out of an old back number bible, and Ma and me argued with him
about getting a new revised edition. We told him that the old one was all out of style, and
that all the neighbors had the newest cut in bibles, with dolman sleeves, and gathered in the
back, and they put on style over us, and we could not hold up our heads in society when it
was known that we were wearing the old last year's bible. Pa kicked against it, but finally
got one. I thought I had as much right to change things in the revised bible, as the other
fellows had to change the old one, so I pasted some mottoes and patent medicine advertisements
in it, after the verses. Pa never reads a whole chapter, but reads a verse or two and skips
around. Before breakfast, the other morning, Pa got the new bible and started to read the ten
commandments, and some other things. The first thing Pa struck was, 'Verily I say unto you,
try St. Jacobs oil for rheumatism.' Pa looked over his specks at Ma, and then looked at me,
but I had my face covered with my hands, sort of pious. Pa said he didn't think it was just
the thing to put advertisements in the bible, but Ma said she didn't know as it was any worse
than to have a patent medicine notice next to Beecher's sermon in the religious paper. Pa sighed
and turned over a few leaves, and read, 'Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his
ox, if you love me as I love you no knife can cut our love in two.' That last part was a motto
that I got out of a paper of candy. Pa said that the sentiment was good, but he didn't think
the revisers had improved the old commandment very much. Then Pa turned over and read, 'Take
a little wine for the stomach's sake, and keep a bottle of Reed's Gilt Edged tonic on your
side-board, and you can defy malaria, and chills and fever.' Pa was hot. He looked at it again,
and noticed that the tonic commandment was on yellow paper, and the corner curled up, and Pa
took hold of it, and the paste that I stuck it on with was not good, and it come off, and when
I saw Pa lay down the bible, and put his spectacles in the case, and reach for the fire poker,
I knew he was not going to pray, and I looked out the window and yelled dog fight, and I lit
out, and Pa followed me as far as the sidewalk, and it was that morning when it was so slippery,
and Pa's feet slipped out from under him, and he stood on his neck, and slid around on his
ear, and the special providence of sleet on the sidewalk saved me. Say, do you believe in special
providence? What was the use of that sleet on the sidewalk, if it was not to save sinners?"

"O, I don't know anything about special providences," said the grocery man, "but I know you
have got two of your pockets filled with them boneless raisins since you have been talking,
and my opinion is you will steal. But, say, what is your Pa on crutches for? I see him hobbling
down town this morning. Has he sprained his ankle?"

"Well, I guess his ankle got sprained with all the rest. You see, my chum and me went bobbing,
and Pa said he supposed he used to be the greatest bobber, when he was a boy, that ever was.
He said he used to slide down a hill that was steeper than a church steeple. We asked him to
go with us, and we went to that street that goes down by the depot, and we had two sleds hitched
together, and there were mor'n a hundred boys, and Pa wanted to steer, and he got on the front
sled, and when we got about half way down the sled slewed, and my chum and me got off all right,
but Pa got shut up between the two sleds, and the other boys behind fell over Pa and one sled
runner caught him in the trowsers leg, and dragged him over the slippery ice clear to the bottom,
and the whole lay out run into the street car, and the mules got wild and kicked, and Pa's
suspenders broke, and when my chum and me got down there Pa was under the car, and a boy's
boots was in Pa's shirt bosom, and another boy was straddle of Pa's neck, and the crowd rushed
up from the depot, and got Pa out, and began to yell 'fire,' and 'police,' and he kicked at
a boy that was trying to get his sled out of the small of Pa's back, and a policeman came along
and pushed Pa and said, 'Go away from here, ye owld divil, and let the b'ys enjoy themselves,'
and he was going to arrest Pa, when me and my chum told him we would take Pa home. Pa said
the hill was not steep enough for him, or he wouldn't have fell off. He is offul stiff to-day:
but he says he will go skating with us next week, and show us how to skate. Pa means well,
but he don't realize that he is getting stiff and can't be as kitteny as he used to be. He
is very kind to me, If I had some fathers I would have been a broken backed, disfigured angel
long ago. Don't you think so?"

The grocery man said he was sure of it, and the boy got out with his boneless raisins, and
pocket full of lump sugar.

"Got any vaseline," said the bad boy to the grocery man, as he went into the store one cold
morning, leaving the door open, and picked up a cigar stub that had been thrown down near the
stove, and began to smoke it.

"Shut the door, dum you. Was you brought up in a saw mill? You'll freeze every potato in the
house. No, I haven't got vaseline. What do you want of vaseline?" said the grocery man, as
he set the syrup keg on a chair by the stove where it would thaw out.

"Want to rub it on Pa's legs," said the boy, as he tried to draw smoke through the cigar stub.

"What is the matter with your Pa's legs? Rheumatiz?"

"Wuss nor rheumatiz," said the boy, as he threw away the cigar stub and drew some cider in
a broken tea cup. "Pa has got the worst looking hind legs you ever saw. You see, since there
has been so many fires Pa has got offul scared, and he has bought three fire escapes, made
out of rope with knots in them, and he has been telling us every day how he could rescue the
whole family in case of fire. He told us to keep cool, whatever happened, and to rely on him.
If the house got on fire we were all to rush to Pa, and he would save us. Well, last night
Ma had to go to one of the neighbors, where they was going to have twins, and we didn't sleep
much, cause Ma had to come home twice in the night to get saffron, and an old flannel petticoat
that I broke in when I was a kid, cause the people where Ma went did not know as twins was
on the bill of fare, and they only had flannel petticoats for one. Pa was cross at being kept
awake, and told Ma he hoped when all the children in Milwaukee were born, and got grown up,
she would take in her sign and not go around nights and act as usher to baby matinees. Pa says
there ought to be a law that babies should arrive on the regular day trains, and not wait for
the midnight express. Well, Pa he got asleep, and he slept till about eight o'clock in the
morning, and the blinds were closed, and it was dark in his room, and I had to wait for my
breakfast till I was hungry as a wolf, and the girl told me to wake Pa up, so I went up stairs,
and I don't know what made me think of it, but I had some of this powder they make red fire
with in the theatre, that me and my chum had the 4th of July, and I put it in a washdish in
the bath-room, and I touched it off and hollered fire. I was going to wake Pa up and tell him
it was all right, and laugh at him. I guess there was too much fire, or I yelled too loud,
cause Pa jumped out of bed and grabbed a rope and rushed through the hall towards the back
window, that goes out on a shed. I tried to say something, but Pa ran over me and told me to
save myself, and I got to the back window to tell him there was no fire just as he let himself
out the window He had one end of the rope tied to the leg of the washstand, and he was climbing
down the back side of the shed by the kitchen, with nothing on but his nightshirt, and he was
the horriblest looking object ever was, with his legs flying and trying to stick his toenails
into the rope and the side of the house."

"I dont think a man looks well in society with nothing on but his nightshirt. I didn't blame
the hired girls for being scared when they saw Pa and his legs coming down outside the window,
and when they yelled I went down to the kitchen, and they said a crazy man with no clothes
but a pillow slip around his neck was trying to kick the window in, and they run into the parlor,
and I opened the door and let Pa in the kitchen. He asked me if anybody else was saved and
then I told him there was no fire, and he must have dreamed he was in hell, or somewhere. Well
Pa was astonished, and said he must be wrong in the head, and I left him thawing himself by
the stove while I went after his pants, and his legs were badly chilled, but I guess nothin'
was froze. He lays it all to Ma, and says if she would stay at home and let people run their
own baby shows, there would be more comfort in the house. Ma came in with a shawl over her
head, and a bowl full of something that smelled frowy, and after she had told us what the result
of her visit was, she sent me after vaseline to rub Pa's legs. Pa says that he has demonstrated
that if a man is cool and collected, in case of fire, and goes deliberately at work to save
himself, he will come out all right."

"Well, you are the meanest boy I ever heard of," said the grocery man. "But what about your
Pa's dancing a clog dance in church Sunday? The minister's hired girl was in here after some
codfish yesterday morning, and she said the minister said your Pa had scandalized the church
the worst way."

"O, he didn't dance in church. He was a little excited, that's all. You see, Pa chews tobacco,
and it is pretty hard on him to sit all through a sermon without taking a chew, and he gets
nervous. He always reaches around in his pistol pocket, when they stand up to sing the last
time, and feels in his tobacco box and gets out a chew, and puts it in his mouth when the minister
pronounces the benediction, and then when they get out doors he is all ready to spit. He always
does that. Well, my chum had a present, on Christmas, of a music box, just about as big as
Pa's tobacco box, and all you have to do is to touch a spring and it plays, 'She's a Daisy,
She's a Dumpling.' I borrowed it and put it in Pa's pistol pocket, where he keeps his tobacco
box, and when the choir got most through singing Pa reached his hand in his pocket and began
to fumble around for a chew. He touched the spring, and just as everybody bowed their heads
to receive the benediction, and it was so still you could hear a gum drop, the music box began
to play, and in the stillness it sounded as loud as a church organ. Well, I thought Ma would
sink. The minister heard it, and everybody looked at Pa, too, and Pa turned red, and the music
box kept up, 'She's a Daisy,' and the minister looked mad and said 'Amen,' and the people began
to put on their coats, and the minister told the deacon to hunt up the source of that worldly
music, and they took Pa into the room back of the pulpit and searched him, and Ma says Pa will
have to be churched. They kept the music box, and I have got to carry in coal to get money
enough to buy my chum a new music box. Well, I shall have to go and get that vaseline or Pa's
legs will suffer. Good day."
