  | For two years readers of AMAZING STORIES have literally   |
  | clamored for a sequel to the famous story, "The Skylark of   |
  | Space," which appeared exactly two years ago. Except that    |
  | "Skylark Three" is more thrilling, more exciting and even    |
  | more chockful of science than the other. Dr. Smith tells     |
  | about the story in his author's note far better than we can  |
  | do.                                                         |

AUTHOR'S NOTE:

To all profound thinkers in the realms of Science who may chance to read SKYLARK THREE, greetings:

I have taken certain liberties with several more or less commonly accepted theories, but I
assure you that those theories have not been violated altogether in ignorance. Some of them
I myself believe sound, others I consider unsound, still others are out of my line, so that
I am not well enough informed upon their basic mathematical foundations to have come to any
definite conclusion, one way or the other. Whether or not I consider any theory sound, I did
not hesitate to disregard it, if its literal application would have interfered with the logical
development of the story. In "The Skylark of Space" Mrs. Garby and I decided, after some discussion,
to allow two mathematical impossibilities to stand. One of these immediately became the target
of critics from Maine to California and, while no astronomer has as yet called attention to
the other, I would not be surprised to hear about it, even at this late date.

While I do not wish it understood that I regard any of the major features of this story as
likely to become facts in the near future--indeed, it has been my aim to portray the highly
improbable--it is my belief that there is no mathematical or scientific impossibility to be
found in "Skylark Three."
