was that he voted for the terrible annual conscriptions. "It had no sensible effect on the

[Footnote 3181: We can trace the effect of his attitude on the public in the police reports,
especially at the end of 1793, and beginning of the year 1794. (Archives Nationales, F 7, 31167
report of Charmont, Nivôse 6, year II.) "Robespierre gains singularly in public estimation,
especially since his speech in the Convention, calling on his colleagues to rally and crush
out the monsters in the interior, also in which he calls on all to support the new revolutionary
government with their intelligence and talents.... I have to state that I have everywhere heard
his name mentioned with admiration. They wound up by saying that it would be well for all members
of the Convention to adopt the measures presented by Robespierre."--(Report of Robin, Nivôse
8.) "Citizen Robespierre is honored everywhere, in all groupes and in the cafe's. At the Café
Manouri it was given out that his views of the government were the only ones which, like the
magnet, would attract all citizens to the Revolution. It is not the same with citizen Billaud-Varennes."
(Report of the Purveyor, Nivôse 9.) "In certain clubs and groups there is a rumor that Robespierre
is to be appointed dictator..... The people do justice to his austere virtues; it is noticed
that he has never changed his opinions since the Revolution began."]

of our Revolution.... Taking advantage of political tempests (the cabinet) aimed to effect
in exhausted and dismembered France a change of dynasty and to place the Duke of York on the
throne of Louis XVI.... Pitt....is an imbecile, whatever may be said of a reputation that has
been much too greatly puffed up. A man who, abusing the influence acquired by him on an island
placed haphazard in the ocean, is desirous of contending with the French people, could not
have conceived of such an absurd plan elsewhere than in a madhouse."--Cf. Ibid., XXX., 465.]

to be good, must sacrifice himself to the people.".... "Let this maxim be first adopted that
the people are good and that its delegates are corruptible.".. . XXX., 464. (Speech, Dec.25,
1793): "The virtues are the appanages of the unfortunate and the patrimony of the people."]

[Footnote 3187: Cf. passim, Hamel, "Histoire de Robespierre," 3 vols. An elaborate panegyric
full of details. Although eighty years have elapsed, Robespierre still makes dupes of people
through his attitudes and rhetorical flourishes. M. Hamel twice intimates his resemblance to
Jesus Christ. The resemblance, indeed, is that of Pascal's Jesuits to the Jesus of the Gospel.]

the Rosati club at Arras at 24, a member of the Arras Academy at 25. The Royal Society of Metz
awarded him a second prize for his discourse against the prejudice which regards the relatives
of condemned criminals as infamous. His eulogy of Gresset is not crowned by the Amiens Academy.
He reads before the Academy of Arras a discourse against the civil incapacities of illegitimate
children, and then another on reforms in criminal jurisprudence. In 1789, he is president of
the Arras Academy, and publishes an eulogy of Dupaty and an address to the people from Artois
on the qualities necessary for future deputies.]

[Footnote 31102: See his eulogy of Rousseau in the speech of May 7, 1794. (Buchez et Roux,
XXXII., 369.--Garat, 85. "I hoped that his selection of Rousseau for a model of style and the
constant reading of his works would exert some good influence on his character."]

Club, said that he resembled a "tailor of the ancient regime." La Réeveillère-Lepeaux, ´"Memoires."--Buchez

of Abbé Raynal's address.) "This is the first and only time I found Robespierre clear and even
eloquent.... He spun out his opening phrases as usual, which contained the spirit of his discourse,
and which, in spite of his accustomed rigmarole, produced the effect he intended."]

[Footnote 31104: Courrier de Provence, III., No. 52, (Oct. 7 and 8, 1789).--Buchez et Roux,
VI., 372. (Session of July 10, 1790.) Another similar blunder was committed by him on the occasion
of an American deputation. The president had made his response, which was "unanimously applauded."
Robespierre wanted to have his say notwithstanding the objections of the Assembly, impatient
at his verbiage, and which finally put him down. Amidst the laughter, "M. l'Abbé Maury demands
ironically the printing of M. Robespierre's discourse."]

[Footnote 31105: L. Villiers, 2.]

[Footnote 31106: Cf. his principal speeches in the constituent Assembly;--against martial law;
against the veto, even suspensive; against the qualification of the silver marc and in favor
of universal suffrage; in favor of admitting into the National Guard non-acting citizens; of
the marriage of priests; of the abolition of the death penalty; of granting political rights
to colored men; of interdicting the father from favoring any one of his children; of declaring
the "Constituants" ineligible to the Legislative Assembly, etc. On royalty: "The King is not
the representative but the clerk of the nation." On the danger of allowing political rights
to colored men: "Let the colonies perish if they cost you your honor, your glory, your liberty!"]

[Footnote 31107: Hamel, I., 76.77, (March, 1789). "My heart is an honest one and I stand firm;
I have never bowed beneath the yoke of baseness and corruption." He enumerates the virtues
that a representative of the Third Estate should possess (26, 83). He already shows his blubbering
capacity and his disposition to regard himself as a victim: "They undertake making martyrs
of the people's defenders. Had they the power to deprive me of the advantages they envy, could
they snatch from me my soul and the consciousness of the benefits I desire to confer on them."]

a living martyr to the Republic, at once the victim and the enemy of crime!" See this speech
in full.]

justificatory form, is his apotheosis.--Cf. Hamel, II., 212; Speech in the Jacobin club, (April

[Footnote 31112: Robespierre's devotees constantly attend at the Jacobin club and in the convention
to hear him speak and applaud him, and are called, from their condition and dress, "the fat
petticoats."]

[Footnote 31113: Buchez et Roux, XX., 197. (Meeting of Nov. I, 1792.)--"Chronique de Paris,"
Nov. 9, 1792, article by Condorcet. With the keen insight of the man of the world, he saw clearly
into Robespierre's character. "Robespierre preaches, Robespierre censures; he is animated,
grave, melancholy, deliberately enthusiastic and systematic in his ideas, and conduct. He thunders
against the rich and the great; he lives on nothing and has no physical necessities. His sole
mission is to talk, and this he does almost constantly... His characteristics are not those
of a religious reformer, but of the chief of a sect. He has won a reputation for austerity
approaching sanctity. He jumps up on a bench and talks about God and Providence. He styles
himself the friend of the poor; he attracts around him a crowd of women and 'the poor in spirit,
and gravely accepts their homage and worship.... Robespierre is a priest and never will be
anything else." Among Robespierre's devotees Madame de Chalabre must be mentioned, (Hamel,
I., 525), a young widow (Hamel, III., 524), who offers him her hand with an income of forty
thousand francs. "Thou art my supreme deity," she writes to him, "and I know no other on this
earth! I regard thee as my guardian angel, and would live only under thy laws."]

become the people's regenerator and instructor."]
