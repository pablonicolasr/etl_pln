'I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go up the shaft again, and
leave the Under-world alone. But even while I turned this over in my mind I continued to descend.
At last, with intense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a slender loophole
in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel
in which I could lie down and rest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped,
and I was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the unbroken darkness
had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air was full of the throb and hum of machinery
pumping air down the shaft.

'I do not know how long I lay. I was roused by a soft hand touching my face. Starting up in
the darkness I snatched at my matches and, hastily striking one, I saw three stooping white
creatures similar to the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating before
the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me impenetrable darkness, their eyes were
abnormally large and sensitive, just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they reflected
the light in the same way. I have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity, and
they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light. But, so soon as I struck a match
in order to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels, from
which their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion.

'I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently different from that of the
Over-world people; so that I was needs left to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight
before exploration was even then in my mind. But I said to myself, "You are in for it now,"
and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the noise of machinery grow louder. Presently
the walls fell away from me, and I came to a large open space, and striking another match,
saw that I had entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into utter darkness beyond the
range of my light. The view I had of it was as much as one could see in the burning of a match.

'Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose out of the dimness, and
cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim spectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The
place, by the by, was very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly shed blood
was in the air. Some way down the central vista was a little table of white metal, laid with
what seemed a meal. The Morlocks at any rate were carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember
wondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red joint I saw. It was all
very indistinct: the heavy smell, the big unmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in
the shadows, and only waiting for the darkness to come at me again! Then the match burned down,
and stung my fingers, and fell, a wriggling red spot in the blackness.

'I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such an experience. When I had
started with the Time Machine, I had started with the absurd assumption that the men of the
Future would certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances. I had come
without arms, without medicine, without anything to smoke--at times I missed tobacco frightfully--even
without enough matches. If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that glimpse
of the Underworld in a second, and examined it at leisure. But, as it was, I stood there with
only the weapons and the powers that Nature had endowed me with--hands, feet, and teeth; these,
and four safety-matches that still remained to me.

'I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark, and it was only with
my last glimpse of light I discovered that my store of matches had run low. It had never occurred
to me until that moment that there was any need to economize them, and I had wasted almost
half the box in astonishing the Upper-worlders, to whom fire was a novelty. Now, as I say,
I had four left, and while I stood in the dark, a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling
over my face, and I was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I fancied I heard the breathing
of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being
gently disengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The sense of these unseen
creatures examining me was indescribably unpleasant. The sudden realization of my ignorance
of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. I shouted
at them as loudly as I could. He spoke quietly to the pilot to direct their course toward a
group that came sweeping upon them, and the massed fire of the squadron was squarely into the oncoming
beaks that fell beneath them where the mirrors showed them crashing to the earth.

They were scattered now; the enemy was in wild disorder; and Blake spoke sharply to his aide.

"Break
formation," he ordered; "every ship for itself. Engage the enemy where they find them; shoot
down anything they see; prevent the enemy reforming!" But I had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the blackness
I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves, and pattering like the rain, as
they hurried after me.

'In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no mistaking that they were trying
to haul me back. I struck another light, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce
imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked--those pale, chinless faces and great, lidless,
pinkish-grey eyes!--as they stared in their blindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay
to look, I promise you: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck my
third. It had almost burned through when I reached the opening into the shaft. I lay down on
the edge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the
projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind, and I was violently tugged
backward. I lit my last match ... and it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing
bars now, and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the Morlocks and
was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed peering and blinking up at me: all
but one little wretch who followed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy.

'That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or thirty feet of it a deadly nausea
came upon me. I had the greatest difficulty in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful
struggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I felt all the sensations
of falling. At last, however, I got over the well-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin
into the blinding sunlight. I fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean. Then
I remember Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of others among the Eloi. Then,
for a time, I was insensible.

VII

'Now, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto, except during my night's anguish
at the loss of the Time Machine, I had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that
hope was staggered by these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought myself impeded by
the childish simplicity of the little people, and by some unknown forces which I had only to
understand to overcome; but there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of
the Morlocks--a something inhuman and malign. Instinctively I loathed them. Before, I had felt
as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out
of it. Now I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemy would come upon him soon.

'The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the new moon. Weena had put this
into my head by some at first incomprehensible remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now
such a very difficult problem to guess what the coming Dark Nights might mean. The moon was
on the wane: each night there was a longer interval of darkness. And I now understood to some
slight degree at least the reason of the fear of the little Upper-world people for the dark.
I wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that the Morlocks did under the new moon.
I felt pretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upper-world people might
once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their mechanical servants: but that
had long since passed away. The two species that had resulted from the evolution of man were
sliding down towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new relationship. They did it
as a standing horse paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport: because
ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the organism. But, clearly, the old order
was already in part reversed. The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages
ago, thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of the ease and the sunshine.
And now that brother was coming back changed! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson
anew. They were becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came into my head the memory
of the meat I had seen in the Under-world. It seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred
up as it were by the current of my meditations, but coming in almost like a question from outside.
I tried to recall the form of it. I had a vague sense of something familiar, but I could not
tell what it was at the time.

'Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their mysterious Fear, I was
differently constituted. I came out of this age of ours, this ripe prime of the human race,
when Fear does not paralyse and mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend myself.
Without further delay I determined to make myself arms and a fastness where I might sleep.
With that refuge as a base, I could face this strange world with some of that confidence I
had lost in realizing to what creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt I could never
sleep again until my bed was secure from them. I shuddered with horror to think how they must
already have examined me.

'I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but found nothing that commended
itself to my mind as inaccessible. All the buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to
such dexterous climbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the tall pinnacles
of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished gleam of its walls came back to my memory;
and in the evening, taking Weena like a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills towards
the south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or eight miles, but it must have been
nearer eighteen. I had first seen the place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively
diminished. In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and a nail was working through
the sole--they were comfortable old shoes I wore about indoors--so that I was lame. And it
was already long past sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted black against
the pale yellow of the sky.

'Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but after a while she desired me
to let her down, and ran along by the side of me, occasionally darting off on either hand to
pick flowers to stick in my pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at the last she
had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vase for floral decoration. At least she
utilized them for that purpose. And that reminds me! In changing my jacket I found...'

The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and silently placed two withered flowers,
not unlike very large white mallows, upon the little table. Then he resumed his narrative.

'As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the hill crest towards Wimbledon,
Weena grew tired and wanted to return to the house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant
pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to make her understand that
we were seeking a refuge there from her Fear. You know that great pause that comes upon things
before the dusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees. To me there is always an air of expectation
about that evening stillness. The sky was clear, remote, and empty save for a few horizontal
bars far down in the sunset. Well, that night the expectation took the colour of my fears.
In that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally sharpened. I fancied I could even feel
the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the Morlocks
on their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark. In my excitement I fancied
that they would receive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war. And why had they
taken my Time Machine?

'So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night. The clear blue of the distance
faded, and one star after another came out. The ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena's
fears and her fatigue grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed her.
Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her arms round my neck, and, closing her eyes, tightly
pressed her face against my shoulder. So we went down a long slope into a valley, and there
in the dimness I almost walked into a little river. This I waded, and went up the opposite
side of the valley, past a number of sleeping houses, and by a statue--a Faun, or some such
figure, minus the head. Here too were acacias. So far I had seen nothing of the Morlocks, but
it was yet early in the night, and the darker hours before the old moon rose were still to come.

'From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide and black before me. I hesitated
at this. I could see no end to it, either to the right or the left. Feeling tired--my feet,
in particular, were very sore--I carefully lowered Weena from my shoulder as I halted, and
sat down upon the turf. I could no longer see the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I was in doubt
of my direction. I looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide.
Under that dense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars. Even were there
no other lurking danger--a danger I did not care to let my imagination loose upon--there would
still be all the roots to stumble over and the tree-boles to strike against.

'I was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so I decided that I would not face
it, but would pass the night upon the open hill.

'Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her in my jacket, and sat
down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The hill-side was quiet and deserted, but from the
black of the wood there came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the stars,
for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of friendly comfort in their twinkling.
All the old constellations had gone from the sky, however: that slow movement which is imperceptible
in a hundred human lifetimes, had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But the
Milky Way, it seemed to me, was still the same tattered streamer of star-dust as of yore. Southward
(as I judged it) was a very bright red star that was new to me; it was even more splendid than
our own green Sirius. He covered his emotion with an affectation of disapproval as he swung back
toward McGuire.

"Captain?" he inquired. "Captain? Where do you get that captain stuff?"

He pointed to an emblem on his uniform, a design that was unfamiliar to the eyes of McGuire.

"You're
talking to an admiral now!--the first admiral of the newest branch
of your country's fighting service--commanding the first fleet of
the Space, ships of the United States of America!" He threw one arm
about the other's shoulders. And during these few revolutions all the activity,
all the traditions, the complex organizations, the nations, languages, literatures, aspirations,
even the mere memory of Man as I knew him, had been swept out of existence. Instead were these
frail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white Things of which I went
in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear that was between the two species, and for the first
time, with a sudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen might be.
Yet it was too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me, her face white and starlike
under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the thought.

'Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as I could, and whiled away
the time by trying to fancy I could find signs of the old constellations in the new confusion.
The sky kept very clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at times. Then, as
my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like the reflection of some colourless
fire, and the old moon rose, thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking it,
and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then growing pink and warm. No Morlocks
had approached us. Indeed, I had seen none upon the hill that night. And in the confidence
of renewed day it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable. I stood up and found
my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel; so I sat down
again, took off my shoes, and flung them away.

'I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and pleasant instead of black
and forbidding. We found some fruit wherewith to break our fast. We soon met others of the
dainty ones, laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature
as the night. And then I thought once more of the meat that I had seen. I felt assured now
of what it was, and from the bottom of my heart I pitied this last feeble rill from the great
flood of humanity. Clearly, at some time in the Long-Ago of human decay the Morlocks' food
had run short. Possibly they had lived on rats and such-like vermin. Even now man is far less
discriminating and exclusive in his food than he was--far less than any monkey. His prejudice
against human flesh is no deep-seated instinct. And so these inhuman sons of men----! I tried
to look at the thing in a scientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more remote
than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago. And the intelligence that
would have made this state of things a torment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These
Eloi were mere fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed upon--probably
saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena dancing at my side!

'Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon me, by regarding it as
a rigorous punishment of human selfishness. Man had been content to live in ease and delight
upon the labours of his fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword and excuse, and in
the fullness of time Necessity had come home to him. I even tried a Carlyle-like scorn of this
wretched aristocracy in decay. But this attitude of mind was impossible. However great their
intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim my sympathy,
and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation and their Fear.

'I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursue. My first was to secure
some safe place of refuge, and to make myself such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive.
That necessity was immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some means of fire, so
that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand, for nothing, I knew, would be more efficient
against these Morlocks. Then I wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of
bronze under the White Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I had a persuasion that if I
could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me I should discover the Time Machine
and escape. I could not imagine the Morlocks were strong enough to move it far away. Weena
I had resolved to bring with me to our own time. And turning such schemes over in my mind I
pursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling.

VIII

'I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about noon, deserted and falling
into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass remained in its windows, and great sheets of the green
facing had fallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high upon a turfy
down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was surprised to see a large estuary,
or even creek, where I judged Wandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then--though
I never followed up the thought--of what might have happened, or might be happening, to the
living things in the sea.

'The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed porcelain, and along the face
of it I saw an inscription in some unknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena
might help me to interpret this, but I only learned that the bare idea of writing had never
entered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, more human than she was, perhaps because
her affection was so human.

'Within the big valves of the door--which were open and broken--we found, instead of the customary
hall, a long gallery lit by many side windows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum.
The tiled floor was thick with dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was shrouded
in the same grey covering. Then I perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the
hall, what was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton. I recognized by the oblique feet
that it was some extinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper
bones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water had dropped through
a leak in the roof, the thing itself had been worn away. Further in the gallery was the huge
skeleton barrel of a Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards the side
I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away the thick dust, I found the
old familiar glass cases of our own time. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the
fair preservation of some of their contents.
