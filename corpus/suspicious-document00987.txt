Bishop Turner of Newberry Court House, in South Carolina, purchased a spelling book and secured
the services of an old white lady and a white boy, who in violation of the State law taught
him to spell as far as two syllables.[1] The white boy's brother stopped him from teaching
this lad of color, pointing out that such an instructor was liable to arrest. For some time
he obtained help from an old colored gentleman, a prodigy in sounds. At the age of thirteen
his mother employed a white lady to teach him on Sundays, but she was soon stopped by indignant
white persons of the community. When he attained the age of fifteen he was employed by a number
of lawyers in whose favor he ingratiated himself by his unusual power to please people. Thereafter
these men in defiance of the law taught him to read and write and explained anything he wanted
to know about arithmetic, geography, and astronomy.[2]

[Footnote 1: Bishop Turner says that when he started to learn there were among his acquaintances
three colored men who had learned to read the Bible in Charleston. And yet there are causes of
Astonishment, which may befal the Good, as well as the Bad.

IX. But then there is a +Conviction+, discovering the +Witch+, which must proceed from just and
sufficient proofs, and not from bare presumptions.

X. Scratching of the suspected party, and Recovery thereupon, with several other such weak Proofs;
as also, the fleeting of the suspected Party, thrown upon the Water; these Proofs are so far
from being sufficient, that some of them are, after a sort, practices of Witchcraft.

XI. The Testimony of some Wizzard, tho' offering to shew the Witches
Face in a Glass: This, I grant, may be a good Presumption, to cause
a strait Examination; but a sufficient Proof of Conviction it cannot
be. He was never without books during his stay with his master.[5] One of the
Grimké Sisters taught her little maid to read while brushing her young mistress's locks.[6]
Robert Harlan, who was brought up in the family of Honorable J.M. Harlan, acquired the fundamentals
of the common branches from Harlan's older sons.[7] The young mistress of Mrs. Ann Woodson
of Virginia instructed her until she could read in the first reader.[8] Abdy observed in 1834
that slaves of Kentucky had been thus taught to read. He believed that they were about as well
off as they would have been, had they been free.[9] Giving her experiences on a Mississippi
plantation, Susan Dabney Smedes stated that the white children delighted in teaching the house
servants. One night she was formally invited with the master, mistress, governess, and guests
by a twelve-year-old school mistress to hear her dozen pupils recite poetry. One of the guests
was quite astonished to see his servant recite a piece of poetry which he had learned for this
occasion.[10] Confining his operations to the kitchen, another such teacher of this plantation
was unusually successful in instructing the adult male slaves. Five of these Negroes experienced
such enlightenment that they became preachers.[11]

Planters themselves sometimes saw to the education of their slaves. Ephraim Waterford was bound
out in Virginia until he was twenty-one on the condition that the man to whom he was hired
should teach him to read.[1] Mrs. Isaac Riley and Henry Williamson, of Maryland, did not attend
school but were taught by their master to spell and read but not to write.[2] The master and
mistress of Williamson Pease, of Hardman County, Tennessee, were his teachers.[3] Francis Fredric
began his studies under his master in Virginia. I live by Neighbours that force me to produce
these undeserved Lines. But now, as when Mr. Wilson beholding a great Muster of Souldiers, had
it by a Gentleman then present, said unto him, Sir, I'll tell you a great Thing: Here is a
mighty Body of People; and there is not +Seven+ of them all, but what loves Mr. +Wilson+. That
gracious Man presently and pleasantly reply'd: Sir, I'll tell you as good a thing as that; here
is a mighty Body of People, and there is not so much as +One+ among them all, but Mr. +Wilson+
loves him. He remarked,
too, that such slaves were generally owned by the wealthy slaveholders, who had them schooled
when the enlightenment of the bondmen served the purposes of their masters.[7]

The enlightenment of the Negroes, however, was not limited to what could be accomplished by
individual efforts. In many southern communities colored schools were maintained in defiance
of public opinion or in violation of the law. Patrick Snead of Savannah was sent to a private
institution until he could spell quite well and then to a Sunday-school for colored children.[1]
Richard M. Hancock wrote of studying in a private school in Newbern, North Carolina;[2] John
S. Leary went to one in Fayetteville eight years;[3] and W.A. Pettiford of this State enjoyed
similar advantages in Granville County during the fifties. He then moved with his parents to
Preston County where he again had the opportunity to attend a special school.[4] About 1840,
J.F. Boulder was a student in a mixed school of white and colored pupils in Delaware.[5] Bishop
J.M. Brown, a native of the same commonwealth, attended a private school taught by a friendly
woman of the Quaker sect.[6] John A. Hunter, of Maryland, was sent to a school for white children
kept by the sister of his mistress, but his second master said that Hunter should not have
been allowed to study and stopped his attendance.[7] Francis L. Cardozo of Charleston, South
Carolina, entered school there in 1842 and continued his studies until he was twelve years
of age.[8] During the fifties J.W. Morris of the same city attended a school conducted by the
then distinguished Simeon Beard.[9] In the same way T. McCants Stewart[10] and the Grimké brothers
[11] were able to begin their education there prior to emancipation.

More schools for slaves existed than white men knew of, for it was difficult to find them.
Fredrika Bremer heard of secret schools for slaves during her visit to Charleston, but she
had extreme difficulty in finding such an institution. Moreover, There are many parts of the World,
who if they do upon this Occasion insult over this People of God, need only to be told the Story of
what happen'd at Loim, in the Dutchy of Gulic, where a Popish Curate having ineffectually try'd
many Charms to Eject the Devil out of a Damsel there possessed, he passionately bid the Devil
come out of her into himself; but the Devil answered him, Quid mihi Opus, est eum tentare,
quem Novissimo die, Jure Optimo, sum possessurus?

Unsuspected by the slave power and undeterred by the terrors of the law, a colored woman by
the name of Deveaux had for thirty years conducted a Negro school in the city of Savannah.[4]

The city Negroes of Virginia continued to maintain schools despite the fact that the fear of
servile insurrection caused the State to exercise due vigilance in the execution of the laws. We
are under the Influence of a LIEUTENANT GOVERNOUR, who not only by being admirably accomplished
both with Natural and Acquired Endowments, is fitted for the Service of Their Majesties, but also with
an unspotted Fidelity applies himself to that Service.
Becoming suspicious that a school of this kind was maintained at the home of De Baptiste, the
police watched the place but failed to find sufficient evidence to close the institution before
it had done its work.[1]

[Footnote 1: Simmons, Men of Mark, p. 352.]

In 1854 there was found in Norfolk, Virginia, what the radically proslavery people considered
a dangerous white woman. It was discovered that one Mrs. Douglass and her daughter had for
three years been teaching a school maintained for the education of Negroes.[1] It was evident
that this institution had not been run so clandestinely but that the opposition to the education
of Negroes in that city had probably been too weak to bring about the close of the school at
an earlier date. Mrs. Douglass and her pupils were arrested and brought before the court, where
she was charged with violating the laws of the State. The defendant acknowledged her guilt,
but, pleading ignorance of the law, was discharged on the condition that she would not commit
the same "crime" again. Censuring the court for this liberal decision the Richmond Examiner
referred to it as offering "a very convenient way of getting out of the scrape." The editor
emphasized the fact that the law of Virginia imposed on such offenders the penalty of one hundred
dollars fine and imprisonment for six months, and that its positive terms "allowed no discretion
in the community magistrate."[2]

[Footnote 1: Parsons, Inside View of Slavery, p. 251; and Lyman, Leaven for Doughfaces, p. 43.]

[Footnote 2: 13th Annual Report of the American and Foreign Antislavery Societies, 1853, p. 143.]

All such schools, however, were not secretly kept. Writing from Charleston in 1851 Fredrika
Bremer made mention of two colored schools. One of these was a school for free Negroes kept
with open doors by a white master. Their books which she examined were the same as those used
in American schools for white children.[1] The Negroes of Lexington, Kentucky, had in 1830
a school in which thirty colored children were taught by a white man from Tennessee.[2] This
gentleman had pledged himself to devote the rest of his life to the uplift of his "black brethren."[3]
Travelers noted that colored schools were found also in Richmond, Maysville, Danville, and
Louisville decades before the Civil War.[4] William H. Gibson, a native of Baltimore, was after
1847 teaching at Louisville in a day and night school with an enrollment of one hundred pupils,
many of whom were slaves with written permits from their masters to attend.[5] Some years later
W.H. Stewart of that city attended the schools of Henry Adams, W.H. Gibson, and R.T.W. James.
Robert Taylor began his studies there in Robert Lane's school and took writing from Henry Adams.[6]
Negroes had schools in Tennessee also. And by the Presence and Power of the Divine Institutions
thus maintained in the Country, We are still so happy, that I suppose there is no Land in the
Universe more free from the debauching, and the debasing Vices of Ungodliness. The Body of the
People are hitherto so disposed, that Swearing, Sabbath-breaking, Whoring, Drunkenness, and the
like, do not make a Gentleman, but a Monster, or a Goblin, in the vulgar Estimation. All this
notwithstanding, we must humbly confess to our God, that we are miserably degenerated from the
first Love of our Predecessors; however we boast our selves a little, when Men would go to
trample upon us, and we venture to say, Wherein soever any is bold
(we speak foolishly) we are bold also. When preachers themselves dared not undertake
this task it was often done by their children, whose benevolent work was winked at as an indulgence
to the clerical profession. This charity, however, was not restricted to the narrow circle
of the clergy. Believing with churchmen that the Bible is the revelation of God, many laymen
contended that no man should be restrained from knowing his Maker directly.[1] Negroes, therefore,
almost worshiped the Bible, and their anxiety to read it was their greatest incentive to learn.
Many southerners braved the terrors of public opinion and taught their Negroes to read the
Scriptures. To this extent General Coxe of Fluvanna County, Virginia, taught about one hundred
of his adult slaves.[2] While serving as a professor of the Military Institute at Lexington,
Stonewall Jackson taught a class of Negroes in a Sunday-school.[3]

[Footnote 1: Orr, "An Address on the Need of Education in the South, 1879."]

[Footnote 2: This statement is made by several of General Coxe's slaves who are still living.]

[Footnote 3: School Journal, vol. lxxx., p. 332.]

Further interest in the cause was shown by the Evangelical Society of the Synods of North Carolina
and Virginia in 1834.[1] Later Presbyterians of Alabama and Georgia urged masters to enlighten
their slaves.[2] The attitude of many mountaineers of Kentucky was well set forth in the address
of the Synod of 1836, proposing a plan for the instruction and emancipation of the slaves.[3]
They complained that throughout the land, so far as they could learn, there was but one school
in which slaves could be taught during the week. The light of three or four Sabbath-schools
was seen "glittering through the darkness" of the black population of the whole State. Here
and there one found a family where humanity impelled the master, mistress, or children, to
the laborious task of private instruction. If a man, being dangerously sick, and like to dye, upon
Suspicion, will take it on his Death, that such a one hath bewitched
him, it is an Allegation of the same nature, which may move the Judge
to examine the Party, but it is of no moment for Conviction.
