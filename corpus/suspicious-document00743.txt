JACK HAYDON'S QUEST.

CHAPTER I.

THE ATTACK ON THE HEATH.

Jack Haydon, prefect of Rushmere School and captain of the first fifteen, walked swiftly out
of the school gates and turned along the high road. He had leave to go to the little town of
Longhampton, three miles away, to visit a day-scholar, a great friend of his, now on the sick list.

He was alone, and he swung along at a cracking pace, for he could walk as well as he could
run, and a finer three-quarter had never been known at Rushmere. He was a tall, powerful lad,
nearly nineteen years of age, five foot ten and a half inches in his stockings, and turning
the scale at twelve stone five. At the present moment he carried not an ounce of spare flesh,
for he was in training for the great match, Rushmere v. Repton, and his weight was compact
of solid bone, muscle, and sinew. As he stepped along the highway, moving with the easy grace
of a well-built athlete, he looked the very picture of a handsome English lad, at one of the
finest moments of his life, the point where youth and manhood meet.

The road he followed was called a high road, but the name clung to it from old use rather than
because of present service. Eighty years before it had been a famous coaching road, along which
the galloping teams had whirled the mails, but now it had fallen into decay, and was little
used except by people passing from Rushmere to Longhampton. A mile from the school it ran across
a lonely, unenclosed piece of heath, the side of the way being bordered by clumps of holly,
thorn, and furze.

Halfway across this desolate stretch of country, Jack was surprised by seeing a man step from
behind a thick holly bush and place himself directly in the lad's way. As Jack approached,
the man held up his hand.

"Stop," he said, "I want to speak to you."

Jack stopped in sheer surprise, and looked at the speaker in wonder. What could the man want
with him? At a glance he saw the man was not English, though upon closer examination he could
not place the type. The stranger's skin was darker than an Englishman's, but not darker than
many a Spaniard's. His eyes were large and black and liquid; their look was now crafty and
a trifle menacing; his hair was lank and intensely black. In build he was very slight, with
thin arms and legs. Jack's idea was that if he had been a little darker he might very well
have been a Hindoo.

"And what, my friend, may you want with me?" said Jack genially.

"This morning you received a letter from your father," said the dusky stranger.

"How under the sun do you know that?" asked Jack; "and what if I did? I don't see where your
interest comes in."

"I wish to see that letter. You had better hand it over at once."

"Don't you ever apply for a further stock of cheek, my little man," said Jack, "for you've
got all you need, and a little bit over."

"The letter is almost certainly in your pocket," said the stranger in perfect English, yet
pronounced with a curiously odd lisp and click, "and I must see it."

"It's in my pocket all right, confound your cheek," replied Jack, "and there it will stay.
Come, get a move on you, and clear out of my way."

"I shall not get out of your way," said the other. "I shall stop you until I have read the letter."

"I don't know what lunatic asylum is short of your cheerful presence to-day," remarked Jack,
"and if you don't clear out quick I shall certainly rush you. In which case, I beg you to observe
that I am, even if I say it myself, a pretty stiff tackler, and about three stone heavier than
you."

The man laughed mockingly and waved his hand, as if making very light of Jack's purpose.

"I assure you," he said in a soft voice, and giving once more his laugh of light mockery, "that
it would be much better for you to hand over the letter at once. I do not wish to hurt you,
but I have not the least objection to do so if it becomes necessary."

Jack's warm blood was fired at once, and he pulled himself together for a swift charge which
would fill this stranger with surprised regret for what he had brought upon himself. But, for
a second, something checked him; a strange, mysterious feeling came over him as he wondered
what lay behind all this. He stood, though he knew it not, at a great parting of the ways.
Behind him lay his happy days of triumph on the football meadow and the cricket field. How
was he to know that this dark, slight figure before him meant that a strange, new life was
opening out to him, a life of wild adventures in far-off lands, in lands where the memory of
English meadows would seem like thoughts and dreams of another life. Jack Haydon knew nothing
of this; yet he paused for a moment as some strange prevision seized upon him and held him
in its grip. Then he brushed away this odd influence, and was back at once in the present.

"For the last time, clear out," said Jack. The man laughed, and Jack made a swift leap at him.
They were not three yards apart, but Jack never reached his man. Without a sign, without a
sound, someone sprang upon him from behind, flung a cord over his head, and seized him in a
strangling grip. Jack was as strong as a young bull, but in this awful, noiseless clutch he
was helpless. He fought madly to throw off his unseen assailant, but he fought in vain. He
felt a noose close upon his throat, and his eyeballs began to start out and his head to swim.
In front of him stood the mysterious stranger, who had moved neither hand nor foot, and Jack's
last conscious recollection was of the quiet, smiling face, and the mocking laugh once more
rang in his ears. Suddenly the frightful, strangling clutch seemed to tighten, the blood drummed
madly in his ears as if every vein was bursting; then he knew no more.

When Jack Haydon came to himself, he found that he was in the same spot, and that someone was
chafing his hands and pouring water on his face. He gave a deep sigh, and a well-known voice
said: "Thank God, Haydon's coming round. Whatever could have been the matter with the poor
lad? What does this mark round his throat mean?"

Jack opened his eyes and saw Dr. Lawrence, the headmaster of Rushmere School, bending over
him. Near at hand stood Colonel Keppel, a gentleman residing in the neighbourhood. The Colonel
had been driving Dr. Lawrence back from Longhampton, and his trap stood close by. At the present
moment the Colonel held a hat from which water was dripping. He had fetched it from a pool
near at hand.

Jack gulped once or twice, then began to speak. The two gentlemen heard his story with the
utmost surprise.

"Garrotters!" cried Dr. Lawrence, "I never heard of such an outrage in this neighbourhood before.
What a frightful thing! Yes, yes, that explains the mark on your throat. Their object must
have been robbery. What have they stolen from you, Haydon?" But the mystery now deepened. Jack's
watch and chain, his purse, everything he had worth stealing, were perfectly safe and untouched.
Suddenly Jack started up and thrust his hand into his pocket. "The letter! the letter!" he
cried. He drew out several letters and looked over them. "My father's letter has gone!" he said.

"What's that?" said Colonel Keppel, pointing to a sheet of paper fluttering over the heath
about thirty yards away. He ran and fetched it. "This is the letter," said Jack, "the letter
I received from my father this morning."

"But what an extraordinary thing that you should be attacked in this manner, Haydon, in order
that this man may read a private letter. Is there anything in it, may I ask, to explain such
a strange proceeding?"

"Nothing, sir, that I know of; nothing in the least. My father says nothing there but what
anyone may see. I beg that you and Colonel Keppel will glance over it; you will then see how
ordinary it is."

The two gentlemen demurred, but Jack insisted, and they ran their eyes over what Mr. Haydon
had written. "Purely and simply an ordinary letter from a father abroad to his son," said the
Doctor; "it seems madness to go to such lengths to gain a glimpse of such a letter."

"All the same, young Haydon was quite right in not giving up his father's note to such rogues
to read, whatever their purpose may have been," remarked the Colonel.

"Oh, quite so, quite so," agreed Dr. Lawrence. "They had no right whatever to see his private
correspondence. By the way, Haydon, I see your father is on his way home. This is posted at
Cairo. In what part of the East has he been staying lately?"

"He has been in Burmah for some time, sir," replied Jack, "but I do not know exactly what he
has been doing. I rather fancy he went out to survey some ruby-mines for a big London firm."

"Quite so," said the Doctor, "I have seen him referred to many times as a famous ruby expert."

At this moment Colonel Keppel came towards them with something in his hand. He had started
away after concluding his last speech, and had gone in the direction where he had seen the
letter fluttering. Now he was returning.

"Here is something they dropped, something which throws a flood of light on the affair in one
way, and makes it much stranger in another," he remarked in a grave voice, holding up his find.
It was a curiously-plaited thong of raw hide, with faded strips of silk worked into the plaits.

"The cord with which Haydon was garrotted!" cried Dr. Lawrence. "They dropped it."

"Yes," said the Colonel slowly, "but this does not mean common garrotters. The fact that they
stole nothing really disposes of that. This means a much darker and more terrible business."

"And what is that?" cried the headmaster.

"Thuggee," said Colonel Keppel very gravely.

"Thugs, Colonel!" said Dr. Lawrence in a tone of stupefaction. "Are you serious? Thugs on the
heath here, in our quiet, familiar country?"

"This is a Thug noose, at any rate," said Colonel Keppel. "I know it very well. I served twenty-seven
years among the hill-tribes of northern India in one capacity and another, and once I served
in a Thug country, and I shall never forget it. The way young Haydon was handled suggests Thuggee.
No common garrotter could have overcome such a fine, powerful young fellow in that fashion.
But the skill of these Thugs is a thing truly diabolical. I remember one instance well. One
night, just upon dusk, two men of my regiment were entering the gate of the cantonments. The
guard saw them pass, and one was relating a story to the other. The man telling the story expected
his comrade to laugh at the conclusion of the anecdote. Hearing nothing, he turned and found
that he was walking alone and talking to the empty air. Thinking his comrade had slipped aside
and played a trick upon him by leaving him to himself, he went on to the barrack-room. Later
the second man was missing, and inquiries were made. A search followed, and the dead body of
the unfortunate man was found under the wall of the cantonments. He had been seized and strangled
by Thugs when actually walking beside a comrade, and the latter had known nothing of it.

"That shows frightful skill and cunning, Colonel," said Dr. Lawrence.

"It does indeed," said the other, "and I could relate a dozen such stories. But why Thugs should
be here and attack Haydon seems a most extraordinary mystery. How do you feel now, Haydon?"

"Much better, sir," replied Jack. "My throat's a bit stiff, but for the rest I am none the worse."

"You've had a wonderful escape, my boy," said Colonel Keppel; "there are not many who have
felt a Thug noose and lived to say what it was like. But now, Doctor, what are we to do? There
must be some inquiry made into this."

"Of course, of course," agreed Dr. Lawrence. "You are a magistrate, Colonel; what do you recommend?"

"We must put it into the hands of the police at once," said Colonel Keppel. "The fellows cannot
have got far. We saw no sign of them on the road, so they must have slipped away over the heath,
very probably as soon as they heard the sound of wheels in the distance. Now, Haydon, jump
up at the back of the trap. The cob will soon run us up to the constable's cottage in Rushmere."

All three climbed into the Colonel's dog-cart, and away went the brown cob at a slashing pace
for Rushmere. Tom Buck, the Rushmere constable, was just returning from a round, and he touched
his hat respectfully to the gentlemen. Colonel Keppel told the story, and Buck slapped the
gate-post with his open hand.

"Well, gentlemen," he said in surprise, "then they are the very men I've just been hearing about."

"What's that?" said Colonel Keppel. "Where have you heard of them?"

"From Parsons, the postman, he drives the mail-cart, you know, sir, from Longhampton. This
morning, just after six, he was coming through the Chase, the wood beyond the heath, when two
men slipped out o' the trees before him and made a dash at the horse's head. There was hardly
light enough to see 'em, an' they'd ha' stopped him as easy as could be if he hadn't been drivin'
a young, fresh, chestnut mare. She's that wild he daren't use a whip to her, but seein' these
suspicious characters, he snatches the whip out and gives her a cut as hard as he could lay
it on. Off she went like a shot, took the bit between her teeth and bolted. As for the men
jumpin' at her head, it was all they could do to save themselves from being run down and trodden
underfoot. Parsons luckily managed to keep her on the road, and after she'd galloped a couple
o' miles or so, he managed to pull her in all of a lather."

"Then those rascals meant to raid the mail-bags to find your letter, Haydon," said Colonel
Keppel. "They seem to have been thoroughly posted as to its time of arrival. Missing the postman,
they hung about, and a strange chance delivered you into their hands."

"It's certainly a most mysterious business, sir," replied Jack. "But why they should want to
see so simple and ordinary a letter, who they are, and what they're after, are altogether beyond
me."

"We must try to get hold of them," said Colonel Keppel, "then we shall perhaps be able to fathom
the mystery." He gave orders to Buck, who went off at once to follow, if possible, the track
of the strangers across the heath, to inquire at cottages, and do his utmost to trace them.

"For my part," said Colonel Keppel, "I shall drive back at once to Longhampton, and see the
superintendent. The railway must be watched, and every constable for miles round be warned
by telegraph to keep a look out for the rascals."

"You are very kind to take so much trouble, Colonel," said Dr. Lawrence.

"I'm working for myself as much as anyone," laughed the other. "My wife and daughters use that
road continually, and very often they are driving alone in a pony-carriage. It is imperative
that the neighbourhood be cleared of such desperate characters."

He drove away at once, and Dr. Lawrence and Jack walked up the hill to the school. Jack had
given up the idea of his visit to Longhampton.

"If I were you, Haydon," said the Head, "I should go and rest a little. Sit down quietly in
your study for an hour or two; you must feel badly shaken by your awful experience."

"Thank you, sir," replied Jack, "I will do as you say, though as a matter of fact I am practically
recovered now. Luckily, I'm in first-rate condition, I'm not bothered with nerves."

"No," smiled Dr. Lawrence, "I suppose not. Still, I should be careful for a time if I were you."

At the Doctor's gate they parted, and Jack went to his own study and sat down. He could not
keep his mind from his extraordinary adventure. Why had those fellows seized him, and what
did they want? Would they be caught, and then would their secret be discovered? His mind worked
over these points again and again, like a squirrel working the wheel in his cage.

CHAPTER II.

A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE.

Four days later Jack Haydon was in his study, his heels on the mantelpiece, his eyes fastened
on the pages of a novel, when there was a tap at his door and a telegram was brought in. He
broke open the envelope and read the contents in growing surprise and wonder. Then a look of
uneasiness came into his eyes. It was a cablegram from Brindisi, and ran, "Come at once. Most
urgent," and was signed "Risley." Jack went across to the Doctor's house, sent up his name,
and was bidden to go up to the study. Here he laid the cablegram before the Head.

"Who is Risley, Haydon?" asked Dr. Lawrence.

"My father's man, sir," replied Jack. "It seems to me that they must have got as far as Brindisi
on their way home. I feel wretchedly uneasy. Something tells me that things have gone wrong
with my father."

"Oh, I hope not," said Dr. Lawrence. "There is no word of ill-news here. The urgency may be
quite on another score."

"I should like to start at once, sir," said Jack. "I know my way about the Continent very well.
I have spent two or three vacations in Italy."

"Quite so, quite so," said Dr. Lawrence. "Have you plenty of money for the journey, Haydon?"

"I don't need more than sufficient to carry me to London, sir," replied Jack. "I shall go there
to Mr. Buxton, my father's friend, who manages all his business affairs, and he will supply
me with funds."

Jack was on fire to be off to Brindisi and see what was wrong. He made short work of his packing,
and within an hour he was driving to Longhampton to catch the London express. He caught it
with scarcely two minutes to spare, and was soon whirling towards the great city. A short distance
from Longhampton, he caught a glimpse of Rushmere School in the distance on its hill, and the
strip of heath country running up to the foot of the slope. This brought to mind his adventure,
which remained as mysterious an affair as ever. The police had been most active, stations had
been watched, inquiries had been made in every direction, but all to no result. The Thugs had
vanished and left no trace behind. But the thought of his encounter on the heath soon faded
from Jack's mind. It was crushed out by the pressing question of the moment. What was the matter
at Brindisi? Why had Risley cabled and not his father? Had something happened to his father?
Jack felt wretchedly uneasy, for he and his father were bound together by no ordinary ties
of affection.

In the first place, he had, as far as he knew, no other living relation. His mother had been
dead for many years, and his father was the only close friend that Jack knew. Then the elder
Haydon had always been a great hero in his son's eyes. His profession of mining engineer had
carried him into many wild corners of the world, and the store of marvellous tales which he
would pour forth for the boy's delight had made Jack's holidays a time of intense pleasure.
Mr. Haydon had always made a point, if it was possible, of keeping himself free for such times,
and he and Jack had spent the weeks joyously, until the day for return to school had become
a Black Monday indeed in the boy's eyes.

As Jack mused over memories of other days, his anxiety to know what was wrong at Brindisi grew
moment by moment, and the flying express seemed to crawl, so great was his impatience to be
in London, where he expected to get further news from Mr. Buxton. But he was destined to learn
something long before he saw Mr. Buxton. The express screamed into an important junction and
pulled up for five minutes. Three fellow-passengers got out, and left Jack to himself. A boy
came along the platform shouting, "London Pay-pers," and Jack bought a Daily Telegraph.

He turned to the football news, and was reading it, when the train pulled out and shot forward
once more towards London. But the accounts of his beloved sport failed to interest him, and
he turned the paper over listlessly, idly scanning one big sheet after another. Suddenly the
word imprinted on his brain caught his eye. "Brindisi"--here was some scrap of news from Brindisi.

What was it? Jack folded the paper, and then a second name seemed to leap at him from the sheet.
His own name! Haydon, Brindisi. What now? His eyes darted over the paragraph, and he drew a
long, gasping breath. This, then, was the explanation of the cablegram. Over and over again
Jack read the paragraph, striving to grasp what it all meant, striving to seize the inner meaning.
The paragraph was short and to the point. It ran:--

     "STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE.

     "FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.

     "BRINDISI, Tuesday.

    "There is much stir here over the mysterious disappearance of
    Mr. Thomas Haydon, the famous mining expert and engineer. He
    arrived here on Sunday, and it was believed that he intended
    to travel to England by the mail-train. He went for a walk on
    Sunday evening, but did not return to his hotel, where his
    man and his baggage were awaiting him. Since he left his
    hotel there has been no sign of him, and the authorities are
    making a diligent search."

His father had disappeared? How? Why? Jack could make nothing of it, and he stared at the paper
with pale face and perplexed eyes. It was so contrary to his every idea of his father, this
extraordinary disappearance. Thomas Haydon was the last man in the world to set tongues wagging
and to give anxiety to friends by such a trick. There was something very strange at the back
of this, and Jack struck the paper with his open hand. "Foul Play!" he murmured to himself,
and then, for he was alone in the carriage, he said it aloud, "Foul Play!"

Jack glanced at his watch. The train was due at St. Pancras in an hour. How slowly that hour
dragged! Now that he knew this momentous piece of news, Jack burned more fiercely than ever
to be in the midst of affairs and doing something to clear up this strange mystery which had
gathered about his father's name. At last, with a thrill of joy, he heard the engine give its
warning shriek as it ran into the big station. He had brought nothing but a Gladstone bag with
him, and he had it in his hand, and the door of the carriage open, before the train drew up.
He made a leap at the first hansom, and shouted, "Lincoln's Inn. Drive fast," and away he rattled
into London streets.

There was a good cob in the shafts, and little time was lost on the way. Jack paid the man
double fare for the excellent speed he had made, then bounded upstairs to the landing upon
which Mr. Buxton's chambers opened. In answer to his knock, a tall, thin man with a long beard
came to the door, and Jack gave a cry of joy. "You are at home, then, Mr. Buxton. How glad
I am! It has been my one terror that you might be away in the country."

"No, Jack, I'm here," said Mr. Buxton, shaking hands. "I've been expecting you every knock
I've heard. I suppose you've seen the papers."

"Yes," cried Jack, "I saw the Daily Telegraph. Are there any further particulars in the others?"

"No," replied Mr. Buxton, leading the way into his sitting-room. "The Telegraph has as much
as anyone."

"Have you heard anything? Do you know anything?" cried Jack eagerly.

"Nothing but what I've seen in the papers," replied the other. "I'm altogether at sea. I can't
fathom in the least what it all means. What have you had?"

"Nothing but this cablegram," said the lad, and handed it over. Mr. Buxton read it aloud slowly,
and nodded. "From Risley," he said. "Of course he wants to get you on the spot at once."

"I shall start without any delay," said Jack. "Isn't there a boat-train to-night?"

"Yes," said Mr. Buxton, glancing at a clock on the mantelpiece, "but there's plenty of time
for that. Sit down and talk it over, and besides, you must have something to eat."

He rang the bell and ordered the servant who answered it to set out a meal in the adjoining
apartment: he gave Jack a chair beside the fire, and took one opposite to him and began to
fill a pipe.

"Mr. Buxton," said Jack earnestly, "there's something out of the common in this. My father
has met with foul play. Before I know anything else I feel sure of that."

Mr. Buxton struck a match and puffed out several clouds of smoke. Then he tossed the match
into the fire, and nodded through the tobacco clouds. "I agree with you, Jack," he said. "This
is the queerest thing I ever came across in my life. I've known Tom Haydon, boy and man, this
forty-five years, and he's as straight as a gun-barrel. If they expected him back at that hotel,
if Risley expected him back, then he meant to come back. And if he didn't get back, it was
because he was interfered with. I'd stake a hand on that."

Jack nodded with glistening eyes. "And I'm going to see why he didn't come back," said the lad.

"I'd come with you if I could," said Mr. Buxton, "but at present I can no more leave London
than the Monument can. I'm as fast by the leg, held by press of work, as a bear tethered to
a stump. How do you stand for funds?"

"I've only got a sovereign or two in my pocket," said Jack. "I was depending on you."

"Yes, yes," said Mr. Buxton, "of course you were. I made time an hour or so ago to run over
your father's accounts. There's plenty to draw on." He went over to his desk and ran his fingers
through a bundle of papers. "Here it is," he remarked. "At the present moment your father is
worth the respectable sum of forty-seven thousand two hundred and nineteen pounds eighteen
shillings and fourpence; so he certainly hasn't run away from his creditors."

Jack nodded. "I'll start straight for Brindisi to-night, Mr. Buxton. I can't lose a minute
till I get on to the spot and talk with Buck Risley."

Mr. Buxton nodded. "I quite understand your feelings, Jack," he replied. "I've wondered whether
the matter might not have a very simple explanation after all. One thing struck me. Has your
father ever said anything about his health to you? You know he's been a great deal in India
and Burmah. It's a very easy thing to get a touch of the sun, and that will often cause a man
to lose the sense of his identity and get lost for a time."

Jack shook his head. "I've never heard him mention such a thing," he said. "He's always been
perfectly fit whenever I've seen him."

"Yes, yes," said Mr. Buxton, "and whenever I've seen him, too. He has a wonderful constitution.
But, you know, the possibility crossed my mind, and I mentioned it."

At this moment the servant announced that the meal was ready, and Jack did his best to eat
something. It was a very poor best, however, for he was too anxious to be on his way to be
able to eat, and he was relieved when Mr. Buxton said it was time to start and sent the servant
for a cab.

On their way to Charing Cross they did not talk much: conjecture was a pretty useless thing,
and, in their present state of utter lack of information, conjecture was the only thing possible.

The bustle of getting a ticket and finding a seat occupied most of the ten minutes they had
to spare before the train started, and, as the swift express glided out, Mr. Buxton waved his
hat to Jack leaning through the window, and cried, "Good luck!"

Of Jack's swift scurry across the Channel and over the Continent it is not necessary to enter
into details. He made the journey with the utmost speed, and chafed at every delay. At last
the train ran into the station of Brindisi, and Jack hung half out of the window, his eyes
searching the crowd for Risley, to whom he had telegraphed his time of arrival.

"Hullo, Buck," sang out Jack, as a middle-sized, stiff-built man of five and thirty ran up
to his carriage door.

"Glad to see you, Jack," said Buck Risley, as they shook hands. "Very glad to see you."

"Any news?" snapped Jack.

"Not a word," replied Buck gravely, "not a word. Is this your bag?"

"Yes," said Jack sombrely, for he was very disappointed. He had been hoping to hear that something
had been found out, or that his father had returned.

Buck took Jack's gladstone, called a carriage, and gave the name of the hotel. He did not speak
till they were rattling along the streets of Brindisi.

"Say, Jack, this beats the band," he said. "I can't make a guess what's happened to the Professor."

Mr. Haydon and Buck Risley had first met in a "wild-cat" mining camp in Dakota. The Lone Wolf
Clarion had introduced the English engineer to the local community as Professor Haydon, and
Mr. Haydon had been the Professor ever since to his part-comrade, part-servant.

"Tell me all about it," said Jack, and Buck began his story. It was soon finished, for there
was very little to tell. They had been four months in Burmah, and Mr. Haydon and Buck had gone
up to Mandalay, and then on to the Mogok country. At Mogok Buck had been seized with a sharp
touch of fever, and had been compelled to remain in that famous mining town while Mr. Haydon
went up country, accompanied only by a few natives who had been with him in other journeys.
He came back after an absence of five weeks to Mogok, found Buck better, and announced that
they would return to England at once. They had packed and started forthwith, and returned by
the usual route.

"Did my father seem quite himself, just as usual in every way, Buck?" asked Jack.

"No," said Buck thoughtfully. "He didn't quite. There was somethin' on the Professor's mind,
I'm sure o' that."

Jack put forward Mr. Buxton's suggestion, but Buck waved it aside.

"Touch o' the sun," said he. "Oh, no, nothin' like that. The Professor was as fit as he always
was, right as a bull-frog in a swamp. No, it was a sort of anxiousness there was about him.
He was that careful that you might almost call him fidgetty."

"Fidgetty!" said Jack in surprise, as he remembered the perfectly equable manner of his widely-travelled
father.

"Yes, that's as good a word as any I can jump on at short notice," replied Buck. "He seemed
as keen on getting back to London as some o' these globetrotters who have got sick o' foreign
parts."

"That was rather strange," commented Jack. "You've been with my father twelve years now, Buck.
Did you ever see him like it before?"

"Never in my knowledge of him," said Buck, shaking his head. "As a general rule the Professor
was as calm an' easy campin' in a jungle as another man in a front seat at a circus. It was
all one to the Professor, let things come how they might. But this time he seemed as if his
only idea was to get back. Not that he said much about it. The most I ever heard him say was,
'Well, Buck, I don't care how soon I get into Lane & Baumann's office,' an' he only said that
once when he was fretted at losing a day by missing a boat at Rangoon."

At this moment the carriage drew up at the door of the hotel. They had scarcely entered the
door when the hotel clerk came forward with a cablegram. It was from Messrs Lane & Baumann,
asking if anything was yet known of Mr. Haydon.

"If he was anxious to see them, they are just as anxious to see him," said Buck, handing the
form to Jack. "Every day they wire, an' sometimes twice a day, to know if I've got hold of
any news."

"I wish I'd been to see them before I left London," said Jack. "I might have got some useful
information from them. What do you believe has happened to my father?"

"I dunno what to think," said Risley, "except that some o' these Dagoes got him in a corner
and went for his pocket-book. He'd got plenty of money with him."

"But if he'd been attacked by thieves," argued Jack, "the police would have found something
out before this. He could not have been hidden away from them."

Buck shook his head. "Some o' these Dagoes are very sly and deep," he replied. "I've heard
queer stories about 'em at times. They say there are brigands around."

"Yes, yes," said Jack, "in Sicily and in some of the wilder parts of Calabria, but not in Brindisi,
Buck, not in this big port."

"Well, I give it up," said Buck, "but there's a queer twist at the bottom of it somewhere.
The Professor ain't the sort o' man to worry us by goin' into hiding somewhere, and lyin' low."

"Of course he isn't," said Jack. "My father was prevented from returning to the hotel, that's
clear enough; and we've got to find how."

"Say, I'm your man, Jack," returned Buck. "I shan't feel easy till I've had a glimpse o' the
Professor with his old, quiet smile on him. We'll hunt every hole there is."

For two days Jack and Buck hunted every hole about Brindisi, and, stimulated by the promise
of handsome rewards, the police, too, did their utmost, but all was in vain; the missing man
had disappeared as though the earth had opened and swallowed him. Absolutely the only thing
out of the ordinary that the police could discover was that a fisherman's skiff was missing
one night, and was found the next morning a couple of miles down the coast, floating idly about.
But the painter was drifting astern, and it might easily have happened that it had been carelessly
fastened, and the rope had slipped from the mooring ring and allowed the skiff to drift away.

On the afternoon of the second day Jack announced his decision. "Buck," said he, "I'm going
back to London. I want to see Lane & Baumann. It's quite possible that some information may
be gleaned from them which would give us a basis to go to work upon."

"It's no good stopping here," said Risley. "When shall we start?"

"To-night," said Jack, and, being near the station, they turned in to look up the time of the
fast express. Jack glanced along the platform, and soon found what he sought, one of Cook's
interpreters. "I want to ask some questions of the booking-clerk," he said to the man, slipping
several lire into his hand, "you might come and interpret for me."

"Yes, sir," said the man at once, and followed the tall young Englishman to the office. In
three minutes Jack had learned what he wished as to the shortest route and fastest trains;
then he and Risley set out to return to the hotel. Suddenly Jack remembered another point,
and crying, "Half-a-minute, Buck," he rushed back to the office. He thrust open a swing door
and saw that the interpreter was still there, and was now in conversation with a smaller man.
Jack stepped forward, and the smaller man looked up and gave a short, quick cry of alarm. For
a second Jack stood with widely-opened eyes and parted lips, an image of wild surprise. Then
darting forward at full speed, he seized the second man by the throat, and clutched him as
a lion clutches his prey.

CHAPTER III.

THE BIG RUBY.

Jack had known the fellow at once, had recognised him instantly as the small, dark man who
had stood in front of him upon Rushmere Heath and demanded that he should produce his father's
letter. An instant conviction had darted into Jack's mind that these things were connected,
and that this man knew something of his father's disappearance.

"I've got you this time," cried Jack, and was upon him in a second. But a most astonishing
thing happened. The small, slight man offered no resistance to Jack's fierce rush, instead,
he seemed to give way before it as a reed gives way before the wind. Then he bent slightly
and laid one small, sinewy hand on Jack's knee, and, in some mysterious fashion or another,
the lad felt that his hold was torn away, and that he was flying through the air over the little
man's head. All in a heap Jack landed on the dusty floor. As he fell, he caught a glimpse of
Buck's head thrust through the swinging door as he followed his young leader, and saw the look
of surprise on Buck's face.

"Seize him!" roared Jack, and Buck darted forward as the dark stranger shot through another
door and vanished into a crowd which swarmed on to the platform from a train which had just
drawn up. Jack gathered himself together, and sprang to his feet, and rushed after his companion.
He soon found Buck, who was hurrying through the groups, looking about on every hand, and they
searched together, but searched in vain; the mysterious stranger had gone to earth safely amid
the ample cover provided by the mass of bustling passengers. At last they pulled up and looked
at each other.

"No go," said Jack, "he's lost in the crowd. He may be far enough away by now."

Buck's look of wonder and surprise was striking to behold.

"See here, Jack," he said, laying his hand on his companion's arm. "How in thunder do you come
to know Saya Chone, and jump on him at sight like a hawk droppin' on a chicken?"

"You know him, Buck?" cried Jack. "You know his name?"

"Know him all right," replied Buck. "But what under the sun is he doing this distance from
home? What brings Saya Chone in Brindisi? The last time I set eyes on him he was coming into
Mogok with a little bag of rubies to sell to U Saw, the chap they call the Ruby King."

"He comes from Burmah, where you have been?"

"Sure thing," said Buck, nodding his head. "He's a half-caste. Says his father was a British
officer, and prides himself on talking Number One English."

"He talked English as easily as we do," said Jack, "but with an odd click of the tongue."

"That's the native strain in him," returned Buck. "But where did you run up against him and
hear his English?"

Jack told his story quickly, and Risley listened with a knitted brow of attention.

"Say, there's business at the back o' this," murmured Buck, "but where it fits in beats me
at the moment. We don't know enough, Jack, to be sure which way we're moving."

"We do not, Buck, you are quite right," replied the lad, "and we'll make a bee-line for London
and see the firm for whom father was working."

"Let's go and see what tar-brush was talking to the interpreter about," suggested Buck, and
they went at once and found the man, who had returned to his post on the platform. The interpreter
readily told them that the half-caste had offered him a liberal sum in order to learn what
Jack was doing, and what route he intended to follow on leaving Brindisi, but the man declared
that he had made no answer, had, indeed, been unable to reply to the questions before Jack
was on the scene and making his rush.

"Is it worth while to stop here and put the police on the search for this fellow, I wonder?"
said Jack, as he and his companion returned to the hotel.

"I doubt it," returned Buck. "There are such numbers of foreigners of all kinds passing through
the port that the police can't keep track of them all. Besides, it would take time, and if
there's some queer game in the wind, we've lost a good deal now. If you could learn, Jack,
how matters stand between the Professor and the firm that sent him out to Burmah, it might
give you a line to go on. At present we're snuffin' the wind and pickin' up no scent."

"You're right, Buck, we'll get the baggage together at once."

Again Jack rushed across Italy, France, and the Channel, never pausing for one instant on the
way. It was a little before noon on a Thursday morning when he saw London again, and, at the
terminus, he parted with Buck.

The latter went with the baggage to Lincoln's Inn to report to Mr. Buxton, while Jack, too
anxious to lose another moment, jumped into a cab and drove straight to the offices of Messrs
Lane & Baumann in Old Broad Street. He sent his name in, and was shown at once into a large
room where Mr. Lane, the senior partner, sat at his desk.

"Ah, Mr. Haydon," said he, "you have, I hope, come to give us some news about your father."

"Unfortunately I have not," replied Jack. "I have been in Brindisi making every inquiry possible,
but I have been able to gather no information whatever as to his whereabouts. I have come here
in hopes that you may give me some idea of what his arrangements were with you, and from that
I might plan a course of action."

"I think my partner had better join us," said Mr. Lane, taking up a speaking-tube. For a few
moments nothing was said. The business man went on with the letter he was writing, and Jack
looked about him. The office was large and splendidly fitted up. Jack knew nothing of Lane
& Baumann, but it was plain on every hand that it was a large and wealthy firm. Mr. Lane himself
was an elderly gentleman, irreproachably dressed, and the picture of an important man in the City.

The door opened and the other partner came in. Jack saw that Mr. Baumann was much younger,
a fat, heavy German with clean-shaven face and big, round spectacles, through which little,
thick-lidded eyes peered.

"Has he brought some news?" asked Baumann quickly. "What does he say?" His accent at once betrayed
him, though his English was excellent.

"No," said Mr. Lane quietly, "he has brought no news. He comes to learn of us."

"To learn of us," said Baumann slowly; "and what is it you wish to learn?" he demanded of Jack.

The latter eyed the German keenly. At the first word he detected an enemy. Mr. Lane had been
gravely polite and non-committal in his manner. This man showed hostility at once.

"I wish to learn anything that will aid me in discovering the reason for the mysterious disappearance
of my father," replied Jack, firmly.

"Mysterious disappearance," repeated the German, with a sneering stress upon the words. "Ach
Gott! it is no mystery to me when a man with such a gombanion as that disappears." He was becoming
excited, and his German accent began to thicken.

"Companion," repeated Jack, "I do not understand you. My father had no companion except Buck
Risley, his man, who has now returned to London with me."

"Had he not, indeed?" said Baumann. "But he had a very close gombanion, one who might easily
lead him astray. Himmel, what was it not worth? I think about it night and day."

"Gently, Baumann, gently," said Mr. Lane. "You are mystifying Mr. Haydon, and I shall explain
to him what you mean. He clearly does not understand you, and I do not think it is right to
keep him in the dark. Mr. Haydon, do you know why your father went to Burmah for us?"

"I understood that he was going to survey some concession you had gained," replied Jack.

"My goncession," cried Baumann. "I went over there and saw the place, and I said to myself,
Himmel, here is the for rubies, yes, fine rubies, and I got all rights to dig there."

Mr. Lane quieted his excited partner and turned once more to Jack.

"Exactly," he said; "your father went to survey a concession for us. My partner had been over
the ground, and had returned convinced that there was a fine field for ruby-mining. We sent
your father out to look carefully over the ground on our behalf, and a short time ago we received
some very startling news from him. He cabled to us that in a fissure of the rock, where, as
everyone knows, the finest rubies are found, he had made a most marvellous find. He had come
across a ruby of priceless quality, and, as his work was done, he intended to return at once,
bringing the ruby with him in order to place it himself in our hands."

"And now he has mysteriously disappeared," sneered Baumann. His meaning was very plain, and
Jack leapt to his feet with pale face and shining eyes.

"Sir!" he cried. "Do you dare to hint that the ruby is the cause of my father's disappearance?"

The German smiled, and Jack's anger grew.

"It is impossible!" he cried. "My father is the soul of uprightness and honour. And do you
think he would be tempted by a mere stone, whatever its value? He has handled rubies a hundred
and a hundred times."

"Ay," snarled the German, "but not such a ruby as this. What did he say himself? What was in
his cablegram? 'The finest ruby by far that I have ever seen or handled!' He says that. He,
Haydon, the first living expert on rubies, the man who knows everything of every big specimen
in existence. Himmel, Himmel, what a stone was that! And what time are we losing! I would set
every police of the world on his track. And we do no nothing, nothing!"

"Gently, Baumann, gently, you know very well that I do not agree with you," said Mr. Lane.

Jack turned eagerly to the senior partner. He felt that the whining German was below both his
anger and contempt.

"Sir," said Jack earnestly, "if my father had in his charge a stone so immensely precious,
I fear he has met with foul play."

"Who knew of it?" said Mr. Lane. "Had he mentioned anything about it to his man?"

"No, he had not," said Jack, and narrated at once what he had heard from Buck Risley.

"Yes," said Mr. Lane, nodding, "it was the possession of the great jewel which made him uneasy."

"Who can say what it was worth?" broke in Baumann fiercely. "A big ruby of perfect colour and
without flaw, remember, he said its like did not exist, is of all stones the most precious.
Diamonds, poof! This ruby was worth a score of great diamonds."

"And if my father had with him so wonderful a stone," urged Jack on Mr. Lane, "is it not almost
certain that someone has learned of its existence? and again I say that he has met with foul play."

"But who should know of it?" said Mr. Lane. "It is most unlikely that he should mention it
to anyone; and you say, moreover, that his own companion knew nothing of it."

"But," cried Jack, and thought this point was a clincher, "he cabled home to you about it,
and word of it got abroad, perhaps, from the telegraph office."

Mr. Lane shook his head. "He cabled to us in cipher," he said; "a cipher which he had composed
himself and wrote down for us before he started. The paper has been safely locked up in our
strong-room, and it was the only copy in the world, for he told us that, for himself, he should
carry the cipher in his memory."

This was puzzling and baffling, and Jack was silent. In a moment he put forward another point.

"But we are not sure the ruby has disappeared with my father," he said; "it may be packed away
in his baggage."

Mr. Lane shook his head once more. "No," he said, "that is very unlikely. Your father would
be certain to carry a thing so small and so valuable on his person. He would never part with
it night or day."

Again there was a short interval in which nothing was said. Into this silence suddenly broke
the grumbling roar of Baumann's great voice. The German had been brooding over the disappearance
of the great stone until he was beside himself.

"Ach Gott," he cried furiously to Mr. Lane. "You are foolish. You still believe in the man
and trust him. Me, I do not, I tell you plainly he is a thief. He is to-day perhaps in Amsterdam,
cutting that noble and splendid stone into many smaller ones, and each of them still a fortune.
Yes, he is a thief!"

"You liar!" roared Jack. "My father is not a thief. How dare you take such words on your dirty
lips in respect of such a man!"

He had bounded to his feet and clenched his fists. Mr. Lane sprang between them.

"Now, Mr. Haydon," said the elder man, "you must keep the peace. Baumann is speaking very wildly.
I do not agree with him. I know your father too well."

Respect for Mr. Lane held Jack back, and nothing else. He would dearly have liked to plant
his fist on the German's foaming mouth, but he commanded himself with an immense effort, and
tried to speak calmly.

"The man is mad to say such things," said Jack with trembling lips. "Why, the whole facts of
the case are against any such monstrous idea. If my father had wished to steal the stone, would
he have cabled to you full particulars and started home? What would have been easier than to
pocket it at once, and say nothing?"

"He was not a thief at first," vociferated the German. "He was honest when he cabled. But the
jewel, the great, big, beautiful jewel itself corrupted him. He looked at it, and looked at
it, till the love of it filled his heart and he could not part with it. Himmel, I have felt
it all. I know what happened as well as if I had been at his side all the voyage."

"Look here, you foul slanderer," cried Jack. "I'll prove you a liar out and out. Listen to
me. I'll find my father if he still remains in existence, and I'll prove that you wrong him
by your unjust suspicions." The lad turned to Mr. Lane with flushed face and shining eyes.
"I thank you, sir," he said, "for the trust you still retain in my father. I will do my very
utmost to prove to you that it was well placed. I cannot promise you anything save that I will
do all that lies in my power to trace your great ruby and discover my father's fate at the
same time."

Jack could say no more. He held out his hand and Mr. Lane shook it, and the tall English lad
strode from the office.

CHAPTER IV.

BUCK SEES LIGHT.

Jack walked rapidly through the city, and, free from the presence of Baumann and his vile insinuations,
began to cool rapidly and survey the situation with a steadier eye.

"This needs talking over," he said to himself. "Here's a big new development." He hailed a
cab and was driven to Lincoln's Inn. He found Mr. Buxton's sitting-room littered with the baggage
they had brought home, and Mr. Buxton himself in close confab with Buck Risley.

"Hullo, Jack," said the elder man, rising to shake hands with him; "how have you been getting
on with Lane and Baumann? You look excited."

"Rather, Mr. Buxton," said Jack. "I have been learning a great deal." He struck into his story
at once, and the two men listened with great interest.

"He had an immense ruby of incalculable value in his possession," said Mr. Buxton slowly, when
Jack had finished. "I say, this changes the whole situation. I'm afraid, Jack, something very
serious has happened to your father."

"Then that's what was on the Professor's mind," cried Buck. "I knew very well there was something.
It was big enough to make even him feel uneasy."

"It's an odd thing he didn't mention it to you, Risley," said Mr. Buxton. "I've always understood
that you were privy to all his business movements."

"That's all right, Mr. Buxton," said Risley cheerfully. "You've got that quite straight. In
a general way the Professor hid nothing from me. But this time he did hide it about the big
stone, and I'm goin' to show you how right, just as usual, the Professor was. You must remember,"
went on Buck, "that when he picked me up at Mogok on the way home, he found only a dim and
distant shadder o' the party now talkin' to you. I'd been on my back for weeks with fever,
and was as weak and nervous as a kitten. I've picked up wonderful on the voyage home. Well,
if he'd told me o' such a thing as he'd certainly got at that moment in his belt, it would
ha' rattled me to pieces. I should have been certain to give the show away in my anxiety for
fear anybody should get to know about it, and do him a mischief. So he said nothing at all.
But it puts everything in a new light, everything."

"Buck!" cried Jack. "What about that fellow who stopped me on Rushmere Heath and then turned
up in Brindisi? Can he have something to do with it?"

"Now you're talking, Jack," said Risley, nodding at the young man. "'Twas all runnin' through
my mind. It all hangs together, as straight as a gun."

Buck knitted his brows in deep thought, and stared into the fire. Mr. Buxton was about to speak,
but Buck held up his hand for silence, and the quiet remained unbroken till the American slapped
his knee with a crack like a pistol-shot, looked round on them, and nodded briskly.

"I've worked it out," said Buck. "The Professor's been kidnapped, and I'll lay all I'm worth
I can spot the parties who have boned him."

"Kidnapped!" The cry burst in irrepressible surprise and excitement from the other two.

"Sure thing," said Risley. "Just listen to me. That half-caste Saya Chone comes from up-country
somewhere in the direction the Professor headed for after leaving Mogok. That's the starting-point
for the whole business. He's mixed up in it from first to last, that's plain enough, by his
showing up at Rushmere and then followin' Jack to Brindisi as he must have done. What brought
him trackin' us all this way if he didn't know about the big ruby and was in with the gang
that's carried off the Professor?"

"But why are you so sure that they have carried Tom Haydon off, Risley?" asked Mr. Buxton.
"Perhaps they--" Mr. Buxton paused, unable to put into words the terrible thought which filled
his mind.

"Say it right out, sir," said Buck encouragingly. "You can say it out, for I don't believe
it's the least bit true. You meant, suppose they've murdered the Professor for the ruby?"

Mr. Buxton nodded, and Jack went white about the lips.

"Well, that's all right," said Buck cheerfully, "they ain't done that, anyway. First thing,
if so we'd ha' found the Professor, for all they wanted was the stone; they'd no use in the
world for his body. But there's a lot more in it than that. They want the Professor himself.
It's a dead sure thing that where that big stone came from there's a lot more, and they intend
to make him show them the place."

"Ah," said Mr. Buxton, "there's a good deal in that, Risley. I hadn't thought of that."

"Then, Buck," cried Jack, "you think that my father has been seized and is being carried back
to Burmah?"

"I'm as sure of it as I am that we are in this room," said Buck solemnly.

Jack drew a long breath of immense relief. To feel that his father might be alive, and possibly
could be rescued, was to bring a bright gleam of hope into the darkness of this strange affair.

"How have they carried him away?" cried Jack.

"By sea," replied Buck. "Couldn't be done by land, nohow. But you can get a quiet road by sea
easy enough. I wonder how much that boat that disappeared from the harbour had to do with it.
They might have nailed him, pulled him out in it to a vessel waiting off the harbour, and then
sent it adrift when they'd done with it."

Mr. Buxton had filled his pipe and was smoking thoughtfully. Now he took the pipe out of his
mouth, and spoke.

"I can see another thing which, in the light now thrown upon the affair, seems very possible,"
said he. "How many letters did you receive from your father, Jack, when he was on his way home?"

"Only one, Mr. Buxton," replied Jack. "The one he sent me from Cairo was the first I had had
from him for a long time."

"Isn't it possible," went on Mr. Buxton, "that those who were following him up knew of that
letter being sent, and were anxious to read it, hoping that he would describe where he had
been and what he had been doing? Then, even if they failed to secure him and the big stone,
they would know the spot where he had discovered the ruby-mine."

"Say, Mr. Buxton, you've hit the bull's eye," remarked Buck. "That's about the square-toed truth."

"And that's why they threw the letter away when they had read it," cried Jack. "There was no
hint of any such thing in it."

There was silence for a few moments, while all three pondered over the strange events which
had taken place. It was broken by Jack.

"Oh, Buck," he said, "I suppose there is no chance of such a precious thing being in the baggage
after all."

"Not it," replied Risley. "I packed every consarned thing with my own hands. I had just enough
strength for a job like that."

"And you feel convinced, Risley, that Tom Haydon has been spirited off back to Burmah by a
gang who have learned of his wonderful find, and mean to seize it for themselves?" said Mr. Buxton.

"Dead sure of it, sir," replied Buck.

Jack sprang to his feet and paced the room excitedly.

"Then we'll go ourselves, Buck," he cried, "and run them to earth."

"Sure thing," said Buck calmly. "I'm on at once for a look into what's happened to the Professor."

"It will be a dangerous quest," said Mr. Buxton slowly; "a very dangerous quest, among wild
lands and savage peoples. I know that much. Do you think the Government authority extends over
the district where the discovery was made, Risley?"

"No, it don't," replied Buck. "They're all savage Kachins and Shans up there, as ready for
a scrap as any you ever met. It's all the authorities can do to hold 'em off the settlements."

"A dangerous quest indeed!" repeated Mr. Buxton.

"But one that must be undertaken," cried Jack earnestly. "Would you have me leave my father's
fate a matter of uncertainty, Mr. Buxton? I know very well it's a long journey on the chance
of Buck being right in his suspicions. But so many things point that way, and if Buck is willing
to guide me to the country where the search ought to be made, I will gladly go."

"Oh, I'm with you, of course, Jack," sang out Buck Risley. "We'll have a look into things,
anyhow, an' I know more than a bit of that country. I've been three times up the river, an'
made all sorts o' little side-trips."

"Thank you, Buck," cried the lad. "I knew you'd be willing to help me. We'll start as soon
as possible. You'll find us plenty of funds, won't you, Mr. Buxton?"

"Oh, yes, Jack," said Mr. Buxton, "I'll find you all the money you want for such a purpose."

CHAPTER V.

THE SPY.

Three days later, about four o'clock in the afternoon, Jack and Buck walked into Lincoln's
Inn, and knocked at Mr. Buxton's door. They had been staying at a hotel near at hand, and nothing
was said until Jack had carefully closed the door of the inner sitting-room, where Mr. Buxton
was at work among his papers.

"So you're off to-morrow?" said Mr. Buxton, laying down his pen.

"No, to-night," said Jack.

"What?" returned Mr. Buxton in surprise. "Have you got all your luggage ready?"

"Yes, sir," said Buck. "We've got it with us."

"Oh, your cab is outside?" he said.

"No, sir," replied Buck, with a twinkle in his eye. "You see it all on view."

Mr. Buxton scratched his head. "Do you mean to say that you're going to start for Burmah with
an umbrella apiece?"

"We do, Mr. Buxton," replied Jack. "We're going to slip off quietly. Buck thinks we're being
watched."

"Watched!" cried Mr. Buxton. "By whom?"

"Can't say that," said Buck. "But there's someone takin' a deep interest in us I feel certain.
I should venture to spec'late as the ruby gang want to know what we're up to."

"And you mean to start off for the other side of the world equipped merely for a stroll through
the Park?" cried Mr. Buxton.

"Why not, sir?" asked Buck. "You've found us plenty of money, and we can rig ourselves out
whereever there are shops. Best for us, too, to pull out on this business with as little show
as we can make. If we don't, we may find ourselves pulled up mighty soon and mighty sharp.
I tell you this is a deep an' cunning gang we've got to fight. An' they've got a big pull of
us. They know us and we know very little of them. I can tell you there are wily birds east
of Suez. They are up to all the tricks, both of East and West."

The two visitors did not stay five minutes with Mr. Buxton. They wished their visit to have
the air of a mere passing call, and when he had shaken hands with them and wished them good
luck, they left his rooms, strolled into Chancery Lane, and went gently up towards Holborn
as if they had nothing to do but stare at the sights of the town like country cousins.

"Jack," said Buck softly, "let's pull up and look at this shop window, the panes have just
got the bulge I want."

Jack, wondering a little what his companion meant, stopped, and they stared into a print shop
where photographs of eminent judges and K.C.'s were set out in rows.

"Say, this is bully," murmured Buck. "Move a bit on one side, Jack, so that I can see the street
behind us reflected in the glass. Now, come on, I've seen all I want. Don't turn your own head
or you'll spoil the show."

They walked on together, and Buck muttered in deep satisfaction: "I've spotted the man following
us; a stout chap with a double chin and a look like a fat policeman out o' work. I reckon I've
tumbled to this game. I've seen him outside our hotel."

"Is it one of the gang?" asked Jack.

"Oh, no," replied his companion. "More likely to be one o' these private detectives hired to
watch us. Now we've got to throw pepper into his eyes, an' then make a break for the station."

Buck raised his hand and hailed a growler. They got in, Buck said "Marble Arch," and away trotted
the horse. Buck now set himself to keep a watch out of the little window at the back of the
cab, and soon gave a chuckle of satisfaction.

"He's coming," he said, "he's in a hansom about fifty yards behind. This makes it a dead cert
that he's our man. It would be a bit too much of a coincidence for him to be outside our hotel
last night, following us up Chancery Lane to-day, and now tracking us along Oxford Street."

"How will you drop him?" asked Jack.

"As easy as tumbling off a log," replied Buck. "We'll use Connaught Mansions. Do you remember
its two entrances? We'll pop in at one and out at the other."

Jack laughed, and understood at once. His father had a flat at Connaught Mansions, a huge block
of flats near Lancaster Gate, which served as Mr. Haydon's London home between his journeys.
They had made no use of it during the few days they had been in town, preferring a hotel near
Mr. Buxton's rooms, but now it would be of service to their plans.

As they neared the Marble Arch, Buck gave the address to the driver. He handed up a couple
of half-crowns at the same time.

"We may be detained at the place you're driving to," he remarked. "Wait a quarter of an hour
at the door, and then if we don't send any message to you, you can go."

"Very good, sir," said the cabby, and on rolled the growler, and soon turned into the courtyard
of Connaught Mansions, and pulled up at the main entrance. Jack and his companion left the
cab at once and went into the lobby, where the porter came out of his office.

"Hullo, Mr. Risley, you are back again," said the porter. Then he caught sight of Jack, whose
face was very well known from frequent visits to his father. The question which had plainly
been on the porter's lips was at once checked. He had been eager to talk to Buck about the
disappearance of Mr. Haydon, but Jack's presence put a barrier upon that.

The cloppety-clop of the feet of a passing cab horse now came in through the open door of the
vestibule. Jack glanced out and saw the stout man passing in his cab. The spy seemed to be
very busy reading a paper, and the whole thing looked as innocent as could be.

"Well, I'll nip upstairs an' get what I want," said Buck to the porter, and he and Jack rang
for the lift, and were shot up to the fifth floor. Upon this landing there was one projecting
window, which commanded the front of the great building, and the two comrades went cautiously
to it and peeped out.

"There he is, there he is," whispered Jack.

"Sure thing," chuckled Buck.

Far below them they saw their cabman sitting idly on his perch and waiting for his quarter
of an hour to pass. The Mansions looked on to a square, a long narrow strip of gardens, filled
with lofty bushes rather than trees. The spy's cab had taken a sweep round these gardens and
was now drawing up on the other side, exactly opposite their cab. As they looked they saw the
stout man leave his cab and move to and fro till he found a space through which he could look
across the gardens and watch the entrance to the great building. From their lofty standpoint
Jack and his companion had a splendid bird's-eye view of everything.

"Off we go now," said Jack. "For if our cabman makes a move he'll become suspicious."

"We've got ten minutes yet," murmured Buck; "but as you say, Jack, off we go."

They turned and crossed the landing swiftly, and ran down the stairs, flight after flight.
They did not wish to call attention to their movements by ringing for the lift; besides, they
were making for the back of the place, where a smaller entrance opened on a quiet side street.
They gained this and were once more free to strike where they wished, leaving the baffled spy
to watch the main entrance in vain.

CHAPTER VI.

IN RANGOON.

"Now for a start in earnest," said Buck, as the two comrades hurried swiftly through the quiet
streets, moving westwards in order to put as much ground as possible between themselves and
the baffled spy. "I propose, Jack, that we make for Harwich and cross over to the Continent,
avoiding the usual English routes and English steamers. We want to get there as quietly as
we can. It wouldn't be healthy to arrive in Upper Burmah thumping a drum to let 'em know we
were on their track. They've got ways of their own of gettin' rid o' people they want to see
the last of."

Jack nodded. "Then we must head for Liverpool Street," he remarked.

"Yes," said Buck. "We're not far from Queen's Road Station. We'll hit the Twopenny Tube and
dodge back east, now."

They went into the station and were just in time to jump into an east-bound train, as the conductor
was about to shut the gates of the carriage.

"Nobody followed us there anyway," remarked Buck. "We were the last to board the train."

They went right away to the Bank, plunged into the City, and threaded the narrow streets and
busy crowds in every direction, gradually working their way towards Liverpool Street. They
timed their arrival there five minutes before a fast express pulled out, and were soon on their
way. As they rushed through the Essex flats Buck detailed his plans, and Jack listened and agreed.

"From Harwich we'll make for Hamburg," said Risley. "There we can buy an outfit and take passage
for Rangoon in a German boat which does not call in England."

       *       *       *       *       *

Our story now moves on to a point nearly five weeks later, when, as evening fell, a big German
steamer slowly moved up to a wide quay of Rangoon, and took up her berth. Over her side leaned
two figures we know, one looking at the scene with eyes which noted the familiarity of it all,
the other drinking in every detail with eager interest and curiosity.

Jack was too absorbed in the scene to utter a word; the minarets of the mosques, the vast spire
of Shway Dagon, the famous pagoda, its crest of gold glittering in the last rays of the sun;
the crowd of masts, the native boats, the swift little sampans darting hither and thither,
the quaint up-river craft, the Chinese junks--all was so new and strange and wonderful that
he could not gaze enough upon the scene. And above all, he felt that this was the land whose
wildest recesses he must penetrate upon his quest, and his mind turned strongly upon that.

"Do you know, Buck," he murmured to his companion, "that the sight of all these strange new
things makes the whole affair very visionary to me?"

"I think I tumble to what you mean," replied the other. "I had a touch of it myself when I
first came to these queer parts. You feel as if you were ramblin' about in a dream."

"That's it, exactly," said Jack. "It seems impossible that this is workaday life in which we
have a definite task."

"You'll soon shake that off," replied Buck; "the sight o' these places makes every tenderfoot
moon a bit; and we've got a straight enough job before us. We'll have to rustle some before
we've got the Professor out o' the hands o' these people who want to jump his claim."

"You feel certain my father is here, Buck?"

"Three times as certain as when we started," replied Risley. "Mr. Buxton's kept the search
going, and found nothing. Very good. That makes it all the surer the Professor is in front
of us up this river;" and Buck threw his hand northwards, pointing to the broad flood which
slipped past the quays of Rangoon to the sea.

At different points of their voyage they had received cables from Mr. Buxton giving the news
of the search, which was going on in vain.

The steamer took up her moorings, and the stream of landing passengers began to flow swiftly
to the quay. Jack and his companion stepped ashore, each with a large kit-bag in hand. They
had travelled light, and all their luggage was with them. Buck held up a finger, and a Chinese
coolie darted up to them, his rickshaw running easily behind him. The two bags were pitched
into the light vehicle, and Buck bade the man follow them by a gesture.

"This way, Jack," said Risley, and led his companion up a broad street, which, now that the
dusk had fallen and the sea-breeze was blowing, was filled with a strange and busy crowd.

"Everybody turns out for an hour or two, now," remarked Buck. "It's pleasant and fresh after
the day. This is Mogul Street, about the liveliest street in the city."

Jack looked upon the crowd with wonder, the first Eastern crowd of which he had ever made a
part. The thronging pavements were a kaleidoscope of the East--long-coated Persians; small,
brown, slant-eyed Japanese; big, yellow, slant-eyed Chinamen; a naked Coringhi, his dark body
shining in the lamp-light, and the rings in his nose jingling together; Hindus of all ranks,
from the stately Brahmin to the coolie bearing loads or pulling a rickshaw; Burmese; and, to
Jack's pleasant surprise, three straight-stepping English soldiers, swinging along with their
little canes, their lively talk sounding pleasantly familiar amid the babel of Eastern tongues.

At a narrow opening Buck turned and left the main street. Fifty yards along the side street
he stopped the rickshaw and paid off the coolie, each taking his own kit-bag. Next Buck plunged
into a dusky, ill-lighted alley, and Jack followed, wondering.

"I'm making for a friend's house," murmured Buck, "an' I'm takin' a shy road. We've got to
keep our eyes skinned from now on."

"Do you think the gang will be on the look-out for us in Rangoon, Buck?" asked Jack.

"Likely enough," replied Risley. "No harm in takin' care, anyway."

The two gained a narrow lane beyond the alley, followed it some distance, then turned into
a wider street. Here Buck paused before a shop whose windows were closed, but rays of light
were streaming through chinks in the shutters. He tried the door and found that it was not
fastened.

"Nip right in," said Risley, and the two entered briskly, and closed the door behind them.
Behind the counter stood a tall, elderly man taking a rifle to pieces by the light of a brightly-burning
lamp. He was surrounded by weapons of all kinds, and a single glance told Jack that he stood
in a gunsmith's shop.

"Hello, Buck," said the tall man calmly. "Slidin' in like a thief in the night, eh? What's
wrong, and who's your friend?"

"This is the Professor's son, Mr. Jack Haydon," replied Buck, answering the last question first,
as he put down his bag and shook hands with his acquaintance.

"Pleased to know you, sir," said the gunsmith, offering his hand to Jack in turn. "Me and your
father have known each other a long time and done a lot of business together. Perhaps you've
heard him mention me, Jim Dent?"

"Yes, Mr. Dent," said Jack, "I've heard your name many a time."

"I'm very sorry for you, sir," said Dent. "This is a queer business about the Professor. Knocked
me all of a heap when I heard of it."

"The news is about Rangoon, of course, Jim?" said Buck.

"Came at once," replied Dent. "The Professor was known to so many people here."

"Well, between me and you, Jim," said Buck in a low voice, "that's just what I've come to talk
about. You know the ropes in this country pretty well, and I want your advice."

"Been in Burmah twenty-eight years, and spent a good deal of the time shiftin' about here and
there," remarked Jim Dent. "I know a thing or two, as you may say. But come in; I should like
to hear all about it."

He secured the outer door, put out the lamp which lighted the shop, and led the way to an inner
room. Here another lamp was burning, and all three sat down. Buck plunged into the story, and
Dent listened attentively, now and again putting a question.

"They've got the Professor all right," said Dent at the conclusion of Buck's narrative.

"You, too, think so?" cried Jack.

"Oh, yes, sir," returned Dent, nodding at him, "they're going to make your father show 'em
his find, there's no mistake about that. The thing's been done before, but the men have been
collared in this country, I admit. I've never known anything so big and daring as this, but
still it's on the cards, and Buck has tumbled to the right conclusion."

"But how could they carry off my father with such secrecy?" asked Jack. "It was impossible
to book a passage back in any vessel. They would have been found out at once."

"That's right enough, sir," replied Dent. "They must have had a vessel of their own, but that's
a puzzling thing. Did you see any sign of this Saya Chone on the voyage, Buck?"

"Not a hair of him," replied Risley.

"He and his pals might have been among the third-class passengers after all," said the gunsmith.
"You weren't looking out for them, but it's pretty plain they were looking out for you. They
must have been fly to your posting that letter, and got an idea somehow or other of the address.
Well, this is a rum go. What's your next move, I wonder?"

"Go straight up to Mogok," suggested Jack, "and strike into the country where my father was
exploring. Surely we can lay our hands upon one or other of his native guides, and they will
lead us to the place. Then we can discover whether those people you suspect of kidnapping him
are anywhere in that neighbourhood."

Dent nodded his head in agreement. "Well, sir," he said, "you'll have to do something after
that fashion. But you must go to work very cautiously. The men you are after are at home there,
and have a hundred ways of finding out what you're up to, while you know no more of them and
their movements than you know which way a snake's slipping through the jungle."

"Would it be of any use to appeal to the authorities?" asked Jack.

The gunsmith shook his head.

"Not a mite, sir, not a mite. In the first place, you're moving on suspicion, and you can hardly
expect the police to go tramping round in wild and only partly explored jungle to find out
if your suspicions are correct. Then, again, if inquiries were started you would only warn
the parties you suspect, and they'd take good care your plans came to nothing. For holding
a man tight and keeping the place of his hiding secret, this country is a marvel. I've known
many a native disappear in a very mysterious fashion and be never heard of again; some enemy
had disposed of him." The gunsmith fell silent and mused for a few moments.

"I'll tell you," said he, "the best thing to do now, and that is to strike up to Mandalay.
There might be a chance there to pick up a bit of river news which would help you. I wonder
whether old Moung San is up in Mandalay yet. He started up river with his hnau weeks back,
and you know how they dawdle along, picking up every scrap of river gossip."

"Moung San!" cried Buck, "old Moung, why, he's the very man whose hnau took the Professor up
the river Chindwin, the last trip Mr. Haydon made before he went up to Mogok. He'll give us
a hand if he can, I know."

"He was in here, buying stuff off me to trade along the river," said Dent, "and he ought to
be somewhere about Mandalay by now."

"Then we'll start in the morning by the first train," said Buck; "and that reminds me, Jim,
we shall want some guns; we've got nothing at all at present, and we'll look over your stock."

"Come in the shop," said Dent, and all three went back to the little front room where weapons
stood in racks about the wall.

"These Mauser pistols are handy things," remarked Dent, as he turned some of his stock on to
the counter. "Clap the holster on 'em and they make a very smart little rifle."

"We'll have a couple," said Buck, "they're daisies. I've tried 'em. Have you got a light rifle
or two in stock, Jim? We don't want to drag any weight through the jungle, as you know as well
as most."

"What's the matter with the Mannlicher?" said Dent, picking up one of those handiest of shooting
tools and passing it over to Jack. "No weight, and as good a little rifle as a man wants to
put to his shoulder."

"This is all right," said Jack, putting it up. "I've never tried it, but I've heard about it.
Makes pretty good shooting, I think."

"Wonderful good, sir," said Dent. "You can't wish for better. And such a handy little cartridge,
too. That's a thing to consider on a march. You can carry a much bigger number for the same
weight of ordinary cartridges."

For half an hour or more Buck and Jack turned over Dent's stores, and laid in a very complete
stock of weapons and cartridges. As the gunsmith talked, speaking of the wild jungle into which
they must wander, the wild people they would be likely to meet, and what they would need to
meet the chances of their journey, his eye fired and his excitement grew. He poured forth a
flood of information, of warning, of directions, which showed how complete was his knowledge
of the wilds into which they were about to venture, how deep was his lore of jungle-craft,
and how great his passion for the life of the explorer and adventurer. His flood of speech
ended on a sigh.

"Five years it is now," he said, "since I made what I call a real trip, getting clean off the
track and striking a line which you might fancy no white man had ever struck before."

Buck had been watching his old acquaintance keenly. Now he leaned over and laid his hand on
Dent's arm.

"Look here, Jim," he said, "you're achin' in every bone o' your body for a real good trip again.
Come with us."

The invitation was like a spark thrown upon gunpowder. The gunsmith struck the counter with
his open hand till the weapons danced again.

"By George, I will!" he cried, "I'll come fast enough. It's the sort o' trip I'd choose out
of a thousand."

Jack saw what a splendid recruit offered here, and he hastened to second Buck.

"If you could, indeed, spare time to accompany us, Mr. Dent," he said, "we shall be delighted
to have your company and assistance."

"Well, sir," said Dent, "I'll give you a month. I can manage, I know, to get the business looked
after by a friend as long as that. And within a month, if we go the right way to work, we ought
to get a good idea as to whether the Professor's in the hands of that gang or not."

"And if your business suffers at all, Jim, you need never fear you'll be at a loss in the end,"
said Buck. "There's plenty of money for everything."

"Oh, that's all right," returned Dent. "Didn't you say you're offering a reward of £500 for
finding the Professor?"

"That's so," replied Risley.

"Very good," said Dent. "Suppose I hit on him first and pick that up. That'll clear my expenses,
and a bit over bar the fun o' the trip."

"Oh, Mr. Dent," said Jack, "we're paying all expenses, of course."

"Better an' better still," chuckled the gunsmith. "I get all the fun and the chance of £500
thrown in, and the lot for nothing. You can count in Jim Dent on this game." And so the matter
was settled.

CHAPTER VII.

UP THE RIVER.

It was on a Tuesday evening that Risley and Jack entered Dent's shop in Rangoon: late on the
Thursday afternoon the three comrades stepped out of the train at Mandalay.

"I know a little place down by the river where we can stay quietly," said Dent, and they took
a carriage and drove down to the banks of the broad Irrawaddy. Here, at a native rest-house
in a riverside village, they set down their baggage and made a hearty meal in a room whose
window overlooked the noble stream with its crowd of craft.

Before they ate, Dent had an interview with the master of the house, a short, stout Burman
in silken kilt and headgear of flaming scarlet, and their business was put in hand at once.
The Burman sent a native boatman off to see if Moung San had reached Mandalay.

The meal was scarcely ended before the light sampan was back with good news. Moung San had
been in Mandalay the last two days, and now lay at his accustomed anchorage.

"That's capital," said Dent. "We'll give old Moung a look up before the evening's much older."

Half an hour later all three embarked upon the sampan whose owner had found out the anchorage
of Moung San, and the tiny craft was thrust into the river and pulled across the flowing stream.
Jack looked with much interest on the pretty, picturesque little craft with its bow and stern
curving upwards, and on its boatman, a strong Shan clad in wide trousers and a great flapping
hat, who stood up to his couple of oars and sent the light skiff along at a good speed. A pull
of a mile or more brought them to the hnau, a big native boat moored near the farther shore
of the wide stream. The sampan was directed towards the lofty and splendidly-carved prow of
the hnau and brought to rest.

Now there looked over the side a dark-faced old Burman, whose face broke into smiles at sight
of his old acquaintances.

"Hello, Moung San," cried Dent. "We've come to pay you a visit."

"Very glad, very glad," replied the Burman. "Come up, come up."

They climbed at once to the deck of the hnau, where Moung San shook hands with them very heartily.
When he heard Jack's name he smiled and showed all his teeth, stained black with betel-chewing.

"Me know your father," he said, and shook Jack's hand again. "Very good man, very good man."

Amidships there was a large cabin, roofed with plaited cane, built up on the hnau. Moung San
invited them to enter it, and all four went in and sat down.

"Now, Moung San," began Jim Dent "You listen to me. You know the ruby-mines well, don't you?"

"Yes," replied Moung San. "Do much trade with the miners for many years."

"Do you know a man named Saya Chone?"

"Yes," said the trader. "Know him. Don't like him."

"Who is he with now?"

"With U Saw, the man they call the Ruby King."

"U Saw," murmured Dent reflectively. "He's jumped into notice since I was up here last. What
sort of character has U Saw, Moung San?"

The Burman lowered his voice and looked uneasily round to see if any of his crew were within
earshot.

"Very dangerous man," he said, shaking his head, "if he hears of one of the hill-miners finding
good ruby, that man sure to lose it, perhaps lose his head same time. U Saw has many Kachins
who follow him, and every Kachin carry strong, sharp dah (native sword)."

"Have the police been on to him, Moung San?" asked Buck.

"The police!" Moung San laughed disdainfully. "What do the police know about the hills and
the jungle, and what goes on there? But we know. The word goes from Kachin to Shan, and from
Shan to Burman, over the country, up and down the river. We know."

"Where does U Saw sell his rubies?" asked Dent.

"In China," replied the Burman. "Takes them along the great road to China from Burmah over
the mountains. Sells them there for big, big money. Very rich and very strong is U Saw."

Then, with scarcely a pause, Moung San came out with a piece of news that made his hearers jump.

"When I am at Prome two weeks ago, the 'fire-boat' of U Saw pass me, and go up the river."

"Fire-boat!" cried Jim Dent. "U Saw possesses a steamer. How big, Moung San?"

Moung San went into details. He compared the "fire-boat" with the size of his hnau, he compared
it with a river-steamer which now went puffing past, he described it with the greatest minuteness,
for he had lain beside it at Bhamo for three days on the trip before last.

"Say," murmured Buck, looking round on his deeply-interested companions, "this beats the band.
I didn't know U Saw had a steam yacht of about three hundred tons, for that's what Moung San's
talk comes to. Say, Jim, my son, this clears things up a bit."

"It does that," said Dent. He turned to Jack.

"You see, sir," he remarked, "that Buck's guess hit the mark pretty straight. I'd stake my
shop that the party we want was on that yacht."

Jack nodded, with bright eyes. "It must be so," he said, but Buck was again in conversation
with the Burman.

"Do you know where the 'fire-boat' had been?" he asked.

"There was a word that U Saw had been a long cruise in the islands," replied Moung San.

"Been a long cruise in the islands, had he?" said Dent, in a meaning tone. There was silence
while the three white men made swift calculations mentally.

"If the yacht is a good sea-boat," said Jack, "they would just about have had the right time
to do it, supposing they came up the river two weeks back." He meant the voyage from the Mediterranean,
and the others nodded.

The old Burman looked from one to the other gravely. There was something he did not understand
behind this, and it was plain that he was about to shape a question.

Buck whispered swiftly to Jack, then spoke:

"Well, Moung San, we must be going. But the son of your old patron wished to see you and to
give you a little present because you have served his father."

Jack smiled and passed over twenty rupees. Moung San's mouth was at once filled with thanks
instead of questions, and an awkward moment passed safely.

"I could see the old fellow was going to ask questions," remarked Jim Dent, when they were
once more in the sampan, and the big Shan was pulling strongly across the stream. "It was a
lucky stroke to stop his mouth with the rupees."

"Yes," said Jack, "it's quite clear he knows nothing about my father's disappearance, or he
would have said something. So it was just as well to leave him in ignorance, and escape a lot
of talk. You never know where the simplest question may lead you to."

"You don't," agreed Dent. "He may wonder why we want to know about the Ruby King, but as long
as he's in the dark about things, he'll put it down to mere curiosity."

CHAPTER VIII.

THE ATTACK ON THE SAMPAN.

Jack nodded and looked out across the wide, shadowy waste of waters which surrounded them.
The night had fallen and there was no moon, but the sky was full of the glorious stars of the
East, and the great silent river spread itself abroad in the bright starshine till its low
distant banks were lost to sight, and the sampan seemed to be crossing a vast lake. Far away
up the stream a myriad twinkling lights showed where the shipping lay thickly, and now a huge
cargo boat came down stream, its vast bulk looming high above the smooth flood.

Somewhere on the shore a mandoline tinkled, the faint distant notes coming sweetly to them
across the water. Jack dropped his hand into the stream and found it warm to the fingers. Then
he felt that the river was full of something floating on its surface, which brushed his fingers,
and circled about his wrist.

"What's this in the water?" said Jack.

Buck dropped his hand down.

"Paddy-husks, the husk of rice," he replied. "There are rice-mills on the banks up above, and
they pitch the husks into the stream. When the mills are busy, the husks cover the river."

"It is a strong current," said Jack.

"Ay, and a very dangerous one," remarked Dent "There's no mercy in this river. It'll sweep
you away like the under-tow of a strong tide, and suck you down to feed the crocodiles, if
it gets the chance."

For a few moments there was silence, and Jack, who was seated with his face to his companions,
watched the big cargo-boat now passing them, but a good distance away. Suddenly he sharpened
the glance of his keen eyes and looked more intently. A tiny dark patch shot from the shadow
of the great vessel and held its way straight towards them.

"There's a boat just come from behind that big ship, and it's making straight for us," said Jack.

"That's queer," said Dent sharply, turning his head to look. "It must have come down stream
in shelter of the cargo-boat. I've been keeping a watch on the river round us." He said a few
words in the native tongue to the big Shan, and the latter pulled much faster and altered his
course a little.

"If they're only making for the shore they'll go straight on," said Jim Dent. "If they're after
us, they'll change their course."

"They row fast," said Jack.

Jim spoke to the Shan once more, and a few sentences passed between them.

"It's one of those long creek skiffs, pulled by six men," announced Jim. "He knows by the shape
of it on the water and the sound of the oars."

"Think they're after us, Jim?" asked Buck in a low voice.

"I don't know, Buck," replied Dent. "But I wish we were ashore. This isn't a country to take
any chances in."

All three watched the dark, long shape behind them, and the Shan pulled with all his might.

"It's after us." Jim Dent's low, fierce tones broke into the tense silence, and Buck gave a
growl of anger.

"What's their game?" he muttered.

"Run us down, there's no doubt of it," replied Dent. "That skiff is built of stiff teak planks,
with a nose as sharp and hard as an iron spike. If they once hit this light sampan they'll
cut it in two and scupper us."

"Ay, ay," said Buck, "and drop an oar on the head of a man who tries to swim."

The long narrow row-boat was now heading for them as straight as an arrow. There could be no
doubt of the rowers' intent. They meant to run down the slight sampan and hurl its occupants
into the deadly current below. Driven by six powerful oarsmen, the skiff was coming on at tremendous
speed, and the shore was still a dim and distant line.

Jim Dent spoke again quickly to the Shan, and the latter made a swift reply and bent to his
oars with all his might. He understood their danger better than any one, supposing that his
light vessel was run down, and he beat the water with long powerful strokes which drove the
tiny craft forward with great power. Jim Dent had begun to rummage in the stern, and soon drew
out a broad-bladed steering paddle. He dipped this into the water and added a strong dexterous
stroke to the efforts of the boatman; now the sampan began to fly.

"Isn't there anything for us, Jim?" cried Jack. "Must we sit idle?"

"There's not another thing to pull with in the boat," said Dent. "I'll lay in with all the
strength I've got with this paddle. We'll take turns at it."

Now commenced a stern, fierce race for life. The two men in the sampan fought with set brows
and clenched teeth to gain the far-off shore and save the lives of themselves and their comrades.
The six rowers in the long skiff lashed the water furiously with their oars in order to overtake
and ram the slight vessel they pursued. One, two, three hundred yards were covered. Jack's
heart sank. The skiff had gained terribly. Manned by six powerful oarsmen, she was cutting
down the distance between them with frightful rapidity. In the sampan the Shan was still pulling
with undiminished energy, but Jim Dent was beginning to pant. Buck seized the paddle from his
grip and took a turn. But the skiff continued to come up hand over hand.

"She'll get us long before we reach the shore," murmured Dent as he marked the relative distances,
and he spoke in the native tongue with the Shan, who only answered with a grunt or two which
had a sound of acquiescence.

"Give me the paddle, Buck," said Dent.

"No, no," said Jack, "it's my turn." Every muscle in his body was tingling to put its strength
against the smooth current and the weight of the sampan.

"We're going to try a little trick," said Dent, and Jack perforce had to sit still. He glanced
down the river and saw a light low on the water, as if a boat was coming towards them. He wondered
whether it meant chance of help, but in any case, it was far off, and the enemy were now terribly
near, and his attention was drawn again to their position of immense peril.

Dent and the boatman were now pulling easily, and the long skiff darted up to them faster and
faster still. Jack watched their pursuers with a fascinated eye. There was not the faintest
sound made, save for the regular plash of the rising and falling oars. They were so near that
he could see the naked backs of the oarsmen glisten as they swung their bodies to and fro in
the starshine. Nearer, nearer, came the long darting skiff.

Jack held his breath. The sharp nose was within half a dozen feet of the stern of the flying
sampan, for Dent and the boatman were once more pulling with all their might. For the first
time a sound was heard from the pursuing boat. A single word rang out from the steersman, and
the rowers bent to one last tremendous effort to hurl their stout skiff upon the fragile sampan.
But at that very instant Jim Dent dipped his paddle deep on the left side, the Shan made a
corresponding movement with his oars, and the light vessel spun round on her heel and darted
away from the impending stroke.

So close were the two boats when this skilful manoeuvre was executed that the dripping bow
oar of the pursuers was flourished almost in Jack's face as the sampan flew round. He seized
it, but did not attempt to snatch it from the oarsman's clutch. He had no time for that, but
he made splendid use of the chance afforded him. He gave it a tremendous push, and released
it. The rower, caught by surprise, was flung over the opposite gunwale, and the skiff was nearly
upset. As the sampan darted away on her new course, the skiff was left floundering on the water.

"Good for you," chuckled Dent, who had seen the swift action and the confusion it caused; "that's
given us twenty yards," and now he allowed Jack to seize the paddle. "Tom, you are crazy. Time
enough, surely, when we all meet in England."

"And when may that be?" said I, drawing her arm closer through mine. "No, no--tomorrow I will
call on the admiral; and as you are all going to England in the fleet at any rate, I will ask
his leave to give you a passage."

All of which, as I said before, being parish news, we shall drop a veil over it--so a small
touch at the scenery again.

Immediately under foot rose several lower ranges of mountains those nearest us, covered with
the laurel--looking coffee--bushes, interspersed with negro villages hanging amongst the fruit--trees
like clusters of birds nests on the hillside, with a bright green patch of plantain suckers
here and there, and a white painted overseer's house peeping from
out the wood, and herds of cattle in the Guinea--grass pieces.

Beyond these, stretched out the lovely plain of Liguanea, covered with luxuriant cane--pieces,
and groups of negro houses, and Guinea--grass pastures of even a deeper green than that of
the canes; and small towns of sugar--works rose every here and there,
with their threads of white smoke floating up into the clear sky,
while, as the plain receded, the cultivation disappeared, and it gradually
became sterile, hot, and sandy, until the Long Mountain hove its back
like a whale from out the sea--like level of the plain; while to the
right of it appeared the city of Kingston, like a model, with its
parade, or place d'armes, in the centre, from which its long lines
of hot sandy streets stretched out at right angles, with the military
post of Up park camp, situated about a mile and a half to the northward
and eastward of the town.

Through a tolerably good glass, the church spire looked like a needle,
the trees about the houses like bushes, the tall cocoa--nut trees
like harebells; a slow crawling black speck here and there denoted
a carriage moving along, while waggons, with their teams of eighteen
and twenty oxen, looked like so many centipedes.

At the camp, the two regiments drawn out on parade, with two nine--pounders
on each flank, and their attendant gunners, looked like a red sparkling
line, with two black spots at each end, surrounded by small black
dots.

Presently the red line wavered, and finally broke up, as the regiments wheeled into open column,
when the whole fifteen hundred men crawled past three little scarlet spots, denoting the general
and his staff. When they began to manoeuvre, each company looked like a single piece in a game
at chess; and as they fired by companies, the little tiny puffs of smoke floated up like wreaths
of wool, suddenly surmounting and overlaying the red lines, while
the light companies breaking away into skirmishers, seemed, for all
the world, like two red bricks suddenly cast down, and shattered on
the ground, whereby the fragments were scattered all over the green
fields, and under the noble trees, the biggest of which looked like
small cabbages.

At length the line was again formed, and the inspection being over, it broke up once more,
and the minute red fragments presently vanished altogether like a nest of ants, the guns, looking
like so many barleycorns, under the long lines of barracks, that looked no bigger than houses
in a child's toy. As for the other arm, we of the navy had no reason to glorify ourselves. For,
while the review proceeded on shore, a strange man--of--war hove in sight in the offing, looming
like a mussel--shell, although she was a forty--four--gun frigate, and ran down before the wind,
close to the Palisadoes, or natural tongue of land, which juts out
like a bow from Rock Fort, to the eastward of Kingston, and hoops
in the harbour, and then lengthens out, trending about five miles
due west, where it widens out into a sandy flat, on which the town
and forts of Port Royal are situated.

She was saluting the admiral when I first saw her. A red spark and a small puff on the starboard
side--a puff, but no spark, on the larboard, which was the side farthest from us, but no report
from either reached our ears; and presently down came the little red flag, and up went the
St George's ensign, white, with a red cross, while the sails of the gallant craft seemed about
the size of those of a little schoolboy's plaything. After a short interval, the flag ship,
a seventy four, lying at Port Royal, returned the salute. She, again, appeared somewhat loftier;
she might have been an oyster--shell; while the squadron of four frigates, two sloops of war, and
several brigs and schooners, looked like ants in the wake of a beetle. As for the dear little
Wave, I can compare her to nothing but a musquitto, and the large
500--ton West Indiamen lying off Kingston, five miles nearer, were
but as small cock--boats to the eye.

In the offing the sea appeared like ice, for the waves were not seen at all, and the swell could
only be marked by the difference in the reflection of the sun's rays as it rose and fell, while
a hot haze hung over the whole, making every thing indistinct, so that the water blended into sky,
without the line of demarcation being visible. But even as we looked forth on this most glorious
scene, a small black cloud rose to windward. At this time we were both sitting on the grass on a
most beautiful bank, beneath an orange--tree--the ominous appearance increased in size--the
sea breeze was suddenly stifled--the swelling sails of the frigate that had first saluted, fell,
and, as she rolled, flattened in against the masts the rustling of the green leaves overhead ceased.

The
cloud rolled onward from the east, and spread out, and out, as it
sailed in from seaward, and on, and on, until it gradually covered
the whole scene from our view, (shipping, and harbour, and town, and
camp, and sugar estates,) boiling and rolling in black eddies under
our feet.

Anon the thunder began to grumble, and the zigzag lightning to fork out from one dark mass into
another, while all, where we sat, was bright and smiling under the unclouded noon--day sun. This
continued for half an hour, when at length the sombre appearance of the clouds below us brightened
into a sea of white fleecy vapour like wool, which gradually broke away into detached masses,
discovering another layer of still thinner vapour underneath, which again parted, disclosing
through the interstices a fresh gauze--like veil of transparent mist,
through which the lower ranges of hills, and the sugar estates, and
the town and shipping, were once more dimly visible; but this in turn
vanished, and the clouds, attracted by the hills, floated away, and
hung around them in festoons, and gradually rose and rose until presently
we were enveloped in mist, and Mary spoke.

"Tom, there will be thunder here what shall we do?"

"Poo, never mind.

Mary, you have a conductor on the house."

"True," said she; "but the servants, when the post that supported it was blown down t'other
day, very judiciously unlinked the rods, and now, since I remember me, they are, to use your
phrase, 'stowed away' below the house;" and so they were, sure enough. However, we had no more
thunder, and soon the only indications of the spent storm were the
red discoloured appearance of the margin of the harbour, from the
rush of muddy water off the land, and the chocolate colour of the
previously snow--white sandy roads, that now twisted through the plain
like black snakes, and a fleecy dolphin--shaped cloud here and there
stretching out, and floating horizontally in the blue sky, as if it
had been hooked to the precipitous mountain tops above us.

Next day it was agreed that we should all return to Kingston, and the day after that, we proceeded
to Mr Bangs's Pen, on the Spanish Town road, as a sort of halfway
house, or stepping stone to his beautiful residence in St Thomas in
the Vale, where we were all invited to spend a fortnight.

Our friend himself was on the other side of the island, but he was to join us in the valley, and
we found our comforts carefully attended to; and as the day after
we had set up our tent at the Pen was to be one of rest to my aunt,
I took the opportunity of paying my respects to the admiral, who was
then careening at his mountain retreat in the vicinity with his family.

Accordingly, I took horse, and rode along the margin of the great
lagoon, on the Spanish Town road, through tremendous defiles; and
after being driven into a watchman's hut by the rain, I reached the
house, and was most graciously received by Sir Samuel Semaphore and
his lady, and their lovely daughters.

Oh, the most splendid women that ever were built! The youngest is now, I believe, the prime ornament
of the Scottish Peerage; and I never can forget the pleasure I so frequently experienced in those
days in the society of this delightful family.

The same evening I returned to the Pen.

On my way I fell in with three officers in white jackets, and broad--brimmed straw hats, wading
up to the waist amongst the reeds of the lagoon, with guns held high above their heads. They were
shooting ducks, it seemed; and their negro servants were heard ploutering
and shouting amidst the thickets of the crackling reeds, while their
dogs were swimming all about them.

"Hillo!" shouted the nearest--"Cringle, my lad--whither bound? how is Sir Samuel and Lady Semaphore,
eh? Capital sport, ten brace of teal there"--and the spokesman threw two beautiful birds ashore
to me.

This wise man of the bulrushes was no less a personage than Sir Jeremy Mayo, the commander
of the forces, one of the bravest fellows in the army, and respected
and beloved by all who ever knew him, but a regular dare devil of
an Irishman, who, not satisfied with his chance of yellow fever on
shore, had thus chosen to hunt for it with his staff, in the Caymanas
Lagoon.

Next morning, we set out in earnest on our travels for St Thomas in the Vale, in two of our
friend Bang's gigs, and my aunt's ketureen, laden with her black
maiden and a lot of bandboxes, while two mounted servants brought
up the rear, and my old friend Jupiter, who had descended, not from
the clouds, but from the excellent Mr Fyall, who was by this time
gathered to his fathers, to Massa Aaron, rode a musket shot ahead
of the convoy to clear away, or give notice of any impediments, of
wagons or carts, or droves of cattle, that might be meeting us.

After driving five miles or so, we reached the seat of government, Spanish Town. Here we stopped
at the Speaker's house--by the way, one of the handsomest and most agreeable men I ever saw--intending
to proceed in the afternoon to our destination. But the rain in the forenoon fell so heavily, that
we had to delay our journey until next morning; and that afternoon I spent in attending the debates
in the House. of Assembly, where every thing was conducted with much greater decorum than I
ever saw maintained in the House of Commons, and no great daring in the assertion either. The
Hall itself, fitted with polished mahogany benches, was handsome and well aired, and between
it and the grand court, as it is called, occupying the other end
of the building, which was then sitting, there is a large cool saloon,
generally in term time well filled with wigless lawyers and their
clients.

The House of Assembly (this saloon and the court--house forming one side of the square) is situated
over against the Government House; while another side is occupied by a very handsome temple,
covering in a statue erected to Lord Rodney, the saviour of the Island,
as he is always called, from having crushed the fleet of Count de
Grasse.

At length, at grey--dawn the next day, as the report of the morning
gun came booming along the level plain from Port Royal, we weighed
and finally started on our cruise.

As we drove up towards St Thomas in the Vale, from Spanish Town, along the hot sandy road, the
plain gradually roughened into small rocky eminences, covered with patches of bushes here and
there, with luxuriant Guinea--grass growing in the clefts; the road
then sank between abrupt little hills the Guinea corn fields began
to disappear, the grass became greener, the trees rose higher, the
air felt fresher and cooler, and proceeding still farther, the hills
on either side swelled into mountains, and became rocky and precipitous,
and drew together, as it were, until they appeared to impend over us.

We had now arrived at the gorge of the pass, leading into the valley, through which flowed a most
beautiful limpid clear blue stream, along the margin of which the
road wound, while the tree--clothed precipices rose five hundred feet
perpendicularly on each brink.

Presently we crossed a wooden bridge, supported by a stone pier in the centre, when Jupiter
pricked a--head to give notice of the approach of waggons, that our cavalcade might haul up,
out of danger, into some nook in the rock, to allow the lumbersome
teams to pass.

"What is that?"--I was driving my dearie in the leading gig--"is that
a pistol shot?"

It was the crack of the long whip carried by the negro waggoner, reverberated from hill to
hill, and from cliff to cliff; and presently the father of gods came thundering down the steep
acclivity we were ascending.

"Massa, draw up into dat corner; draw up."

I did as I was desired, and presently the shrill whistle of the negro waggoners, and the increasing
sharpness of the reports of their loud whips, the handles of which
were as long as fishing--rods, and their wild exclamations to their
cattle, to whom they addressed themselves by name, as if they had
been reasonable creatures, gave notice of the near approach of a train
of no fewer than seven waggons, each with three drivers, eighteen
oxen, three hogsheads of sugar, and two puncheons of rum.

Come, thought I--if the negroes are overworked, it is more than the
bullocks are, at all events.

They passed us with abundance of yelling and cracking, and as soon as the coast was clear, we
again pursued our way up the ravine, than which nothing could be
more beautiful or magnificent.

On our right hand now rose, almost perpendicularly, the everlasting rocks, to a height of a thousand
feet, covered with the richest foliage that imagination can picture, while here and there a sharp
steeple--like pinnacle of grey--stone, overgrown with lichens, shot
up, and out from the face of them, into the blue sky, mixing with
the tall forest trees that overhung the road, festooned with ivy and
withes of different kinds, like the rigging of a ship, round which
the tendrils of many a beautiful wild--flower crept twining up, while
all was fresh with the sparkling dew that showered down on us, with
every breath of wind, like rain.

On our left foamed the roaring river, and on the other brink the
opposite bank rose equally precipitously, clothed also with superb
trees, that spread their blending boughs over the chasm, until they
wove themselves together with those that grew on the side we were
on, qualifying the noonday fierceness of a Jamaica sun into a green
cool twilight, while the long misty reaches of the blue river, with
white foaming rapids here and there, and the cattle wading in them,
lengthened out beneath in the distance.

Oh! the very look of it refreshed one unspeakably.

Presently a group of half--a--dozen country Buccras--overseers, or
coffee--planters, most likely, or possibly larger fish than either--hove
in sight, all in their blue--white jean trowsers, and long Hessian
boots pulled up over them, and new blue square--cut, bright--buttoned
coatees, and thread--bare silk broad--brimmed hats.

They dashed past us on goodish nags, followed at a distance of three
hundred yards by a covey of negro--servants, mounted on mules, in
white Osnaburg trowsers, with a shirt or frock over them, no stockings,
each with one spur, and the stirrup--iron held firmly between the
great and second toes, while a snow--white sheep's fleece covered
their massas portmanteaus, strapped on to the mail pillion behind.

We drove on for about seven miles, after entering the pass, the whole scenery of which was
by far the finest thing I had ever seen, the precipices on each side
becoming more and more rugged and abrupt as we advanced, until all
at once we emerged from the chasm on the parish of St Thomas in the
Vale, which opened on us like a magical illusion, in all its green
luxuriance and freshness.

But by this time we were deucedly tired, and Massa Aaron's mansion, situated on its little airy
hill above a sea of canes, which rose and fell before the passing breeze like the waves of the ocean,
was the most consolatory object in the view; and thither we drove
is fast as our wearied horses could carry us, and found every thing
most carefully prepared for our reception.

Having dressed, we had a glorious dinner, lots of good wine; and, the happiest of the happy, I tumbled
into bed, dreaming of leading a division of line--of--battle ships
into action, and of Mary, and of our eldest son being my first lieutenant.

"Massa"--quoth

Jupiter--"you take cup of coffee, dis marning, massa?"

"Thank you--certainly."

It was by this time grey dawn. My window had been left open the evening before, when it was hot
and sultry enough, but it was now cold and damp, and a wetting mist boiled in through the open
sash, like rolling wreaths of white smoke.

"What is that--where are we in the North Sea, or on the top of Mont Blanc? Why, clouds may be all
in your way, Massa Jupiter, but."

"Cloud!" rejoined the Deity--"him no more den marning fag, massa;
always hab him over de Vale in de morning, until de sun melt him.

And where is you?--why, you is in Massa Aaron house, here in St Thomas
in de Vale--and Miss."

"Miss"--said I--"what Miss?"

"Oh, for you Miss," rejoined Jupiter with a grin, "Miss Mary up and dress already, and de horses
are at de door; him wait for you to ride wid him before breakfast, massa, and to see de clearing
of de fag."

"Ride before breakfast!--see the clearing of the fog!" grumbled I.
"Romantic it may be, but consumedly inconvenient."

However, my knighthood was at stake; so up I got, drank my coffee, dressed, and adjourned to
the piazza, where my adorable was all ready rigged with riding--habit
and whip; straightway we mounted, she into her side saddle with her
riding--habit, and who knows how many petticoats beneath her, while
I, Pilgarlic, embarked in thin jean trowsers upon a cold, damp, indeed
wet, saddle, that made me shiver again.

But I was understood to be in love; ergo, I was expected to be agreeable.

However, a damp saddle and a thin pair of trowsers allays one's ardour
a good deal too.

But if any one had seen the impervious fog in which we sat--why, you could not see a tree three
yards from you--a cabbage looked like a laurel bush, and Sneezer
became a dromedary, and the negroes passing the little gate to their
work were absolute Titans.

Boom, a long reverberating noise thundered in the distance, and amongst the hills, gradually dying away
in a hollow rumble. "The admiral tumbling down the hatchway, Tom--the
morning gun fired at Port Royal," said Mary; and so it was.

The fire--flies were still glancing amongst the leaves of the beautiful orange--trees in front
of the house; but we could see no farther, the whole view being shrouded under the thick watery
veil which rolled and boiled about us, sometimes thick, and sometimes thinner; hovering between a
mist and small rain, and wetting ones hair, and face, and clothes,
most completely.

We descended from the eminence on which the house stood, rode along
the level at the foot of it, and, after a canter of a couple of miles,
we began to ascend a bridle--path, through the Guinea--grass pastures,
which rose rank and soaking wet, as high as one's saddlebow, drenching
me to the skin, in the few patches where I was not wet before.

All this while the fog continued as thick as ever; at length we suddenly
rose above it--rode out of it, as it were.

 Then some
of 'em were left lurking about, and they spied Me Dain coming, didn't see us behind, and thought
he was coming to the village alone. Of course they slipped out of the bushes and nabbed him,
thinking to whiff off his head and turn the ponies' packs out at their own leisure. But Jack
upset their little plan, and Me Dain's head stops in the right spot."

"Many thanks, phaya (my lord), many thanks," said Me Dain, bending low before Jack. "Your servant
thanks you for his life."

Crack! There was a dull roar as of someone firing a very heavy duck-gun from the forest, and
a ball whistled by their heads.

"A jingal!" cried Buck. "We've got to hustle round and find shelter. The dacoits are on us."

"The pagoda, sahibs," cried Me Dain. "It is the only place of stone in the village. Let us
hasten there."

He gathered up the leading-reins of the ponies--which had been easily caught--and hurried towards
the spire. The others ran swiftly after him, their steps hastened by the roar of a second shot
and the whistle of a second heavy ball.

In a couple of minutes they had reached the pagoda and leaped on the platform between the columns
which supported the bulb-like roof crowned by its tapering spire. In the centre of the platform
was a shrine. Jack glanced quickly round.

"This won't do," he said, "not enough cover here, supposing the dacoits attack us. What's that
place?"

He pointed to a new, strongly-built house of stone a short distance from the pagoda.

Me Dain looked at it in surprise. "It has been built since I was here last," he cried.

"Looks just the thing for us," said Jack. "Come on," and the whole party hurried across to
the building, whose door stood half open.

"It is a small monastery," cried Me Dain, as they approached, "some rich man has been winning
merit since I was last this way. Stay a moment, sahibs; I will enter and see that all is safe."
He flung the leading-reins to Buck and darted forward. In a few moments he reappeared, and
cried out, "There is no one here but a wounded villager, sahibs. Come on, we shall be safe
from the dacoits' guns in this new, strong house."

The party entered through a door formed of strong teak slabs, and Me Dain closed it behind
them. They now found themselves in a large, wide apartment, formed of the whole ground floor
of the building, from which wooden stairs led to upper rooms.

At the foot of the stairs was huddled a fine-looking old man, whose rich silken kilt and jacket
of delicate muslin showed that he was a person of consequence. He had received a severe cut
from a dah on the left shoulder, and while Me Dain skilfully bound up the wound, he talked
with the old man and learned the story of the affair.

It proved to be the outcome of a blood-feud, one of those savage vendettas so common among
the hill-tribes of Burmah. A band of Kachin dacoits had raided near the village some six months
before, and three of the dacoits had been cut off and killed by the villagers. Now, in revenge,
a strong troop of the savage mountain banditti had fallen upon the village, burning, slaying,
plundering without mercy. The old man had fled for refuge to the monastery, his own monastery,
for he had built it to house a party of Burmese monks.

"I am Kyaung-Taga Pah, 'Builder of a Monastery Pah,'" he declared proudly, and Me Dain bowed
before him in much respect.

It is the great ambition of a wealthy Burman to show his piety by building a pagoda or a monastery,
and when he has done so, he is always saluted by his fellows as "Builder of a Monastery," or
"Builder of a Pagoda," titles held in very high regard. This was the meaning of Me Dain's phrase
about some rich man winning merit, for it is considered that such good works meet with the
deep approval of the gods.

When "The Builder of a Monastery," Pah, had finished his story, Buck inquired where the monks
were, for, as a rule, such holy men are safe even in blood-feuds. The old Burman replied that
they were absent at present. There was a great festival at a large village three days' journey
away, and the monks had gone to attend it.

Jim had stayed at the door, keeping watch and ward.

"We're in for a little blood-feud, too," he remarked. "They're dottin' about pretty lively
at the edge of the jungle."

Jack ran across to him and saw a large number of little figures in blue flitting through the
trees; now and again he caught a flash of steel as some naked dah glittered in the rays of
the sinking sun. Buck had come too, and was looking over his comrade's shoulders.

"Say, we shall have to flip our guns a bit before we drive those blood-thirsty little ferrets
away," he remarked.

"Yes, they'll do their level best to cut our throats," agreed Jim. "They're like a nest of
hornets. Touch one and you've touched the lot."

"Hullo, they're bringing something forward," cried Jack. "It looks like a clumsy gun on a stand."

"That's a jingal," said Jim. "They're laying it for the door. We'll get out of the way. It's
a clumsy weapon and a clumsy ball, but if it hits you, you get all you want an' a little bit
over. I remember in '85"--for Jim had once been a British redcoat and had fought in the Burmese
war--"we were carrying a stockade with a rush, and a chum o' mine got a jingal-ball and went
down. He must have been a dead man when he dropped, for we found afterwards that the ball had
fairly ripped the inside out of the poor chap."

He closed the door as he finished speaking, and a heavy bar was placed in position across the
stout planks. From one of the small, slit-like windows they watched the movements of the dacoits.
The jingal, a big muzzle-loader on a stand of iron forks, was touched off and a heavy shot
crashed into the door.

"Whew!" whistled Jim. "That's a heavier shot than I thought. That bit of iron weighed nearer
half a pound than anything."

"It's cut into the door pretty badly," cried Jack, who had run forward to look, and found a
long streak of white in the plank which had been struck. "We shall have to stop that or the
door will be down."

"Sure thing," said Buck, "an' those little tigers away to the left o' the jingal are massing
for a rush as soon as the gunners have worked the door loose."

"You're right, Buck," said Jack, who had returned to his window. "Look here," he went on, "there
are three windows facing that patch of jungle where the dacoits are clustered. We'll take a
window apiece. I'll give the word, and we'll empty our magazines into them as fast as we can
pull the trigger."

"Good plan," cried Buck. "It will show 'em we're well armed and an awkward lot to tackle, even
if we don't scare 'em off."

"There ain't much scare about them, worse luck," said Jim, "but we'll pepper 'em a bit an'
see what happens anyhow."

Each of them had unslung his Mannlicher and held it in hand since the moment of the first alarm,
and now they opened the magazine and saw that all was in perfect order. Then they threw the
deadly little rifles into the embrasures formed by the window slits, and all was ready for
the word.

"Fire!" cried Jack, and the swift trill of rifle-cracks rang out on the soft evening silence.
As swiftly as they could press finger on trigger, the three comrades emptied their magazines
completely into the fringe of forest three hundred yards away. This storm of tiny, whirling
slips of lead struck among the dacoits at point blank range, and, by the screams and yells
of the banditti, did much execution. The watchers distinctly saw three or four fall, but these
were swiftly dragged among the trees by their comrades, and for a moment not a single dacoit
was to be seen. Then, just inside the shelter of the trees, five figures were observed very
busy placing a new jingal in position. At a glance the besieged saw that the gun was much larger
than the first, and would throw a heavier ball.

"We shall have to pick off those fellows at work with the new gun," said Jack. "Perhaps that
will terrify them into flight."

"I hope so," said Jim, but there was not much hope in his voice. "The worst of these little
chaps is that they never know when they're beaten. They'll give their lives to get yours, as
cheerfully as possible."

"And they don't set any high value on their lives, either," chimed in Buck. "Whoever's runnin'
the show over there, he'll spend his men's blood like water for the chance o' catchin' us and
puttin' us to death as slowly as he can make the time spin out."

"Slowly? Killing us slowly, Buck?" said Jack. "What do you mean?"

"Torture," replied Buck, and the one dreadful word was answer enough.

Crack! It was Jim's Mannlicher which spoke, but the bullet missed its aim. The dacoits at work
about the big jingal had artfully placed the weapon so that its mouth pointed from between
two close-growing teak saplings, and the trees formed a safe cover for the gunners.

"I thought I could pick one of 'em off that time," remarked Jim, "but I believe I only hit
a tree after all."

At this instant a figure was seen for a moment behind the long gun. A dacoit stepped into view,
crouched down, and carefully trained the piece. There was a second crack, and the freebooter
dropped under the jingal and never moved. Jack had fired and sent a Mannlicher bullet through
the dacoit's brain.

"I say, you can shoot a bit," cried Jim Dent admiringly, and Buck chuckled.

"I guess he can, Jim. He put on a very pretty string o' bull's-eyes at Bisley, shootin' in
the competition for public schools. The Professor grinned all over his face when he read how
Jack headed the list with a highest possible."

Buck's speech was cut short by a loud roar from the jingal. The fallen dacoit had trained it
perfectly before he dropped, and a comrade now touched off the piece. At the next moment a
terrific crash rang through the building. The heavy missile had lighted full on the point where
the door was secured by the stout bar, had smashed its way through door and bar and hurled
the door open. As the portal flew back, there was a tremendous yell from the edge of the jungle.
Then a cloud of blue figures burst into sight. With gleaming dahs flourished on high, or long-barrelled
muskets thrown forward ready to fire, the blood-thirsty little men of the mountains rushed
upon their prey.

CHAPTER XII.

A FIGHT FOR LIFE.

Jack ran forward to the door and tried to thrust it into place again. It swung to, for its
hinges were uninjured, and as he closed it, Me Dain was beside him with a short, thick plank
he had brought from the other side of the room. The plank was placed diagonally against the
door, its head caught under a cross-bar piece of the framework, and, for the moment, the open
gap was filled up. The rifles in the hands of Jim and Buck had been going steadily from the
moment the Kachins flew out of their cover, and Jack now poked the muzzle of his weapon through
a broken plank, and fired swiftly and steadily into the mass of assailants racing directly
towards him. The whole thing happened so quickly that the dacoits had not crossed more than
one half of the space intervening between monastery and jungle when Jack opened fire.

The withering storm of bullets poured from the three magazines had no more effect in checking
the dacoit rush than if the bullets had been drops of rain. The men actually struck dropped,
of course, but their comrades were not in the least terrified by their fall. The short, broad,
powerful figures rushed on as undauntedly as ever, their dark, wild faces full of the savage
light of battle, their rough, deep voices uniting in a terrible yell of rage and of fierce
lust for vengeance. A shower of bullets from their muzzle loaders pattered on the door or whistled
in through the windows.

Buck gave a grunt of pain as a bullet cut him across a shoulder; Jim and Jack were untouched.
The Kachins did not stay to reload, and in another moment their dark faces and blue forms were
massed in the doorway, and the door rang under the tremendous blows delivered upon it by their
dahs, weapons so broad and heavy as to be sword and axe in one. The windows, luckily, were
too narrow for them to swarm through, and when Jim and Buck could no longer rake the flying
crowd, they ran to the door to help their young leader. This was the moment when the Mauser
pistol proved itself an invaluable weapon. Quicker and handier in the narrow space than a rifle,
it poured its stream of heavy bullets into the assailants in an almost unbroken stream, as
the defenders slipped clip after clip, each containing ten cartridges, into the magazine.

Fanatically brave as were the desperate Kachins, this was a punishment too severe for mortal
flesh and blood to endure. Of a sudden they broke and fled, leaving a heap of dead and wounded
about the door, and a trail of fallen men to mark the track they had followed.

"Are you hurt, Buck?" cried Jack, drawing a long breath. Fiercely as they had been pressed,
he had not forgotten Risley's grunt of pain.

"Snicked my shoulder, that's all," replied Buck.

Jim looked at the wound and nodded.

"A snick it is, Buck," he agreed, "and a lucky thing for you. A bit lower, and it would have
smashed the bone."

"We'll wash the wound and tie it up," said Jack.

"Later on, later on," murmured Buck. "We've got no time to spare at present. What's the little
move next with these boys in blue."

"Do you think they will attack us again?" cried Jack.

"Sure thing," said Buck, "they're a tough crew, I can tell you. We've got a lot more to do
before we chill 'em cold."

"That's true," said Dent. "After they smell blood there's no more holdin' them than you can
hold a tiger."

"We've punished them terribly already," said Jack.

It was his first battle, and in true English fashion he had fought his hardest for his own
life and the lives of his comrades. Now he looked with a troubled eye on the fallen, and sighed.

Jim Dent nodded at him with a friendly smile. "I know just how you feel, Jack," he said. "But
the thing is pure necessity. If you hadn't shot that chap back in the path there, he'd have
had Me Dain's head off as sure as sin, and after you shot him, the rest followed as straight
as a string."

"True, Jim," said Jack, "the whole thing lies at their door."

"Say, Jack," murmured Buck, "you'd better get your Bisley bull's-eye trick on that jingal again.
They're goin' to try another shot or two."

Jack ran to the window, and as he did so, the jingal roared, and crash came the heavy shot
into the door. It struck a weak place, burst through, and rolled across the floor. In another
moment Buck had picked it up and brought it forward.

"Say, boys," murmured Risley, "no wonder this jingal makes the poor old door crack. Look here!"
He displayed a ball of iron, nearly the size of a cricket ball.

"By George! What a smasher!" said Dent. "The door's bound to go if they can get two or three
of those straight on it."

Jack glanced at the heavy shot, then turned to the window to watch for the gunners in order
to check them in working their destructive piece.

"I can't see them," he said. "There's no sign of them at all."

Jim and Buck joined him at once.

"There's the bunch of trees they were at work among," said Dent. "They must have drawn the
jingal farther back into the jungle."

"Yes, but if they can shoot at us we ought to be able to see them," said Jack.

"Sure thing," murmured Buck. "Where's the little old cannon gone to?"

In another moment all three gave a cry of surprise. The mystery was made clear before their
eyes. A sudden puff of smoke burst from a tangle of vines and creepers twenty yards to the
left of the jingals former position, and a second ball crashed into the door, shook every plank
in it, and ripped a great piece out where it struck. The dacoits had swiftly cut down and lashed
a number of saplings across a couple of trees to form a cover for their gun. Over the slight
barricade they had thrown a great tangle of creeping plants, and the whole concealed and protected
them in a wonderful fashion.

"They know how to play their own game," said Jack, as he searched the spot with a few bullets.
"They're hidden all right."

"Sure thing," said Buck. "They're up to all the tricks of the jungle. I don't see how we're
going to stop 'em gettin' the door down now. It's pure luck firin' into that tangle."

Within the next half hour Buck's fears were verified. Shot after shot was launched from the
heavy jingal, and at the short range the gunners found the door an easy mark, and pounded it
again and again until it was utterly shattered, and the opening into their stronghold was left
defenceless. Nor could the besieged make the gap good with any other barrier. Between the firing
of the heavy balls a steady fusillade of musketry was poured into the doorway, and no one dared
to show himself there.

The three comrades stood each at a narrow window, each with his weapons charged, and his mind
sternly resolved to make the banditti pay a heavy price for his life.

"They'll come again soon," muttered Jim Dent. "We must pump lead into 'em like mad as they
cross the open, then hold the doorway as long as we can."

"Yes," agreed Jack. "We must not let them get in if there's any way of keeping them out. Once
they surround us, their dahs will finish the struggle in a few strokes."

"Say, I fancy I see a bunch of 'em just beyond the jingal," said Buck. He fired, but there
was no sign that his bullet had taken effect. "They're gone again," he continued in a tone
of disappointment.

There was now silence while each watched the fringe of the jungle with the utmost vigilance.
Minute after minute passed, and not a sign appeared of the terrible little dacoits. The jingal
was fired no more, the musketry had dropped, and the stillness remained perfectly unbroken.
Anyone less experienced in jungle warfare than Jim Dent would have concluded that the fierce
Kachins for once had had their fill of fighting, and had retired towards their fastnesses among
the hills. But he bade his comrades stand close and be ready.

"There is some trick in the wind," he said. "What it is we shall see before long if we keep
our eyes open."

Suddenly into this silence came the sound of heavy blows on the planks over their heads. These
planks formed the ceiling of the lower room and the floor of the upper. The noise in this unexpected
direction made them jump, and then Buck roared, "Who's aloft?"

The head of Me Dain was now shown at the head of the flight of steps leading to the next story.

"Me up here," said the Burman. "Me got a job." He held in his hand the heavy dah which had
so nearly been driven through his own neck, and he now returned to his task without making
any further explanation. Buck moved as if to investigate into the Burman's doings, but at this
moment Jack gave a cry of surprise, and he turned hastily back to his window.

"What do you see, Jack?" said Dent quickly. "Are they coming?"

"Something's coming," cried Jack, and pointed. "Look straight opposite to us," he went on.
"It seems as if a piece of the jungle were moving upon us."

CHAPTER XIII.

A CUNNING TRICK.

Jim and Buck followed the direction of his outstretched finger, and then gasped in surprise.
As Jack said, it seemed as if a patch of jungle had begun to move. A mass of tangled greenery
was edging steadily forward from the sharp line where the forest ended, and was making its
way very slowly across the open towards them. For a moment the whole thing looked horribly
uncanny, then at the next instant the explanation flashed upon them.

"Say, that's a deep game," cried Buck. "We're in for a hard streak o' weather, boys. They're
coming on in shelter of a movin' barricade."

So they were. The cunning little men in blue had set their savage hearts on the blood of the
white men, and were sparing no effort to compass the destruction of their enemies. But the
terrible hail of bullets from those steady rifles was a thing they must avoid, or the attacking
party would be wiped out before the shattered door was reached. So they were coming on under
cover. The thing was simply enough contrived. They had cut down young palms and saplings and
lashed them together with tough creepers. Thus they had formed a little palisade six feet high
and fifteen feet along. Into the joints everywhere they had thrust great feathery bushes of
the wild plum, completely concealing every sign of themselves. Six of the sturdy little highland
caterans were strung along behind the palisade. To their muscles of iron it was the simplest
thing in the world to swing the barricade forward a step at a time, and behind them crept a
score of their comrades with dah and musket ready for action.

"They'll march right up to us if we can't stop them in some fashion," cried Jack, and he fired
his Mannlicher into the palisade. The others followed his example, and for a few moments they
searched the oncoming mass of greenery with a close fire.

"There's something behind those bushes of wild plum," said Jim Dent. "Can't you hear the bullets
striking into wood? They've formed a big shield of logs, and are pushing it forward."

Now that their advance was known, the Kachins gave up their silence. The bearers began to shout
to give each other the time and to make their movements regular and swift. "Ai-ai-Ai!" they
shouted. On the last cry they all lifted and swung the barricade a step forward, "Ai-ai-Ai!"
On they came again, "Ai-ai-Ai!" Another swing of their burden, and so they cut down the distance
foot by foot, and the blood-thirsty little men who crawled after them felt the edges of their
dahs and promised to dull the shine of the great blades in the blood of the English sahibs
who had shot so many of their friends.

In the building, Jack and his comrades were at their wits' end to know what to do in order
to check this deadly advance.

"They're standing us off easily enough," cried Jack. "At the rate they're coming, they'll be
up to the door in a quarter of an hour, and then they'll swarm straight in on us. These bullets
are too light to check them." Suddenly he turned on Dent, his bright eyes flashing. "Jim, Jim!"
he cried, "what are we thinking of? Didn't you pack a heavy big-game rifle among the baggage?"

Jim Dent leapt as if he had been shot.

"Of course I did," he roared. "I put it in on chance of being useful if we had trouble with
tigers or a rogue elephant." He darted across to the baggage ponies, who had been tethered
in a far corner of the large room, and swiftly cut a case loose. He unstrapped it and drew
out an eight-bore rifle, a big powerful weapon. In a corner of the case was a package of the
cartridges which fitted the rifle. Jim caught up the packet and ran back to his window.

"The very thing," he breathed in the utmost excitement, "and I stood here like a dummy and
never remembered it was with us till you thought of it, Jack. Unless they've got some very
stiff stuff in yonder palisade, I'll send a bullet through it as if it was only paper. I've
tried this gun with nickel-covered bullets such as these, and sent the bullet through eight
one-inch teak planks and five inches of wet sawdust."

"That ought to be good enough," cried Buck. "Pipe the lead into 'em, Jim, and me and Jack will
watch for any you drive out of cover if your bullet goes through."

"If," snorted Jim, as he threw open the breech and slipped in the big cartridge, "I'll show you."

He threw the elephant gun forward and fired at the centre of the palisade. There was an instant
scream. The immensely powerful weapon had driven the bullet straight through the centre of
a palm log, through the body of the dacoit behind, and wounded one of the party following up.

Jim whipped open the breech, and the empty shell flew out, for the rifle was an ejector. His
practised hands had another cartridge in and the breech closed in an instant. He fired again
and then again, aiming each time at a different spot in the palisade. There was a roar of anger
from the hidden Kachins, a roar answered by an exultant shout from the besieged.

"Pipe it into 'em, Jim," roared Buck. "You're gettin' home every shot. Hark at 'em squealin'."

The barricade had now come to a standstill, and it trembled all over every time that it was
struck by the heavy bullet travelling at terrific speed at so short a range.

"Fire low, Jim," cried Jack, "they have stopped and are crouching at the foot of the palisade,
I know."

Jim fired low, and his shot was answered by a fresh outburst of yells of pain and rage. Suddenly
the palisade began to waver, then it slowly fell over, as a stream of blue-clothed figures
darted from its insufficient shelter. The dacoits did not make either for the door of the hut
nor for the jungle they had left. The pagoda was the nearest cover to them, and they raced
for it with all their speed, the quick-firing Mannlichers scourging them with a whistling shower
of lead as they flew. When the last Kachin who could run had disappeared behind the building,
the comrades checked their fire and looked at each other with joyful eyes. Jim slapped the
breech of the eight-bore exultantly.

"It sent every bullet through their shield like a cannon!" he cried. "Lucky I put it in; they'd
have got up to the door all right if it hadn't stopped 'em."

"They would, indeed, Jim," replied Jack, "and it would have been all over with us then."

"Sure thing," agreed Buck. "We should ha' hit the long trail in short order."

"What's the next move?" cried Jack.

"Hard to say," replied Jim. "We can do nothing but watch 'em."

Watch them they did. The three comrades kept a steady look-out, but the sun went down, and
the swift dark of the tropics fell over jungle and clearing, and the dacoits had given no further
sign of their presence. The approach of night filled the besieged with the greatest uneasiness.
There was no moon to light the early hours of the darkness, and in the deep gloom the dacoits
could creep upon them unseen and swarm over them by sheer force of numbers. But just as dusk
fell, Me Dain began to drag down a number of planks and posts from aloft. This was the fruit
of his hacking away with the heavy dah. He had cut loose enough timber to make a very useful
barrier at the open doorway, and he and Jim made the strongest barricade they could while the
others kept watch.

When night fell they kept their places, every ear strained to catch the faintest sound. They
had only to watch one side of the ground floor where they stood. Three of the walls were solid
and very strongly built; the fourth was pierced by the windows and the door, and here they
had taken their stand from the first.

About two hours after dark, Me Dain came to the head of the stairs leading to the next floor.
He had been stationed there to move from one to the other of the upper windows and keep strict
watch all round.

"Come here now," said Me Dain.

"I'll go," murmured Jack, and he groped his way across the floor to the foot of the wooden
steps. Up he went, and found the Burman waiting for him at the top.

"Me think some men this way," muttered Me Dain, and took Jack's shoulder to lead him through
the darkness of the unlighted passage above.

"Which way?" whispered Jack eagerly, clutching his rifle. "Are they creeping on us from the
back, Me Dain?"

"Me think so," replied the Burman, and led Jack to a long, narrow room at the back of the monastery,
a room lighted by a large window. Coming from the blackness of the passages, Jack saw the window
clearly, a grey patch in the gloom of the walls. He ran across to it and looked out. The window
was high above the ground, twenty feet at least, and looked upon a tangle of low bushes which
ran almost to the wall of the building.

"Men in the bushes. Me hear them," said Me Dain.

Jack nodded, and watched intently. The window was a mere hole in the wall, closed, when necessary,
by a shutter. At present the shutter was fastened back, and Jack could hear every sound that
was made below.

Presently his ears caught a rustling among the bushes, and he threw his rifle forward. Then
he returned it to the hollow of his arm. He would wait and see what were the plans of the freebooters
now ambushed below. At this moment he found Me Dain's lips at his ear.

"They make ladder and come up here," breathed the Burman.

Jack nodded. That was the idea that had already struck him. Well, it would be easy enough from
above to sweep the ladder with a swift rifle fire and drive the dacoits back into their hiding-place.

Then another idea struck him, and he turned it over and over. To drive them back. Yes, that
was all right. But it would still leave him and his comrades prisoners with the Kachins in
hiding about the monastery and thirsting for their blood. Would it be possible to win a chance
of escape out of this? It seemed to him there was a chance, just a bare chance, and he resolved
to seize it. He drew Me Dain back into the shadows, and whispered softly, "How many doors lead
into this room?"

"One," answered the Burman, who had thoroughly explored the monastery before the dusk fell.

"Can you fasten it?"

"Yes, very easy. Big lock, strong lock, and key in it."

"All right," said Jack. "Now you keep watch on, the men below. I'll be back soon."

CHAPTER XIV.

JACK'S PLAN.

He hurried to the ground floor, and in a dozen swift words laid his plan before his friends.

"Frightful risky!" said Jim, "Frightful risky! I don't say there's nothing in it, but a big risk."

"We stand in fearful danger now, Jim," said Jack. "I know it's only a chance, but we've got
to do something, or these fellows will wipe us out for a certainty."

"Sure thing," said Buck, "and there is a chance in Jack's idea. I'll carry it out."

"No, Buck," said Jack firmly, "I can't agree to that. Both of you came into this thing to oblige
and to help me, and it would be a cowardly trick on my part to put the risky work on your shoulders.
I'll try it."

"Let's toss up," suggested Jim, "or draw straws. I'm willing to take my chance."

"I know you are, Jim," said Jack, "but I insist on having a shot at it myself. If they catch
me, it may leave a chance for you two to get clear away. I know it's a mere toss-up whether
the plan comes off or not, but we must try something."

Jack left his Mannlicher with Buck and slipped away up the stairs once more. He regained the
window where Me Dain was watching, and found that the Burman had nothing to relate save that
much rustling had been heard. Within five minutes again Jack saw the very thing he had been
awaiting. A dark, thin shape rose from the bushes and began slowly to creep up the wall. It
was a ladder which the dacoits were raising to the window below which they stood, a ladder
formed of a couple of bamboo stems with rungs of creepers.

Now came the time for action, and Jack drew the Burman back into the passage and locked the
door himself; luckily the big key turned quietly and easily. Down to the lower floor hurried
Jack and crossed to his friends.

"They have raised the ladder just as I expected," he said. "Now I'm off."

"Good luck, Jack, good luck," breathed Jim and Buck earnestly, as Jack dropped on hands and
knees at the door and glided out at a hole which they had prepared for him by moving a portion
of the barricade. When he found himself in the open, Jack paused for a moment and listened
with all his ears. But he could not catch the slightest sound of either voice or movement on
this side, and he glided on like a snake, keeping his body very low and pressing closely against
the dark wall.

He gained the corner of the building just beyond the door, and cautiously put his head round.
Again he listened and looked. All was quiet, and once more he slipped on. Near the next angle
was a patch of low-growing bushes. He worked his way into these with the utmost care, and raised
his head slowly until he could peer through the upper shoots. He now commanded the rear of
the building, and his heart gave a great thump of excitement and satisfaction as he saw the
sight which he had been hoping for. He saw the swaying line of the ladder clear against the
sky, and mounting it, rung by rung, a line of climbing figures. The dacoits were swarming nimbly
up to the quiet room, from which they expected to fall like thunderbolts upon their unsuspecting
enemies below.

Jack now began to work his way towards the foot of the ladder. He went very slowly and with
the utmost care. At last he paused. The bushes which had helped the banditti to approach the
back of the monastery unobserved had helped him too, and he was now within ten yards of the
foot of the ladder. He raised himself to one knee and looked intently over the ground. The
last of the climbing dacoits was vanishing through the window, high above his head, and one
stood motionless below. He, clearly, had been left on guard to keep the foot of the ladder.
Now Jack heard plainly a shuffling and creaking and straining above. The Kachins were trying
to force the door which he had locked against them.

"Lucky it's a strong door," thought Jack. "It'll keep them busy for a few minutes. How shall
I dispose of this fellow?"

Suddenly the crash and uproar of heavy blows rang out from the room above. The dacoits had
given up trying to force the door quietly, and were beating it down. This noise gave Jack a
chance of a thousand to carry out his plan. He had slung his rifle over his shoulder. He now
unslung it quickly, clubbed it, and bounded forward. The dacoit at the foot of the ladder was
staring upwards, intent on the doings of his comrades, when Jack landed without a sound scarce
a yard behind him.

Down came the butt of the rifle with a terrific swing, fair and square across the skull of
the dacoit, who crumpled under the blow and dropped without a groan. Jack jumped at the ladder,
seized it, dragged it from the window, and flung it among the bushes. The dacoits were trapped.
Then he turned and darted away. He gave a glance at the window as he ran. As far as he could
see, his plan had met with wonderful success. Not a figure showed at the dark square above;
every man seemed to be taking part in the furious assault on the door.

Now Jack ran for his life. Would the dacoits beat the door down and be upon them before he
could give the word? He flew back to the front and called in a low, quick tone, "Come on! Come
on! I've cleared the ladder away, and they're trapped above."

"Then we'll be off before they've got the door down," said Jim softly. "Forward, boys!"

A little procession now streamed swiftly through the doorway and hurried across the open space
which led to the friendly jungle, where they hoped to find shelter and hiding.

Me Dain went first leading a pony, Buck followed with a second pony, Jim and Jack brought up
the rear, their rifles ready for any pursuers who might hit on their trail.

They were on the edge of the forest when a confused uproar of voices told them that the dacoits
had swarmed down the stairs and were in the stronghold they had so luckily deserted. But even
as the shouts of the Kachins rang in their ears, the sounds were dulled, for Me Dain plunged
into a narrow path running through a thicket of bamboos, and they left the clearing behind them.

"Will they follow us?" whispered Jack to his companion.

"It would be sheer luck if they hit on our track now," replied Dent in the same soft tones.
"Me Dain is leading us by a path that it isn't likely these fellows know. Coming from a distance,
they would only know the chief road through the village, and they are almost certain to divide
and strike along that in both directions, thinking we have fled towards the next village."

"Where is the old Burman whom we found in the monastery?" asked Jack.

"Dead, poor old chap," replied Jim. "He'd lost too much blood before Me Dain tried to patch
him up."

"What savage fellows these dacoits are!" murmured Jack.

"A merciless crew," returned Dent. "Any of our poor fellows who dropped into their hands in
the Burmese war were cut up in most frightful fashion, and in cold blood, too. But we made
them pay for it now and again, when we got in amongst them with the bayonets."

No more was said, and they tramped on in silence, with their ears laid back to catch the faintest
sounds of pursuit. But no sign of danger was to be caught. Now and again they halted, and listened
intently. The jungle was perfectly silent save for its own noises, chief among which was the
sullen, deep roar of a tiger calling to its mate.

"That's a tiger calling," said Dent to Jack.

"I thought so," replied Jack; "it sounds like the Zoo, but how queer to think that fellow is
not behind bars, but roaming free through the forest."

"Say," remarked Buck over his shoulder, "I hope that 'Tiger, tiger, burning bright' isn't a
man-eater. If he is, he'll have a soft snap with us, marching along this narrow path through
thick cover."

"By George, he's coming!" cried Jim, in a tone of sudden alarm. "Let's bunch together, boys.
If he doesn't get one of us, he may get a pony, and that wouldn't suit our game at all." The
tiger had again raised his voice, but not in a roar so much as a fierce, grumbling snarl, and
the sound was much nearer.

"Quick, quick!" cried Me Dain, from the head of the procession, and the whole party hurried
forward. Suddenly the trees above their heads parted, and they saw the stars. The little band
had reached an open space in the jungle, and they gathered in the midst of this space and closely
surrounded the ponies.

"Put your hand on this little beast's shoulder," said Dent to Jack.

Jack laid his hand on the shoulder of the pony next to him, and found that it was trembling
violently and running with sweat.

"I rather fancy it knows all about that noise, and what's making it," went on Dent. "They understand
when trouble's in the wind as well as anybody."

"It must be in a terrible fright," said Jack. "Do you think the tiger will attack us, Jim?"

"It isn't at all unlikely," replied Dent. "What do you say, Buck?"

"If he doesn't want one of us, he wants a pony," replied Buck, "so it comes to just the same.
We'll have to pipe him full o' lead, I shouldn't wonder."

"This is a bad place for tigers," broke in Me Dain. "Very bad place. Three Chinamen killed
here four months ago."

"How was that, Me Dain?" asked Jack.

"Nobody know," returned the Burman. "Three diggers going up to the hills to look for rubies.
Make camp on little creek not a mile from here. Somebody pass the camp next day and see one
man dead. Then they look, and see pieces of the other men in the jungle. Me forgot that, running
from Kachins."

"Never mind, Me Dain," said Jim Dent. "Don't worry about that. A 'bad' tiger is a very awkward
brute to run up against, but a bunch of Kachins is a more desperate case still. Hallo, he's
pretty close. Hold the ponies tight, Me Dain. They're ready to bolt."

The little creatures were now frantic with fear, and the Burman had all his work cut out to
keep them in hand.

"Look there! Look there!" cried Jack. "What's that straight in front of us?" He had been staring
hard into the blackness of the jungle, and now, all of a sudden, two bright green flames seemed
to start up in the gloom.

"That's a tiger just stepped from behind a tree," murmured Jim. "Stand steady, boys, and don't
let anybody loose off in any too much hurry."

"There's another, and another," said Jack.

In swift succession two fresh pairs of gleaming eyes were seen. Me Dain gave a groan of terror.

"Old tiger and two little ones," he said in a low voice. He was much more terrified of tigers
than of dacoits.

"Say, he's got it quite straight," said Buck. "It's a tigress and a pair of cubs. The eyes
of the last couple are nearer the ground."

It was so dark in the jungle which surrounded them that no sign of the bodies of the savage
creatures could be seen, only the eyes, which burned upon them with a fierce, steady gaze.

"It's a family party," said Jim. "Where's the old man tiger? It was his call we heard, certainly."

At this moment the tigress gave tongue. She let out a horrible whining snarl, full of ferocity
and threat. In an instant her call was answered. Somewhere near at hand in the jungle arose
a terrible sound which seemed to fill the air and shake the earth, a sound which made the blood
run cold. It was the horrible coughing roar of a charging tiger.

"Here he comes," said Jim in a low voice, and Jack clutched his rifle tightly.

CHAPTER XV.

IN THE JUNGLE.

A moment later, and a fresh pair of burning eyes was added to the group in the jungle.

"Shout, shout, or he spring," cried Me Dain.

The whole party shouted at the top of their voices. This sudden uproar checked the tiger; the
most ferocious brute hesitates to leap upon people who are making a great noise. Then a sudden
flame spurted up, and they saw the whole scene plainly. This was the doing of Buck. He had
been hastily gathering great handfuls of dried grass and piling them together. He struck a
match and tossed it into the heap. The withered grass caught at once, and a great red flare
leapt out and lighted the scene. For the first time they saw the tigers clearly, an immense
male tiger, his smaller mate, and two large cubs. The tigress and the cubs were retreating
a little, and the male was crouching as if for a spring, his tail lashing his flanks, but the
sudden flaring up of the fire checked him, and for the moment he did not leap.

That moment's hesitation saved them, so quickly and well was it used by Jack. He had his rifle
already at his shoulder. As the flame sprang up, his quick eye brought the sights to bear on
the huge, round head of the crouching tiger. He touched the trigger, and the rifle spoke. The
great tiger gave one convulsive shudder, but did not move. There was a general thrill of terror
among the party. Had Jack missed, or only grazed him? If it was so, he would spring at once,
and his mate would follow.

The flame leapt and fell. The grass had burned out. With frenzied haste Jim and Buck tore fresh
handfuls to feed the fire. Every second they expected the tigers to rush on them through the
darkness. But no charge came, and once more the red flame ran through the dried grass and leaped
into the air. As it did so, they gave a cry of astonishment. There crouched the tiger, just
as before, save that his tail no longer swept to and fro. His head was laid low, his paws were
drawn under him just as if he were about to rise in the air and descend upon them like a living
thunderbolt, but he made no movement, uttered no sound. Suddenly Jim Dent broke the wondering
silence.

"By George," said he in a low voice, "what a shot! What a shot! Jack, that's a dead tiger."

"Do you think so, Jim?" said Jack, joyfully. "Have I killed him?"

"Sure thing," said Buck, "that's a brain shot. He never moved after the bullet hit him. Now
for the others. Where's the lone, lorn widdy and the poor orphans. Jack, they'll rip holes
into you for robbing them of a kind father."

Buck was still speaking when the tigress returned and rushed up to her mate. She seemed to
suspect something, and she bent over the huge, prostrate figure and snuffed at it eagerly.
Then she gave a blood-curdling growl and retreated slowly towards the cubs, which came bounding
to her side, whining impatiently.

"Those cubs are very hungry," said Buck.

"Yes," said Jim quietly. "What's her next move? Will she scent danger and clear off with the
young ones, or is she in so great a need of food for herself and them that she will attack us?"

Suddenly Me Dain began to shout, "Shoot, sahibs, shoot! She is coming! She is coming!" His
experienced eye had told him that the tigress was about to charge, and another instant showed
that he had given no false alarm. Maddened by the scent of the pack animals, and by the whining
of her famished cubs, the tigress turned short and came at them with two tremendous leaps!
The second carried her full into the light of the fire, and as she touched the ground, all
three rifles cracked, and three bullets were driven home into her shining, striped body.

Again she rose to her leap, her eyes blazing madly, her mouth opened to its fullest extent,
showing her huge fangs, and the repeaters crackled as a rapid fire was poured into her in hopes
of checking her rush, for a wounded tigress is the most savage and dangerous beast in the jungle.
The last volley carried the day. Each fired into the open mouth, and each hit his mark. The
bullets, travelling at terrific speed, cut their way through flesh, sinew, brain, and bone,
and almost tore the head of the tigress to pieces. She dropped across the fire and lay there
without moving, her coat singeing in the embers.

"Whew!" Jim blew out a long breath. "I thought she was in among us that time. And if she had
been, we should have known about it. There's a fore-arm for you." As he spoke, he touched the
short, thick leg where the muscle bulged in huge rolls under the loose skin.

"And look at her claws," said Jack, bending with much interest to examine the dreadful creature
now lying so still. "A stroke of those would mean mischief."

"I saw a tiger once rush out of cover and give a beater a stroke in passing," said Jim. "I
remember I thought the brute had only patted the man. I wasn't fifty yards away, and I'm perfectly
sure the beast didn't put any particular force into the blow. But the man dropped, and when
we ran up to him, we found five of his ribs torn clean out of his body. He died from loss of
blood almost at once."

Buck twisted a bunch of dried reeds into a rude torch and lighted it. "Let's have a look at
the boss," he said, and they crossed to the great tiger, still crouching as if about to spring.
There was no mark of injury on him save a small patch of blood between his eyes.

"That's where you hit him, Jack," said Buck. He bent down and felt among the fur. "I can feel
the hole in the skull," he said, "but those Mannlicher bullets are so small, there's scarcely
anything to be seen."

"That bullet took him through the brain and then went down the spine," said Jim. "Must have
done, to have settled him so completely. You see he never moved after he was hit."

Jack took the torch from Buck's hand and looked proudly over the magnificent proportions of
his first tiger. The gleaming, satiny skin, the bright bars of black and yellow, showed that
the animal was in splendid condition, and at the height of his powers.

"Isn't he a splendid fellow?" murmured Jack. "I should just about like to have his skin."

"Sahibs," came a voice behind them, "let us go. Perhaps the Kachins hear the guns."

"The dacoits!" cried Jack. "Upon my word, I'd forgotten all about them! By Jove, it's a matter
of saving our own skins without worrying about the tiger's. We'd better be on the move."

"I'd clean forgotten 'em myself," said Jim, and Buck chimed in with, "So had I."

"They're pretty awkward parties to forget," went on Jack.

"That's so," agreed Buck. "If they hit our trail, we'll see trouble yet."

No more time was spent over the dangerous brutes which had threatened to bar their way. They
were left lying where they had fallen, and the little party of fugitives turned once more to
their flight, and pushed rapidly through the jungle.

An hour later the moon came up, and soon after that they reached a wide, naked stretch of rocky
hill-side. This was very hard travelling, but they welcomed it, as it was country where they
would leave very few traces to guide pursuers. On and on they pushed, until dim grey streaks
in the east told them that the dawn was near at hand. They climbed a steep slope, and were
just on its crown when the morning broke, and the sun shot up into a sky without a cloud.

"Good place here to make camp," remarked Me Dain, and all agreed heartily with the remark.

"I reckon this is your first night march," said Jim to Jack, smilingly.

"Yes," said Jack. "It isn't bad fun either." His tall, powerful, young figure was as upright
as a dart, his eye bright, his cheek fresh; he could have gone on all day again.

"Well," said Jim Dent, "I don't mind saying I'm ready for a rest," and he dropped on the grass
beside the fire which Me Dain had already begun to build.

Buck got out the provisions, and they ate from their store of native bread and dried beef,
and washed it down with plenty of tea.

"The country looks empty," said Jack, glancing over the wide stretch they had traversed, "but
for all that we had better keep our eyes open, perhaps."

"We had," said Jim. "Those Kachins will follow us hot-foot when once the light comes and they
get our track for certain. I should say we'd better stop here a few hours and then push on
again till we've got clean out of this country-side."

"Very well," returned Jack. "We'll set a guard. Best to run no risks. I'll take first watch."

The last watch fell to Me Dain, and Jack awoke just as Buck roused the Burman and lay down
himself for another nap before continuing the march. Jack, who was lying in a patch of thick
grass, and wrapped in a blanket, watched the sturdy figure of the Burman as Me Dain paced lightly
to and fro, looking out keenly on every hand. Then Jack dozed off himself for half an hour,
and woke again. He glanced round and saw that Me Dain was sitting on a rock with his back towards
the sleepers. The first glance aroused Jack's suspicions. The Burman's head was sunk between
his shoulders. Next moment suspicion became certainty. A gentle snore reached Jack's ears,
and he knew that Me Dain was sleeping at his post.

Up sprang Jack at once, and crossed to the sleeping man. He was about to shake the drowsy watchman
by the shoulder, when he paused and looked intently at the slope below. What were those creeping
figures among the rocks down there? A second later he knew them, and aroused his sleeping companions
by a low, fierce cry.

"Up, up! Buck! Jim! Get your rifles at once. The dacoits are on us!"

CHAPTER XVI.

THE BRIDGE AND THE FORD.

The two men were on their feet at once.

"Dacoits! Dacoits!" growled Jim, dashing the sleep from his eyes and gripping his weapon. "How
in thunder do they come on us so soon? Have we overslept?"

"No," said Buck, glancing at his watch. "We're inside our time. They must have picked up our
trail quicker than we thought, and followed a lot faster than we travelled with the ponies."

By this time Jack had taken cover behind a boulder, and was drawing a bead on the first of
the oncoming figures. Up the hill-side was streaming a broken line of crouching little men
in blue, following, with the skill of born trackers, the signs of the fugitives' march. Jack's
finger pressed on the trigger, and the leader dropped. At once the men in blue seemed to disappear
as if the earth had swallowed them. They vanished behind rock, or bush, or tuft of grass, and
the hill-side was empty save for the fallen figure. At this instant Buck and Jim crept to Jack's
shoulder.

"How do they come to be so near to us as that?" cried Buck in surprise. "In two minutes again
they'd have been in the camp slicing us up as we lay."

"Me Dain was asleep," said Jack briefly. "I happened to wake up and hear him snore. So I nipped
up and took a look round and dropped my eye on the dacoits making straight for us."

"Good for you, Jack," replied Buck. "That's saved all our lives, for a certainty."

A groan of misery behind them drew their attention. They glanced over their shoulders and saw
Me Dain seated on his rock, a picture of shame. He had been awakened by Jack's call and the
crack of his rifle, but sat still, unable to face the men whose lives he had risked by giving
way to his desire for more slumber.

"Me Dain, you fat, brown-faced villain of the world," cried Buck. "What d'ye mean by letting
the dacoits nearly get us?"

"Me sorry, me very sorry, sahibs," cried the Burman. "The sleep just catch me. Me very sorry."

"You'd better be sorry," returned Buck. "I've a good mind to boot you till your nose turns
grey. If it hadn't been for Jack, the king-pin o' this outfit, we should all have hit the long
trail this morning."

"We'd better give those chaps down there a volley," said Jack. "See how the tufts of grass
shake as they creep on us."

"You're right," said Jim. "They're trying to get within range. At present they can't reach
us with their muzzle-loaders, but we can pepper them easy enough."

Firing steadily but swiftly, the three comrades raked every patch of cover with a stream of
Mannlicher bullets. This checked the advance; no more signs of movement were seen.

The voice of the Burman was now heard behind them.

"Sahibs," he said, "let us go on. Two miles more we reach a deep river, and break the bridge.
No Kachins follow then."

"Sounds like a chance for us," remarked Jim. "Get the ponies, Me Dain, and cut along ahead.
We'll follow in a minute."

The Burman at once slipped the hobbles from the ponies, whose packs had not been removed, and
led them quickly away. From the head of the slope the path crossed a kind of tableland, and
they could easily keep their guide in sight for a long distance.

"Now to search the places where these fellows below are in hiding," cried Jack. "That will
hold them back from following us till we get a good start."

"That's it," returned Jim. "Just what I was thinking of."

Each man spent a couple of magazine loads in firing into every spot where a Kachin had been
seen to move or to go to cover. Then they drew back out of sight, leapt to their feet, and
ran at full speed after Me Dain, who was hurrying the ponies along in the distance.

"After that bit o' shootin' they'll wait a while before they push on to the top of the slope
and find we're gone," said Jim as they ran. "And that will give us a good start to cross the
river."

Within a mile they caught up the Burman. Jack looked back as they ran up to the ponies, but
the top of the slope was now out of sight, and he could not discover whether the Kachins had
swarmed up to it or not.

The fugitives were now following a well-worn path, clearly that used by the people of the country-side
to gain the bridge over the stream in front.

Jack was now leading the way, while Buck and Jim formed a rearguard behind the ponies. Looking
ahead, Jack saw that the path began to descend very rapidly and fell out of sight. He ran forward
and found himself on the lip of a ravine with steep sides. At the foot of the ravine flowed
the river, and Jack gave a shout of joy when he saw how near they were to the stream which
promised safety.

Then the sound of swift, heavy blows came to his ears, and he looked in the direction whence
they proceeded. His call of joy was checked in an instant. What were those three figures in
blue doing down there? In a second he saw what it meant, and he dropped on one knee and clapped
his Mannlicher to his shoulder with a cry of anger. The dacoits had been more cunning than
they suspected. The pursuers knew also of the bridge, and at this very instant three powerful
Kachins were hacking away with their keen, heavy dahs, cutting the bridge down.

The three men in blue were so intent on their work that they never once glanced upwards. They
were slashing fiercely at the nearer end of the bridge, and were about two hundred and fifty
yards away. A rifle-bullet would reach them more quickly than anything, and Jack drew a careful
bead on the nearest worker and fired. His bullet went through the arm which had just swung
up the heavy blade for a fresh stroke at the frail bridge, and the dah dropped into the water,
while the dacoit's yell of pain came clearly to the ears of the party now gathered on the edge
of the ravine.

"Gosh!" cried Buck. "They're ahead of us."

"So they are," snapped Jim. "They're cutting down the bridge and penning us in. Drop 'em, boys,
drop 'em quick, or it's all over with us."

At the next instant a swift shower of the tiny slips of lead was pelting on to the bridge head
where the two dacoits still hacked away, striking harder and faster now that the rifles cracked
on the lip of the ravine. One dropped into the river with a splash, the other leapt into cover
of the big tree to which the bridge was swung, and was safe from the darting bullets. But his
gleaming dah still flashed into sight now and again as he hewed fiercely at the bridge.

Jack at once bounded out, and, followed by his companions, raced madly for the place. The bridge
was but a slight affair, a native structure formed of a couple of long bamboo poles with cross
pieces lashed into place by native cordage.

The lower slope of the ravine was covered with tall bushes of wild plum, and, as Jack ran through
these, he lost sight, for a few moments, of the bridge and the busy dacoit. He burst through
them with a straight, open run before him of seventy yards to the bridge head. His heart beat
thick and fast as he flew across the open. The blows of the dah had ceased. Had the bridge
gone or not? A little clump of water-grasses on the bank hid the bridge from him, but the silence
was terribly ominous. He thought he saw a blue kilt disappearing among the trees, but he did
not stay to intercept it. He shot up to the edge of the stream, and saw a horrible space of
blank water between bank and bank. The bridge was swinging slowly towards the other side. Held
fast there, the current was thrusting the slight structure across the stream. The dacoits had
succeeded in their plan.

Jack stood still and looked round for their enemies. There was no sign of a Kachin to be seen.
One had dropped into the river, and the current had certainly carried him away; the others
had escaped into the jungle which grew thickly within a short distance of the bridge head.

"By Jingo!" cried Jim Dent blankly, as he ran up. "The bridge has gone. We're in a pretty fix."

"Gone," echoed Buck. "They've cut us off after all. Boys, we're in a tight place."

"Bridge gone!" cried Me Dain. "Bridge gone! What shall we do? Sahibs, oh, what shall we do?"

Jack looked from one to the other in some surprise at hearing this outburst of deep anxiety.

"It isn't very wide," he cried. "Why on earth can't we swim over? That would be simple enough."

"Ay, ay," said Jim Dent. "Easy enough if we were sure of getting to the other side, but we're
not. All these rivers swarm with alligators, big, savage brutes that would pull a man under
as easy as if he were a dog."

Jack's looks were now as blank as the others. This put a very different face on crossing the
river, and he gazed on the dark, swift stream with horror. In those gloomy depths lurked huge,
dreadful reptiles whose vast jaws would drag a swimmer down to a frightful death.

"It's not a short journey across this creek, d'ye see," said Buck. "The stream's so fast that
a swimmer would be swept down full a hundred yards in crossing from bank to bank, and in that
time it would give an alligator plenty of chance to lay hold of him."

"We can't cross here, sahibs," put in Me Dain. "Stream too swift, too strong. The bridge is
here because the river at this place is very narrow, but about a mile down there is a ford."

"We'd better light out for it without losing any more time then," cried Buck. "We might see
an ugly row of Kachins any minute now along the brink of the gully behind us."

"True for you, Buck," said Jack. "Lead us at once to the ford, Me Dain."

The Burman turned and hurried down the banks of the stream, and the others followed. In a moment
they were lost to sight among the tall bushes which were dotted about the bank. When the sound
of their footsteps had completely died away, two figures slipped from the edge of the jungle
and approached the spot where the fugitives had stood. The newcomers were a couple of dacoits,
one the man who had been wounded by Jack's first shot. The short, broad, powerful figures stood
for a moment in close conversation, then the wounded man started to climb the bank of the ravine.
The second dacoit plunged into the bushes, and followed easily the track left by four men and
two ponies. It was his task to track the intruders down: his comrade was despatched to find
the rest of the band and lead them to enjoy the revenge for which the blood-thirsty dacoits lusted.

CHAPTER XVII.

A FRIGHTFUL PERIL.

Meanwhile the fugitives, unconscious that a sleuth-hound was on their track, hurried forward
and came to a point where the river spread out broadly over sandy flats.

"This is the ford," cried Me Dain.

"Why was it given up?" asked Jack.

"Because it was too dangerous, sahib," replied the Burman. "Many men, many women have been
seized by alligators at this ford. So the villagers made a bridge at the narrow place higher up."

"Well, we shall have to face it," said Jack. "How deep is it in the middle?"

"To the waist when the water is low," replied Me Dain.

"H'm, that's awkward," remarked Jim Dent, "for the water certainly isn't low to-day. There's
been rain among the hills. You can tell by the colour. It may mean swimming in the middle."

"I'll try it first," cried Jack, "and I'll sing out to you how I find it. Here goes!" He was
about to spring into the river, when Jim Dent called to him to stop.

"No, no," said Jim. "That won't do, Jack. We might lose you that way, and we should prefer
a good deal to lose a pony."

"Sure thing," said Buck, as Jim looked at him.

"Now," went on Dent, "here's our best plan. We'll go in in a bunch with a pony each side of
the party. Then, if some of these ugly brutes come up to see who's crossing their river, they're
more likely to grab a pony, and if we lose them, why we must."

"It will be a frightful loss," said Jack.

"It lies between that and being scuppered ourselves," said Dent.

"Yes, yes, Jim, of course," cried Jack. "Your plan is the best."

It was carried out at once. The four men went into the ford in a bunch, with a pony up stream
and a pony down stream. Jack was leading the up-stream pony, Buck the down-stream animal, while
Jim and the Burman were between them. The crossing was a broad one, near upon a hundred yards,
for the river had spread out on a sandy flat, and they were thirty or forty yards into the
stream before they were more than thigh-deep. Then the water suddenly deepened a full twelve
inches, and they were up to their waists. The stream, even on the flat here, was fairly swift,
and they could only wade forward slowly.

"Slow job this," remarked Buck. "Water's tougher stuff than you think to get through. I feel
as if I was wading through treacle."

"Yes, doesn't it clog your movements," agreed Jack, "but I should think we're a good half-way
over."

"Deep part got to come yet, sahib," said Me Dain. "We have come through easy part of ford."

Just at this moment Jim's voice broke in; his tones were low and fiercely earnest.

"Push ahead, boys," he said. "Do your best. Strike it faster, everybody."

"What is it, Jim?" The question broke from Jack's lips, but a glance up stream answered it
before Jim could speak in reply. A hundred yards above the ford a small sand-bank rose above
the water. On this bank lay, to all appearance, three logs washed thither by the current. But
now, oh horror, Jack saw these logs move and raise themselves. They were huge alligators sunning
themselves and waiting for prey. It was clear that the vast saurians had noted the movement
on the surface of the river. One by one they slid down the sand and vanished into the stream.

"They are coming, sahibs, they are coming!" cried Me Dain, and his brown face was hideously
ashen with terror.

"Strike it faster, everybody," growled Jim, and the party pushed forward at their utmost speed
through the stream.

"Gosh!" panted Buck. "It's getting deeper and deeper. That's dead against us."

"Let us go back, sahibs," cried Me Dain, beside himself in terror of the awful reptiles now
coming down stream upon them with frightful rapidity. "Let us go back. Better to face dacoits
than alligators."

"Easy does it, Me Dain," said Jack. "Peg along and do your best. It's facing death either way.
Let's have a go at the other bank."

"That's the way to talk, Jack," said Jim, through the teeth set in his white, grim face. "We've
got to go through with it now. And hark, listen to that!"

There was the crack of a musket on the shore behind them, and a ball whistled over their heads
and splashed into the water before them. Jack glanced back and saw a blue-clothed figure on
the river bank.

"They're coming," he said. "One of them's trying to pot us now. Impossible to turn back."

"Gosh! it's deepening again," growled Buck.

So it was. The stream ran nearly shoulder deep, and the other bank was still a good forty yards
away. Jack pushed on as fast as he could, urging the pony forward. His breath came fast, and
his heart thumped like a trip-hammer. The situation was inconceivably desperate. Somewhere
through the hidden depths of the rushing stream, three monstrous and frightful reptiles, fearfully
dangerous and terrible creatures in their own element, were darting swiftly towards them, and
behind them the dacoits now lined the shore and prevented return into shallower waters which
might promise safety from the huge saurians.

Suddenly the pony which Jack led gave a great leap, and pawed the water madly with its fore-feet,
and uttered a loud snort of agonised terror. Jack held him tight and looked over his withers.
Nor could the brave lad keep back a cry of alarm at the frightful thing he saw there.

CHAPTER XVIII.

THE COMBAT IN THE RIVER.

The river, though swift, was not muddy, and through the clear brown water he saw plainly the
vast open jaws of a huge alligator rising in the stream, and about to seize the pony by the
neck. In another second the great saurian would have seized its prey, but the pony swerved
aside, and the huge snout shot out of the water, and the jaws, missing their prey, clashed
together with a sharp snap. At the next moment they were opened, as the alligator drew back
a little for a fresh assault.

Jack had been marching with his Mannlicher held on top of the pony's pack, and his Mauser pistol
held up in the other hand, hoping to keep the weapons dry. Now he seized the opportunity of
pouring a stream of heavy Mauser bullets into the open jaws.

So swiftly did he press the trigger that he drove five shots in before the alligator once more
snapped its jaws close. The great saurian was badly wounded, and in its rage and agony began
to lash the water furiously with its huge tail, while blood and foam poured out at its jaws
and nostrils. The deadly, ripping, soft-nosed bullets, which would have glanced off its hide
of mail, had torn their way down its throat and through the soft parts of the body with fearful
destructive power, inflicting mortal wounds. At sound of the pistol shots so close to its ear,
the pony leapt forward more frantically still, and the huge dying brute was left floundering
in the water.

"One done for," roared Jim in delight. "Peg away, boys. We may come safe yet."

The words were scarcely out of his mouth when Buck let out a yell of alarm.

"Say," cried Buck, "there's one here. He's got hold of the pony."

Buck's words were drowned by the loud shrill squeal of affright from the pony, whose off-hind
leg had been seized by the second of the vast brutes to attack the party.

"Here's another," shouted Jack, and he and Jim, who had been also holding his pistol above
the stream, fired rapidly. The third alligator was sailing straight upon them down stream,
floating on the surface, his evil, unwinking eyes fixed full on the pony which he was about
to attack. Jim planted a lucky shot in one of the wicked-looking eyes and knocked it clean
out of its socket. Jack plainly saw the bleeding hole before the alligator threw up his huge
tail, slapped the water with a crack like thunder, and dived.

In the meantime Buck was engaged in a terrible struggle with the alligator which had seized
the pony. He held the bridle of the unlucky beast, and assisted it as much as possible in the
strong fight it made for its life. So desperately did the powerful little animal struggle with
its terrible foe that it actually gained a dozen yards or more, dragging the huge reptile along
the river-bed. But the immensely powerful jaws, fanged with strong, sharp teeth, never loosed
their grip.

Jim now turned to Buck's assistance. At that instant the alligator rolled in the water, showing
its softer underside. It rose towards the surface, yet never easing its grip, and lashed the
river into foam with its powerful tail as it tugged backwards with tremendous force, aiming
to pull the pony into the deeper water. For a moment Jim saw its underside near the surface,
the four horrible legs armed with huge claws striking out savagely in the water.

He thrust his rifle into the stream, pressing the muzzle against the saurian's body. Luckily
the magazine still remained above water, and he fired several shots in swift succession into
the vast brute, the water boiling and swirling as the gases of the discharge came to the surface
in huge bubbles. One of these shots must have reached a vital part; the alligator gave a final
convulsive shudder, its jaws ground savagely together, then they gaped wide, and the pony was free.

Jack was pushing on swiftly with the pony under his charge. That was his business, and he hurried
forward, feeling joyfully that the water was growing shallower with every step. His shoulders
were out, and now the pony's withers began to rise. Suddenly a horrid dark snout was thrust
up in front of him. It was the wounded alligator, which had returned to the assault.

Before Jack could fire the saurian dived, and Jack saw the huge dark form dart at him under
water. He felt his legs swept from under him at the next instant, and down he went. He had
not been seized, he had simply been knocked from his foothold by the rush of the great brute,
and he landed full on the alligator's back. He felt plainly with his hand its rough scaly covering
like knobs of horn. He had kept his eyes open, and saw clearly the horrid brute below him,
and the dark forms of his companions at hand.

He dropped his pistol, whipped out a great hunting-knife from his belt, and drove it time and
again into the underside of the big reptile. Then he struck out for the surface and came up
gasping for breath. He swam a dozen swift strokes before he dared to drop his feet again and
find the easy depth which the whole party had now reached. He saw that the Burman was leading
ashore the pony he had been torn away from, and that Buck and Jim were doing their utmost to
keep the second pony on its legs. Suddenly the bottom began to rise swiftly, and the whole
party, fearfully exhausted, but very luckily unhurt, staggered ashore and threw themselves
down on the warm sand.

"You all right, Jack?" snapped Buck. "I thought I saw you go under."

"Yes," said Jack, "the brute that Jim knocked an eye out of attacked me and fetched me off
my legs. But I dug a knife into him and got away. How are you two?"

"Oh, we've come through with a sound skin," replied Jim. "But that was a near shave. And look
what we've missed." He pointed to the water, where, thirty yards out, half-a-dozen huge ridged
backs were now to be seen cruising to and fro.

"By Jove!" said Jack, "it's a fresh lot turned up just as we got out."

Everyone shuddered as they thought what their fate would have been if the alligators, attracted
to the scene by the scent of prey, had arrived a few moments earlier.

"Where are the dacoits?" said Jack, looking across to the other bank. "They've all cleared
out, except a couple who seem posted to watch us."

"So they have," rejoined Buck. "What's their little game?"

"I wonder if there's another bridge handy," remarked Jack. "Where's the next bridge, Me Dain?"

"A long way down the river, sahib, but there is a village about four miles off."

"Then they've gone there to borrow a boat, I'll wager a trifle on that," cried Jack.

"Right for you, Jack," said Dent. "We'd better be on the move. But what can we do with this pony?"

The poor beast, which the alligator had mauled, had managed to get ashore and that was all.
Its leg was frightfully torn.

"This pony 'll never hit the trail again," remarked Buck, after he had examined it carefully.
"We shall have to carry its pack partly between us and partly on the other pony."

"Poor little brute," said Jack. "It's suffering fearfully. Look at its eyes!"

"We can do nothing for it, I'm afraid," remarked Jim.

"No," said Buck, "but if we don't hump round a bit, somebody'll do something for us."

This hint of the danger in which they still stood from the blood-thirsty and revengeful dacoits
quickened their movements, and the wounded pony was stripped in a few moments. The other pony
was quite unhurt, and a good share of the baggage was added to its load for the present; the
remainder was swung up on the shoulders of the four members of the party.

Jack, Jim, and the Burman now marched swiftly up the river bank towards the road which ran
from the broken bridge. Buck stayed behind for a moment. Soon his companions heard the crack
of the pistol which put an end to the sufferings of the wounded pony, then heard Buck's footsteps
as he hastened to rejoin them.

"What a lucky thing you packed the ammunition in water-tight tins, Jim," remarked Jack, as
they pushed at full speed along the bank.

"Yes," said Jim, "I've been in this country a time or two afore. It wasn't wetter in that river
than it is in the jungle at times when a storm catches you."

"I've lost my Mauser pistol," said Jack. "It had to go when that brute knocked my legs from
under me. I had to drop it to whip my knife out. Luckily I've got my rifle all right. That
was on the sling."

"We've got another Mauser in the outfit," said Jim. "I slipped a couple of spare ones in. We'll
turn it out at the next stopping-place."

No more was said, and they pushed on swiftly along the river bank. The day was fearfully hot
and the road rough. Jim Dent began to puff and blow under his burden.

"Say," grunted Buck, "this is a tough job running away under loads from dacoits who'll scour
after us like coyotes as soon as they hit our bank of the river."

"It is," panted Jim. "Me Dain, how far is it to the next village which is strong enough to
make us safe against the Kachins?"

The Burman shook his head.

"Soon the road leaves the river," he said. "Then it goes through jungle. But it passes only
little villages, very little."

"A jungle road, and no chance of a haven," said Jack. "This sounds precious awkward. It strikes
me our only chance will be to pick a strong position, or as strong a one as we can find, and
wait for them. They'll certainly run us down pretty soon at the pace we're travelling now."

"And we can't go any faster," said Buck, "without we leave our traps, and then we should be
up a tree for want of them, even if we escaped from the dacoits in the end."

"I'm getting beat, and that's a fact," murmured Jim Dent. "I had a sharp touch of fever about
three months ago, and it's not gone so clean out of my bones as I thought."

"I'll carry your pack, Jim," cried Jack.

"In addition to your own?" said Dent. "Not likely. I'll peg along a bit farther before I agree
to that."

At that moment the path ran into a grove of tall bamboos clustered along the bank. The grove
was of no great width, and they emerged from it to see a little camp pitched on a sand-bank
beside the stream. A fire was burning, and a pot of rice simmering over the flame. Watching
the rice, sat, or rather squatted, a couple of Shan boatmen, and their boat was moored to a
tree at the water's edge.

"Hallo!" cried Jack, "these chaps have got a big boat here. Can't we get them to run us and
our stuff up the river?"

"By George!" said Jim Dent, "there's something in that."

"Ask them, Me Dain," called Jack. "Tell them we'll pay them well if they'll carry us up the river."

The Burman ran forward at once and began to talk quickly to the big-hatted boatmen. In two
moments everything was settled. The men were poling their boat back up the stream after selling
a load of tobacco in a down-river village, and were glad to serve travellers who would pay
them well. The baggage was stripped from the pony, and hastily swung into the empty boat.

"What shall we do with the pony?" said Jack.

"Turn him loose into the jungle," said Buck. "He's got heaps of sense, they all have. Before
night he'll hit on some village, and then he'll soon find a master. A stray pony comes in very
useful to anybody."

This was done. Me Dain led the pony a short distance from the river bank and loosed it, and
gave it a cut with a switch. The little creature threw up its heels joyfully to find itself
free, then cantered off among the trees, and they saw it no more.

By this time the Shans had swallowed their rice, and were ready to seize their poles. All sprang
aboard, the Shans and Me Dain grasped the boating-poles, and the craft was soon being driven
steadily up stream. For some time Jack watched the boatmen with deep interest. They drove their
craft along just as a punt is propelled in England. Each man handled a long stout pole, and,
where the water was shallow enough, he set the bottom of his pole in the gravelly bed and urged
the boat forward. Where the water was too deep the craft was turned inshore, and the polers
thrust the ends of their staves against the bank or against tree trunks lining the water's
edge. Jack saw that quite deep holes had been made in many of the trunks where boatman after
boatman had gained the purchase which sent his craft spinning up stream.

"Well, Jim," said Jack, "this is a bit easier anyhow."

"It is," sighed Dent, wiping the streaming sweat from his brow. "I was pretty near caving in,
and that's a fact."

"We'll drop the dacoits for a sure thing," said Buck. "They'll stop to hunt all about the place
where they lose our trail, and then they'll follow up the pony for a dead cert."

"True for you, Buck," replied Jim Dent. "We left no marks at all to show them where we got
into the boat."

They had embarked secretly by pushing the boat up to a big stone, and moving carefully in order
to leave no trace.

"Where does the road turn off from the river bank, Me Dain?" asked Jack.

"We have passed it already, sahib," replied the Burman. "It is solid jungle on both banks now,
with no path at all The dacoits cannot follow except along the river itself."

"Then we've dropped 'em," said Jim Dent decisively. "We shall never see 'em again."

And Jim's words proved to be right. They had at last eluded the pursuit of the blood-thirsty
little Kachins.

CHAPTER XIX.

THE VILLAGE FESTIVAL.

For three days the strong arms of Me Dain and the two Shan boatmen drove the river boat up
the stream, and every day's journey brought them nearer to the mountains where the rubies were
found, and among whose recesses they believed that Jack's father was a close prisoner in the
hands of men who coveted rubies above all things.

Jack said very little to his companions about the object of their journey, but his own thoughts
were full of it at every waking moment. Since he had discovered that U Saw, the Ruby King,
had a steam yacht, and that it had returned and gone up river shortly before their own arrival,
he had felt no doubt whatever in his own mind as to his father's fate. He knew that the great
ruby expert was on that yacht a close captive, and that he had been carried by secret ways,
through the jungle and over the hills, to the place where U Saw was all-powerful, and would
do his utmost to wrest from Thomas Haydon the knowledge which the latter certainly possessed
of a great ruby-mine.

Very good. They, too, would push into the Ruby King's country, and do their utmost to foil
his plans and snatch his prisoner from his clutch. Hour after hour Jack thought over the situation,
while his eye rested almost carelessly on the lovely scenes of hill-side and jungle, past which
their boat was driven.

At the end of the first day they left the main current of the river, and poled eastwards by
a network of creeks leading to the village from which their boatmen came. For the most part
the water-way was very solitary. Here and there they passed a village, but, as a rule, no life,
save that of wild animals, was to be seen. Monkeys chattered in the trees over their heads,
panthers and deer came down to the stream to drink, tigers roared in sullen fashion in the
jungle, and once, a troop of wild elephants crossed a ford before them in stately line.

With the evening of the third day the boatmen reached their native village, and the travellers
stepped ashore. A new hut, built of reeds and cane, was set apart at once for their use, and,
after supper, they talked over their future movements before turning in.

"How do we stand now as regards striking the course my father followed from Mogok?" asked Jack.

Jim Dent, who knew the country well, cross-examined Me Dain for a few moments.

"We ought to hit it to-morrow afternoon," he said. "We've come a long way on the right road
by dropping on these boatmen. We're just handy to the foot-hills, and the Professor skirted
'em, according to what Me Dain says."

"Very well," said Jack. "Then we'll roll into our blankets, and be off by daybreak."

Jack was so eager to start on the real trail, and so excited by its nearness, that he slept
but little. He was up an hour before the dawn, and had got the fire burning when his companions
awoke. Buck sat up, and rubbed his eyes, and sniffed the smoke.

"Keen on a start, Jack?" he murmured.

"I am, Buck," replied the tall lad. "Haven't you told me a score of times how the news of travellers
in a country runs with marvellous swiftness through the jungle, from village to village? Well,
I want to be ahead of the news. It might make Saya Chone and U Saw suspicious. They knew very
well we were in Mandalay. I don't want them to learn too soon that we're at their very doors."

Jim Dent nodded. He, too, had wakened, and had been listening to Jack.

"Me Dain," said Jack, "go to the headman, and tell him we want a couple of good ponies to carry
the packs once more. Bring them here for us to see, and then we'll pay the owners."

Within half an hour they had the pick of a score of capital little beasts. They looked them
over carefully, chose the couple which seemed best suited to their needs, paid for them, and
set to work to pack the traps on them. Within an hour after sunrise they were on the march.

For several miles they followed a well-worn road running due north from the village. This was
to conceal their true line of march from the knowledge of the curious villagers. But when they
were well away from the place, and safe from all prying eyes, they swung to the east and marched
straight through open country for the foot-hills, plainly in view a score of miles away.

The sun was low and they had made a good day's journey, when Me Dain halted on a little ridge,
overlooking a sloping green valley with a brook tinkling down its centre. Jack was beside him.

"There, sahib, there," said the Burman. "We have reached now the path which the sahib, your
father, followed. We made our camp, one night, under those trees."

He pointed to a group of noble teak trees growing beside the little brook, and Jack strode
forward, and was soon standing on the spot where his father had camped a month or two before.
He had scarcely reached the place when he received proof positive that Me Dain was right. Something
glittered in the rays of the sinking sun. It was an empty tin tossed carelessly into a clump
of wild-fig bushes. Jack picked it up with a cry of recognition.

"Look here," he said; "the Burman's hit the trail all right. Here's one of the governor's empty
tobacco tins. He's never smoked anything else in my knowledge of him."

Jack held in his hand an empty tin which bore the name of a brand of Carolina tobacco. Though
little known out of America, the tobacco was an immense favourite with Mr.. Haydon, who carried
an ample supply of it with him wherever he went.

"Sure thing," chuckled Buck. "That's one o' the Professor's tins. Well, we'll follow him up."

They camped that night under the teak trees, and with the first light of the next morning,
began to follow up the track which Mr.. Haydon had taken some time before, the track which
led into the wild hill-country, where U Saw, the Ruby King, was all-powerful.

They now moved with the utmost caution. When they saw a caravan of cattle, laden with salt,
marching along a hill road they were about to cross, they hid from it in the jungle. When they
saw afar off the spire of a pagoda peeping over the trees, and knew they were near a village,
they sent Me Dain ahead to make inquiries, and find whether the villagers were familiar with
the name of U Saw. And so for three days they worked cautiously along the track running up
into the hills where Thomas Haydon had found the immense ruby of priceless value.

On the fourth morning they were just breaking camp, when, to their surprise, a troop of gaily
dressed villagers passed them, and called out a cheerful greeting to Me Dain. The Burman went
forward to talk to them, while Jack, Jim, and Buck went on with their packing, and tried to
look unconcerned.

They were in reality vexed that they had been seen. But the bunch of walking figures had descended
the ravine in which they were camped so suddenly and unexpectedly, that there was no time to
get out of the way.

"Where under the sun have these people turned up from, in so lonely a part of the hills?" said
Jack to Buck. "Why, we haven't seen a village since yesterday morning."

"I dunno," replied Buck. "This beats the band. They seem to have dropped from the sky."

When Me Dain came back to them, the explanation was simple enough. Four hours' march ahead
was a large village, where every three years a great religious festival was held. To this festival
the whole country-side gathered, and the band of villagers, now pushing ahead and almost out
of sight at the foot of the ravine, had already come three days' journey to attend the feast.

The Burman reported that the villagers had been filled with curiosity at the sight of three
white travellers in this out-of-the-way region, and had overwhelmed him with questions about them.

"What did you tell them, Me Dain?" asked Jack.

"Said you were crossing the hills to strike up to the great road from Bhamo," replied the Burman.
"Sahibs, we must go to that village now, and pass through it openly."

"But won't that make our presence known throughout the whole district?" cried Jack.

"Not half so much as if we don't show up," said Jim Dent "D'ye see, Jack, it's uncommon, but
not impossible, for travellers to strike across the hills this way. Now, if we pass through
this village in an open sort of fashion, it won't make a tenth of the talk as if we were to
slip off and never be seen again. Then there'd be such a chatter in the country-side as we
don't want to start."

"I see what you mean, Jim," returned Jack. "We must hope that we can get through the place
quietly."

But Jack's hopes proved utterly vain. Half a mile outside the village they were met by a dozen
of the leading inhabitants, each wearing a fine new silk putsoe, and with a gaung baung of
gorgeous colour on his head. The strangers were politely bidden to take up their residence
in the house of the headman, and to be present at the great feast which was that night to open
the week of religious festival. It was impossible to refuse these attentions, and the little
group of travellers, whose keenest wish was to pass unnoticed, entered the place under the
stare of many hundreds of eyes.

A large room was set at their disposal in the house of the headman, and here they talked together.

"It's vexing, but it can't be helped," said Jack. "We must slip off again in the morning. After
all, this fandango, you say, will last a week. At that rate, we shall get a big start of the
people assembled here, and shall outrun the country gossip far enough."

CHAPTER XX.

THE DANCING GIRL.

After the dusk had fallen, the travellers were conducted by the headman himself, a white-headed
old fellow, who showed them the utmost respect, to the spot where the festival was to be opened
with a play and a performance of dancing girls.

Jack was fascinated with the wonderful sight now presented to his view. He, alone, among the
party, had never seen such a spectacle before, and he looked on with the deepest interest.
He was seated on a heap of cushions, before a wide open space surrounded by thickets of low
trees and tall bushes. On the branches of these were hung innumerable coloured lamps, which
lighted the scene with a soft, bright radiance.

In the centre of the space were ranged sixty dancing girls, in ten rows of six in a row, and
each dancer stood at an equal distance from her next neighbour on either hand. Each girl was
dressed in beautiful silks of the most glowing, or the most delicate shades. Her short embroidered
jacket, her tightly folded skirt, were of the brightest and newest, and her hair was decked
with beautiful flowers.

The dance began, and the graceful swaying movements, to which the clink of the bangles worn
in rows on every arm kept time, were full of fascination and charm. All round the open space
the villagers from far and near were gathered, and this mass of spectators in strange garbs,
but everything of the freshest and gayest, formed a striking setting for the scene.

When the dance was over, the headman, through Me Dain, begged them to inspect the pagoda and
the offerings which had been brought to it by the faithful. They went and saw a very quaint
and beautiful structure, its columns inlaid with mosaics and coloured glass which glittered
with a thousand glancing rays in the lights of the myriads of lamps. Chief among the offerings
at the shrine were huge packets of gold-leaf, for the religious Burman loves to decorate his
favourite pagoda with sheets of gold-leaf, till it glistens in the sun like a palace of gold.

Among the offerings ranged on the steps of the pagoda was a native painting, a quaint piece
of work which drew Jack's attention at once. He bent down to look at it, while his companions
rambled on with Me Dain and the headman.

As Jack straightened himself again, he felt a light touch on his arm, and looked round. Beside
him stood a dancing girl, wrapped in a close-fitting robe of yellow silk, and a scarf of muslin
so wound about her head that he could not see her face.

Jack stared for a moment in surprise, wondering what the girl could want with him, then he
gave a great start as she began to speak. She used the softest, gentlest whisper, but her voice
came easily to his ears, and, marvellous to relate, she spoke in perfect English.

"I know what you seek," she said, "and I can help you."

Jack's surprise was so great that, for a moment, he could not answer, and the veiled figure
went on:

"Would you not like to know where the object of your search is?"

"How do you know that I seek someone?" said Jack in wonder.

"Oh, I know," murmured the dancing girl with a soft, light laugh. "I will go a little further.
Would you not like to know where your father, Thomas Haydon, is imprisoned, and what is happening
to him?"

For a moment the whole glittering scene of lamps and gaiety went round before Jack's eyes.
Then he pulled himself up steady once more. This savoured of the utterly marvellous, that a
dancing girl in this village which he had never seen before, should glide up to him and tell
him the innermost secret of his heart, the purpose of his quest.

"Who are you, and how did you come to know such things?" said Jack.

"Oh," said the girl lightly, "in this strange land we can do many strange things. But I cannot
talk to you long. Do you wish, I ask you once more, to gain tidings of your father?"

"There is nothing I wish for more upon earth," returned Jack earnestly, for it was idle to
pretend that the girl was wrong, and try to hide his secret. It was known only too clearly
to this strange creature in the yellow robe, with a score of silver bangles tinkling on her
arm. Jack turned his head towards his companions who had strolled on, and were now a dozen
yards away, and half hidden by a group of villagers standing before the shrine.

"No," said the girl, laying her hand on Jack's arm, "no, you must not call to them. I do not
wish to talk to your Burman guide. It would place me in great danger if it became known that
I had warned you. If you do not listen to me, and alone, I shall vanish into the crowd, and
you will never see me again, or learn that which you long to know."

The girl's hint that she stood in danger by warning him, at once checked the call on Jack's
lips. He looked at her keenly, but could only see a pair of lustrous eyes flashing through
the folds of delicate muslin, her features he could not make out at all. His brain was in a
whirl. Here seemed a most extraordinary, a most wonderful chance to gain news of his father,
but at the same time his reason bade him be careful.

Suppose he were to seize the girl and declare that she must tell him at once what she knew?
But Jack's feelings revolted at such conduct. Suppose she should come into danger by his doing
so, by his making public the fact that she was warning him? No, he could not do that. Besides,
they were but a few strangers amid a great concourse of natives. Such an action might give
great offence, and place, not only himself, but his friends in a position of the utmost peril.

These thoughts went through Jack's head in a flash. The girl at his side gave another light laugh.

"You can find out all you want in so simple a fashion," she murmured. "Turn your head to the
right, and near a patch of acacia bushes you will see a monk with his begging-bowl. Cross over
to him, and drop a piece of money into the bowl. At the same moment you can take out of it
the letter which your father has sent to you by his hands. I would fetch it for you, but he
will not give it up to anyone but you."

This became more and more bewildering, but at the same time, Jack saw that this matter was
very simply settled. He looked away to the right, and saw the monk plainly enough, a Buddhist
monk in yellow robe, his begging dish of bronze held out before him. The man stood upright
and motionless, not thirty yards away.

Jack turned on his heel and strode straight across towards the monk, resolved to see at any
rate what was in the dish. The dancing girl followed him with graceful, swaying step.

At the instant that Jack moved towards the monk a fresh band of revellers came out of a path
leading from the acacia bushes and crossed towards the steps of the pagoda. From among them
a tall, thin man dressed in white robes stepped out and moved with long, soft strides after
the young Englishman. His companions lingered and stared idly about them.

As Jack approached the monk, he saw the latter raise his head and glance at him meaningly.
Then, with a slight movement of the hand, the monk pointed to the bottom of his bowl. Jack
had taken a rupee from his pocket and stretched out his hand to drop it into the bowl. As he
did so he glanced eagerly into the bronze vessel. A folded piece of white paper lay in the
bottom of it. Jack dropped his coin and stretched out his hand to seize the paper. But he never
touched it.

With horrible swiftness and suddenness, someone clutched him from behind. Once more he felt
his throat in the frightful strangling grip which had seized him on Rushmere Heath, in far-away
England. He tried to shout, but his half-choked voice was drowned in the sudden burst of song
which rose from the band of gaily dressed figures which now swarmed around him. He tried to
struggle, to throw off the fearful grip which held him, but now the dancing girl sprang to
him and pressed against his face a cloth she had drawn from beneath her yellow robe. Almost
at once the powerful drug with which the cloth was saturated took effect. Jack's head dropped
forward, and the dancing girl nodded to the strangler to loose his frightful clutch.

At that moment Buck looked round and missed his young companion.

"Where's Jack got to?" he asked.

"I don't know," said Jim. "He was looking at a picture just along there, the last time I saw him."

"I don't see him anywhere about," said Buck, in an uneasy voice, and he walked rapidly back.
He came to the picture, stopped in front of it, and looked eagerly round for Jack. He saw the
band of singers a short distance away, but took no notice of them. He had seen scores of such
bands during the evening. Little did he dream that, under cover of those harmless looking revellers,
the body of his young comrade was being dragged among the acacia bushes by the monk and the
dancing girl.

CHAPTER XXI.

JACK FINDS HIMSELF IN BAD HANDS.

When Jack came to himself again, he felt faint and sick, and his head ached dully. This was
the effect of the powerful drug which had been used to overcome him, but for the rest he was
unhurt and quite himself. He found at once that he was securely bound hand and foot. His ankles
were fastened together by a short cord, his hands were tied behind him, and a rope ran round
the middle of his body and tethered him securely to a strong post. But he was not gagged, and
his eyes were free.

He looked eagerly around the place in which he found himself. It was a native hut, built of
canes and reeds, woven upon a framework formed of saplings and stronger trees. The floor was
of earth, and he could see the whole of the bare, empty room, for in one corner a lamp stood
on the floor, and gave sufficient light to show him every nook in the place. Somewhere, not
far away, there was a hoarse roar of water, as if a river leapt over falls near at hand.

Jack raised his voice and shouted. He could not move, but his throat was free. Twice or thrice
he shouted the names of his companions. The only answer to his call was a light mocking laugh
outside the door, which swung half open straight before him. Then a figure appeared in the
doorway, a figure in a tight yellow robe and short embroidered jacket, the dancing girl who
had ensnared him. But even as he opened his mouth eagerly to speak to her, he was silenced.
The figure was drawing aside the muslin veil from its head. As the soft shimmering folds of
the delicate wrapper slipped away, Jack's heart leaped within him. He knew that face. This
was no dancing girl. It was the half-caste in disguise. It was Saya Chone, the man who had
stopped him on Rushmere Heath, the man who had slipped out of his clutch at Brindisi.

"Ah," said the half-caste, squatting down in front of Jack, "I have no need to ask if you know
me. I see recognition in your astonished face. Well, does it now surprise you that a dancing
girl should know so much of your business up in these hills?"

"So it was you, you rascal, was it?" said Jack, drawing a deep breath. "You, all the time."

"I, all the time," chuckled the half-caste, clicking consonants between his teeth.

"If you'd have spoken out, I should have known you," said Jack.

"Ah, possibly," said Saya Chone; "but then for my purpose the soft voice, the gentle whisper,
was the only thing."

"What do you mean by this, and what do you want with me?" demanded Jack.

"Orders, orders, I am acting under orders," murmured the half-caste, waving his brown hand
in the air. "And I do not want you at all. It is merely my business to hand you over to my
patron U Saw. It is he who wants you, not I."

"And what does he want me for?" said Jack.

"Ah," murmured Saya Chone, "that I shall not tell you now. It is not good for the servants
of U Saw to interfere too much in their master's business. Well, I must prepare for the march."

He clapped his hands, and a tall, thin man in white robes came in. Saya Chone said a few words
to the newcomer, and the latter sat down and fixed his dark, menacing eyes on Jack.

"This is a Malay, who is entirely devoted to U Saw's service," said the half-caste, with an
evil grin. "He is a very useful man, for he is absolutely the cleverest hand with the strangling
noose that I have ever known. I believe he could strangle a child in its mother's arms and
she would know nothing about it. You have already had a slight taste of his skill on two occasions.
Once on that heath in your queer, cold England, and again to-night. But as he was under strict
orders on both occasions not to take your life, he spared you the last touch of his art, that
sharp, neat twist which breaks his victim's spinal column as if he was snapping a bit of dry
stick."

Saya Chone turned to go, but paused at the door and looked over his shoulder.

"I heard you shouting as I came in," he said. "If you have a fancy for that amusement, pray
shout as much as you like. But I ought to warn you that it is a pure waste of breath. We have
carried you nearly a couple of miles into the jungle, and fifty times the uproar you could
make would be quite useless to attract attention."

He left the hut, and Jack sat back against the post to think over his desperate situation.
He had fallen into the hands of the very people that he and his comrades were trying to circumvent.
How they had discovered their line of march, and been enabled to lay this clever trap for him,
he could not imagine. But one thing he saw clearly, that U Saw's arm was very long in this
country, and that his net for information was spread abroad very widely and very successfully.

He looked across at the Strangler, and found the dark bright eyes of the Malay fixed intently
upon him. Jack had been thinking to test the strength of the knots and the cords which bound
him, but in the presence of this keen watchman it was useless, and he bent down his eyes in
thought once more.

"I am to be carried to U Saw," he thought. "Then my father must be there already. At any rate
I shall see him, I hope, and find out what has happened to him, and how he has been treated."

Several hours now passed in complete silence. Jack's bonds chafed him miserably, but he could
do nothing to relieve himself, and the Malay watched him with fierce alertness at every moment.
Then the ricketty door was jerked open again, and Saya Chone came in.

"It is the dark hour before the dawn," he laughed jeeringly. "A capital time to slip away while
all the revellers are sleeping, and the forest paths are empty. Your conveyance awaits you,
my lord."

He said two words to the Strangler, and drew a revolver from beneath his jacket. He had thrown
aside his disguise as a dancing girl, and now appeared in the rich tartan silk kilt, the jacket,
and turban-like head-dress of a prosperous Burman.

"Get up," he said curtly to Jack, while the Strangler unfastened the rope which bound the captive's
feet and also that which bound his body to the post.

Jack got up, and Saya Chone motioned to him to go outside, and Jack went, with the Malay and
the half-caste in close attendance. Resistance was impossible. His hands were still bound behind
his back, and the half-caste held a big, blue "Smith and Wesson" within two inches of his ear.

In front of the hut loomed up a huge beast looking monstrous in the light of a couple of lanterns
held by attendants. It was an elephant, and a ladder was placed against the open howdah fixed
on its back; the great beast was swinging trunk and tail impatiently, and its driver was already
seated behind the huge head.

"Up with you," said Saya Chone. Jack glanced round, and saw nothing but dark, fierce, inimical
faces all about him.

"No chance in the world at present," he thought, and began slowly to climb the ladder. It was
very awkward work with no hand free, but the Strangler stretched out a long arm, supported
him to the top rung, then thrust him violently forward, so that Jack rolled into the howdah.
It was the simplest form of this kind of carriage, and was exactly like a huge open basket
of strong wicker-work fastened on the elephant's back. Before Jack could recover himself from
his fall, the Malay and two other men bounded into the howdah, and flung themselves on the
prisoner. In a trice they had strapped his ankles together again. Then they swung him into
a sitting posture, and lashed his arms firmly to the back of the howdah.

Next they descended, another figure leapt up, and the ladder was taken away. The newcomer gave
an order, and the elephant driver spoke to his huge beast in a low voice. The elephant at once
swung forward, and in a moment the hut and its lanterns were left behind, and they were moving
through the darkness of the jungle.

Jack had known by the voice that it was the half-caste who was his companion in the howdah,
but he said nothing, and Saya Chone, too, was silent. Soon the half-caste lighted a huge Burmese
cheroot, and in the light, almost the flare, of this immense cigar, nine or ten inches long
and an inch thick, Jack saw now and again his beardless brown face, his big, shining, evil eyes.

When the dawn came and Jack could look about him, they were traversing a narrow path through
jungle so thick that the sky could scarcely be seen overhead.

"Ah," said Saya Chone, breaking the silence at last, "you may look round, my lord, but you
will never be able to keep in mind the details of the route. I shall take you into the hills
by paths so hidden in the jungle or along ravines so deep that to track you will be impossible."

Jack was silent for a moment. Then he spoke. "Shall I see my father?" he asked.

Saya Chone laughed. "You will see what U Saw wills that you shall see," he said mockingly.
"I am U Saw's humble servant, and can say no more."

Jack made no reply. He was sorry he had spoken, but the question had slipped out on the impulse
of the moment.

All that day they travelled on, and at night they camped in a hollow among the rocks at the
foot of a tall cliff. Jack was not ill-treated, and plenty of food was given to him, but the
keenest watch was kept upon his every movement, and escape was a thing altogether beyond his
reach. His captors were six in number, including the man who drove the elephant. The driver
and Saya Chone were Jack's companions on the great beast, and when they were on the move the
captive was always lashed tightly to the framework of the howdah. The other four, the Malay
and three companions, rode the strong, nimble ponies of the country. The baggage of the party
was conveyed on a pack-pony, and they travelled at a good speed.

On the second morning, Saya Chone sat on the edge of the howdah, purring at his huge cheroot,
while the Strangler and a companion lashed Jack into position. The half-caste had been superintending
the operation with his revolver at Jack's ear, until the knots were tight, and our hero could
not move.

"This is a very good idea, indeed," he murmured, "this carrying of a prisoner in a howdah on
a pad-elephant. I had an idea it would be a success, but it is better than I thought. It is
a neat, little, portable prison. It is far better than tying the feet of an active young man
under a pony's barrel. The young man may dig his heels in and gallop off after all. But tied
up in a howdah he is quite safe."

Jack paid no attention whatever to the half-caste's sneers and jeers: he had resolved to take
his gruel without whining, and he bore everything in stoical silence.

Two hours' march brought them to a clearing in the jungle, and the road ran between small paddy-fields.
This meant that a native village was near at hand, and Jack looked out for the slight huts
of reed and cane in which the villagers lived. To his surprise he saw nothing. And not to his
surprise alone. He could not understand the words used by his companions, but he saw plainly
that they were puzzled about something. Then the cries of wonder broke out loudly as they passed
a grove of bamboos and came upon a scene of extraordinary destruction. The native village had
been built in shelter of the bamboos, only a little place, a cluster of fifteen or twenty huts.
But every house lay in ruins as if the place had been knocked about the villagers' ears with
a huge flail. Near at hand a man lay dead, his body horribly crushed and battered. No sign
of life was to be observed about the place.

But while the travellers stared in wonder on the havoc which had been made, they were suddenly
attacked by the author of it, and knew that their own lives were in deadly peril. There was
a terrific crashing among the bamboos, and then a huge, dark object was seen to be bursting
a way through the tall stems. All but Jack knew at once what it meant; he was enlightened in
an instant.

"A 'rogue' elephant! A 'rogue' elephant!" cried Saya Chone, and the driver urged the pad-elephant
forward with voice and spear.

Then Jack understood. His father had told him many times how that a big, savage male will often
leave a herd of wild elephants, take up a solitary life in the jungle, and become a "rogue."
There is no more terrible beast to be met with. His enormous size and strength, his terrible
ferocity, make him the king of the jungle. He attacks all he meets, and tramples every foe
under his huge feet.

This "rogue" had evidently been attracted to the clearing by the paddy-fields, where the elephant
loves to feed. Then, irritated probably by some attempt of the natives to drive him away, he
had attacked their village and swept it out of existence. Now he was charging savagely upon
the newcomers.

He came at them across the open with terrific speed. Jack had not the faintest idea that so
ponderous a beast could move at such a pace, and he stared with fascinated eyes at the extraordinary
sight. The "rogue" was an immense tusker, a big, wild, savage-looking brute, who charged with
up-lifted trunk, and now trumpeted with so tremendous a note that the jungle and the hill-sides
rang with the hoarse thunder. His course was laid straight for the men in front, two of the
attendants on ponies. The Malay, the remaining attendant, and the pack-pony were behind the
pad-elephant.

The ponies, obedient to their riders, had at first bounded forward, but when that frightful
trumpeting broke out, and they saw the huge tusker thundering upon them, they were seized with
such fear that they stopped and stood still, trembling in every limb. Before their riders could
urge them on, the immense brute was upon them. One of the riders, a bold fellow, stood up in
the stirrups, and struck at the "rogue" with his dah. But he might as well have struck with
a straw. The monster literally swept the two ponies down in his stride, trampling them under
foot in his frightful charge. The man who had used his heavy sword to so little effect, went
down with his pony. The second man had leapt from his saddle, and he ran at full speed for
a teak tree, intending to swarm up its trunk.

His flying figure caught the eye of the "rogue" just as he was about to turn and trample on
those he had hurled to the ground. Now the savage brute strode on, and it was seen how swift
was his great lumbering stride. He caught the man up, long before the fugitive was anywhere
near the tree, and hurled him to the ground with a stroke of his tusk. Then he pulled up and
deliberately knelt down on the unlucky wretch, who screamed horribly as his life was crushed
out of him by the tremendous weight of the gigantic beast.

CHAPTER XXII.

THE TWO ELEPHANTS.

All this passed directly below Jack's horrified eyes. The pad-elephant was so frightened at
the advent of this savage specimen of his own species, that he had turned stupid and made no
attempt to obey his driver's orders. Instead, he turned and backed slowly from the place, keeping
his head towards the "rogue." Thus Jack saw the ferocious brute swiftly crush the life out
of the man upon whom he knelt, then leap up and rush back to the spot where the two ponies
and the rider who had used the dah were still lying on the ground.

The ponies had both been trodden on in that terrific charge, and the man, untouched by the
elephant, had been flung three or four yards, and lay half-stunned by his fall. As he scrambled
to his feet the "rogue" was upon him. With a scream of rage the maddened brute bent down his
huge head and delivered a sweeping stroke with his tusk. The great sharp spear of ivory struck
the man in the back and was driven clean through the body. The elephant raised his head and
swung the man high above the ground. Jack shuddered as he saw the writhing figure impaled on
that huge tusk.

For a moment the elephant held his victim aloft as if in triumph, then with a swing of his
head he hurled the man far away, and looked round for fresh victims. At the next moment the
earth shook under his tread as he thundered down upon the pad-elephant and the burden it bore.

"Cut me loose!" roared Jack to the half-caste. "What chance have I got, tied to this howdah?"

But Saya Chone, ashen with fear, clung to the edge of the car, and had eyes and ears for nothing
save for the great beast charging full upon them. Jack hurled himself to and fro, trying to
slacken a little the bonds which held him a prisoner under such fearful circumstances. If the
pad-elephant would only make a fight of it, there would be a chance for its riders to slip
down and escape, but how could Jack help himself?

As the "rogue" made his last few sweeping strides upon them, the pad-elephant seemed to pluck
up the courage of desperation. He was a fine, big, powerful fellow, though not equal in size
to his wild enemy, and now he took a step or two forward, threw out his huge forehead, and
met his enemy in full career.

The crash as the two huge beasts charged into each other was tremendous. The pad-elephant was
driven back half a dozen yards, but he kept his feet. Then the two immense creatures, head
braced to head and tusks locked in tusks, began a steady trial of strength, each striving to
force the other back.

Now Saya Chone plucked out his heavy revolver, and, leaning over the edge of the howdah, began
to fire swiftly into the head and body of the savage "rogue." But though the bullets cut deeply
into the flesh, and the blood spouted freely, the big brute troubled nothing about that. As
far as reaching any vital part went, the revolver might have been a pop-gun, and the wild elephant
gave himself up entirely to the struggle with his tame brother.

In a few minutes it was seen that he was carrying the day. The pad-elephant, with deep grunts
of anger and fear, began to give way before the fierce strength and impetuosity of his terrible
opponent. Jack looked round and saw that they were alone; the Malay and the fourth attendant
had fled from the place.

Then, at the next moment, the elephant under them gave up the fight. He suddenly backed off,
turned, and lumbered across the clearing in full flight. The "rogue" threw up his trunk, and
trumpeted a roar of victory, then dashed after the pad-elephant in savage pursuit. He was much
swifter, and soon came up on the flank where Jack, by turning his head, had him in full view.
Jack saw the small, fierce eyes burning with fury, and then the head was bent and the great
forehead was driven against the flying enemy. The shock was such that the pad-elephant was
driven to its knees, the driver was hurled over its head, and Saya Chone flung headlong out
of the car. Jack alone remained in the howdah, held fast by his bonds.

Again the "rogue" elephant charged his enemy, and now the latter was flung over on to its side,
and the rim of the howdah brushed the ground. Jack looked up in despair. The vast bulk of the
infuriated elephant hung right over him as the "rogue" prepared to trample upon the foe whom
he had hurled to the ground. In vain did Jack dash himself to and fro in his bonds; he was
fastened only too securely, and he knew that the least stroke of the foot now raised above
his head would crush him as surely as a steam-hammer would crush a nut. At the next second
Jack saw a gleaming white tusk dart down towards him as the "rogue" bent his head and struck.

The tusk went through the howdah within six inches of Jack's leg, and was buried deep in the
back of the pad-elephant Then the "rogue," as he withdrew the dripping spear of ivory, caught
sight of something and turned his wicked little eyes on it. He saw the driver and Saya Chone
at some little distance running for their lives, and his fickle fancy turned to the thoughts
of making short work of them before he finished with his tame brother.

Away he went in pursuit of this new object, and the pad-elephant scrambled to its feet, and
stood for a few moments as if bewildered and uncertain what to do. During these few moments
Jack saw the driver caught and felled to earth by the huge beast before whose savage might
all stood helpless. Saya Chone had far outrun his companion, and the half-caste disappeared
among the trees as the "rogue" began to trample upon the driver, whose frightful screams were
silenced as both breath and life itself were swiftly crushed out of the body, so soon made
pulp under those huge round feet.

Suddenly the pad-elephant wheeled about with big clumsy movements, and was off at a good round
lumbering trot in the opposite direction. He had seen quite enough of this savage brother of
the jungle, and had no wish for further punishment. But the "rogue" had no intention of letting
him go so easily. Leaving the driver, the wild elephant dashed after the tame one at full speed.

And now began a most extraordinary race. The pad-elephant darted straight into the jungle and
took the country as it came, straight before him, thinking of nothing but escape. He dashed
through groves of bamboos and saplings, cutting his way clean through; he raced grunting and
puffing up hill-side and down ravines; he dodged through the big trees with an agility and
swiftness most wonderful in so heavy and clumsy a beast, and all the time his enemy hung upon
his rear, sometimes near enough to gore his flank, sometimes out-distanced for a little as
the tame beast, frenzied with fear and pain, put out an extraordinary burst of speed. And in
the howdah, fast bound still to the tough wicker-work, was Jack, the only spectator of this
marvellous chase through the jungle, and one with an immense stake in it.

When the "rogue" came up, Jack's heart beat thick with anxiety. If the creature that bore him
was once more knocked down, then he knew that it would be all over with him. He would certainly
be crushed like a fly in the terrific struggle which would follow. When the pad-elephant got
away, Jack breathed a little more freely, until he heard his enemy's ponderous steps once again
thundering up.

Mile after mile, through jungle or over open plain, this marvellous chase went on, and still
the pad-elephant raced snorting for his life, still the furious "rogue" pounded at his heels
in hot pursuit.

Jack was nearly shaken to pieces. He braced his feet against the side of the howdah, and propped
himself firmly against a corner of the huge basket in which he rode. More than once the curling
trunk of the pursuer was raised above his head, but, as is well known, the wild elephant hesitated
to attack a rider on the tame one's back. For three full hours the furious monarch of the jungle
drove the pad-elephant before him, a ride Jack never forgot to the end of his days. Then they
came out on a wide grassy plain by a river, where a large herd of wild elephants was standing
knee-deep in the stream, solemnly spouting water over their backs.

On rushed the pad-elephant, now panting and almost ready to fall from exhaustion, towards his
fellows. But the "rogue," a hater of his kind, pulled up, trumpeted a few shrill notes of defiance,
turned, and trotted back into the jungle.

The pad-elephant now stood still, trembling from head to foot with his tremendous exertions.
The herd of wild elephants, more than twenty in number, left the river and came towards the
beast which bore the howdah and Jack. They marched up in slow and stately fashion, without
any sign of anger, but apparently full of curiosity as to this newcomer and his strange equipment.

At the next moment Jack found himself in a most extraordinary position, his elephant being
surrounded by the wild herd, whose trunks ran here and there over their tame brother like so
many hands being stretched out to examine him. One big bull put his trunk into the howdah and
ran it over Jack, who remained perfectly still, knowing that an incautious movement might arouse
the animal's anger. But these creatures seemed as mild and gentle as the "rogue" had been ferocious.
Before long their curiosity was satisfied, and they strolled away to crop the young bamboo shoots.

At last Jack breathed a little more freely. His wild ride had been a terrible business for
him. A hundred and a hundred times had his heart come into his mouth when the great beast that
bore him had plunged through groves where it seemed that over-hanging boughs must sweep howdah
and rider from the elephant's back. But he had come through all these dangers safely, and now
the "rogue" had gone back to the jungle and the pad-elephant was at peace.

Presently Jack underwent an odd experience. His elephant walked down to the river and took
a long drink. Jack envied the lucky brute; he, too, was parched with thirst. But in another
moment he had water enough and to spare, for the elephant, filling his trunk with water, began
to cool himself by spouting it over his body, and in a very short time Jack was drenched to
the skin.

"It's refreshing, at any rate," thought Jack, as he shut his eyes against a fresh deluge of
yellow water. "I wish to goodness I could only work myself free. I've got clear away from Saya
Chone and the Strangler, and that's something to the good."

He began again to work himself about in his bonds, but he was soon obliged to desist. He was
already stiff, and he soon became very sore as he struggled with his fastenings, which seemed
to be eating into his very flesh.

"It's no go," he said half-aloud. "I cannot shake myself loose," and he fell back into his corner.

His elephant now came out of the river, and looked around eagerly for food. The herd of wild
ones was already deep in a large bamboo thicket, and the tame one went at once after them and
began to crop and munch the bamboo shoots. The wild elephants, feeding as they went, plunged
farther and farther into a region of wild jungle, far from any habitations of men, and the
tame one steadily followed them, bearing on his back the young Englishman, a prisoner, and
forced to accompany the elephant wherever he might go.

"I've heard," thought Jack, "that these tame ones will often break away and join wild herds.
I'm in a pretty desperate fix if I've got to remain lashed in this howdah while this brute
rambles far and wide with this troop of companions he has hit upon."

He looked around on every side, but saw nothing that could give him the slightest cause for
hope. With every step he was being carried deeper and deeper into the recesses of the jungle
where no hunter dare venture, where the elephant, the tiger, and the leopard rule as undisputed
masters. His plight was terrible. Who would free him, who could free him of the bonds which
held him in subjection to so cruel a fate?

CHAPTER XXIII.

THE PANTHAY WOOD-CUTTERS.

It was within an hour or two of dark, and Jack, faint with hunger and the strange and exhausting
experience through which he had gone that day, was hanging listlessly in his bonds. But, alas! Rachel
hardly knew what she would do to support herself during the dead months from August to October. "Fashionable
people always go out of town, father," she said.

"Then let us be fashionable."

"Fashionable people go to Scotland, but they won't take one in there
without money.

We shan't have £50 left when our debts are paid. And £50 would do nothing for us."

"They've stopped me altogether," said Mr. O'Mahony. "At any rate they have stopped the money-making
part of the business.

They have threatened to take the man's license away, and therefore that place is shut up."

"Isn't that unjust, father?"

"Unjust! Everything done in England as to Ireland is unjust. They carried an Act of Parliament
the other day, when in accordance with the ancient privileges of members it was within the
power of a dozen stalwart Irishmen to stop it. The dozen stalwart Irishmen were there, but they
were silenced by a brutal majority. The dozen Irishmen were turned out of the House, one after
the other, in direct opposition to the ancient privileges; and so
a Bill was passed robbing five million Irishmen of their liberties.

So gross an injustice was never before perpetrated--not even when the bribed members sold their
country and effected the accursed Union."

"I know that was very bad, father, but the bribes were taken by Irishmen.

Be that as it may, what are we to do with ourselves next autumn?"

"The only thing for us is to seek for assistance in the United States."

"They won't lend us £100."

"We must overrun this country by the force of true liberal opinion. The people themselves will
rise when they have the Americans to lead them. What is wanted now are the voices of true patriots
loud enough to reach the people."

"And £100," said she, speaking into his ear, "to keep us alive from the middle of August to the
end of October."

"For myself, I have been invited to come into Parliament.

The County of Cavan will be vacant."

"Is there a salary attached?"

"One or two leading Irish members are speaking of it," said Mr. O'Mahony, carried away by the
grandeur of the idea, "but the amount has not been fixed yet. And they seem to think that it is
wanted chiefly for the parliamentary session. I have not promised because I do not quite see
my way. And to tell the truth, I am not sure that it is in Parliament that an honest Irishman
will shine the best.

What's the good when you can be silenced at a moment's notice by the word of some mock Speaker,
who upsets all the rules of his office to put a gag upon a dozen men. When America has come
to understand what it is that the lawless tyrant did on that night when the Irishmen were
turned out of the House, will she not rise in her wrath, and declare
that such things shall no longer be?"

All this occurred in Cecil Street, and Rachel, who well understood her father's wrath, allowed
him to expend in words the anger which would last hardly longer than the sound of them.

"But you won't be in Parliament for County Cavan before next August?" she asked.

"I suppose not."

"Nor will the United States have risen in their wrath so as to have settled the entire question before
that time?"

"Perhaps not," said Mr. O'Mahony.

"And if they did I don't see what good it would do to us as to finding
for us the money that we want."

"I am so full of Ireland's wrongs at this moment, and with the manner in which these policemen
interfered with me, that I can hardly bring myself to think of your
autumn plans."

"What are yours?" she asked.

"I suppose we should always have money enough to go to America.

In America a man can at any rate open his mouth."

"Or a woman either. But according to what M. Le Gros says, in England they pay better at the
present moment. Mr. Moss has offered to lend me the money; but for myself I would sooner go
into an English workhouse than accept money from Mr. Moss which I
had not earned."

In truth, Rachel had been very foolish with her money, spending it as though there were no end
to the source from which it had come, and her father had not been more prudent. He was utterly
reckless in regard to such considerations, and would simply declare
that he was altogether indifferent to his dinner, or to the new hat
he had proposed to buy for himself when the subject was brought under
his notice.

He had latterly become more eager than ever as to politics, and was supremely happy as long
as he was at liberty to speak before any audience those angry words which had however been, unfortunately
for him, declared to be treasonable.

He had, till lately, been taught to understand that the House of Commons was the only arena on
which such permission would be freely granted,--and could be granted of course only to Members
of the House. Therefore the idea had entered his head that it would suit him to become a member,--more
especially as there had arisen a grand scheme of a salary for certain
Irish members of which he would be one.

But even here the brutality of England had at last interfered, and men were not to be allowed
to say what they pleased any longer even in the House of Commons. Therefore Mr. O'Mahony was
much disturbed; and although he was anxious to quarrel with no one individually, not even the policemen
who arrested him, he was full of indignant wrath against the tyranny
of England generally.

Rachel, when she could get no good advice from her father with regard to her future funds, went
back again to her singing.

It was necessary, at any rate, that she should carry out her present
arrangement with Mr. Moss, and she was sure at least of receiving
from him the money which she earned.

But, alas! she could not practise the economy which she knew to be necessary. The people at the theatre
had talked her into hiring a one-horse open carriage in which she
delighted to drive about, and in which, to tell the truth, her father
delighted to accompany her.

She had thought that she could allow herself this indulgence out of her £15 a week. And though she paid
for the indulgence monthly, that and their joint living nearly consumed the stipend. And now,
as her father's advice did not get beyond the very doubtful salary which might accrue to him
as the future member for the County Cavan, her mind naturally turned
itself to other sources.

From M. Le Gros, or from M. Le Gros' employers, she was to receive £300 for singing in the two
months before Christmas, with an assurance of a greatly increased though hitherto unfixed stipend
afterwards. Personally she as yet knew no one connected with her future theatrical home but M.
Le Gros. Of M. Le Gros all her thoughts had been favourable.

Should she ask M. Le Gros to lend her some small sum of money in advance for the uses of the
autumn? Mr. Moss had made to her a fixed proposition on the subject
which she had altogether declined.

She had declined it with scorn as she was wont to do all favours
proffered by Mr. Moss.

Mr. Moss had still been gracious, and had smiled, and had ventured
to express "a renewed hope," as he called it, that Miss O'Mahony would
even yet condescend to look with regard on the sincere affection of
her most humble servant.

And then he had again expatiated on the immense success in theatrical life which would attend
a partnership entered into between the skill and beauty and power of voice of Miss O'Mahony
on the one side, and the energy, devotion, and capital of Mr. Moss on the other. "Psha!" had
been Rachel's only reply; and so that interview had been brought
to an end.

But Rachel, when she came to think of M. Le Gros, and the money she was desirous of borrowing,
was afflicted by certain qualms. That she should have borrowed from Mr. Moss, considering the length
of their acquaintance might not have been unnatural; but of M. Le
Gros she knew nothing but his civility.

Nor had she any reason for supposing that M. Le Gros had money of his own at his disposal;
nor did she know where M. Le Gros lived.

She could go to Covent Garden and ask for him there; but that was all.

So she dressed herself prettily--neatly, as she called it--and had herself driven to the theatre.
There, as chance would have it, she found M. Le Gros standing under
the portico with a gentleman whom she represented to herself as an
elderly old buck.

M. Le Gros saw her and came down into the street at once with his hat in his hand.

"M. Le Gros," said she, "I want you to do me a great favour, but I
have hardly the impudence to ask it.

Can you lend me some money this autumn--say £100?" Thereupon M. Le Gros' face fell, and his
cheeks were elongated, and his eyes were very sorrowful. "Ah, then, I see you can't," she said.
"I will not put you to the pain of saying so. I ought not to have suggested it. My dealings
with you have seemed to be so pleasant, and they have not been quite of the same nature down at
'The Embankment.'"

"My dear young lady--"

"Not another word; and I beg your pardon most heartily for having given you this moment's annoyance."

"There
is one of the lessees there," said M. Le Gros, pointing back to the
gentleman on the top of the steps, "who has been to hear you and to
look at you this two times--this three times at 'The Embankment.'
He do think you will become the grand singer of the age."

"Who is the judicious gentleman?" asked Rachel, whispering to M. Le
Gros out of the carriage.

"He is Lord Castlewell. He is the eldest son of the Marquis of Beaulieu. He have--oh!--lots of
money. He was saying--ah! I must not tell you what his lordship was saying of you because it will
make you vain."

"Nothing that any lord can say of me will make me vain," said Rachel, chucking up her head.
Then his lordship, thinking that he had been kept long enough standing on the top of the theatre
steps, lifted his hat and came down to the carriage, the occupant of which he had recognised.

"May
I have the extreme honour of introducing Mademoiselle O'Mahony to Lord Castlewell?" and M. Le
Gros again pulled off his hat as he made the introduction.

Miss O'Mahony found that she had become Mademoiselle as soon as she had drawn up her carriage
at the front door of the genuine Italian Opera.

"This is a pleasure indeed," said Lord Castlewell.

"I am delighted--more than delighted, to find that my friend Le Gros has engaged the services
of Mademoiselle O'Mahony for our theatre."

"But our engagement does not commence quite yet, I am sorry to say," replied Rachel. Then she
prepared herself to be driven away, not caring much for the combination of lord and lessee
who stood in the street speaking to her. A lessee should be a lessee, she thought, and a lord
a lord.

"May I do myself the honour of waiting upon you some day at 'The Embankment,'" said the lord, again pulling
off his hat.

"Oh! certainly," said Rachel; "I should be delighted to see you." Then she was driven away, and
did not know whether to be angry or not in having given Lord Castlewell
so warm a welcome.

As a mere stray lord there was no possible reason why he should call upon her; nor for her why
she should receive him. Though Frank Jones had been dismissed, and though she felt herself
to be free to accept any eligible lover who might present himself, she still felt herself bound
on his behalf to keep herself free from all elderly theatrical hangers-on, especially from such
men when she heard that they were also lords. But as she was driven away, she took another glance
at the lord, and thought that he did not look so old as when she had seen him at a greater distance.

But
she had failed altogether in her purpose of borrowing money from M. Le Gros. And for his sake
she regretted much that the attempt had been made.

She had already learned one or two details with reference to M. Le Gros. Though his manners and
appearance were so pleasant, he was only a subaltern about the theatre; and he was a subaltern
whom this lord and lessee called simply Le Gros. And from the melancholy nature of his face when
the application for money was made to him, she had learned that he
was both good-natured and impecunious.

Of herself, in regard to the money, she thought very little at the present moment. There were still six
weeks to run, and Rachel's nature was such that she could not distress herself six weeks in
advance of any misfortune. She was determined that she would not tell her father of her failure.
As for him, he would not probably say a word further of their want of money till the time
should come. He confined his prudence to keeping a sum in his pocket sufficient to take them back
to New York.

As the days went on which were to bring her engagement at "The Embankment"
to an end, Rachel heard a further rumour about herself.

Rumours did spring up at "The Embankment" to which she paid very little attention. She had heard
the same sort of things said as to other ladies at the theatre, and took them all as a matter
of course. Had she been asked, she would have attributed them all to Madame Socani; because Madame
Socani was the one person whom, next to Mr. Moss, she hated the most. The rumour in this case
simply stated that she had already been married to Mr. Jones, and had separated from her husband.
"Why do they care about such a matter as that?" she said to the female from whom she heard
the rumour. "It can't matter to me as a singer whether I have five
husbands."

"But it is so interesting," said the female, "when a lady has a husband and doesn't own him;
or when she owns him and hasn't really got him; it adds a piquancy to life, especially to theatrical
life, which does want these little assistances."

Then one evening Lord Castlewell did call upon her at "The Embankment." Her father was not with
her, and she was constrained by the circumstances of the moment to
see his lordship alone.

"I do feel, you know, Miss O'Mahony," he said, thus coming back for the moment into everyday
life, "that I am entitled to take an interest in you."

"Your lordship is very kind."

"I suppose you never heard of me before?"

"Not a word, my lord. I'm an American girl, and I know very little about English lords."

"I hope that you may come to know more.

My special métier in life brings me among the theatres.

I am very fond of music,--and perhaps a little fond of beauty also."

"I am glad you have the sense, my lord, to put music the first."

"I don't know about that. In regard to you I cannot say which predominates."

"You

are at liberty at any rate to talk about the one, as you are bidding
for it at your own theatre.

As to the other, you will excuse me for saying that it is a matter between me and my friends."

"Among
whom I trust before long I may be allowed to be counted."

The little dialogue had been carried on with smiles and good humour,
and Rachel now did not choose to interfere with them.

After all she was only a public singer, and as such was hardly entitled to the full consideration
of a gentlewoman. It was thus that she argued with herself. Nevertheless she had uttered her little
reprimand and had intended him to take it as such.

"You are coming to us, you know, after the holidays."

"And will bring my voice with me, such as it is."

"But not your smiles, you mean to say."

"They are sure to come with me, for I am always laughing,--unless
I am roused to terrible wrath.

I am sure that will not be the case at Covent Garden."

"I hope not. You will find that you have come among a set who are
quite prepared to accept you as a friend."

Here she made a little curtsy. "And now I have to offer my sincere apologies for the little
proposition I am about to make." It immediately occurred to her that M. Le Gros had betrayed
her. He was a very civil spoken, affable, kind old man; but he had betrayed her. "M. Le Gros
happened to mention that you were anxious to draw in advance for some portion of the salary coming
to you for the next two months."

M. Le Gros had at any rate betrayed her in the most courteous terms.

"Well, yes; M. Le Gros explained that the proposition was not selon les règles, and it does not
matter the least in the world."

"M. Le Gros has explained that?

I did not know that M. Le Gros had explained anything."

"Well, then, he looked it," said Rachel.

"His looks must be wonderfully expressive. He did not look it to me at all. He simply told me, as
one of the managers of the theatre, I was to let you have whatever
money you wanted.

And he did whisper to me,--may I tell you what he whispered?"

"I suppose you may. He seems to me to be a very good-natured kind of man."

"Poor old Le Gros!

A very good-natured man, I should say.

He doesn't carry the house, that's all."

"You do that." Then she remembered that the man was a lord.

"I ought to have said 'my lord,'" she said; "but I forgot. I hope you'll excuse me--my lord."

"We
are not very particular about that in theatrical matters; or, rather,
I am particular with some and not with others.

You'll learn all about it in process of time. M. Le Gros whispered that he thought there was not
the pleasantest understanding in the world between you and the people here."

"Well, no; there is not,--my lord."

"Bother the lord,--just now."

"With all my heart," said Rachel, who
could not avoid the little bit of fun which was here implied. "Not
but what the--the people here--would find me any amount of money I
chose to ask for. There are people, you see, one does not wish to
borrow money from. I take my salary here, but nothing more. The fact
is, I have not only taken it, but spent it, and to tell the truth,
I have not a shilling to amuse myself with during the dull season.
Mr. Moss knows all about it, and has simply asked how much I wanted.
'Nothing,' I replied, 'nothing at all; nothing at all.' And that's
how I am situated."

"No debts?"

"Not a dollar. Beyond that I shouldn't
have a dollar left to get out of London with." Then she remembered
herself,--that it was expedient that she should tell this man something
about herself. "I have got a father, you know, and he has to be paid
for as well as me. He is the sweetest, kindest, most generous father
that a girl ever had, and he could make lots of money for himself,
only the police won't let him."

"What do the police do to him?" said
Lord Castlewell.

"He is not a burglar, you know, or anything of that
kind."

"He is an Irish politician, isn't he?"

"He is very much of
a politician; but he is not an Irishman."

"Irish name," suggested
the lord.

"Irish name, yes; so are half the names in my country.
My father comes from the United States. And he is strongly impressed
with the necessity of putting down the horrid injustice with which
the poor Irish are treated by the monstrous tyranny of you English
aristocrats. You are very nice to look at."

"Thank you, Miss O'Mahony."

"But
you are very bad to go. You are not the kind of horses I care to drive
at all. Thieves, traitors, murderers, liars."

"Goodness gracious
me!" exclaimed the lord.

"I don't say anything for myself, because
I am only a singing girl, and understand nothing about politics. But
these are the very lightest words which he has at his tongue's end
when he talks about you. He is the most good-tempered fellow in the
world, and you would like him very much. Here is Mr. Moss." Mr. Moss
had opened the door and had entered the room.

The greeting between
the two men was closely observed by Rachel, who, though she was very
imprudent in much that she did and much that she said, never allowed
anything to pass by her unobserved. Mr. Moss, though he affected an
intimacy with the lord, was beyond measure servile. Lord Castlewell
accepted the intimacy without repudiating it, but accepted also the
servility. "Well, Moss, how are you getting on in this little house?"

"Ah,
my lord, you are going to rob us of our one attraction," and having
bowed to the lord he turned round and bowed to the lady.

"You have
no right to keep such a treasure in a little place like this."

"We
can afford to pay for it, you know, my lord. M. Le Gros came here
a little behind my back, and carried her off."

"Much to her advantage,
I should say."

"We can pay," said Mr. Moss.

"To such a singer as
Mademoiselle O'Mahony paying is not everything. An audience large
enough, and sufficiently intelligent to appreciate her, is something
more than mere money."

"We have the most intelligent audience in
all London," Mr. Moss said in defence of his own theatre.

"No doubt,"
said the lord. He had, during this little intercourse of compliments,
managed to write a word or two on a slip of paper, which he now handed
to Rachel--"Will £200 do?" This he put into her hand, and then left
her, saying that he would do himself the honour of calling upon her
again at her own lodgings, "where I shall hope," he said, "to make
the acquaintance of the most good-tempered fellow in the world." Then
he took his leave.

CHAPTER XXVII.

HOW FUNDS WERE PROVIDED.

Mr.
Moss at this interview again pressed his loan of money upon poor Rachel.

"You
cannot get on, my dear young lady, in this world without money. If
you have spent your income hitherto, what do you mean to do till the
end of November? At Covent Garden the salaries are all paid monthly."

There
was something so ineffably low and greasy in his tone of addressing
her, that it was impossible to be surprised at the disgust which she
expressed for him.

"Mr. Moss, I am not your dear young lady," she
said.

"Would that you were! We should be as happy as the day is long.
There would be no money troubles then." She could not fail to make
comparisons between him and the English nobleman who had just left
her, which left the Englishman infinitely superior; although, with
the few thoughts she had given to him, she had already begun to doubt
whether Lord Castlewell's morality stood very high. "What will you
do for money for the next three months? You cannot do without money,"
said Mr. Moss.

"I have already found a friend," said Rachel most
imprudently.

"What! his lordship there?"

"I am not bound to answer
any such questions."

"But I know; I can see the game is all up if
it has come to that. I am a fellow-workman, and there have been, and
perhaps will be, many relations between us. A hundred pounds advanced
here or there must be brought into the accounts sooner or later. That
is honest; that will bear daylight; no young lady need be ashamed
of that; even if you were Mrs. Jones you need not be ashamed of such
a transaction."

"I am not Mrs. Jones," said Rachel in great anger.

"But
if you were, Mr. Jones would have no ground of complaint, unless indeed
on the score of extravagance. But a present from this lord!"

"It
is no present. It does not come from the lord; it comes from the funds
of the theatre."

"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Mr. Moss. "Is that the little
game with which he attempts to cajole you? How has he got his hand
into the treasury of the theatre, so that he may be able to help you
so conveniently? You have not got the money yet, I suppose?"

"I have
not got his money--which may be dangerous, or yours--which would certainly
be more so.
The walls were smooth and unclimbable, and there was no break in them except at the point where
the tunnel ran in.

Jack returned from his swift search and peered down the tunnel. From the cool darkness he looked
out and saw a ring of brilliant light, the mouth of the outer cave. Suddenly a head shot into
the patch of blinding sunlight without. The head was covered with a yellow turban, and Jack
saw the Strangler slowly draw himself up and stand in the mouth of the cave. The big Malay
did not rush forward. Instead, he stood gazing curiously about, and then Jack understood. He
and his companions had left no track on the smooth hard rocks which paved the bottom of the
ravine, and their enemies were not certain in which cave they lay; each cave was being searched
in turn.

"Oh," thought Jack, "what would I not give for my handy little Mannlicher, and a good pocketful
of cartridges. I could hold an army at bay in this narrow tunnel. But they stripped me of every
weapon, even to my knife."

At this instant there flashed across his mind the thought of the dah carried by the younger
Panthay. He turned and found the man at his shoulder. Jack seized the thong by which the man
bore the weapon, and lifted it over the Panthay's head. The native made no resistance, but
gave up the sword at once.

Jack drew the weapon from its sheath and looked at it carefully in the dim light. He saw at
once by the bright gleam that it was in excellent order, and well polished. He tried the edge
with his thumb; it was as keen as a razor. He stepped back two or three paces to give himself
room to swing the blade, and flourished it about his head in order to find out its swing and
play. These, too, were perfect. So well balanced were the huge, broad blade and heavy handle,
that the great sword swung easily about Jack's head in his powerful young hands.

"By George!" thought he, "I'll make it warm for these rogues before I've done with them. If
I can't give it 'em hot in this narrow tunnel with this good bit of steel, I'm a Dutchman."

He stepped forward and peered once more down the tunnel. He started. Saya Chone was climbing
up, and after him came three or four figures in blue kilts. Jack had seen such before, and
knew them for tough, wiry, hard-bitten little Kachins, small men, but immensely muscular and
powerful. Behind him he heard a sound as of a withered leaf blowing along the floor. He turned
his head and saw the two Panthays fleeing to the uttermost part of the cave. They trembled
before these terrible enemies.

At this moment the Panthay tracker climbed into the cave. He spoke for a few moments to Saya
Chone, pointing to the tunnel where Jack stood, but where in the darkness no one could see
him. Saya Chone nodded, and the whole party moved forward until they were within a couple of
yards of the mouth of the tunnel. Now Saya Chone began to speak.

"Haydon," he called in a loud voice. "Come out at once. The game is up. We know you are within
there. You have left a score of signs in the outer cave to show whither you have retreated.
Come out, I tell you."

He ceased, and stood as if awaiting a reply, but Jack made no answer. He meant to give his
enemies no idea of the point where he had stationed himself. Again the half-caste's voice rang out.

"I will give you one minute again to come out," he called, "and then, if you do not appear,
I shall send in those who will fetch you out more roughly than you will like."

Jack made no answer, but went down on one knee to give himself plenty of room to strike overhead
in the combat which was now near at hand.

The minute passed, and Saya Chone called out some orders to the savage little men in blue,
who were now hovering about the mouth of the tunnel as if burning to rush in to the assault.
Upon the orders being given, three Kachins started forward.

Jack saw them clearly against the bright light outside, and his heart swelled with rage and
fierce anger. Not because each man held in his hand his broad and glittering dah. Oh, no. That
was all in the game, and Jack was willing to give and take in the struggle between man and
man, out-numbered as he was. But each man had now drawn out a coil of fine rope and slung it
about his left arm. Jack saw that shameful bonds were being prepared once more for his free
limbs, and his heart burned with fury.

"I'll die fighting before they shall tie me up again," breathed Jack to himself, and he clutched
still more tightly the heavy dah. Then he drew a short, sharp breath, and held himself ready,
every nerve strung up to its highest tension, every muscle braced and ready for action.

The Kachins were coming. Already their figures darkened the mouth of the tunnel.

CHAPTER XXVI.

THE RESOLVE OF BUCK AND JIM.

We must now return to Buck and Jim, whom we left in great perplexity at the village festival,
wondering what had become of their young leader.

At the moment that Jack was dragged into the bushes by the Buddhist monk, who was not really
a monk at all, but one of Saya Chone's followers in disguise, and the dancing girl, who was
Saya Chone himself, Buck was within a dozen yards of them, looking all about for Jack. But
he saw nothing of his young master, because a group of people, also in Saya Chone's pay, covered
the movements by which Jack was drugged and carried off by his enemies.

"Thunder and mud," growled Buck. "Where's Jack got to? I left him here not five minutes ago,
laughing over this picture."

At this moment Dent came up.

"Where's Jack?" said he quickly.

"I don't know, and that's the square-toed truth," replied Buck. "P'raps he's rambled off in
a different direction."

The two comrades began to move swiftly about in search of their young leader. They kept together,
for, with their knowledge of the country, they felt uneasy at once, and were not willing to
separate, lest each might not find the other again. They found Me Dain, and set him to hunt
in every direction. They found the headman, and he seemed bewildered at the idea that Jack
had disappeared. He gave, or seemed to give, them every assistance possible in their search,
but within an hour the two comrades were looking at each other very blankly. Jack had gone.
There was no sign of him from end to end of the village, but how or where he had gone was a
completely impenetrable mystery.

Buck and Jim and the Burman gathered in the hut which had been assigned to them, and held a
council of war.

"Say," muttered Buck uneasily, "this beats the band. What's come to Jack?"

Jim Dent shook his head, and made no reply for a moment.

"Well, Buck," he said at last, "there's one thing quite certain; he hasn't gone on his own
account."

"Sure thing," replied Buck.

"And if he's been nabbed in some mysterious fashion or another, we're pretty certain who's
got hold of him," pursued Jim, and Buck nodded with a blank face.

At the next instant Jim's suspicions were confirmed by the Burman.

"Well," grunted Me Dain, "U Saw got both now, for sure, both young master and old master."

"What makes you think that, Me Dain?" cried Buck. "Have you seen or heard anything?"

"Nothing, nothing," replied the Burman, waving his hand. "But what else can be? They catch
him and take him off. Oh yes, sure to be."

"After all, it would only be in line with plenty of things we've heard of, Buck," remarked
Jim Dent, and again Buck had to give a sorrowful nod.

"Well," said Buck, in a decided voice, "s'pose we put it at that. In some fashion or other
he's been kidnapped by the people who kidnapped his father. Let it go at that. Then, next thing
is, what are we going to do?"

"I'll bet I know what you're going to do, Buck, my son," said Jim Dent, with a dry chuckle.
"You'll follow on a bit and see what's happened to father and son, or I'm making a big mistake."

"You're quite right, Jim," said Buck Risley. "I don't hold with backin' down on a pardner,
and I'm goin' along to see what's happened to the Professor and Jack just as far as I can crawl."

"And I'm with you, old man," said Jim quietly. "I owe Jack my life, too. One good turn deserves
another."

"And me, sahibs, and me," said Me Dain quickly. "The young sahib save my life also when the
dacoit thought to chop off my head. I go with you everywhere to help the two sahibs."

"Bully for you, Me Dain, you're a good sort," cried Buck, and he thrust his hand out to the
Burman. Me Dain, highly delighted to receive the white man's sign of friendship, shook hands
very solemnly with both Buck and Jim, and they formed at once a confraternity of three to hunt
up U Saw's quarters, and see where he held the prisoners, whom they now firmly believed to
be in his grasp.

CHAPTER XXVII.

THE FIGHT IN THE TUNNEL.

We must now return to Jack, whom we left crouching at the end of the tunnel which led to the
outer cave, and awaiting the onslaught of three powerful Kachins.

As the natives drew step by step along the tunnel towards Jack, he balanced the great broadsword
he held by both hands, and poised it ready to strike at the foremost. Though he was greatly
out-numbered, yet he held one advantage. The forms of his enemies were clear against the sunlight
which poured into the mouth of the outer cave. He could see every movement they made, but they
could not see him. The inner cave was very dimly lighted, and, coming from the bright light
without, his enemies could not mark that Jack was waiting for them.

A second advantage he enjoyed was that they did not know that he was armed. They knew that
they had stripped him of every weapon when he was first seized, and now they did not dream
that he had secured a dah for himself, and was thoroughly resolved to make the deadliest use
of it before he would submit to capture.

On crept the Kachins in the boldest fashion, urged forward not merely by their native bravery,
but convinced that they had before them the simplest of tasks, the seizing of an unarmed lad
who would surrender at sight of their weapons.

At the next moment they were terribly undeceived. Fetching a sweeping blow, Jack cut down the
leading Kachin with a terrific stroke. The edge of the keen, heavy blade fell at the point
where neck and shoulder meet, and the doomed man was nearly cut in two. He dropped with a single
groan, and the two men behind caught him by the feet and dragged him swiftly back.

Jack drew a deep breath, regained his heavy weapon, and poised it anew. But for the moment
he was left in peace. The group in the outer cave had gathered about the fallen man. They uttered
loud cries of surprise when they saw the deep and dreadful wound he had received with such
terrible force from the dah. "Dah! dah!" Jack heard the name of the native sword pass from
lip to lip, and knew that they had recognised by what weapon that frightful slicing blow was
delivered.

But in another moment he recognised how grim and fell were these people who were his foes.
As coolly as though it were but a dog that Jack had slain with that tremendous blow, the Strangler
lifted the dead Kachin and tossed him carelessly aside. Saya Chone said a sharp word, and a
fresh man stepped forward, drawing his dah with a grin as he was ordered to join his companions
in a fresh assault. Jack knew these little men in blue kilts to be brave to desperation, utterly
careless of life, either their own or another's, and he braced himself once more for the struggle.

But this time the Kachins came on in different order, and in a different fashion. A sudden
flare of yellow light filled the tunnel, and Jack saw that two men marched ahead, each with
his dah ready to strike, and that behind them the third man held a flaming torch. He saw at
once how cunning was the trick. The glare would flash over the assailant's shoulders straight
into his eyes, confusing him, while they would be lighted perfectly to the attack.

In a second Jack had devised a plan of meeting this danger. He dropped his dah over his left
arm, bent and seized a huge pebble from the floor. He poised the stone for an instant, then
flung it with great power. At this short range he struck the mark to a hair, and his mark was
the grinning face of the Kachin who carried the torch, and rejoiced that his friends would
now make short work of the fierce young Feringhee who had hidden in the cave.

The dark face of the native was wrinkled with a savage smile, and all his gums were on view
when the heavy stone struck into his open mouth with a crash of splintering teeth. The first
pebble was followed by a second, which took him between the eyes. Stunned and blinded, he reeled
back and dropped the torch. His comrades, bereft of their guiding light, upon which they had
counted so much, hesitated for a moment and hung upon the next step. There was no hesitation
with Jack. Things stood at too desperate a pass with him that he should let things hang in
the wind. No sooner did he see the Kachin with the torch reel back and drop the firebrand,
than he swung his weapon on high and darted at the two men who had halted in the tunnel. As
he did so he let out a mighty shout. Shout and blow fell together on the hesitating Kachins.
Both thrust their dahs forward to parry the unseen assault.

Jack's weapon fell with a ringing clash of steel across the dah of the leading man, beat it
down, went on, and bit deeply into the Kachin's skull. The latter reeled against his companion
and clutched him. For a second they swayed, then both men fell heavily together to the ground.

Lying helpless as they were at his feet, it was a mere matter of a couple of blows for him
to utterly destroy both, and so lessen the number of his enemies. But Jack could not strike
fallen men. He returned to his own end of the tunnel, and allowed them to creep back to the
outer cave, the wounded man crawling slowly after his friends.

This second repulse seemed to put Saya Chone and the Strangler beside themselves with fury.
They screamed invective and insult against Jack, and threatened him with the most frightful
penalties when he should fall into their hands. Both had a perfect command of some of the worst
language in English that Jack had ever heard, but he took it all for what it was worth, clutched
his faithful broadsword tighter still, and waited to see what their next attempt would be.
He still cherished a hope of escape. He had crippled pretty well half of the attacking force,
and if he could but hold them off till darkness came, there might be an opportunity of escape
in the moonless night.

"There were only four Kachins with them," thought Jack, "and the natives they have picked up
from the neighbouring village may be dismissed as fighting men, if they are anything like the
chaps who are somewhere behind me here. The half-caste and the Malay seem to keep out of the
scrimmages. If I only have a bit more luck, I can chew them up enough perhaps to make them
sheer off and leave me alone."

As far as appearances went, they were leaving him alone now. But Jack knew that appearances
are too often deceitful. The outer cave looked perfectly empty. Neither sign nor sound of human
presence was given. Saya Chone and the Strangler had gone away, leaping down from the mouth
of the outer cave to the ravine. But Jack was certain that the unwounded Kachins were still
lurking in the cave out of his sight, and he had no intention whatever of creeping out and
engaging in a hand-to-hand struggle with the iron-limbed little mountaineers. Fully half an
hour passed in this profound silence. Jack kept the sharpest look-out, but could catch no sign
to show that his lair was still watched.

"If they can wait," thought Jack, "so can I. I'll not stir an inch from my cover, however silent
they may be."

At that instant he caught a sharp, low cry of surprise behind him. He whirled round swiftly,
for in his intentness he had actually forgotten the two Panthays, his fellow-prisoners. With
a gasp of relief, Jack found that it was the elder Panthay who had called out. The two men
had been crouching in a corner of the inner cave, and had given no sign of their presence while
Jack struggled with his foes. Now one was calling out, and both were pointing upwards.

Jack took a step back from the mouth of the tunnel and looked aloft. The rift in the rock forty
feet above, which lighted the cave, was obscured and darkened. In a moment he saw that the
gap was filled with a human body, and that a Panthay was peering down upon them.

"What's this game?" thought Jack. "They've climbed up to that hole, but unless I obligingly
stand under it, and let them drop a stone on my head, I don't see what they get by it."

Little did the heroic lad dream of the fearful use to which his enemies meant to put the rift
in the rock high above him.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

THE RUSE OF SAYA CHONE.

In a moment the native drew back, and Jack jumped to cover as he saw a dark object come whirling
through the rift and fall straight into the cave. But the thing flung in was harmless enough
in appearance, a mere bundle of dried grass bound loosely with a shred of creeper. Then, thick
and fast, bundle after bundle was hurled into the cave, dried reeds, more grass, big loose
splinters of pine, fat with resin, withered brushwood, and the like.

Down they came, thicker and faster, until a great pile of this rubbish was heaped on the floor
of the cave. Jack was staring wonderingly at this novel method of attack by flinging rubbish
apparently at large, when once more the Panthay above thrust his head through the rift and
spoke a few words, his voice ringing down hollow into the depths where the three prisoners
stood. Jack did not understand what was said, but he saw that the effect on his companions
was most extraordinary.

They sprang to their feet, and, braving all the terrors of Saya Chone, whose name had appeared
so dreadful to them, they darted for the tunnel, brushed swiftly by Jack, and were gone. The
English lad watched them eagerly. He saw them fly down the outer cave, leap wildly into the
ravine, and disappear. A minute later he saw them cross his field of view as they climbed the
opposite bank. They were going like the wind, and there seemed not the slightest attempt made
to stop them, nor was the faintest sound of pursuit to be heard.

"All the same," murmured Jack to himself, "I don't think I shall follow you, my nimble friends.
It's pretty certain you've been allowed to go in peace in the hopes of drawing me out as well.
I hardly fancy I should be permitted to pass so quietly. Well, I'm thankful the poor beggars
have got away in safety. But what scared them so frightfully? They went like rabbits bolting
from a hole when the ferrets have been put in. There seems nothing very terrifying about this
heap of rubbish."

But was there not? was there not? Ten seconds later Jack was ready to take his words back,
and acknowledge that heap of rubbish to be a very terrible and awful weapon in the hands of
his enemies. Something flashed above him, and he glanced up to see a flaming torch hurled through
the rift. It did not, however, fall into the heap of light inflammable materials awaiting it.
It struck against a projecting point of rock, was turned aside, and fell almost at Jack's feet.
He stamped the flame out swiftly with his boot.

But his breath came fast and short, and his brave face paled as he saw the frightful cunning
of this master-trick. He had luckily quenched one torch, but he could not be sure of quenching
the next and the next. One of them had but to fall into the mass of reeds, canes, dry grass,
and withered brushwood, to cause a swift, fierce flame to run through the whole mass.

This, then, it was which the Panthays had learned from their fellow who looked down from the
rift. The Englishman was to be roasted out, and they were warned of the fearful fate about
to befall him. Before this vision of horrors they had fled, the greater fear conquering the less.

Jack stood looking up at the rift with blanched face, and teeth set like a steel-trap. His
heart gave another jerk within him. A second torch flashed through the rift. But this time
the torch whirled flaming through the air, and fell at the mouth of the tunnel, within a yard
of Jack's foot. He stamped it out. A second torch followed, almost in the same place. He stamped
this out too. He looked eagerly to see where the next would fall.

It seemed extraordinary fortune that not one of them should fall in the midst of the waiting
heap. Then he heard a low, evil, chuckling laugh from someone beside the rift, and he understood.
Saya Chone was there, playing with him, as a cat plays with a mouse. The half-caste was tossing
torches within Jack's reach, simply to torture him with the idea of what would happen when
one of the flaming splinters of pine fell into the heap of tinder awaiting it.

Five minutes of perfect silence passed, and not another torch fell. To Jack the time seemed
like five years rather. He cast swift alternate glances at the rift above and through the tunnel,
where he felt that enemies waited and watched for the opportunity the fire might give them.

And now a great flare appeared in the rift. A huge bundle of reeds, blazing fiercely, was thrust
in, and dropped. His enemies meant now to fire the pile and bring the play to an end. The flaming
mass rolled slowly down the steep face of the cliff within, and Jack was torn in a fierce dilemma
as to what was the best course for him to follow. Should he leave the mouth of the tunnel and
try to beat out the flames with the broad blade of his dah, or should he not?

But if he left the tunnel, then he would give up the key of the situation, and be swiftly surrounded.
If he did not, the roasting flame and the masses of billowing smoke would render the inner
cave untenable. Yet, before the bundle of reeds had rolled down to the mass below, the question
had been settled for him.

A second and a third faggot, each blazing fiercely, and each directed towards a fresh part
of the heap, were flung through the rift.

"I can't stop all three," thought Jack. "The pile must burn."

Within a few seconds it was burning in very truth; the fire ran through the heap of light combustibles
with magical power and swiftness. Scarce had the first bunch of burning reeds fallen, than
a vast scorching flame was leaping up and roaring towards the rift, while a powerful current
of air was drawn through the tunnel and fanned Jack's face.

"What's this?" thought Jack; "they reckoned without the draught, I fancy. It looks as if I
shall be no worse off than before. It's very hot, certainly, but with this rush of air through
the tunnel I can manage all right."

But he soon found that his enemies had not made any miscalculation. For five minutes the air
rushed fiercely past Jack, fanning the tremendous flame which leapt from the blazing pile and
carrying it upwards to the rift, then it began to slacken, and the flame, instead of roaring
upwards to a point, began to sink, and spread its wide red wings abroad in the cave, fluttering
from one side to the other.

Jack looked upwards with a sinking heart: the rift was closed. It had been left open till a
terrific fire had burned up, and now it was blocked, and the whole of the heat and the smoke
was pent up in the cave; and Jack was pent up, too, in this roasting inferno.

CHAPTER XXIX.

THE TORTURE BY FIRE.

For some time Jack was but little troubled with the smoke. It billowed up and up, and rolled
in huge clouds about the lofty roof. But gradually the cave filled, and Jack saw that with
every moment the smoke came lower and lower, threatening to fill the cave from the floor to
roof and choke the life out of him. A cloud whirled about him and was gone again. But it left
Jack coughing and half-choked, so pungent and keen was the whiff which he had drawn into his lungs.

Thicker and thicker rose the clouds of smoke as the fire burned, for, cunningly intermingled
with the dried tinder of the canes and reeds, his enemies had flung great bunches of fresh-cut
boughs. The green wood of the latter, roasting and spluttering with sap in the midst of the
roaring fire, threw out vast rolling clouds of choking smoke.

The freshest air was still at the mouth of the tunnel, and here Jack crouched, his head as
low as possible, for he knew that the last fresh air would be found nearest to the floor. He
was resolved not to go out. His stubborn British blood was aflame at the thought of being placed
afresh in bonds, and he was ready to face the fiery torture within rather than creep out and
give his enemies the joy of knowing that he was beaten, and of seeing him surrender.

Hope, too, was not yet dead in his heart. The heap of blazing brushwood was at some distance
from him, for the rift was at the other side of the cave. If he could but set his teeth and
endure this agony of fire until the heap had burned out, he would not be forced from his post.

But at that instant the fire reached several great faggots of green palm branches, and fresh
clouds of aromatic smoke rolled out still thicker and faster than before. A swirl of the air
currents within the cave sent a thick billowing mass full on the spot where Jack crouched.
The brave lad felt that he was choking, that his senses were deserting him, as he drew, involuntarily,
the pungent, biting smoke into his lungs.

He flung himself on his face, coughed out the smoke he had swallowed, and caught one refreshing
gasp of sweet air blowing up the tunnel. Then the fresh air was driven back by the huge billow
of smoke, and the heavy clouds settled about Jack. He could not have moved now had he wished.
He was the prey of the thick suffocating smoke, and a swift merciful unconsciousness fell upon
him and put an end to the agonies he had so nobly endured.

When Jack came to himself again, the first thing he knew was that he had failed to keep himself
out of the clutch of his enemies. When he opened his bleared and smarting eyes and looked round,
he saw the dark face of Saya Chone straight before him. The half-caste said nothing, only grinned
in evil joy, and Jack closed his eyes again with a groan of despair. He felt that he was once
more in bonds, though they were not so close and galling as before. He was dripping wet, and
his eyes pained him cruelly.

He lay still for a few instants, then pulled himself together, jerked himself into a sitting
position, and looked round boldly, determined to put the best face possible on the situation,
and not give the half-caste the joy of gloating over an enemy who acknowledged himself beaten.

He found he was in the outer cave, and through the tunnel he could see plainly the glow of
the fire still blazing in the inner recess. But no smoke came this way. Clearly the rift had
been opened, and the fire was pulling up towards the natural vent. Jack looked round and saw
that he was in the midst of a pool of water; he supposed that it had been flung upon him to
bring him to.

"Well," said Saya Chone at last, "are you not going to thank me for saving the life you seemed
obstinately bent upon throwing away? If I had not been able to order a couple of fellows, as
careless of their lives as you of yours, to go into the smoke and drag you out, it would have
been all over with you by now."

Jack made no answer. He did not so much as trouble to look at Saya Chone. He ignored him entirely,
and glanced down at the fetters which confined his limbs. He found that his ankles were bound
together with light and slender links of steel, a steel ring encircling each ankle, and similar
fetters bound his wrists. At first glance it seemed as if these light bonds might easily be
broken, but Jack gave up that idea very soon. He saw that they were the work of a very cunning
and skilful craftsman, highly wrought and beautifully tempered, slight in appearance, but immensely
strong.

A head now came in sight outside. It was the Strangler, and he called out a few words to Saya
Chone. The half-caste had been sitting with his hand in the breast of his jacket. He now drew
it out and showed that the butt of a heavy revolver had been in his clasp. He pointed the weapon
at Jack's heart.

"I must beg of you to get up, my lord," he said, in tones of sneering deference. "Your conveyance
awaits you outside the cave."

When he saw that Jack hesitated to obey, he gave a shrill whistle. A couple of Kachins at once
sprang up at the mouth of the cave. Sooner than be handled by these evil little ruffians, Jack
now got up and shuffled slowly down the cave, his fetters allowing him to move about ten inches
at a stride. But this, however, did not save him from their hands. At the mouth of the cave
the two Kachins and the Malay seized upon him and swung him down to the bed of the ravine.
Here a strong pony was waiting, and when Jack's ankles had been freed, he was tossed astride
and the reins put in his hands.

The half-caste followed him at every step with the revolver, nor did he put the weapon away
until the Strangler had once more locked the fetters which bound Jack's ankles together. This
he did with a small key, and, as the links of steel were brought under the pony's barrel from
one foot of the prisoner to the other, Jack was securely tethered to the animal.

CHAPTER XXX.

THE STRONGHOLD OF THE RUBY KING.

As soon as Jack was mounted, Saya Chone and the Malay also got to their saddles, and the party
moved off down the ravine. Save for his fetters, Jack rode as usual, but the two Kachins, one
on either side, held his pony by stout thongs of raw hide, fastened in the bridle. At his heels
trotted the two leaders, and Jack knew that both were well armed.

On the journey that followed it is not necessary to dwell, for it was quite uneventful. They
travelled steadily till dusk, when they halted in a small village where Jack was assigned a
hut, and a strict watch was kept over him at every moment. The next morning the journey was
resumed at earliest dawn, and now they held their way for mile after mile through wild, gloomy
passes between lofty mountains, where no sign of human life or cultivated fields was to be
seen. Hour after hour they pushed on through this deserted hill country, until, late in the
afternoon, they topped a stony ridge, and Jack gave a sharp exclamation of surprise.

Below him the ground fell away steeply to a small and fertile valley with a river running down
its midst, and fields of paddy and plantain lining the course of the stream. Groves of palmyra,
and teak, and palms were dotted about the scene, and in the midst of the valley rose a tall
house of stone. Instinctively Jack felt that they had reached their journey's end, and that
before him was the goal he had set himself to win, the stronghold of U Saw, the Ruby King.
But how different was his approach from that he had hoped to make! Instead of advancing upon
it in company of his trusty friends, he was marching in as a prisoner, fettered hand and foot.

Jack fixed his eyes eagerly on the great house below as another idea sprang to his mind. Was
his father there? Had his quest been in vain, and was Thomas Haydon far away from this lonely
valley set among the wild hills? But Jack believed that his father was there; everything seemed
to point to it. Well, he would soon know, one way or the other.

The path now ran through a native village, whose slender huts of reed and cane bordered both
sides of the narrow way. The people ran to their doors to gaze upon the passers-by, and Jack
knew them for Kachins. He recognised the short, dark, sturdy forms of the men. Beside the latter,
women in embroidered kilts, with big, queer head-dresses, and brown, naked, nimble children,
came to look upon the sahib who rode into their valley, the captive of their lord and master,
U Saw.

The village was passed and a grove of palms was entered. Beyond the palms the land ran smooth
and open to the front of the great strong house of stone which U Saw had built to keep himself
and his treasures safe.

The cavalcade halted before a strong gate formed of huge bars and beams of teak, and in another
moment half of the gate was flung open by a pair of blue-kilted Kachins. Jack's pony was led
inside, and the English lad now found himself in a large courtyard beside the house. The walls
of the courtyard were formed of great logs of teak, and round them ran rows of thatched huts
built against the palisade. These, as Jack learned afterwards, were used as the lodgings of
the strong body of retainers whom U Saw kept about his person, his bodyguard.

Only one small door opened upon the courtyard from the house, and towards this Jack's pony
was led. The Malay unlocked the fetters which bound Jack's feet, and he was hauled roughly
to the ground.

"March in," said Saya Chone, and pointed to the small, narrow, dark doorway. Jack went in,
staring hard into the dark before him, and wondering what fate would befall him in this great,
lonely house to which he had been led in so strange a fashion, and through such wild adventures.
He found himself in a small, dusky hall, lighted only by one tiny window, and that heavily
barred with iron. The door was now closed and bolted behind him, and he was taken up a narrow
flight of tortuous stairs. Then he was conducted along a maze of narrow passages, being led
now and again through doors which Saya Chone unlocked and carefully locked again after them.
The stone walls, the iron bars which covered every opening, the narrow passages, the locked
doors, all told of the caution of U Saw, he who trusted no one, and suspected all.

At last they arrived before a narrow door, heavily banded with iron, and fastened by a huge
bar of teak. Before it squatted a little man in blue, with a big naked dah across his knees.
Saya Chone spoke to him and it sounded like a password, for the man sprang to his feet and
stepped aside. The great bar of teak was drawn from its staples, and the door was opened. The
Malay thrust Jack into the room, and the door was at once closed and barred behind him.

Jack now found himself in a bare stone cell, lighted only by one small window eight feet or
more from the ground. There was nothing in the place save a small bench in one corner, and
he sat down on this and awaited the next movement of his captors. For full three hours he sat
there, and had begun to wonder whether they had forgotten him, when the door was suddenly opened
and the Strangler appeared, attended by a couple of the bodyguard. The Malay beckoned to Jack
to come forward, and the latter went.

He was now led into a large room, where a tall, stout man sat on a heap of rich cushions, and
Jack knew by the deference paid to him that the latter was U Saw, the Ruby King. The room was
lighted by a couple of large lamps, for the dusk had fallen, and the English lad was led into
the bright light and placed before the Ruby King.

The latter looked steadily at Jack, and Jack returned the stare with interest. The Ruby King
had a huge, gross face, thick-lipped and evil-eyed. He was dressed splendidly in a rich embroidered
jacket of pink silk, a silken kilt striped in red and white, and a huge pink gaung-baung on
his head; in the front of his head-dress blazed a magnificent ruby.

He looked long and keenly at Jack, and the latter thought that U Saw was going to speak to
him, but the Ruby King said nothing, and at last waved his hand. Upon this Jack was led aside
by the Malay and made to sit down upon a large, heavy chair near the right-hand wall. All this
was done in perfect silence, and for some minutes Jack sat there waiting, while U Saw seemed
to forget his presence, and rested upon the pile of cushions with head bent as if in deep thought.

Suddenly the Strangler, who had been moving to and fro, disappeared behind Jack's chair. Jack
was about to turn his head to keep an eye on his enemy's movements, when he felt a soft silken
band slipped swiftly over his head and tightened about his shoulders. At the same instant a
couple of attendants flung themselves upon him and held him down tightly in the chair.

Jack tried to throw them off and wrench himself free, but his hands had never been unfettered,
and he was easily mastered. In a trice he found himself securely lashed to the heavy chair,
and then felt another broad band of silk drawn over his mouth. Coolly and methodically the
Strangler gagged him in so skilful a fashion that he could not utter a sound, though he was
able to breathe quite easily. When both bonds and gag were secure he was released from the
grip of the men who had held him down, and the attendants and the Malay stepped aside.

The next movement puzzled Jack beyond measure. A muslin curtain, running on a light bamboo
rod, was drawn before him, thus cutting him off from the main body of the apartment. With the
exception that he had been firmly seized and held down while the Strangler bound him, Jack
had not been roughly treated, and he was quite free to turn his head from side to side and
mark all that went on.

In a few moments the Ruby King raised his hand. As if in response to the signal an attendant
struck one deep booming rolling note on a great gong. Jack looked eagerly to see what would
follow. And that which did follow held him spell-bound with amazement and wonder.

A door opened and Saya Chone came in. Jack recognised him at once, for the delicate filmy veil
of muslin which hung just before him was so slight in texture that he could see through it
easily and make out all that went on in the light of the lamps. But the part of the room where
he was a prisoner was unlighted, and the veil served to hide him sufficiently from anyone standing
in the brighter part of the place. Saya Chone came forward and conversed with U Saw for a few
moments, then a second note was struck upon the resounding gong.

Again the door opened, and a couple of Kachins came in, leading a man between them, a tall,
thin man with grey hair and pale face. Jack's heart leapt within him, and he felt suffocating
under his gag. Yes, there was his father, there he was. They had been right in their suspicions
all the time. Thomas Haydon had been carried off by the men who served the Ruby King.

Jack's heart swelled within him at sight of that well-known form and face, and he strained
every muscle against his bonds. But he had been secured too strongly, and his efforts were
utterly in vain. He could only stare and stare at the old familiar figure, and long for the
moment when his gag should be loosed and he could acquaint his father with his presence. He
wondered whether his father would see him through the curtain, but he felt sure at the next
moment that it was impossible. He was seated in a dusky corner, and his father stood full in
the light of the lamps.

What an end was this to his quest! He had set out to find his father. He had found him: they
stood within a few yards of each other. But he had found him a prisoner in cruel and merciless
hands which now also held Jack captive. What an end to all his fine dreams of rescuing his
father! What a mockery of his hopes! As these thoughts thronged through Jack's mind, Saya Chone
began to speak. Jack was at once all attention to the words of the half-caste.

"Well, Mr. Haydon," began the latter, "you have now had several days to know whether you are
more inclined to be reasonable. You have only, you know, to write down on a scrap of paper
the bearings of the place where you found the big ruby, and then you are free to go where you
please."

There was silence for a moment, then Mr. Haydon replied. How the well-known tones thrilled
Jack through and through as they fell on his ear!

"Exactly," said Thomas Haydon, in a tone of quiet but bitter scorn. "I have only to give up
the interests which were confided to my hands, to prove myself a traitor to those who trusted
me, and then you say I may go. I take leave to doubt the latter statement. In any case, I shall
certainly not do as you wish."

"You still refuse to disclose the secret of the ruby-mine you found?"

"I do."

"It would be better, I think, for you to reconsider that decision," said the half-caste, in
his cold, cruel voice. "There are ways, you know, of making people speak, however obstinate
they may be."

"You refer to torture, without doubt," said Mr. Haydon, in as cool a tone as though he were
speaking on the most indifferent subject. "Well, I do not wish to boast, but I hardly think
you will get anything out of me that way."

"Why, there I am inclined to agree with you," said the half-caste, in his silkiest tones. "That
is to say, so far as applying torture to yourself personally is concerned. You are a stubborn
Englishman, and that means you will cheerfully die before you give in; is it not so?"

"Then, if you think it useless to deal with me in such fashion, why enter upon talk of it?"
demanded Mr. Haydon.

"Oh," said the half-caste, "such a thing may be useful yet. If you were careless about torture
applied to yourself, you might see it in another light when brought to bear on someone to whom
you were attached?"

Mr. Haydon gave a scornful laugh. "And where will you find such a person in this den of thieves?"
he asked, drily.

Upon this reply, Saya Chone and U Saw burst into a great shout of mocking laughter. They rolled
to and fro in their mirth, and the room rang again with their hideous merriment. Mr. Haydon
looked from one to the other, his brow knitted in puzzled wonder.

But behind the curtain Jack's heart had sunk very low indeed, and a light of terror had come
into his eyes. Now he saw at a flash why the half-caste had carried him off, and pursued him
so closely and fiercely, yet without doing him the least harm. It had puzzled Jack a score
of times why Saya Chone had not killed him, and so put an end to any further trouble, but now
he saw the whole plan only too clearly.

By this time the Ruby King knew the character of Thomas Haydon, and had learned that neither
threats nor force had power to sway him from his duty in order to save himself. But what if
his only son, his boy Jack, was exposed to a like danger: would that not break down his iron
resolution?

The terror which had come into Jack's eyes was not for himself, not for an instant. But he
saw at once what the arch-rogues meant to do, to put pressure upon his father through him.
And Jack felt sick at heart to think that he had won the thing he had longed for, that he had
gained his father's side, and yet he came only as an added difficulty to a cruel situation.

"You have a son, I think, Mr. Haydon?" began Saya Chone again, in his purring tones.

"How do you know that?" replied Thomas Haydon.

"Oh, we know many things," replied the half-caste lightly. "We have even heard of your only
son, Jack Haydon."

Mr. Haydon made no reply.

"You would, I suppose, be very unwilling to see any harm happen to him?"

"Thank God!" cried Thomas Haydon fervently, "that, at any rate, is far beyond your power. He
is safe at home in England."

Again the mocking laughter burst out in redoubled volume until the rafters rang again. The
Ruby King and Saya Chone enjoyed their mirth to the full, then the half-caste sprang to his
feet, and pointed with glittering eyes and laughing face to the soft white muslin veil.

"Look there! Thomas Haydon," he cried, "look there!"

CHAPTER XXXI.

FATHER AND SON.

Mr. Haydon turned his calm, steady eyes on the filmy curtain, but he could see nothing. Then,
as he gazed quietly at it, U Saw raised his hand, and a deep booming note resounded from the
gong. The full, musical trembling of the note still rang through the room when an unseen hand
drew back the curtain, and the light of the lamps fell full upon Jack.

Thomas Haydon stood for a moment with the wild, distraught look of one who sees a sight altogether
beyond belief or reason, then he made to spring forward. But he was chained to the Kachins
who stood upon either side of him, and two more leapt forward from their posts by the wall
to check his movements. And again the mocking laughter of his enemies filled the room.

But Thomas Haydon had neither eyes nor ears for them. He could only stare and stare upon his
son as if he found it impossible to believe the evidence of his own sight. At last he spoke.

"Jack!" he said in a tone of wonder beyond all wonder, "Jack, is it you?"

Jack could not reply, for the gag effectually checked his utterance, but he nodded, and his
eyes spoke for him.

"My son here," murmured Thomas Haydon again, and a bitter groan broke from him. He could not
restrain it; this last stroke was utterly beyond all human endurance. When his son had been
mentioned by his unscrupulous enemy, his thoughts had flown thousands and thousands of miles,
far away from the hot, glaring East, with its mysteries and dangers, to the cool, quiet English
meadows amid which lay Rushmere School, where his only son, as he believed, worked and played
in safety.

And all the time Jack was within a few yards of him, hidden, a prisoner, behind the muslin
curtain. How he had got there, how he had fallen into the terrible hands of U Saw, were the
most insoluble of mysteries to the elder man, and he could only stare at his son with a white
and ghastly face, for he knew only too well the character of the men in whose power they both lay.

The jeering voice of the half-caste broke out on a high note of derision. "And is there no
one among this den of thieves for whom you care, Mr. Haydon?" he cried. "If there is not, what
an unnatural parent you must be!"

A deep guttural chuckle from U Saw echoed this speech. The Ruby King said never a word from
first to last. He sat on his cushions as one enjoying the play. His gross face was filled with
an evil joy, his small dark cunning eyes twinkled for ever with laughter at the scene which
was enacted before him, but he maintained, except for his laughter, a perfect silence, and
there was something terribly uncanny and threatening about this.

"Where has he come from?" asked Thomas Haydon, in a low and troubled voice. Yes, it was Jack,
bound there; he was compelled to believe his own eyes at last. It was not an hallucination;
it was a piece of dreadful fact, and in it the elder man saw his difficulties trebled upon
the spot.

"Oh, as to that, he will have plenty of opportunity to tell you himself in a short time," smiled
the half-caste. "We shall shut you up together to talk things over. In the meantime, another
piece of work demands U Saw's attention."

He waved his hand and the Kachins led Thomas Haydon aside and placed him against the farther
wall. There was a shuffle of feet at the door, and three or four natives from the village brought
in a man whose hands were bound behind his back. They were followed by at least a score more
of men and women, and for the next half hour there was a fearful babel of tongues. As far as
Jack could gather it seemed a sort of trial, and the Ruby King acted as judge.

The latter uttered never a word, all the questioning being done by Saya Chone; but at last
he opened his mouth and pronounced a verdict. It was received with cries of joy by some, and
howls of grief by one or two women. Now the bodyguard drove the whole crowd, save the prisoner,
out of the apartment.

When the uproar of the noisy horde had died away in the narrow passages, Saya Chone waved to
the guards to bring Mr. Haydon forward.

"Look at this man, Thomas Haydon," said the half-caste in a low, hard voice, pointing, as he
spoke, to the native; "he has killed a neighbour; he is a murderer. Very good. U Saw has sentenced
him to death. Now I tell you that if you do not give us the information we want, you have as
surely sentenced your son to death as U Saw has sentenced this man."

He said no more: there was a far more dreadful threat in his quiet, cool words than any violence
could have shown. He waved his hand once again, and Mr. Haydon was led away by the guards.

When he had disappeared, Saya Chone turned to Jack.

"You have heard what was said," he murmured. "Do not be so foolish as to think it was spoken
as a mere threat. Base all that you do or say on that statement as a fact. There is no hope
for you unless you get your father to do as we wish."

He turned away, and the Strangler at once released Jack from the chair and removed the gag
from his mouth. Next Jack was led away by a couple of guards and conducted once more through
a labyrinth of narrow, winding passages until they halted before a door, where the Malay unlocked
and took off Jack's fetters. The door was opened, and he was thrust into the room, his limbs
once more his own.

The room in which Jack now found himself was lighted by a small lamp, and, as he entered, a
figure sprang up from a low bench. "Father!" cried Jack, and at the next moment their hands
were clasped together.

"Jack, Jack," said Mr. Haydon, in a low voice which he strove to keep steady; "where, where
have you come from, and how do you come to be here?"

Jack at once plunged into his story. They sat down together on the bench, and now Mr. Haydon
learned the whole history of Jack's adventures.

"Your quest, Jack, was well and bravely undertaken," he said, when his son had finished the
story, "but these powerful and cunning rogues have been one too many for us up to the present."

"But how were you seized, father?" cried Jack, and Mr. Haydon related his story in turn. It
was short and soon told. He had gone for a walk along the shore near Brindisi, when, in a lonely
spot, he had been attacked from behind and felled by a severe blow on the skull. This, however,
did not entirely reduce him to unconsciousness, for he had a distinct recollection of inhaling
the smell of some powerful drug before he became insensible to everything about him.

He had awakened to consciousness to find himself in a cabin of U Saw's steam yacht, and here
he had been kept the closest of prisoners on the voyage back to Burmah and up the river. He
had been put ashore by night on some deserted part of the river bank, and then carried, by
unfrequented ways, through the jungle and across the hills to U Saw's stronghold. In the latter
place he had been kept in strict confinement, and urged by threats to disclose the ruby-mine
he had discovered. Hitherto his enemies had not proceeded to torture, though he had been daily
expecting it.

"And now they threaten me through you, Jack," concluded his father in an anxious voice Jack
laughed, a quiet, steady, confident laugh.

"They will threaten in vain, father," he said. "We shan't give way an inch. What do you think
that half-caste said to me last thing before I was brought here to you?" He related the speech
Saya Chone had made to him, and Mr. Haydon gave an uneasy movement of the shoulders.

"Yes," he said, "they hope that you will plead with me, Jack, to give up the secret of the
ruby-mine in order to save the pair of us."

"Not likely, father," returned Jack at once. "Whatever they do to me, mind you are not to give
way on my account. We'll keep a stiff upper lip and win through this yet."

His bold, brave words cheered Mr. Haydon, and the latter eyed his straight, strong lad with
pride. But at the same time the look of deep anxiety never left his face. He had met his enemies
boldly enough face to face with them alone, but to have Jack in their clutches too was a terrible
thing.

"At any rate," burst out Jack, "it's awfully jolly to be in here with you, and be able to talk
things over. I hardly expected such luck as this."

Mr. Haydon made no reply, only smiled. He saw plainly enough why they had been allowed to share
the same cell. His enemies knew that the more he talked with his frank, brave boy, and looked
into those bright, courageous eyes, the less would he be inclined to let ill come to Jack,
the more powerful would be their hold upon him.

"And was the ruby that you found such a very fine one?" asked Jack.

"It was a most wonderful stone, Jack," replied his father. "I have never seen one like it.
Unfortunately a couple of natives, old ruby-miners, were with me when I found it, and of course
I could not keep their tongues quiet."

"These fellows went to a tremendous lot of trouble, the rascals, to follow you up and get possession
of it," remarked Jack.

"They were well repaid, my boy," returned his father. "The stone is worth a large fortune,
and the greed of a man like U Saw for a precious stone is beyond your understanding, for you
do not know the tribe."

"And the mine, was that rich?" asked Jack.

"Very rich," said his father, "but it is best for us not to speak of these matters, Jack. Walls
have ears with a vengeance in these places."

Their talk now turned to the channel of their own doings while they had been separated. For
nearly twenty-four hours father and son stayed together, and were as cheerful as the dark fate
hanging over them allowed. Then towards sunset of the day after Jack's arrival at U Saw's stronghold,
the door of the cell was opened, and the Strangler appeared at the head of a strong guard.

By signs he ordered the two prisoners to follow him. As they stepped forward, they were placed
in single file, and the guard closed round them. Jack and his father were now led into the
courtyard, where they saw that a larger procession was awaiting them. At the head of the latter
was placed the villager who had killed his neighbour. His hands were bound behind his back,
a loop of cord was thrown about his neck, and he was in charge of a couple of the Kachin bodyguard.

Jack and his father were placed behind this prisoner, and were now allowed to walk side by side.

At the next moment the Ruby King and Saya Chone rode forward, and took their places at the
head of the procession. They moved on, walking their ponies quietly, and the line of men on
foot at once marched after them.

Neither Jack nor Mr. Haydon was bound. They were entirely free except for the Kachins who marched
on either side and kept a wary eye on their movements.

"After all," thought Jack sadly to himself. "What need is there to bind us? Suppose I broke
loose now and ran? Even if I got away from these fellows, where could I go to? The whole valley
is a prison just as sure as the stone walls we have left behind for the moment."

But scarce two minutes had passed before Jack had burst from the guard and was running at his
fleetest. It happened in this way. They filed out of the courtyard and along a broad, ill-kept,
dusty road passing the village.

Near the first houses of the village, a woman sprang out of the crowd which was waiting to
see the procession pass. She rushed forward, an infant in her arms, and flung herself on the
ground before the ponies ridden by the Ruby King and the half-caste. Holding the infant out
at the fullest reach of her arms, she lay in their path, and poured out a string of loud, supplicating
cries. Jack knew not a word she said, but he understood very well that the wife and child of
the doomed man were before him.

He looked to see the riders pause upon witnessing this spectacle of wretched despair. Then,
with a start of horror, he saw that they were intending, in cold-blooded fashion, to trample
mother and child beneath the hoofs of the animals which bore them. The woman had stretched
herself out so that her body was in front of the half-caste's pony, her infant in front of
that of the Ruby King. Saya Chone's pony was more merciful than the flinty-hearted wretch who
bestrode it. It started back, reared, shied, refused absolutely to step forward upon the unhappy
woman. The Ruby King uttered a brutal laugh, and urged his own animal on.

The latter beast went forward willingly, and was within a stride of placing its fore feet on
the little brown, naked body, when Jack gave a sharp cry of horror and darted forward. Several
of the bodyguard sprang after him, but they might as well have leapt after a deer. Jack raced
forward, flew between the ponies, and caught the child from the ground. At the same instant
three or four of the villagers ran to the spot, lifted the woman, and dragged her away. One
of them took the child from Jack and put it in her arms.

Now the guards came up, seized Jack, and hustled him back to his place in the procession.

"Well done, Jack," said his father quietly. "You were just in the nick of time. Another second
and U Saw's pony would have trampled the life out of the poor little mite."

"Really, he would have done it," breathed Jack incredulously. "Even after cutting in and picking
it up, I can hardly believe it."

"Oh, he'd have done it, without doubt," said Mr. Haydon drily. "You will find out, Jack, that
these people hold human life very cheaply, and human suffering cheaper still."

The Ruby King and the half-caste had taken no notice of Jack's action save to laugh derisively,
and now the procession moved forward once more. They went about a couple of miles, and halted
on the edge of a steep descent which ran down to a broad swamp. It wanted now about half an
hour to sunset. At the foot of the descent, on the edge of the swamp, a cross had been raised.
Jack's blood ran cold within him. What awful sight were they now to see? Were these monsters
about to crucify the condemned man?

CHAPTER XXXII.

THE HORROR IN THE SWAMP.

He breathed more freely when he saw that the men who led the villager forward had coils of
rope in their hands and nothing else. In a trice the man was bound to the cross, his arms at
full length, his body firmly lashed to the upright.

The half-caste now beckoned to Jack.

"Come down the slope," said Saya Chone. "I want you to look at this man now. You will see him
again in the morning. Perhaps you will find it useful to note the difference."

Jack was led down the descent and brought face to face with the native. The English lad saw
at once that the man bound to the cross was stupefied with an extremity of terror. His brown
skin was a frightful ashen shade, his eyes were wide, distended with horror, and fixed on the
swamp, his mouth open, his jaw hanging limp.

"You will see him again in the morning," repeated the half-caste; "and you will see, I assure
you, another kind of man."

"Yes," said Jack, "after you have practised your brutal devilries on him."

"No, no, oh no," laughed Saya Chone in his soft, cunning tones. "We shall do no more to him.
His whole punishment consists in remaining here in bonds from sunset to sunrise. Then we shall
loose the ropes, and he will be free."

"Yes," said Jack, who thought now that he saw daylight, "with every vein full of the fever
and malaria that haunt this swamp."

"Fever," laughed Saya Chone, "this fellow is absolutely safe against fever. You could no more
give him jungle fever than you could make him ten feet high. A night here would give you a
fever that would kill you in ten days, never him."

Jack was puzzled once more, and said nothing. He resolved to ask his father what it all meant.

But he soon found that this chance was not to be afforded him. He was led back up the rise,
and placed at some distance from the spot where his father stood. He saw his father taken down
the slope and confronted with the condemned native, then brought back. At once the procession
was reformed. Jack was placed at the head, his father at the rear, and they were not allowed
to exchange a word.

Jack's heart sank a little. Did this mean that they were to be separated? It did. When the
great house was once more gained, Jack was shut up by himself in a room which he had not seen
before, and there he spent the night.

The sun had been up a couple of hours next morning before Jack heard the sound of any movement
outside his cell. Then there was a rattle of creaking bolts and the door was flung open. Saya
Chone stood in the doorway with the usual band of blue-kilted and well-armed Kachins.

He did not speak, only beckoned with his hand, his malicious eyes lit up with their usual evil
grin. Nor did he speak throughout the subsequent journey when Jack was led over the track he
had followed the night before. Jack looked round for his father, but no sign of Mr. Haydon
was to be seen. The half-caste ambled ahead on a pony, Jack and four of U Saw's retainers followed
behind, and that was the whole of the party.

As they approached the edge of the declivity which ran down towards the swamp, the sound of
a loud, measured voice came through the air.

Saya Chone started, touched his pony with his heel, and cantered forward. Then he dropped back
to his former pace as they cleared a patch of bamboo and saw the origin of the sound. On the
edge of the slope stood a man dressed something like a monk. His head was close shaven, and
he carried a large yellow parasol through which the sunlight poured, and made his polished
skull shine like gold. He carried a large basket on a pole slung over his shoulder.

Jack had seen such a figure before, and Buck had told him all about it. It was a pothoodaw,
a man who, without belonging to the order of regular monks, still leads a life of prayer and
pious works. The holy man had paused on the edge of the slope to recite his prayers, moved
doubtless thereto by the sight of the condemned man below. Now, as the little procession arrived,
he swung up his basket and moved away without a glance at them.

Nor, save for Jack, was a glance cast at him. A pothoodaw is a familiar sight in every corner
of the country, and his wanderings from place to place take him to every nook, however desert
or solitary.

Jack, too, soon had eyes for something beside the holy man. They reached the edge of the slope.
Saya Chone turned with a grin and spoke to one of the Kachins. The latter at once whipped off
his turban, unrolled it and folded it over Jack's eyes, and so the latter was led down the slope.

"Now you can look," said a mocking voice, and the turban was whipped aside.

Jack gave a cry of horror. He could not help it. He had meant to restrain all signs of feeling,
but this was too much. He had been placed so that he stood almost breast to breast with the
most dreadful and grisly horror that the mind of man could conceive. He looked upon the horrible,
dry, shrivelled mummy of something which had been a man. The shape of the villager hung there
in the bonds, but it was a mere framework of bones, upon which hung wrinkled brown folds of
shrivelled skin. The haunting terror of the vision was beyond all description.

Jack tried to speak, to ask what had done this fearful thing. But his dried tongue refused
its office; it clung to the roof of his mouth.

The half-caste at his shoulder now broke into a chuckling laugh.

"He looks pretty, does he not?" said Saya Chone. "And you see nothing has happened but what
I said. He has been tied here all night." He was silent for a few moments in order to let the
awful sight sink deeply into Jack's mind, then he went on. "You are puzzled. I can see it in
your face. What has happened to him? I will tell you. You now see what a man looks like when
every single drop of blood has been sucked out of his body."

The half-caste paused a little, then laughed gaily. "It is having a better effect on you than
I should have hoped for, my young friend. You look sick with horror. But even through your
disgust I see a glimmer of wonder as to the manner in which it is done. Simply enough, I assure
you. This swamp is famous throughout the valley for the immense size and virulence of the mosquitoes
which breed in it. With the fall of dusk they pour from its recesses in vast swarms, and fasten
on man or beast or any creature into whose skin they may drive their stings, and from whose
body they may suck its blood. Here has been a feast royal for them."

He waved his hand towards the dry, rattling, shrivelled remnants of humanity, fastened to the
cross, and Jack understood the awful, the sickening cruelty of this exquisite torture.

"It is a slow death, but terribly sure," went on the half-caste. "As one gorged horde drop
off, be certain that a thousand hungry swarms hover round, eager to fill the empty places,
and taste also of the feast. Think of it to-day, think of it well."

He waved his hand and the Kachins marched away up the hill, leading Jack with them. The road
back to the great house was taken in silence, and Jack was thrust once more into his solitary
cell. There he spent the whole day alone, not seeing even those who thrust his dish of meat
and rice through a small trap in the door.

The afternoon had worn far on, and he was sitting on his bench deep in thought. He had striven
to keep out of his mind the spectacle he had seen that morning, but the impression it had produced
upon him was one of such terrible power that it was before his eyes at every moment. What did
it threaten to them, to his father and himself? His mind recoiled before the idea.

Suddenly, without a sound, the door of his cell swung back, and there was a swift rush of naked
feet on the floor. Four of the guard were upon Jack before he could lift a finger, and at the
next moment his hands were bound behind him, and his ankles fastened together with a rope which
permitted him to walk with fair ease, but gave him no freedom to do aught beside take short
steps. Within five minutes again he was in a procession such as he had walked in the night before.

In front once more rode Saya Chone and the Ruby King. The latter rode on a fine white pony,
and was attended by a couple of retainers, one of whom held a huge scarlet umbrella above U
Saw's head, and the other carried his betel-box of solid silver. Jack turned his head, and
saw at first no sign of his father, but when they had gone about half a mile, he looked back
and saw his father's tall figure, conspicuous among the short, sturdy Kachins who guarded him,
among a group now setting out from the gate.

This order of the march was kept until they reached the edge of the slope. Down this Jack was
hurried, and now saw a sight which filled him with the gloomiest of fears. The villager still
hung in his bonds, and two yards in front of the cross to which he was bound stood two similar
crosses, each surrounded with a framework of strong cane.

Jack stiffened himself for a struggle against the horrible fate which menaced him, but his
struggles were all in vain. His enemies, small perhaps, but many, and with muscles of iron,
had him strung up to the cross in a trice, and here he was gagged, after he had been bound
securely.

In a few moments he saw his father bound in like fashion, and then, to his surprise, he saw
a couple of men swiftly and thoroughly cover the framework of cane around each cross with strong
mosquito-netting.

"What does this mean?" thought Jack. "Are they only putting us here to terrify us? The mosquitoes
cannot get at us through this netting." But at the next moment he learned that this was but
a trick to prolong their agony, and cause them to endure an extremity of mental suffering which
the villager had never known. Saya Chone, as ever, was the spokesman of his master's will.

"You will be safe under these nettings until these cords are pulled," he said. Jack and Mr.
Haydon looked to the ground whither the half-caste pointed. There they saw a couple of stout
cords, one fastened at the corner of each mosquito-net.

"A sharp tug at the cord will displace the nets," went on Saya Chone. "But you will have a
chance to save your skins before that is done. In any case, the first cord will not be pulled
until an hour after sunset. Then," went on the half-caste, addressing himself to Mr. Haydon,
"this is the cord which will be pulled," and he pointed to the cord fastened to Jack's net.
Mr. Haydon ground his teeth. "If you don't want it pulled," purred Saya Chone softly, "you
know what you have to do, a few words, nothing more. An hour later the other cord will be pulled,
and you will be left for the night. On the other hand, if you wish for release, you have only
to shout that you will tell us, and a dozen men will rush down with torches and smoking green
boughs to beat aside the mosquitoes, and bring you out in safety. I myself shall remain under
shelter and within earshot."

Without another word he turned and marched up the slope. The attendants had already retired,
and within a few moments the edge of the swamp was empty save for the prisoners and the dead
villager.

Jack closed his eyes. He and his father were so placed that straight before them, almost at
arm's length, was the horrible, shrivelled figure which was so dreadful a pledge of the terrible
powers which lurked within the dismal swamp behind them.

Jack now heard his father begin to speak. "I see you are gagged, Jack," said Mr. Haydon. "It
is a compliment to your staunchness, my poor boy, if nothing else. Had they fancied there was
the least chance of your showing the white feather, they would have left you your powers of
speech, that you might beg for release. This is a frightful position. I have been expecting
some cunning device, but this is awful beyond what I could have dreamed of."

CHAPTER XXXIII.

THE POTHOODAW.

Jack could make no answer. Mr. Haydon now remained silent, and his brow was knitted in deep
thought as he turned their cruel situation over and over, yet saw no hope of release for his
son save in betraying the secrets of those who employed him, secrets he was in honour bound
not to disclose.

The sun sank swiftly. Before it had disappeared Jack saw swarms of the dreaded mosquitoes begin
to thicken in the air, like flights of gnats on a summer evening in England. The swift tropic
dark swept over swamp and hill-side, and almost at once the framework which covered each of
the captives was literally hidden with the vast masses of the venomous insects, which knew
that a fresh prey awaited them within.

It did not need sight to tell the prisoners that an incalculable number of their tiny but deadly
enemies awaited the moment when the nets would be drawn aside, the sense of hearing told them
only too clearly. The air was filled with a steady hum caused by the beating of myriads upon
myriads of tiny wings.

Jack shuddered. He had already been bitten severely by mosquitoes when they had invaded a camp
in their dozens and scores, and he had been free to defend himself, but what hideous torture
would lie in that moment when they would be exposed to the onslaught of these innumerable swarms,
and be unable to move a finger to disturb them at their dreadful feast upon the life-blood
of their victims.

Jack and his father had spent half an hour in silence, when a yellow glow brightened over the
swamp, and presently the moon came up and cast a strong light over the scene. Now Jack saw
the mosquitoes. They hovered in vast clouds around and above the netting, they hung in huge
festoons from every fold, from every corner, from every point of vantage where foothold could
be gained. It had seemed incredible to him at first that such tiny creatures could drain the
body of a man of every drop of blood, but now that eye and ear together assured him of the
vast number of their swarming myriads, he wondered no longer.

He was still staring at them when there was a flare on the edge of the slope above. He glanced
up and saw a couple of men in the moonlight. They bore burning green branches, and waved them
to and fro to keep off the clouds of mosquitoes which danced about them. From the midst of
the smoke came a voice. "In ten minutes more the first hour will have gone and the first cord
will be pulled."

It was the voice of Saya Chone, and he added no word to that brief message. He and his attendant
withdrew, and the prisoners were left in silence to stare at the horrible death which now hung
with terrible nearness over the head of Jack.

Mr. Haydon gave a deep groan.

"This is too dreadful, Jack," he said, in a low, shaking voice. "I see they mean it. There
can be no possible doubt of that now." Then suddenly the note of his voice changed. It became
tense, vibrating, eager. "What's that?" he said, and again, "What's that?" and fell silent.

Jack turned his head and saw what his father meant. Twenty yards to their right a large patch
of reeds grew on the edge of the swamp. From the reeds the figure of a man was slowly creeping
towards them. Swathed from head to foot in folds of thick white linen, to defend himself from
the bites of the venomous mosquitoes, the man was working his way inch by inch along the ground.

Jack watched the stranger's progress with deep and burning interest. Surely he came as a friend!
The bitterest enemy could not come to make their situation worse than it was at present.

With a last swift wriggle the creeping figure was at the foot of the net which shrouded Jack.
The latter looked down and saw that the man was literally covered from head to foot with masses
of the swarming insects. Then, with wonderful dexterity, the newcomer jerked aside the insects
which were massed upon him, raised the lower edge of the net, and shot with a swift, sinuous
movement inside.

As he sprang to his feet, his linen wrapper fell aside, and, to his great astonishment, Jack
saw the bald shaven head of the pothoodaw flash up into the moonlight. Then the holy man smiled,
and Jack knew the cheerful grin. His heart leapt for joy. It was Me Dain, the Burman guide.
Out gleamed a keen knife, half-a-dozen rapid cuts were delivered, and Jack's bonds, gag and
all, hung in shreds about him. Jack caught a fervent, grateful whisper from the neighbouring
framework.

"Thank God! a friend, a friend!" Mr. Haydon breathed in a tone of intense relief.

"Wait!" breathed Me Dain in Jack's ear, and was gone. The Burman wrapped himself again in his
linen shield, wormed his way across to the framework where Mr. Haydon was a captive, and cut
him free in an instant.

"Me Dain!" Jack caught the whisper from his father, and knew that the latter had recognised
his old guide. A few whispered words passed between the Burman and Mr. Haydon, then the latter
whispered across to his son: "Wrap your coat round your head, Jack, to keep these venomous
little brutes off as much as possible, then follow us."

Jack whipped off his Norfolk tunic and folded it about his head, leaving himself a peep-hole
to watch the guide. He did as he saw them do. He dropped to the ground, wriggled under the
net, then sprang to his feet and hurried beside his father, following Me Dain, who led the
way back to the patch of reeds whence he had crept. Skirting the reeds he raced at full speed
along the edge of the swamp, keeping at the foot of the slope which ran down to the marsh,
but heading away from the spot where Saya Chone and his attendant Kachins were posted.

The torture of that journey through the swamp was a thing which Jack never forgot. The mosquitoes
worked their way into every crevice of the tunic he had folded about his head. They crept into
his hair, down his neck, and swarmed over his face through the breathing hole he was compelled
to leave open in front of it. The pain of their sting was such that he had to set his teeth
to keep back a growl of malediction upon their evil fangs. Every venomous little wretch seemed
to carry a red-hot needle which it thrust joyfully into the soft flesh wherever it happened
to alight.

At last, after three hundred yards of silent scurry through this pestilential tract, they struck
hard ground, and went at full speed up the hill-side for open country and purer air. Still
following Me Dain, who pushed on as fast as he could go, Jack and his father plunged into a
bamboo groove, and followed a narrow path. This brought them in a few minutes to a small clearing,
where the Burman paused, and all were glad of an opportunity to draw breath, and knock off
the mosquitoes which still clung to them.

Jack sprang forward and seized the guide by the hand.

"Me Dain," he cried, "wherever have you sprung from to lend us a hand in this fashion, just
in the nick of time?"

"Ay, ay," said Mr. Haydon, "just at the moment of our hardest trial and greatest danger. Me
Dain, old fellow, we are enormously indebted to you."

Father and son shook hands with the Burman and thanked him over and over again, and Me Dain
grinned all over his broad, pleasant face.

"Better get on," he said, "Saya Chone not far away yet."

These words recalled the fugitives to a sense of the great danger in which they stood as long
as U Saw's valley still held them, and they hastened to follow Me Dain, who was now walking
briskly forward. Twenty minutes of swift and silent progress brought them to a native hut in
a little clearing.

"Here you must stay for a time," said the Burman.

"But will it be safe, Me Dain?" murmured Mr. Haydon. "Whoever lives here must belong body and
soul to U Saw. We shall be informed upon at once."

"No, no," said the Burman emphatically, "not by this woman. She tell nothing. She help you
all she can. She is the wife of the man who was killed in the swamp. The young sahib save her
child. She never forget that. Oh, no, I settle with her to-night. She keep you safe."

Mr. Haydon said no more, and all three crept under cover of a patch of plantains to the shelter
of the broad eaves of the thatch of reeds which covered the dwelling. Here they found that
a hole had been made in the cane walls, and they crept into the house, thus avoiding the entrance
by the door, which faced another house at some little distance away.

Inside the place they found no one but the woman and her child. She came forward and shekoed
again and again, and Mr. Haydon, who had a fair knowledge of the language of the country, spoke
to her and thanked her for the refuge which she offered to them.

At one end of the cottage there was a rude loft of logs where the little household had stored
their stock of rice and other necessaries when the time of harvest came. The loft was now partly
empty, and at its farther end there was plenty of room for two men to lie in hiding behind
a row of tall earthen jars in which the paddy was stored after threshing.

In this place of safety Me Dain bestowed them, assuring them that no one ever went to the loft
save the woman herself, and that he must be off at once to show himself at the local monastery
in his character of pothoodaw, and so avert all suspicion that he had been concerned in the escape.

"The monks give me a room," said Me Dain. "I jump through the window, and jump back. No one
knows then that I leave it. Must be careful. U Saw and Saya Chone, both bad men, very bad men."

We must now return to that very bad man Saya Chone, who was also about to be a very disappointed
and furious one. On the stroke of the hour he reappeared at the brink of the slope, just after
the fugitives had vanished round the patch of reeds. Had they not muffled their heads they
would have heard his call to Mr. Haydon. Had he not been thickly surrounded by the smoke of
the green boughs which partly kept off the clouds of venomous assailants, he would have seen
that the frameworks were empty in the moonlight. But such an idea as that his victims could
escape never for an instant came into his mind. The whole neighbourhood was under the thumb
of his brutal lord, and he knew that no one would interfere to save a friend from U Saw's hand,
much less a pair of strangers and foreigners.

Thrice he shouted his threats and warnings to the empty cages, and he judged that the silence
meant stubborn resolution not to be conquered. Then, with his own hand, he pulled the cord
which should have stripped the net from Jack.

"Now the father will give way," thought the half-caste, and strained his ears to catch a sound
of yielding from Thomas Haydon.

When never a sound was heard, the half-caste played what he thought would be his trump card.
He ordered a Kachin to dart down, and cut the gag loose from Jack's mouth. Saya Chone counted
for certain that the son's moans of agony would be too much for the father to stand, and that
the latter would give way. But in an instant the nimble blue-kilt was back, his face full of
a surprise beyond description.

"The white men have gone," he gasped.

"Gone!" screamed Saya Chone, and he rushed down the slope waving a smoking bough about his
head. A glance at the prisons told him that the man's words were true, and for a second he
stared in stupefied amazement at the severed bonds before he rushed back up the slope. He ran
at full speed to the place where U Saw was placidly chewing betel and waiting the upshot of
the affair. The Ruby King was fearfully incensed at the idea that anyone had dared to meddle
with the prisoners, and both he and the half-caste breathed the most furious threats of torture
and death against all concerned in the affair. That they would re-capture Jack and his father
they did not doubt for an instant. The fugitives must be somewhere in the valley, and within
an hour they had a hundred men threading every path and searching every corner of the vale.

CHAPTER XXXIV.

THE HIDING-PLACE AND THE THIEF.

Jack and his father spent the night safely stowed behind the great earthen jars on the loft.
Stretched out on a heap of soft, dried grass, they slept and watched in turns, for it was not
safe for both to go to sleep at once.

At break of day the woman brought them a meal, and they ate and drank, and Jack gave her a
few rupees. A couple of hours after dawn they heard a movement below and saw a sight which
they welcomed gladly. The loft stood upon a dozen wooden supports raised six or seven feet
from the ground. It had no window, but, upon moving the dried grass aside, they could peep
through the chinks in the floor of logs. Peering cautiously down, they saw a yellow umbrella,
and presently that was laid aside as the pothoodaw seated himself in shade of the loft and
began busily to recite his prayers.

When these were ended he sat to all appearance absorbed in profound meditation. But had anyone
been near enough, they would have found that a busy whispered conversation was going on between
the pothoodaw and those hidden in the loft above his head.

For half an hour the holy man sat there, then went his way. But in that time Jack and his father
had learned much of deep interest to them. Me Dain told them that Buck and Jim Dent were now
camped in a lonely place among the hills near upon twenty miles away, awaiting the Burman's
return. The latter had been sent in disguise to U Saw's village to pick up what information
he could, and had only just arrived when Jack saw him on the edge of the slope above the swamp.
He told them he would stay in the neighbourhood and watch for a favourable moment to make a
start for the camp where their friends awaited them.

For two days the fugitives lay in hiding under the care of the native woman and in perfect
safety. They proved once more the truth of the old adage that "the nearer to danger the nearer
to safety." U Saw and Saya Chone urged the pursuit with the most savage eagerness. They searched
every corner of the great swamp, every cane-brake, every patch of forest, every nook, and every
corner. They had a cordon of sentinels drawn round the valley, patrolling day and night, so
that no one could slip through their hands. But it never occurred to them for an instant to
search a cottage lying almost beneath the walls of the Ruby King's stronghold, a hut so slight
that it seemed incapable of concealing anything.

Another piece of luck greatly befriended them.

On the day that they were tied up at the edge of the swamp, one of U Saw's retainers had been
cruelly flogged for some misdemeanour. The man had deserted the same night, and was never heard
of again. The idea at once got abroad that it was he who had released the prisoners in order
to spite the Ruby King, and had guided them out of the country.

Then, on the third night, the luck of the Haydons came to an end, and their hiding-place was
hit upon in a very odd fashion, a fashion which could not have been foreseen or guarded against.
It was about midnight, and Jack had the watch, for one or other stood on guard all the time.
He sat with his back against a great post which ran from ground to ridge-pole, and, without
the least warning, he felt that it was shaking very slightly.

In an instant Jack was on the alert. He could not hear the faintest sound, but the post still
trembled, and Jack felt certain that something or someone was climbing up it. In a few moments
he was certain of this, for he heard faint rustlings on the reed roof as if someone was moving
about. He stretched out his hand and shook his father gently. Mr. Haydon woke at once. He made
no sound, only shook Jack's arm in return to let his son know that he was on the alert.

The rustling on the roof grew a little louder. The thatch was being torn aside, but so cautiously,
so cleverly, that the two watching below could only catch the sound by listening intently.
Suddenly the stars flashed upon them. A hole had already been made above them, and in this
hole they saw the head of a native against the sky.

They remained perfectly still and silent, and watched the hole grow. Silently, deftly, the
midnight marauder plucked handful after handful of the reed thatch away and enlarged the opening.
Both of those below who watched him, had grasped by this time what it all meant. This was no
man in the pay of U Saw, who suspected a hiding-place; it was just a common thief, pure and
simple, who had an eye to nothing save the widow's paddy. Believing that she was alone and
defenceless in the house, he had come to plunder her loft.

But, whatever his motive, the risk to the Haydons remained the same. In another moment he would
drop among them and infallibly discover their presence. Then his outcries would arouse the
village and their capture would be certain.

Very, very slowly the thief slipped his legs in at the hole, which was now big enough to admit
him, and began to slide downwards. As Jack watched the rogue gently drop upon them, he felt
for a second his father's hand laid upon his throat, and he understood; the man was to be seized
and choked into silence; nothing else remained for them to do.

Inch by inch the rascal slipped down. So cunning was he that he made less noise than a mouse
moving among the dried grass, and, without doubt, he thought that he was carrying out his raid
finely, and would make the widow's store of rice smart for it.

The thief loosed his hold upon the rafter of the roof by which he hung, and his long, slender,
naked body, bare but for his waist-cloth, dropped as a great snake might drop between Jack
and his father. Mr. Haydon made one clutch, and closed his fingers in a tremendous throttling
grip about the rogue's neck. Jack caught him by the arms.

A most extraordinary struggle followed. The fellow was like an eel, and it proved a task of
the greatest difficulty to hold him and keep him from getting loose and raising a disturbance.
He was like an eel not only in his marvellous agility, his twists, his feints, his wriggling,
but in his actual bodily slipperiness. The cunning rascal had smeared his naked body from head
to foot with oil, so that, if seized, he could the more easily wriggle out of the hands of
his captors.

How clever a device this was Jack learned to his great surprise. The arms he seized were whipped
out of his clutch as if he was trying to lay hold of quicksilver. He grabbed something which
proved to be a leg. A swift jerk, and his fingers slipped off the greasy limb. Finally he settled
the matter by throwing both arms round the slim, bare waist, and closing upon the rogue with
a bear's hug which drove the breath out of the thief's body.

Together they threw the man upon the dried grass, and Mr. Haydon, who had made his hold good
by locking his fingers about the fellow's windpipe, now eased his grip a little so that the
man could breathe.

Suddenly a light flashed upon this scene of fierce but silent struggle. The woman herself had
been aroused from her couch in the room below, had lighted a small lamp, and climbed the rude
steps to the loft.

Mr. Haydon turned his head, saw her, and snapped out a single word. She set down her lamp,
disappeared, and was back in an instant with a long strip of cloth in her hand. Mr. Haydon
took this, and soon whipped a gag round the mouth of the intruder, while Jack held him down.
In response to another whispered request of Mr. Haydon's, the woman fetched a length of cord,
and in two minutes the thief was bound hand and foot. Then father and son got up and stood
looking down at their captive, who stared sullenly up at them from his dark eyes.

"If this isn't a confounded fix," murmured Mr. Haydon. "Why should this thieving rogue choose
us to drop in on, of all people?"

"The unprotected house drew him, I expect," replied Jack.

"Ah, true," returned his father. "I wonder, though, if he had any accomplices."

He turned and spoke to the woman, and she at once blew out the lamp.

"The light in any case is dangerous as likely to attract attention," whispered Mr. Haydon.
"Now, listen."

They listened intently for some time, but there was not the faintest sound of any movement
in the neighbourhood.

"I hope to goodness this rascal was working by himself," went on Mr. Haydon, "and no one knew
what he was about. We don't want a companion peering in to see what has happened to him."

"What under the sun are we going to do with him, father?" whispered Jack.

"We must leave him tied up here and run for it," replied Mr. Haydon. "I see nothing else that
we can do."

"Nor I," replied Jack; "and the sooner we march the better. We don't know that there was not
someone outside to help him carry off the spoil, and the accomplice may have learned of our
presence."

"You are right, Jack," said his father.

"But there is Me Dain, we must pick him up," pursued Jack. "Without him we do not know where
to strike. How can we get hold of him?"

"The woman will be of service there," said his father. "She is our only hope."

He spoke with the native woman for a few moments, then gave a whistle of satisfaction below
his breath.

"She knows where he is lodging, and thinks she can rouse him without disturbing anyone else,"
whispered Mr. Haydon; "at any rate, she is going to try."

The woman shuffled down the steps, and was gone in an instant.

"We may as well go down and be ready for a move," murmured Mr. Haydon, "but we'll try this
chap's knots first."

They examined the bound thief, and made certain that he could not easily shuffle out of his
bonds, then they went down to the main room of the hut and posted themselves near the door.

The time they waited seemed never-ending. In reality it was not more than twenty minutes. But
when they feared that every sound would see an alarm raised upon them and their escape hopelessly
cut off, every minute seemed an hour.

Jack had his eye at a huge crack in the door, and to his immense relief he made out at last
a couple of figures approaching the house under the dim shade of the trees.

"Here they are," he breathed. "She's brought it off all right. I can make out Me Dain."

Two seconds later the Burman shot into the hut with a stealthy, noiseless glide.

"Come on," he said. "Not stop at all. She tell me everything."

Away they went at once, Me Dain leading the way, with Jack and his father close behind. The
Burman dodged round the corner of the hut, and struck at once into a hard well-trodden path
which was at once swallowed up in the thick shade of a close-set grove of bamboos. It was a
path leading to a pagoda much frequented by the villagers, and would show no sign by which
they might be tracked on the morrow. Me Dain had made himself familiar with the ins and outs
of the place, and he marched forward with a swift and assured step. Luckily, the hut stood
right on the outskirts of the village, and in a few moments they were out of sight of any house,
and when they turned aside from the path to the pagoda they soon left behind all sign of human
presence.

As they crossed a little clearing, Jack thought he heard a soft footfall in their rear. He
turned, and saw, to his surprise, that the native woman was a short distance behind them, with
her child in her arms.

"Why," said Jack, "the woman of the hut is following us."

"Yes," replied Me Dain. "She must come, sahib. If U Saw catch her, he burn her alive for hiding
you."

"Likely enough, the unspeakable brute," murmured Mr. Haydon. "We must put the poor woman in
a place of safety, Me Dain. We owe her a great deal."

"She not want to stop in that place, anyhow, sahib," replied the Burman. "She belong to a village
over the hills. She want to go back, now her husband is dead."

"Oh, very good," said Mr. Haydon. "We'll put her right if we have the chance."

"Yes, yes," said Jack. "She's been a good staunch friend to us, the same as you, Me Dain."

"Very true, Jack," said Mr. Haydon.

CHAPTER XXXV.

THE FLIGHT FROM THE VALLEY.

They now went a couple of miles in silence, keeping a sharp look-out on every hand. But they
gained the foot of the hills which encircled the valley without seeing or hearing anything
which might promise danger.

With Me Dain still in the van, they climbed steadily up a steep slope and over a rocky saddle
between two peaks which lifted sharp points against the starry sky.

As they gained the saddle, Jack whispered sharply: "Stop, Me Dain, what's this? I smell something."

"Me too," said the Burman, snuffing cautiously. "There is a fire somewhere ahead."

"A fire," said Mr. Haydon. "We must take care. Who have lighted it, and what are they doing
in a lonely spot like this?"

A dozen steps again and the questions were answered. They cleared a little ridge and saw, two
or three hundred yards ahead, a great glowing patch of red where a big fire blazed up, and
figures moved to and fro about it.

"A watch-fire," said Jack. "We'd better dodge back. Luckily they're up wind."

The fugitives retreated until the fire was hidden from their view by a great rock, then put
their heads closely together to whisper to each other.

"Watchmen," said Me Dain; "they are watchmen keeping guard over the path which runs out of
the valley towards the hills."

"Then those cunning villains have set a watch over every road," murmured Mr. Haydon. "Do you
know of any way to get out without following a path, Me Dain, any way by which we can clamber
over the hills?"

"No, sahib, I do not," replied the Burman; "but here is the woman who has lived ten years in
the valley. I will ask her."

For a couple of minutes Me Dain and the native woman held a whispered conversation, then the
Burman breathed a deep sigh of relief.

"She can take us out of the valley, sahibs. She can lead us by a way, very rough and hard to
follow, but very little used, where they would not trouble to set a guard. But we cannot follow
it in the darkness. She will take us to the mouth of the pass, and there we must wait for daylight."

"Good, good," said Jack in a cheerful whisper, "we'll dodge these fellows after all. What luck
that the woman marched with us!"

The words were scarcely out of his mouth when a fierce yelping and snarling broke out not forty
yards away, and the sound swiftly approached them.

"Confound it all, a dog, a dog!" growled Mr. Haydon.

In another instant the animal was leaping and bounding within two or three yards of them, snarling
savagely, and then making the hill-side ring with its piercing barks. It belonged to one of
the guards, and had been prowling about in search of food when it caught the scent of the fugitives.

"This way, this way, sahibs," cried Me Dain in low, eager tones. "Quick, quick, the men sure
to come to see why the dog make a noise."

"Sure to, for a certainty," groaned Mr. Haydon. "Well, we must run for it."

Away they hurried as fast as the darkness would permit, and the wretched cur hung on their
heels, yelping and barking without pause, and thus guiding the guards straight to their prey.

"We must stop this brute's mouth or we are utterly done for," said Jack. At that instant he
stumbled over a large stone. He bent, picked it up, and turned round. Four or five yards behind
them, and plainly to be marked by its eyes shining green in the darkness, was the dog, which,
by its mere power of drawing enemies upon them, was, at the moment, the most terrible enemy of all.

For a second Jack hung on his aim, the heavy stone poised high in his right hand. Then he hurled
it with all his force. Crash! He heard the missile strike the brute with a heavy thud. The
dog gave one last frightful yelp of pain, then dropped and lay silent Whether the beast was
dead or only stunned Jack did not know, nor did he care. He knew that he had silenced the miserable
cur, and that was all he wished.

Enough harm had been done already. A bunch of dancing lights now shot into view, and he saw
them borne swiftly on. The watchmen, carrying torches, were running to the spot where the dog
had given the alarm.

Jack now caught up his friends with a few swift strides, and all the party hurried on, the
woman leading the way and guiding them.

"Well done, Jack," murmured his father. "Well done, my lad. If you hadn't put a stop to that
brute's yelping, he'd have brought those fellows on us as straight as they could run. Now they've
got to look for us in the dark, and that's a very different affair."

"Do you think they'll pick up our trail from the spot where they find the dog?" asked Jack.

"Oh, no," said Mr. Haydon, "not easily. The ground is hard, and running a line by torchlight
is a very different thing from running it by daylight. I hope to goodness we can make good
headway before the dawn, for with the first peep of day they'll be after us as fast as they
can lay foot to ground."

At this moment both looked back and saw the plump of torches come to a stand. The watchmen
had reached the spot where Jack had struck down the dog, and, through the silence of the night,
the eager, excited voices of the Kachins could plainly be heard as they debated hotly about
the dog's fate, and what it meant.

Then the bunch of lights scattered and began to flicker here and there. The guards were looking
for the trail of those who had struck down the dog. On and on ran the fugitives, and soon Jack
saw that his father had been right about the difficulties of tracking by torchlight. The points
of fire behind them became more and more scattered, and not one came on or followed them. Then
they turned the shoulder of a hill, and all was darkness and silence once more.

It wanted an hour of daylight when they came to the mouth of the pass by which they were to
escape through the ring of hills which encircled the valley.

"Must wait now," said Me Dain. "She say no man can go through the pass unless he can see the way."

"Are we to lose time, Me Dain?" said Jack. "Can't we creep on slowly and make a little headway?"

The Burman talked again to the woman, but she was most emphatic in declaring that nothing could
be done until the day broke; so they crouched in silence under lee of a great boulder until
the first faint bars of light began to show in the east.

As soon as it was possible to see a yard or so before them the march began. The woman led the
way, with her sleeping child in her arms, Me Dain followed her closely, and Jack and his father
brought up the rear.

They soon saw why daylight had been needed for the task of escaping from the valley by this
road. Their way lay through a narrow pass which ran through a deep cleft of the mountains,
a cleft which seemed as though it had been carved out by a blow of a Titanic axe. There was
scarcely a yard of the narrow path upon which a step could be taken smoothly and easily. For
ages upon ages the forces of nature had been tearing huge boulders and slices of rock from
the frowning heights above, and toppling them into this crevice between the mountains. Thus
the way was littered with huge stones, over which they climbed, between which they threaded
their way, down which they often slid and scrambled as best they could.

For some hours they toiled steadily along this wild, rocky gorge, then a halt was called to
rest and breathe. The native woman, a lithe, nimble creature, was as little discomposed by
the hard, rough march as any of them, although she carried her child, nor would she allow anyone
to help her with her burden.

Their breathing space was but short. They had halted on a ridge which commanded a big stretch
of the country they had crossed. Jack was seated on the ground, with his back to the wall of
rock behind them. Suddenly he sprang to his feet. He looked steadily for a moment down the
pass, then he said quietly, "We are pursued."

Mr. Haydon had stretched himself at full length on the ground to rest. Hearing those words
from his son, he leapt also to his feet and looked eagerly in the direction to which Jack's
outstretched finger was pointed. Far away a patch of the pass lay in sunlight. For the most
part the narrow cleft through the hills lay in gloomy shadow of the precipices which bordered
it on either hand, but the climbing sun shot pencils of light here and there into the deep
rift. Across one of these sunny patches a line of tiny figures was streaming. Only for a moment
were they visible. They crossed the field of light, then vanished into the huddle of rocks
which littered the foot of the pass.

"Fifteen," said Jack, as the last of them disappeared.

Mr. Haydon whistled sharply and nodded.

"We've travelled fast, Jack," said he, with a troubled brow, "but these hard-bitten, wiry,
little mountaineers have travelled faster. We must put our best foot foremost. It will be fatal
to be caught in this narrow gully between the rocks. They will get round us and rush us from
all sides at once."

"I thought we'd got a much better start than this," said Jack.

"So did I," replied his father, "but it has turned out otherwise."

Me Dain's words were short but to the point.

"Kachins!" he cried. "Come on," and pushed ahead with the woman, who was off like a deer at
the first hint of danger.

"How far to the end of the pass, Me Dain?" called Mr. Haydon.

"Not more than two miles, sahib," replied the Burman.

"Good," said Jack, "if we can only clear the pass we may find some means of throwing them off.
In the pass they have us tight between the walls."

"That's it, Jack," returned his father, and then they hurried over the wild broken track in
silence.

Half a mile farther on Jack pointed forward. "Hallo!" he said, "here's another of those roads
built along the precipice. I hope it will be a bit sounder than the last."

In another moment they arrived at a stretch of the path where the road was carried in mid-air
over a deep chasm in the bed of the pass. They had already passed two such places, and at each
point the road was constructed in the same manner. Holes had been cut horizontally in the sheer
face of the precipice and huge beams driven into them. About six feet of each beam was left
projecting from the hole, and upon these outstanding bars, smaller beams were laid parallel
to the face of the rock. The earth had been heaped on all, and the result was a narrow road
running along the cliff like a shelf.

The last they had passed had been very rotten, and Me Dain had gone through one hole up to
his arm-pits. He had only been saved from a fall into the yawning gulf below by the promptness
of Jack, who had flung himself on his knees and whipped his hands under the Burman's arms,
and held him up. Warned by this misadventure, they moved slowly and carefully along the narrow
track which now lay before them.

"Take care, take care," said Mr. Haydon, "this road is worse than the others. We must go in
single file. These beams will not take any great weight."

They spread themselves out in a line, with a yard or more between each person, and went gingerly
forward.

The truth was, that hundreds of years before, when some native ruler had gone to immense trouble
and labour to build these roads, the pass had been an important highway. But a tremendous land-slide
had blocked a portion of the pass, and swept away a number of the wooden roads, and the way
had fallen into disuse. Since then the vast beams of teak which formed the road-bed had been
slowly crumbling into decay, and many were very insecure.

As Jack brought up the rear of the little procession, he kept his eyes fixed on the road at
his feet, and this for two reasons. One, to avoid the rotten places, and the other, because
to look around from a roadway six feet wide into the yawning gulf which gaped beside him was
very dizzying.

Suddenly he heard a scream from the native woman who guided them. He looked ahead at once,
but could not see her. The little procession was now winding its way round an acute angle of
the cliff about which the road had bent sharply. The woman was out of sight; Me Dain was disappearing.
Mr. Haydon quickened his steps, and Jack hurried on too. What had that scream meant? It had
not been loud, but low and full of awful terror. What lay beyond the angle?

Jack turned the corner and saw, and his brown face blanched as he saw the frightful corner
into which circumstances had driven them. Ten yards beyond the angle, the road ended abruptly,
broken short off. Whether the beams had given way and fallen into the chasm, or whether an
avalanche of rocks had beaten the road into ruins, they knew not, nor did it matter. What mattered
was this, that fifty yards beyond them the road had again joined the solid bed of the pass,
and that now along that fifty yards nothing was left save here and there a broken stump of
teak standing out from the face of the precipice. Nothing without wings could pass over the
wide space where the road had been stripped from the cliff.

For a moment no one could speak. They could only stare aghast at the gulf beside and before
them, at the little strip of road broken off short and square at their feet. How were they
to pass this frightful, yawning abyss?

CHAPTER XXXVI.

PENNED IN THE PASS.

"What's to be done now, father," said Jack in a low, quick voice; "the road's clean gone. We're
trapped."

Both stepped forward and looked over the edge of the sheer descent where the road ended. A
broad torrent foamed along fifty feet below. The side of the precipice fell away to the stream
as smooth as a wall. It rose above them just as smooth. No way up or down. They saw that in
an instant.

"Better go back and try another way," said Mr. Haydon. "Ask her, Me Dain."

A few swift words passed between the Burman and the native woman. Then the guide shook his
head soberly. There was no other way that she knew of.

Jack stepped back to the angle and peered carefully round it. "The Kachins are coming," he said.

The shelf-road had risen as it ran along the precipice, and from this point he could see a
long way down the pass. He saw the bunch of pursuers sweep into sight and race up the pass.
His father joined him at once.

"They would see us now if we went back," said Mr. Haydon. "What on earth are we to do, Jack?"

Jack knit his brows in perplexity, but made no answer. He could not see what to answer. Behind
them a band of savage and determined enemies; before them a gulf over which none but a bird
could pass.

"We're in a frightful fix," he murmured at last.

"Frightful," rejoined his father. "I give you my word that I see no way out."

"Nor I, father," said Jack. "It seems to me that all we can do is to try to hold them off at
this corner."

"But how?" asked Mr. Haydon.

"The road's fearfully rotten just at the bend," said Jack. "I think we could break it down
pretty easily. It trembled and shook as I passed over it."

"I see," returned his father, "break the road down and keep them from rushing us. But what
of ourselves? How will it advantage us to be isolated on a patch of road, stuck against the
face of the cliff like a swallow's nest against a wall?"

"Frankly, I don't know, father," replied Jack. "I simply put that forward as the only means
I can see of gaining a slight respite. Otherwise they will be among us and cut our throats
in short order."

"Or make us captives, which would be a long sight worse," said Mr. Haydon. "Well, Jack, we'll
give ourselves an hour or two longer to look at the sun. Down goes the road!"

The three men sprang to the task at once. First, with their hands, they scraped away the earth,
which was very thin on the face of many of the beams. When this was removed, there was exposed
to sight the flooring of small beams laid lengthways across the big beams which jutted from
the rock. From this flooring each selected the soundest stick he could find.

Jack was lucky in dropping across a bit of teak in capital preservation, a bar eight feet long,
four inches square, and as hard as iron. With this he began to batter at the rotten patch of
roadway where the angle of the cliff was turned, and a few strokes on the rotten timbers served
to tumble them headlong into the raging torrent below. His father and Me Dain were hard at
work beside him, and in a very few minutes they had broken away the softest part of the road,
leaving a ragged gap fifteen feet wide, just at the turn.

They made the last strokes at the outer side in the very face of their enemies. When they withdrew
to the shelter of the inner angle, the racing Kachins were not a hundred yards away. In another
moment the fugitives heard their pursuers gather close at hand. The little men in blue were
now only a few yards away, clustered about the farther edge of the gap, and chattering to each
other in a very excited fashion.

Me Dain listened intently. "They make a bridge," he whispered.

"Ay, ay," returned Mr. Haydon. "Drop a few sticks across and come at us."

Jack gripped his stout bar of teak as a plan flashed into his mind. He crept forward inch by
inch until he was on the verge of the gap they had torn in the road. Yet all the time a friendly
rib of rock at the projecting angle of the precipice protected him from the long iron-barrelled
muzzle-loaders carried by U Saw's retainers.

The expert hands of the Kachins made short work of tearing up a number of small beams. Jack
heard them dragging the timbers forward, and he poised his bar. A beam was flung across, and
a second almost at once fell beside it. Out darted Jack's bar, and both were hurled into the chasm.

The Kachins gave a yell of anger, and threw the next beam across at the outer angle, as far
as possible from the face of the cliff. But Jack could just reach it, and that, too, he thrust
into space. Again and again they tried to make for themselves a footbridge by which the gap
could be crossed, but every time Jack's ready bar foiled their purpose completely. There was
a still louder yell of anger from the savage little men as the last beam they had torn up was
hurled from its place. Then for a few moments there was a respite. The fugitives could hear
them draw off to a short distance and hold a conference in low murmurs. Jack now looked round
at his companions. His father and Me Dain were close behind him. The native woman, her child
closely clasped to her breast, was watching his every movement, her face filled with mingled
feelings of fear and hope.

"Well done, Jack!" murmured his father. "You've been one too many for them at that game."

The Burman now crept forward, and thrust his head as far as he dared round the angle. The voices
of the Kachins had risen in eager debate, and many of their words could be caught. Me Dain
listened intently. In a few moments he turned his head, and there was a very puzzled look on
his face.

"They are--they are," he began, then stopped. Clearly his English could not bear him out this
time. He said a few words in Burmese to Mr. Haydon.

"They are casting lots," said the latter to Jack.

"What for, I wonder?" said Jack. "Seems a queer thing."

"They're a queer little crew," returned his father. "As savage and blood-thirsty as so many
ferrets. We shall soon see."

Within five minutes they did see, and the event proved how desperate an enemy they had to deal
with.

Me Dain had retired, and Jack had once more taken up his place beside the gap, his bar in his
hands, and his ears strained to catch the faintest sound made by those who beleaguered the
little party.

Lucky for them was it that he kept so close a watch. For there was a sudden patter of feet
beyond the gap, and then a figure with flying kilt, and fierce, dark face flashed into sight.
Upon this Kachin had the lot fallen to leap the gap and lead an attack on the fugitives. Had
not Jack's bar been ready, the fiery mountaineer would have been among them, with his gleaming
dah poised for the stroke.

But even as he landed, his splendid bound carrying him a couple of feet over the edge, the
heavy bar shot out and caught him a tremendous butting blow, full in the chest. He reeled,
staggered, and his dah flew from his hands, as he made a frantic clutch at the bar. For a second
he struggled to make his foothold good on the brink of the abyss, but failed. He dropped back
and vanished into the gulf without a sound.

Jack recovered his bar, and waited with a stern, grim face for the next attack. It was a life
and death struggle now, and it was his duty to guard the gap. Mr. Haydon caught up the dah
which had flown from the hand of the Kachin, and swung it with a deep guttural sound of satisfaction.
Me Dain had his great knife in his hand.

For some time there was complete silence among their enemies. The terrible fall of the man
who had been chosen by lot to lead the way, seemed to teach them a little caution. But it had
not the smallest effect in the direction of quelling their desire to come to close quarters
with the fugitives. The Kachin is utterly too careless of human life, whether his own or another's,
for that.

Half an hour passed before a fresh assault was made. The minutes dragged by with horrible slowness
to those who awaited their fate on the isolated patch of ledge.

Then, with no more warning of their approach than the patter of naked feet on the earthen path,
a second assault was made in the same fashion. Again a Kachin leapt into sight, but farther
out, and so more out of reach of the bar. His hands were empty, too, and as Jack stepped forward
and thrust at him, he clutched the end of the bar. This he did just as he alighted, and, dropping
on his feet as nimbly as a cat, he strove to turn the bar aside. Swift upon his heels three
more Kachins came, clearing the gulf and landing in safety, while their comrade and Jack struggled
for mastery of the bar.

Upon the instant the tiny ledge was filled with the fury of a desperate combat. Mr. Haydon
sprang out and cut down the second Kachin, as he ran forward to strike at Jack with his heavy
weapon. The third attacked the Burman, and the fourth closed with Mr. Haydon, their heavy swords
clashing together as they slashed fiercely at each other.

Jack had no eyes for any but his own enemy. The Kachin, perched as he was on the very brink
of a horrible abyss, fought as coolly as possible to master the bar and avoid the swift thrusts
by which at every second Jack threatened to drive him over the edge.

Suddenly the Kachin gave way and dropped flat. Jack thought his enemy was disposed of, but
the shifty mountaineer had only fallen along the lip of the gulf to dodge the powerful strokes
delivered by the English lad. With a swift movement the Kachin rolled under the bar, and then
was up like lightning and rushing on Jack, a long dagger, plucked from his girdle, in his hand.

Jack had no weapon but his fists, but with these he sprang to meet the savage, blue-kilted
figure. Taking advantage of his longer reach, he let fly with his right fist. The Kachin was
clearly no boxer, for though he raised his left arm, Jack's fist went straight through the
feeble guard and landed full between his opponent's eyes. This shook the Kachin so much that
the vicious knife-thrust he launched went wide of its mark, and at the next moment Jack closed
with him and tried to wrench the knife from his grasp.

But though the Kachin was no boxer, he was a wrestler of uncommon power and skill, and Jack
felt the little man seize upon him with an iron clutch. To and fro they swung on the horrible,
dizzying edge, each straining every nerve and muscle to free himself from his enemy's clutch
and fling his opponent into the torrent which roared and foamed far below.

Locked in this clinging embrace, they stumbled and fell headlong, still bound together by that
straining clutch. They were now actually hanging with heads over the brink of the gulf, and
the uproar of the rushing waters below sounded loud in Jack's ears. Suddenly he felt that they
were both going over, slowly but steadily. The Kachin was no longer trying to master his foe.
So that his enemy went, he was willing to fall with him. He was now driving his heels into
the roadway, and, with all the force of the iron muscles packed in his compact body, was trying
to force himself and Jack over the brink.

Before Jack had mastered his meaning, the pair were head and shoulders clear of the last beam,
and the Kachin was working his way outwards and downwards, inch by inch. Jack made a terrific
effort and hurled himself backwards. He gained a few of the lost inches, and felt his shoulders
against the edge of the beam. Getting a purchase, he strove to raise himself and fling the
Kachin off. In vain. The arms were closed around him in a powerful grip, the savage face within
a few inches of his own was working convulsively with hate and rage, and the Kachin now was
blind to everything save the desire of destroying the white man.

Another twist and turn in the desperate life-and-death wrestle, and Jack's face was turned
towards the opposite side of the gulf. But this was only to show him that a new danger hung
over him with fearful menace. He looked straight down a gun-barrel. On the farther brink knelt
one of his enemies, a long-barrelled muzzle-loader in his hands. He was leaning across with
the evident purpose of firing a heavy iron bullet into Jack's brain. Yet, though beset with
death on every hand, Jack struggled on gamely.

CHAPTER XXXVII.

HOW THEY MADE A ROPE.

"He may miss," muttered the plucky English lad to himself. "Anyhow, I'm not going to let this
chap chuck me over here if I can help it."

At this moment an unexpected diversion was made in his favour. The native woman had crouched
stolidly in rear of the combat, until she saw the Kachin about to empty his weapon into his
English foe. Now she rose swiftly to her feet, a heavy stone in her right hand. Just as the
Kachin was crooking his finger on the trigger she hurled it with all her force.

It proved the luckiest of shots. The missile struck the stooping man square on the top of his
head and caused him to start violently. As he did so the jet of smoke and flame spurted from
the long barrel and the bullet sped. But not in the direction he had intended. The muzzle of
the piece was jerked a foot aside, and the wrestler received the charge full in his body. He
gave a convulsive start, then his arm fell limp, and Jack was free.

Up he sprang, aflame to see what was happening with his father and Me Dain. Long as his own
struggle had seemed, it had only been a matter of seconds, and Mr. Haydon and the fourth Kachin
were still engaged in fierce sword play. Me Dain and the third man had closed in savage wrestle,
and were trying to find each other's heart with their knives.

Jack whipped up the bar with the speed of thought, and dropped it on the head of the man with
whom his father was engaged. Down went the Kachin, stunned and helpless. But at that very instant
a wild scream went up from the two struggling figures close at hand. Jack turned his head to
see the last flutter of their garments. The rotten foothold had given way beneath them, and,
held fast in each other's clutch, they had fallen headlong into the deeps below. Jack and his
father were about to leap forward to see the last of their faithful guide, when a musket cracked
and a bullet flew by their heads. They sprang back into cover and looked at each other.

"We have lost Me Dain!" cried Jack. "Brave fellow, he has gone, fighting to the last."

Mr. Haydon nodded gloomily. "It is a cruel, bad business for all of us," he said.

A profound silence now fell upon the little battlefield. The remaining Kachins made no further
attempt at an assault. Jack peered out very cautiously to see what they were doing, and was
surprised to see them drawing off. His father joined him, and they watched the mountaineers
retire to the point where the shelf-road began. Here they squatted on the ground, lighted their
pipes, and calmly smoked, motionless as the rocks around them.

"There are two short," said Jack, after counting them.

"Yes," returned his father, "they have been despatched for reinforcements, and to give word
that we have been discovered. Their friends are on guard."

At this moment the Kachin whom Jack had felled with the bar began to move. Jack was upon him
in a moment, whipping off his girdle, and tying him hand and foot with stout strips of it.
Mr. Haydon now began to talk with the native woman. As a rule he had preferred to speak with
her through Me Dain, for her dialect contained many words unfamiliar to him. But now Me Dain,
their stout-hearted, faithful guide, was gone, and it seemed as if no great interval could
elapse before their fate, too, would be settled.

The woman had brought a small store of food with her. She ate, and offered some to her companions.
But they would not touch it, though hunger was gnawing keenly at them.

Mr. Haydon sat down with his back against the cliff, but Jack could not keep still. He moved
restlessly to and fro on their narrow patch, and glanced into the depths on every side. Was
there nothing to be done? Must they wait idly here until their enemies were strong enough to
rush them in overwhelming force?

Jack had gone to the farthest point of their refuge, and was lying at full length with his
head over the edge of the last beam. He was staring into the wild foaming torrent, when an
inequality in the face of the descending cliff caught his eye. He looked intently, and saw
that some fifteen feet above the river a narrow ledge ran horizontally along the cliff. He
followed the ledge with his eye. It ran down towards the river, narrowed, and disappeared.
He raised his head and called his father. Mr. Haydon was by his side in a moment. Jack pointed
out the ledge.

"If we could drop on to that," he said, "we might get away up the pass after all."

"I'm afraid there's not much of a chance there," returned his father. "The ledge shelves away
to the river. But in any case, how are we going to descend a precipice as smooth as glass?
It's a good five-and-thirty feet down to that point."

Jack bit his lip in perplexity for a moment. Then his brow cleared, as a sudden idea slipped
into his mind.

"We'll make a rope," he said. "There's stout stuff in these fellows' kilts and jackets," and
he pointed to the Kachins lying near at hand.

Mr. Haydon slapped his son on the shoulder. "Good for you, Jack, my boy!" he cried. "We'll
have a try at it."

He spoke a few words to the native woman, and she laid her child down and sprang at once to
help. She proved by far the deftest and cleverest of the three at the task now to be performed.
Jack and his father quickly stripped off belt, jacket, girdle, and turban from the fallen Kachins,
and their clothes were tossed over to the woman. With a small, sharp knife which she produced
from the little basket in which she had carried her food, she swiftly cut up kilts and jackets,
while the other two knotted together turbans and girdles. Half an hour's hard work saw the
heap of clothing converted into a stout, well-knotted rope. Jack took a glance at the men on
guard. They were still seated at the end of the shelf-road, smoking calmly, and confident that
their prey could not escape them. Jack now tied a heavy stone at the end of the rope and let
it down. The stone slid along the face of the precipice and rested on the ledge. Nine or ten
feet of their rope were still unpaid out.

"Plenty long enough," said Jack, and they hauled the rope up quickly.

The woman and her child were, of course, sent down first. With a broad strip of the strong
home-spun the child was bound on its mother's breast, so that she might at least have one hand
free to hold herself steady as she was lowered. At the end of the rope they made a broad loop,
and this was drawn tight about her body. When all was ready, she slipped over the edge of the
abyss with all the coolness and bravery of her race, and the strong hands began to lower her.
Foot by foot she slid down the face of the cliff, and at last those above felt the strain upon
their muscles suddenly relieved. The woman was safely on the ledge.

They now made the rope secure around the outer beam, which, luckily, was fairly sound. The
Kachin who was their prisoner was shouting and yelling at the full pitch of his voice to warn
his comrades that the fugitives were escaping. His dark eyes snapped and glittered with fury.
He cared not what danger he brought upon himself if he could but warn his friends. Jack and
Mr. Haydon took no notice whatever of the man's clamour. A hundred voices would have been drowned
in the hoarse roar of the torrent which thundered below.

"I'll go down now, father," said Jack, "and hold the rope steady for you." He slipped over
the side and was gone. Hand below hand he swung himself swiftly down the rope, and was on the
ledge in a few moments. He held the rope steady, and Mr. Haydon descended in safety.

They left the rope where it hung, and crept forward along the narrow ledge. Jack led the way,
the woman came next, and Mr. Haydon brought up the rear. There was very little room on the
ledge, but it was sound and smooth. It had clearly been made by the river eating away the softer
rock in times of flood. It descended gently towards the stream, and within thirty yards it
broke short off. The river was now not more than five feet below, and Jack bent and looked
into it. Then he swung himself off the ledge, and dropped into the stream with a cry of delight.
It was clear and shallow, and he stood in it barely knee-deep. He helped the woman down, his
father sprang after them, and they all waded on in a shallow backwater, where the furious torrent
of the main stream died away to an easy flow.

Moving on in this manner, they gained the farther side of the ravine, which had been spanned
by the shelf-road. Here a vast mass of rock and boulders lay piled along the cliff wall.

"That's the landslip which carried away the road," said Mr. Haydon.

Jack eyed it critically.

"We can get up into the pass again by it," he said. "It'll be a rough climb, but we can do it."

Jack was right. They did it. It took them an hour's hard climbing, but at last they stood at
the point where the shelf-road had joined the main path along the pass. Here they rested awhile,
for the steep climb under a burning sun had been very exhausting.

Then Jack sprang to his feet "Come on," he cried cheerily. "We'll hit on Buck and Jim's camp
yet, and with them at our back we'll stand off U Saw and his men easily enough."

"I think I can strike towards it all right once we clear this path," said his father. Mr. Haydon
had had much talk with Me Dain about the spot where he had left Buck and Jim, and he believed
that he could find the place.

"Poor old Me Dain," said Jack, in a tone of bitter sorrow; "if we'd only brought him up with
us out of the fix there, it would have been all right. He was a fine, brave chap."

"He was," said Mr. Haydon; "it is a terrible loss to us that he has gone."

They pushed on in silence, thinking of the good, faithful Burman who had fallen, close-grappled
with his enemy, into the raging torrent. From this sad reverie they were roused by the voice
of the native woman speaking to Mr. Haydon.

"She says that we shall soon be out in the open country," said he to his son.

"Good business!" replied Jack. "As long as we are between these walls of rock, there seems
a trap-like feeling about the affair."

Ten minutes later they crossed a low ridge, and at once the precipice which had encompassed
them opened out swiftly on either hand. Before them lay a huge, cup-like hollow, filled with
buildings.

"A town!" gasped Jack. "We shall be seen!"

"Deserted, my boy," said his father quietly. The more experienced eye had at once seen the
true nature of the place. Jack looked again, and saw that all was silent, and that the buildings
were empty shells. The walls of the houses stood up along the streets, the vane of a pagoda
darted aloft and glittered in the sun, but no form moved along the narrow ways, no face peered
out upon them as they passed.

Their way lay along what had been the main street of the city, and the silence, which had been
pleasant in the pass, became strange and creepy here. It told of utter ruin, and seized upon
the spirit of those who passed with a sense of haunting desolation.

Suddenly, into this eerie silence, there broke a sound which set every heart leaping. It was
the swift rattle of a pony's hoofs galloping towards them. The sound had broken out sharply
and near, for the main street was paved, and the rider had burst on to it from the sandy track
beyond, where he had ridden in silence. They could not see the rider, for the way bent sharply
just before them, and their only thought was to hide from this newcomer, for to be seen by
anyone in this country spelled danger.

Close at hand was a narrow alley, and into this they hurried. Just inside the opening was an
empty doorway, and they ran through it, and paused inside a house which turned a blank wall
to the street A huge crack seamed this wall from top to bottom, and Jack, springing forward
softly, clapped his eye to it.

The wall stood at an angle to the street, and the rider darted into sight as Jack peered out.
The latter turned and shot a single whisper over his shoulder, "Danger," and all stood silent.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

IN THE DESERTED CITY.

Jack had known the rider at once. It was the tall Malay, the Strangler. He was mounted on a
nimble pony, and flogging it to its utmost speed. A few yards from the house the pony slipped
on the smooth stones and nearly came down. This, perforce, checked its headlong career, and
the Malay drew it in to a walk. Everyone held their breath, and Jack watched the dark, sinister
figure pace by, wishing that his furious speed had not been interrupted.

He was past, he was gone, and Jack breathed more freely. Then, oh, unhappy turn of luck, the
infant in its mother's arms stirred and gave a feeble cry.

The mother hushed it at once, and the fugitives looked at each other aghast. Had that cry been
heard? The answer came at once. They heard the pony swiftly wheeled on the stones without.
A second later it dashed back the way it had come, the Malay flogging fiercely, reckless of
slips or stumbles.

"It was U Saw's man, that big Malay," said Jack to his father. "What shall we do?"

"We must push on and see what lies beyond the town," said Mr. Haydon. "It is clear that he
suspects something. All depends now on whether our line into the open country is blocked."

The little party swiftly sped up the farther part of the alley, and worked their way through
the town by the narrow lanes which threaded the mass of buildings like runs in a rabbit warren.
Through these by-ways the native woman proved a sure guide, and soon, through a gap, they saw
the open, sandy waste which lay around the deserted town.

From the last patch of cover they looked out cautiously and saw a dismal sight. The town, as
has been said, lay in a great cup-like depression. On the rim of the farther rise, straight
in their path, a horseman sat motionless. Jack knew him again at once. It was the Malay. He
had drawn up his pony on the ridge above the town, and now sat there, watching intently, a
dark figure on the sky-line.

"We are beset front and rear," groaned Mr. Haydon. "He is waiting for companions, and watching
to see which way we break cover."

Mr. Haydon had hit upon the truth. At earliest dawn skilful trackers had been set upon the
trail of the fugitives at the point where Jack had silenced the dog. Thence they had followed
them to the mouth of the pass, and had divined their number and the identity of those who made
up the party.

U Saw and Saya Chone had been on the scene without loss of time. The Ruby King ordered that
a party of his men should march up the pass and pursue the fugitives. He himself, with the
half-caste, the Strangler, and a score of other men, all well mounted, had galloped by a long
detour to gain the other end of the pass, in hopes of cutting them off. It was a long journey
which the mounted party had to make, and they would have failed if Jack and his friends had
been able to keep steadily forward. But the long delay on the shelf-road had told heavily against
the fugitives, and now, as they suspected, fierce enemies lay between them and the open country.

As the Ruby King and his followers approached the place where the pass ran out on to the plain,
the Malay had been sent forward to gallop at breakneck speed down the path the fugitives must
follow, and report any sign he could observe of their presence. He had heard the cry of the
child, and suspected at once their presence in the deserted city. Now he sat watching the hollow
and waiting for his companions.

"Can we dodge back through the city, and slip out on the other side?" said Jack anxiously.
His father shook his head.

"The lie of the ground is dead against that," said Mr. Haydon. "The place is built in a cup.
Leave it where you may, you must go up open hill-side, and he will see us at once."

"Then we must find a hiding-place among the ruins until nightfall," said Jack.

"That's all there is for it now," replied his father. "If we can keep out of their hands until
the dark, we can slip off and travel by the stars."

He told the native woman what had been decided upon, and she nodded. She knew perfectly well
what terrible fate awaited her and her child if they fell alive into the merciless hands of
U Saw. The little party turned in search of a hiding-place, and their steps were quickened
by seeing the figures of half a dozen mounted men rise over the rim of the ridge and join the
Strangler.

In a few moments the fugitives had lost all sight of the men without the city; they were swallowed
up in the maze of narrow lanes and by-ways which had once been thronged by busy crowds of city
folk, and were now given up to the snake, the owl, and the wolf.

Here and there they glided, looking on every hand for some secure hiding-place, but found none;
every house, every room seemed open to the sun and the broad light of day.

"Surely among so many houses we should hardly be found, if we lay close in some of these open
places," murmured Jack, but Mr. Haydon shook his head.

"They will split up, and every man will take a patch of the city for himself," replied Mr.
Haydon. "And they are adepts at a search of this kind."

"Hallo, what's that?" said Jack in a low voice. They paused and listened, then looked at each
other. The chase was afoot. They could hear afar off the voices of men shouting to each other
as they hunted through the deserted city.

"That sounds as if they were about the main street," said Mr. Haydon.

"Sure to be there first," replied Jack. "They're searching the place where the Malay heard
the youngster cry."

"Very true," said the father. "Let's strike towards the pagoda. It lies away from the danger
zone, and there may be a chance for us there."

As they hurried towards the tall shaft which shot high above the maze of ruined houses, Mr.
Haydon chatted coolly about its possibilities.

"A pagoda, my boy, is often a solid piece of masonry, built above a relic chamber. The latter
is a large room of immense strength, and if anything has stood in the place, that is the most
likely. If it has stood, and we can find the way in, we may be able to hide till nightfall.
In any case, we can make it an awkward job to attack us."

Both father and son had brought a dah from the battle-ground, and at close quarters no better
lethal weapon can be found.

They arrived before the pagoda, and Mr. Haydon, leaping on the first platform, ran swiftly
to and fro in search of the entrance. His wide knowledge of such buildings guided him to the
spot where it would most likely be found, but, as it happened, the entrance was not difficult
to find. They saw a low doorway half-blocked by a huge fallen stone, but with ample room left
for them to creep in.

"Here's the spot," said Mr. Haydon. "In we go. But," he hesitated for a moment, "we don't know
what may be inside. I'd give a trifle for a torch."

"We'll make one," said Jack. "There are heaps of dried sticks and grass about, and I've got
some matches."

He put his hand into an inner pocket of his tunic, and pulled out a waterproof metal box half
full of vestas.

"Good! good!" ejaculated Mr. Haydon. "I haven't had a match for a long time, and I'd forgotten
you might have a few."

He caught up a bundle of dried grass, and Jack took up several sticks, dry and tindery, ready
to burst into flame as soon as a light was set to them. All three now crawled through the low,
half-blocked doorway. As soon as they crept into the darkness, a strong, fetid, musty smell,
mingled with a horrible scent of decay, made the air pungent and choking.

"Some beasts or other here," murmured Mr. Haydon calmly. "Let's see if they're dangerous."

He struck a match and applied it to the great bundle of dried grass which he had collected.
The flame ran through it at once, and it flared up strongly. Jack thrust a stick into the blaze,
and they now had ample light to see around them.

They found themselves in a large, low room, whose floor was littered with bones and the remains
of animals dragged there for food. They darted glances on every side to discover what kind
of beast it was whose lair they had entered. But for a moment they saw nothing. There was a
movement in a bed of dried reeds in one corner, and presently they saw two pretty little creatures,
having the appearance of big cats, bound out and begin to yowl plaintively. At sight of them
the native woman gave a shrill scream of terror.

"Tiger cubs!" snapped Mr. Haydon.

He glanced quickly around the place, but there was no sign of any other living creature there
save the two cubs, which now began to frisk about the light.

"Lucky for us Mrs. Stripes isn't at home," said Jack, "or it would have been a case of out
of the frying-pan into the fire."

"It would," agreed his father. "But it isn't long since she was here," he added. "Here's a
fresh kill."

He pointed to a small buck lying almost at their feet. The blood was still wet on the graceful
creature's coat, and it was untorn save for the rents made by the huge claws which had brought
it down and dragged it to the tiger's lair.

"If this is the only place available," said Mr. Haydon quietly, "we shall have to creep out
again. It isn't healthy to ask a tigress to go halves in her den when she's rearing a family."

"We'll have a look round in any case," laughed Jack, and they crossed swiftly to the other
side of the place, holding their torches high, so that a red, dancing light was cast before them.

"What's this?" cried Jack, who was a little ahead. "What's this?" He was standing at the foot
of a narrow flight of stone steps which ran upwards and was soon lost to sight in the thickness
of the wall.

"Up, up!" cried Mr. Haydon. "This is what I hoped for."

The little party climbed the narrow, winding stairs as fast as they could go. Round and round
in the wall the steps twisted, and then they saw a dim light ahead, and came out into a second
room, as large as the one below. A broken door of teak hung loosely at the narrow opening which
led into the room, and Mr. Haydon put his shoulder to it at once.

"Here's our refuge, Jack," he cried joyously.

"Half a minute, father, before you clap that door to," said Jack. "I'm frightfully hungry."

"So am I, ready to drop," returned his father. "What of that?"

"I'm going to fetch that buck up, or a good piece of it," remarked Jack. "It's a fresh kill,
and quite sweet."

"I'll come with you," said Mr. Haydon. "Food is priceless at present, for we may well need
all our strength."

"No, no," said Jack, "I don't want to brag, father, but I can leg it a lot quicker than you
if the old lady comes home suddenly."

"Very likely," said his father. "I don't doubt that for an instant, Jack, but I'll come all
the same." They lighted a couple of fresh torches and went quickly down the steps and across
the room below. They found the tiger cubs, drawn by the scent of blood, playing with the new
kill, trying to fix their baby fangs into it, and leaping to and fro like a couple of kittens.

"Clear off," said Jack, thrusting one of them aside with his foot, "we want this."

The buck was only a young one, not more than forty or fifty pounds' weight, and Jack swung
it up from the ground by its horns. As he drew it away from them, both cubs gave a loud cry
of complaint. Their cry was answered upon the instant by a frightful roar, and turning their
heads, the two men saw a long, low, huge form gliding in at the opening with lightning speed. 

I am merely setting down that intuitional fact for what it may be
worth, though I do not hide my opinion that such promptings of the
inner, untutored man are worth more than cavefuls of bones and tombfuls
of undecipherable papers.

This reminiscence, moreover, which springs up into the light of my memory every time I think
of Don Miguel de Unamuno, has to my mind a further value in that in it the image of Don Miguel
does not appear as evoked by one man, but by many, though many of
one species, many who in depth are but one man, one type, the Welsh
divine.

Now, this unity underlying a multiplicity, these many faces, moods, and movements, traceable to one
only type, I find deeply connected in my mind with Unamuno's person and with what he signifies
in Spanish life and letters. And when I further delve into my impression, I first realize an undoubtedly
physical relation between the many-one Welsh divines and the many-one Unamuno. A tall, broad-shouldered,
bony man, with high cheeks, a beak-like nose, pointed grey beard,
and a complexion the colour of the red hematites on which Bilbao,
his native town, is built, and which Bilbao ruthlessly plucks from
its very body to exchange for gold in the markets of England--and
in the deep sockets under the high aggressive forehead prolonged by
short iron-grey hair, two eyes like gimlets eagerly watching the world
through spectacles which seem to be purposely pointed at the object
like microscopes; a fighting expression, but of noble fighting, above
the prizes of the passing world, the contempt for which is shown in
a peculiar attire whose blackness invades even that little triangle
of white which worldly men leave on their breast for the necktie of
frivolity and the decorations of vanity, and, blinding it, leaves
but the thinnest rim of white collar to emphasize, rather than relieve,
the priestly effect of the whole.

Such is Don Miguel de Unamuno.

Such is, rather, his photograph.

For Unamuno himself is ever changing.

A talker, as all good Spaniards are nowadays, but a talker in earnest
and with his heart in it, he is varied, like the subjects of his conversation,
and, still more, like the passions which they awake in him.

 It will be an awkward job to slide out after
dark and take the chance of blundering into her with claws and fangs ready for business."

"Yes," replied his father, "it cuts both ways."

"Well, we won't worry about it now," said Jack. "Let's have something to eat. Here's plenty
of meat, but how shall we cook it?"

It would have been easy to make a fire, for the remains of a couple of large chests lay in
one corner, but smoke curling from the holes would betray their hiding-place.

"We'll make some biltong, as I've done many and many a time in South Africa," said Mr. Haydon.
"In this sun the meat will parch very quickly."

He cut some long and very thin slices from the leg of the buck. Then he thrust them through
one of the holes which lay towards the sun, and spread them on the flat stone outside. The
stone was burning hot, so hot that the hand could not be borne upon it, for the sun had been
beating there with immense power for many hours. Between the fiery sun and the hot stone, the
meat parched swiftly, and ere long they were satisfying their ravenous hunger with the excellent
venison. They offered some to the native woman, but she preferred to eat from her own stock
of food.

"I wonder why this city was deserted," said Jack, as he devoured his venison.

"War, pestilence, or famine," replied his father briefly. "I'll pump this woman and see how
the local tradition runs."

He conversed with her for some time, then turned to his son.

"I can begin as I used to begin stories when you were a nipper," said Mr. Haydon. "Once upon
a time there was a great king."

"How long ago?" queried Jack.

"Goodness knows," said his father. "Time is a mere blur in these old stories. A hundred, two
hundred, five hundred years, all are one to a people who keep no written records. Well, a great
king ruled here over a busy and wealthy people. He built this pagoda and was immensely proud
of it He delighted to deck it with gold and precious stones. She says that once the whole of
the exterior was covered with plates of solid gold, and the Hti, the umbrella, that is the
topmost stage of the pagoda, was hung with thousands of golden and silver bells, and decked
with huge rubies and other precious stones. Most of these didn't belong to him. For he had
a habit of marching upon neighbouring rulers and stripping their treasuries to brighten up
his pagoda.

"At last the usual thing happened. A better fighting man came along and stripped him. He and
his people fought well, but in the end they were overcome and the whole city was put to the
sword. The conqueror had the plates of gold and a vast number of rubies, emeralds, and diamonds.
But many of the finest rubies slipped out of his grasp. The priests fled and carried them off.
Since that day the city has been a desert. And so you have the legend."

"Is it true, do you think?" asked Jack.

"Substantially true, without a doubt," replied his father. "The thing has happened again and
again. It might easily happen to-day in Burmah itself, were it not for the British Raj. These
local rulers were forever cutting each other's throats."

At this point the low murmur of his voice became mingled with a louder noise without. The sound
of busy Kachin tongues in full flow came through the tiny apertures which lighted the room,
and Jack and his father sprang to their feet.

"The enemy have arrived," murmured Jack, and his father nodded. They stole swiftly across the
room and peered through the little apertures which lighted the place. No better spying-place
could be needed. They looked straight into the broad open space before the pagoda, and saw
their pursuers defiling from a narrow street. One man was mounted, and they knew him at once
for U Saw, the great ruby in his head-dress glinting scarlet fire in the rays of the sun. At
the tail of his horse strode the Strangler, and a dozen busy little blue-kilted figures ran
hither and thither, chattering and calling to each other, and searching eagerly for traces
of the fugitives.

A loud shout presently told the Haydons that something had been discovered. Half a dozen Kachins
began to yell together, and Mr. Haydon listened intently.

"They've found the hole," he murmured coolly. "What next?"

"It's very lucky for us that Mrs. Stripes is at home and on guard," said Jack. "We could hold
them in the narrow stairs there with our dahs, but she'll do the job much better."

"Yes, for a time, without doubt," replied his father, shaking his head. "But these chaps are
splendid little shikarees, and fear nothing that stands on four legs."

They could not see the group of Kachins which had gathered before the opening, but they saw
the Ruby King wave his hand, and knew that the blue-kilts had been ordered to explore. They
listened breathlessly, but, for some moments, all was silence. Then in the vault below there
broke out a frightful roar of anger, and mingled with it came yells and outcries. The two watchers
looked eagerly from their apertures, and saw the Kachins recoiling in a disorderly body, carrying
among them a man whose legs dragged along the ground.

"Looks as if she'd settled one of them," remarked Mr. Haydon. It was soon apparent that the
tigress had thinned by one the number of their enemies. The man was laid down in the open space,
and his fellows gathered about him. But very soon they left the body lying where it had been
placed, and collected about the Ruby King in a chattering crowd.

"Clearly the man is dead," said Jack. "They do not attempt to do anything for him."

"I should say she smashed his skull in, by the look of things from this distance," remarked
his father. "See how the blood spreads in a pool about his head!"

Their eyes were fixed on the debating crowd, and they were wondering what the next move of
the Kachins would be, when they heard a low call behind them. Both whirled round at once, and
saw that it was their companion who was attracting their attention. She was kneeling on the
floor, and they ran to her at once. She knelt beside a large stone which was sunk three or
four inches below its fellows and shook easily under the touch.

"This is strange," said Jack. "We dried our meat and ate our meal just about here, and the
stone was not out of its place then."

"Perhaps our movements loosened it," replied his father. He spoke with the native woman for
a little, then turned to his son. "It sank a moment back when she stepped on it," he said.
"Just when she cried out. She feared she was going to fall through the floor."

Jack knelt down and pressed heavily on the stone. It slid away from his hands, and, had he
not grasped the edge of the hole quickly, he would have rolled after it The stone vanished,
and was heard to land with a heavy ringing crash on stone below.

"By Jove, I nearly went head first after it," said Jack. "It was as loose as possible. Where
does this lead to?"

Mr. Haydon knelt down and looked carefully around the sides of the square hole left in the floor.

"It's a secret entrance to some place or other," he said. "See, Jack, the wooden bar on which
this stone worked. It has rotted through, and the stone held its place, as you may say, by
clinging to the neighbouring stones. But a slight weight was sufficient to start it moving."

"What's underneath, I wonder?" murmured Jack.

"Some chamber built in the thickness of the floor between this room and the vault below," replied
his father.

"We ought to have a look into this," remarked Jack.

"We will," said his father; "but I hardly see how it will avail us. There might be a chance
to make it useful if we could get the stone into place, but it is very heavy, and the machinery
on which it worked has rotted away."

Jack took a half-burned torch, whose flare had been quenched upon their regaining the room
from the raid in which they had secured the buck, and relighted it. He held it as far into
the darkness as he could, and the red light showed that a ladder, built of heavy beams of teak,
ran downwards from the edge of the hole. Mr. Haydon sniffed cautiously. "The air doesn't smell
bad," he remarked; "close and musty, but no mephitic vapours. I think we'll go down."

Jack swung himself over the lip of the hole, dropped his feet on the stout ladder, and went
down first, holding the torch before him, and his father followed. They found themselves in
a low room of fair size, but not one-half as large as that above and below.

"What's that?" said Jack, and pointed to the far corner, where something gleamed white. They
crossed to it, and stood before a knot of skeletons. Nine they counted, each lying as the dead
man had fallen long, long ago. In the houses of the city, where roofs had fallen in, where
wild beasts had devoured the flesh, and where sun and rain and wind had worked their will upon
the bones, all trace of the citizens of that long bygone day had utterly disappeared, but here,
where the secret chamber had protected their remains, the skeletons were perfect.

"These are some of the men who fell in the sack of the city," said Jack.

His father bent and carefully examined them by the light of the torch.

"I scarcely think so, Jack," he said. "The bones are perfect and bear no sign of injury. It
is more likely that they were priests of the pagoda who took refuge here, and perhaps died
of famine, not daring to leave their hiding-place."

Jack moved a little, and started. In his new position a ray of red fire darted at him from
one of the heaps of white bones. He stepped forward, bent, and picked up the glittering object.

"Look here," he said to his father, "this is something in your line, if I'm not very much mistaken."

His father turned it over, rubbed the dirt off it, and held it up to the light. It lay in his
palm and winked in the light of the torch with dancing gleams of deep scarlet fire.

"Whew!" whistled Mr. Haydon, "a magnificent ruby, large, and of the purest water. Where did
you get it, my boy?"

Jack pointed to the skeleton at his feet, among whose bones it had lain.

"Could this have been their secret treasure-room?" said Mr. Haydon, looking round. "Yet it
is very unlikely. It is too large, and hardly in the place where they would have built it."

At this moment they heard a murmur at their shoulders. The woman had followed them, and they
turned to see that she had picked up a couple of rubies from among the bones of another skeleton,
and was holding them out to Mr. Haydon.

The great expert took them and examined them swiftly.

"Finer than the one you found in point of size," he said to his son. "As to purity, they are
all of the highest quality. These three stones in my palm represent a substantial fortune."

Jack had never before seen such magnificent stones. He gazed in wonder at the three gleaming
splendours, and turned them over with his finger.

"They are true oriental rubies," said his father, "of the finest colour and without flaw. Any
one of them is ten times as valuable as a diamond of the same weight."

The native woman was turning over the bones of another skeleton. She straightened herself,
came forward, and dropped another noble ruby into Mr. Haydon's hand.

"Jack, Jack," cried the latter to his son, "don't you see what this means, my boy? Here is
proof positive of the truth of the legend."

"I see," said Jack, "these are the monks who were said to have fled with the pick of the rubies."

"These are they without a doubt," said his father. "They disappeared, and the conquerors believed
that they had escaped, and so the story of their flight was worked into the tradition. But
they had hidden themselves here, and here they died. The rubies were shared among them, and
concealed in their garments. The ants have made short work of the robes long since, and the
stones have fallen among the bones."

"Then among these skeletons lie the chief treasures of the ancient city?" said Jack.

"The thing is beyond all question," replied his father. "These glorious stones bear ample witness."

The intense interest of this marvellous find had almost driven the thought of their enemies
from their minds. But the recollection of their deadly peril came back in full flood when a
hoarse thunder broke out beneath their feet in the lower vault.

"The tigress!" cried Jack. "Is it a fresh assault?"

Not another thought did they give to the gleaming treasures within their grasp. Life was worth
a mountain of rubies.

They rushed at once to see what U Saw and his retainers were doing. Mr. Haydon did not even
pocket the rubies, such was his haste. He tossed them aside among the mouldering bones, where
they had lain for so many generations, and flew after his son, who was already climbing the ladder.

They raced across the room, and now heard the savage roars of the tigress pealing louder and
louder up the narrow stairway. In the vault below they heard shots and yells.

"They have attacked her in her lair, there is no doubt of it," said Mr. Haydon in a tone of
deep anxiety. "They have without doubt flung torches in to light the place up, and shot her
as she stood before her cubs, checking her charge with fire, noise, and spears. I have known
a band of them take as desperate a risk for the sake of a mere skin to sell, so they would
certainly take it to seize us."

The growls of the tigress became more furious and deafening.

"They are running out!" cried Jack. "They are flying before her."

In the open space below, the Kachins were running swiftly from the entrance to the vault. Some
looked over their shoulders, as if fearing pursuit.

"Very possibly," said his father. "They are running for the moment, but I fear they have done
their work. See how joyous they look!"

This was quite true. The dark faces of the little mountaineers were bright with smiles, and
their teeth flashed white as they grinned at each other, and shouted as if in triumph.

"Their muskets at close range are not to be despised," murmured Mr. Haydon uneasily. "They
fling a heavy ball, and drive it with great smashing power. And again, the bullets may be poisoned.
They often are."

The Kachins did not run far. They faced about, and three or four who were armed with spears
threw their weapons forward, ready to receive the charge of the wounded creature. But no charge
was made. Had the tigress been alone, she would have rushed out, but the presence of her cubs
made a great difference. She stayed beside them, growling and roaring with rage and pain until
the very building shook.

Half an hour passed, and the tigress was now making no more than a low moan. Little by little
her growling had died away. The Haydons heard the sound diminish with uneasy hearts. They knew
that the strength of the great fierce beast was going with it, and that very soon the Kachins
would be at the foot of the stairs.

They talked the situation over, and looked at it from every point of view, but could see only
one thing to do. That was to wait for the enemy on the narrow winding steps, where but one
could pass at a time, and hold them at bay.

Jack looked round. "Where's the woman?" he said, "she has not come up."

"No more she hasn't," said his father. They had been so deeply engaged in watching every movement
of their enemies that they had utterly forgotten their companion. When Jack rushed up from
the secret chamber, he had thrust the flaring torch into her hand, in order that she might
follow at her leisure, but there was no sign of her in the room behind them.

Jack ran across to the spot where the square black hole yawned in the floor.

"It's all dark down here," he cried in surprise. "Has the torch gone out? But why has she not
come up?"

Near at hand lay a large lock of dried grass, part of a bundle which the woman herself had
gathered and brought up on their first entrance.

Jack caught it up, struck a match, and thrust the burning vesta into it. In an instant the
tuft of grass was ablaze, and he flung it into the secret chamber. It dropped to the floor,
and the flame shot up brightly, lighting the little room from corner to corner, from roof to floor.

"She's gone!" gasped Jack in utter amazement "She's gone!" Save for the skeletons, the little
room was completely empty. There was not the faintest sign of the native woman. She had disappeared
absolutely and entirely.

CHAPTER XL.

THE BATTLE ON THE STAIRS.

Jack was about to spring down the ladder and see what had become of their companion, when a
low cry of warning burst from his father's lips. The elder man had been watching the enemy,
and now he called out, "They are coming! they are coming!"

Jack caught up his dah and ran at once for the stairs. The mystery of the woman's disappearance
must wait; the first thing to be done was to keep the Kachins from their throats.

He and his father had already settled upon the point which they would occupy for defence. Halfway
down the narrow winding flight there was a small landing, about six feet long, with a sharp
turn above and below. Jack felt his way down to this in the darkness, then stood and listened
eagerly for any sounds of movement in the vault below. He heard his father softly tiptoeing
after him, and then all was silence, save for the mournful cries of the tiger cubs trying to
rouse their dead dam.

"They have not come in yet," whispered Jack to his father.

"No," replied Mr. Haydon, "but I saw seven of them start across the open space, clearly bent
on a fresh attack."

At this moment a muffled sound of voices rang through the vault and came up the narrow stairs.
The Kachins were at the entrance. Then there was silence for a short time. The next sound was
a joyous yell, which rang and re-echoed from wall to wall. The Kachins had discovered the dead
tigress. Then the vault resounded with voices as they ran to and fro, searching every corner.

The fugitives knew that the flight of steps running upwards must be discovered at once, and
Mr. Haydon gave a low murmur as they heard a party of searchers gather at the foot of the stairs.
Up to this moment Jack and his father had stood in complete darkness, but now a faint glimmer
of light began to shine up from below, and they knew that the flare of their pursuers' torches
was being reflected along the winding walls.

The preparations of the savage little men in blue were quickly made, and up they came. As Jack
heard their feet shuffle swiftly up the steps, and saw the shine of the torches become brighter
and brighter, he poised his heavy blade and prepared to launch a swinging blow. Nearer, nearer
came the light and the chattering voices, for they talked as they came. Then a gleaming spear-head
flashed round the bend below. It was held by the leading Kachin, and the second man carried
a torch to light his comrade's way.

Jack drew aside to the wall, and waited for the man's head to appear. In an instant it came,
and the dark face and glittering eyes of the mountaineer were filled with excitement as he
saw the white men within arm's length. He shortened his grasp of the spear to strike at Jack,
but the broad, gleaming dah fell at that very instant with tremendous force.

The Kachin whirled up the spear to guard his head, but the trenchant blade, wielded by those
powerful young arms, was not to be denied. It shore clean through the stout shaft of the spear,
it fell upon the shoulder of the Kachin, and clove him to the spine. He pitched backwards among
those following, and the torch was dashed from its bearer's hand. But it was caught as it fell,
and another of the dauntless little men sprang up to cross swords with the defender who could
strike so dreadful a blow.

Again Jack launched a sweeping cut at his assailant, but this time his blade was caught upon
a blade of equal strength and temper, and the iron muscles of the wiry Kachin turned the slashing
stroke. He fetched a swift return blow at Jack, and the latter avoided this by springing a
pace backwards as he recovered his own weapon.

The little man followed with the leap of a cat, and gave a grunt of satisfaction. This was
his aim, to make ground, and Jack saw it in an instant. It allowed another man to come round
the turn and support the assault with a long spear. The second Kachin was crouching low, and
at the next moment the shining head of a spear darted past the first assailant and was directed
at Jack's thigh. Jack avoided it by a miracle. He did not see it, did not know the man had
struck at him, for he was too busy cutting and parrying with the leader. But as the spear-head
was darted at him, he sprang aside to avoid the dah, and so dodged both sword and spear.

The Kachin with the spear had made his stroke so heartily, and with such certainty of reaching
his mark, that on missing his blow he sprawled forward. Mr. Haydon bent down, gripped the strong
shaft behind the spear-head, and tore the weapon from the baffled Kachin's grasp. Then, with
a growl of satisfaction that he could take a share in the fray, he reversed the long weapon,
and swung its keen point forward.

The spear came to his hand at a most opportune moment. A third man was creeping on hands and
knees beside the wall, aiming to pass his leader. He gripped a huge knife in his hand. In another
instant he would have seized Jack by the ankles and dragged him down, had not Mr. Haydon driven
the spear into him with such force that the head was completely buried in his body. He dropped
to the floor with a frightful yell, and at that moment the leading Kachin gave way and leapt
back among his friends. Jack had half cut through the swordman's right arm, and the latter
could no longer wield the heavy dah.

"Come back a few steps, Jack!" cried his father. "They are meeting us on the flat, and that
is to their advantage."

Father and son darted up half a dozen steps from the landing, gained the sharp turn above,
then faced about again. But no Kachin was following them. The little men chattered and yelled,
argued and disputed with each other, but did not advance. Finally, they retired to the vault
below, taking their fallen with them.

"First round to us," breathed Jack. "How strange they brought no muskets with them! My dread
from first to last was of a bullet being loosed into us."

"I observed as they crossed towards the door that they carried only spears and swords," said
his father. "That is U Saw. He wishes to take us alive, wounded, perhaps, but still alive.
So he forbade shooting."

"What next?" murmured Jack.

"I wish we knew," replied his father, "then we might be prepared for it." But no preparation
within their power could have availed against the cunning of the next assault. They had been
watching and waiting half an hour or more in the darkness, when again the red shine of fire
began to glow on the walls below them.

"What is this?" muttered Mr. Haydon. "This light is far too strong for torches." And now with
the gleam of fire came gusts of heat sweeping up to them, and clouds of thick pungent smoke.
Half choked, and with smarting eyes, they watched for the fire to appear. Presently they saw
it below them, and saw that a furnace of leaping flame was advancing towards them, flame which
filled the whole of the space, licking walls, roof, and floor. They watched it with horrified
eyes. It was impossible to meet this subtle and dreadful enemy with spear or dah.

"What is it?" cried Jack.

"A cunning trick, a cruelly cunning trick," replied his father. "They are thrusting great burning
bundles of dried reeds and grass before them. The draught comes up the stairs and keeps the
air cool and sweet for them, while it drives suffocating smoke and heat upon us."

Jack ground his teeth as he saw how perfectly the plan was calculated to drive them out of
the staircase into the open room above, where the numbers of the Kachins could be used to deadly
purpose.

"The fire is flagging," gasped Jack.

"For the moment, yes," said his father.

The glowing mass of flames wavered and began to sink. Then they saw how it was fed. A huge
bundle of dried canes and reeds on the end of a spear was thrust into the flickering glow,
and at once took fire and burned with the utmost fury. Fresh bundles were pushed forward beside
it, and these, too, flared up with a shrill crackle of snapping canes and the roar of a fire
fanned by a strong draught. Inch by inch the flames moved forward, themselves a terrible enemy,
and behind them crept up and up a savage and merciless foe.

CHAPTER XLI.

THE SECRET PASSAGE.

Within that confined space, the heat became that of a fiery furnace, the pungent smoke became
overpowering.

"We must get back or we shall be overcome," gasped Mr. Haydon, and they climbed the steep steps
of stone.

"Who's here?" snapped Mr. Haydon, as they turned the last bend. Jack looked under his father's arm.

"It's the woman," he gasped, for the pungent smoke had almost stopped his breath. "She's come
back. Where has she been?"

Now the woman's voice came to them calling earnestly, "Sahib, sahib, sahib!" she cried.

Jack and his father leapt into the room, where the wider space, though dim with smoke, made
the air taste wonderfully fresh and sweet after the choking passage.

The woman at once sprang at Mr. Haydon and seized his arm, talking earnestly. As she spoke,
the elder man's face lighted up with a great hope.

"Jack! Jack!" he cried. "Come on! come on! Here's a wonderful chance turned up."

Jack asked no questions. He only followed as the other two hurried for the hole which led to
the secret chamber. Discussing these matters they reached the quay near Morony Castle, and Edith
as she jumped ashore felt something of triumph in her bosom. She had at any rate succeeded in
her object. "I am sure we were right to go," she whispered to Ada.

Their father received them with but very few words; nor had Florian much to say as to the glories
of the ball. His mind was devoted at present to the coming trial.

And indeed, in a more open and energetic manner, so was the mind of Captain Clayton. "This
will be the last holiday for me," he had said to Edith at the ball,
"before the great day comes off for Patrick Carroll, Esq.

It's all very well for a man once in a way, but there should not be too much of it."

"You have not to complain deeply of yourself on that head."

"I have had my share of fun in the world," he said; "but it grows less as I grow older. It is
always so with a man as he gets into his work.

I think my hair will grow grey very soon, if I do not succeed in
having Mr. Carroll locked up for his life."

"Do you think they will convict him?"

"I think they will? I do think they will. We have got one of the men who is ready to swear that
he assisted him in pulling down the gates."

"Which of the men?" she asked.

"I will tell you because I trust you as my very soul. His own brother, Terry, is the man. Pat,
it seems, is a terrible tyrant among his own friends, and Terry is willing to turn against
him, on condition that a passage to America be provided for him. Of course he is to have a
free pardon for himself. We do want one man to corroborate your brother's evidence. Your brother no
doubt was not quite straight at first."

"He lied," said Edith. "When you and I talk about it together, we
should tell the simple truth.

We have pardoned him his lie;--but he lied."

"We have now the one man necessary to confirm his testimony."

"But he is the brother."

"No doubt. But in such a case as this anything is fair to get at the
truth.

And we shall employ no falsehoods. This younger Carroll was instigated
by his brother to assist him in the deed.

And he was seen by your brother to be one of those who assisted. It seems to me to be quite right."

"It
is very terrible," Edith said.

"Yes; it is terrible. A brother will have to swear against a brother,
and will be bribed to do it.

I know what will be said to me very well. They have tried to shoot
me down like a rat; but I mean to get the better of them.

And when I shall have succeeded in removing Mr. Pat Carroll from his present sphere of life,
I shall have a second object of ambition before me. Mr. Lax is another gentleman whom I wish
to remove. Three times he has shot at me, but he has not hit me yet."

From
that time forth there had certainly been no more dances for Captain
Clayton. His mind had been altogether devoted to his work, and amidst
that work the trial of Pat Carroll had stood prominent. "He and I
are equally eager, or at any rate equally anxious;" he had said to
Edith, speaking of her brother, when he had met her subsequent to
the ball. "But the time is coming soon, and we shall know all about
it in another six weeks." This was said in June, and the trial was
to take place in August.

CHAPTER XXVI.

LORD CASTLEWELL.

The spring
and early summer had worn themselves away in London, and Rachel O'Mahony
was still singing at the Embankment Theatre. She and her father were
still living in Cecil Street. The glorious day of October, which had
been fixed at last for the 24th, on which Rachel was to appear on
the Covent Garden boards, was yet still distant, and she was performing
under Mr. Moss's behests at a weekly stipend of £15, to which there
would be some addition when the last weeks of the season had come
about, the end of July and beginning of August. Luckily the latter was very stout and of a tough wood,
enabling him to bring a great stress on the big stone.

"Look out!" cried Jack, "it's going, it's going!"

Both of them moved back, as the huge stone toppled swiftly to the ground. It was followed in
its fall by a dozen more, and in an instant the path through the tunnel was blocked by a heap
of ruins which rose from floor to roof.

"That's all right," said Jack, in a tone of deep satisfaction. "It will take an hour or two
to shift those whacking big stones. This tunnel's a case of no thoroughfare at present."

The torch was handed once more to the native woman, and on they went. The next time she paused
was to dash the head of the torch against the wall of the tunnel and put out the light. As
soon as the red flare had been extinguished, they saw that the beams of day were pouring faintly
through branches and brushwood a little before them.

"Ah," said Mr. Haydon, "that's why the air was fairly sweet in the tunnel. There has been a
draught through, more or less."

Jack sprang forward, dah in hand, and began to slash at the network of creepers and saplings
which blocked the mouth of the tunnel. In a few minutes he had cut a path out, and they crept
cautiously forth and looked round to see what place they had gained.

They found themselves in the broad courtyard of a large, ruined house.

"May have been a monastery," said Mr. Haydon. "Now for U Saw and his men. Are we clear of them
or not?"

He moved cautiously forward to reconnoitre, Jack following him.

"Where's the pagoda?" murmured Mr. Haydon. "That will give us our bearings."

"I see it through this doorway," said Jack, and pointed to a gap in the wall. Mr. Haydon looked
at the pagoda, and noted how it stood with regard to the sun and their present position.

"This is capital," he said. "We've come out on a side opposite to the open space where U Saw
is waiting for reports from his men. We can go ahead in safety. He will have men on the watch
all round the pagoda, of course. But we've come clean under their feet, and risen to earth
amid the ruins behind them."

"I should say our best plan now would be to try to get clear of the city before they push a
way through the tunnel," said Jack. "We've certainly got a couple of hours before they find
where we came out. Then, very likely, they'll start a fresh search for us among the ruined
houses. That would give us a bit more pull in making a flit of it."

"We can't do better," said his father, and the latter spoke a few words to the native woman,
who would be by far the best guide to set them on the line they wished to follow. Led by her,
they threaded once more the narrow by-ways and lanes tangled with creepers, and sometimes so
choked with growth that they had to turn back and choose another way. At last they came to
a broken gap in what had once been the city wall, and from it they looked across the bare,
bright, open plain.

"There's no one to be seen," murmured Jack, "and if we can once get over the rim of the hill,
we shall be out of sight. What is it? Not more than four hundred yards."

They stayed for a few moments longer in shelter of the ruined wall, and looked warily on either
hand again and again. But there was not the slightest token of danger to be seen or heard.
The sun, now sloping to the west, shone brilliantly upon the open space of stones and sand,
stones too small to hide a spy, and sand too bare of brushwood to afford him an ambush.

"There's a risk, of course, in venturing into the open," murmured Jack. "But there's risk whichever
way you take it. We may as well make a dash for it as hang about in the ruins till someone
drops on us or on our tracks."

"That's true," agreed his father.

"Come on, then," said Jack in a low voice, and he led the rush across the open.

For the first hundred yards they ran breathlessly. How naked and bare the land seemed around
them after the friendly shelter of the narrow lanes and alleys they had just left! Then, as
they forged steadily ahead, and the rim of the cup-shaped hollow came nearer at every stride,
hope awoke in their hearts and they strained forward, counting on the moment when they would
slip over the sky-line, and be lost to sight of the broken walls and towers amid which their
enemies sought them.

"See that big white stone," said Jack, who had to draw himself in to an easy trot lest he should
outrun his companions, "we have only got to make that, and we're clean out of sight."

Thirty yards from the white stone the woman tripped, stumbled, and fell. Before they left the
ruins Jack had wished to carry the child, but she had refused.

"Push ahead, father," called Jack. "I'll pick her up and bring her on."

He sprang to the woman's side, and swung her to her feet by main strength. He glanced back
as he did so--he had looked back every few yards as he ran. He gave a mutter of deep satisfaction,
"All quiet!" But the words on his lips came to a sudden end in a gasp of dismay and horror.
Round a far angle of the ruined wall four horsemen swept into sight at a gentle trot.

For a second Jack stared at them aghast He knew at once what it was. Their enemies had foreseen
the possibility of such a bolt from cover as they were now making, and a patrol was on guard
about the deserted city.

Jack hurried the woman forward, hoping against hope that no eye would be raised to catch sight
of the knot of fugitives on the hill-side. A wild yell raised from four savage throats told
him a moment later that his hopes were vain. He glanced back, and saw that the riders had lashed
their speedy ponies to a furious gallop and were climbing the slope towards them at terrific speed.

The fugitives exchanged not a word. They ran now in silence, looking on every hand for some
way of escape from the horsemen who followed. Jack burned to gain the ridge and see what was
beyond. "If it's broken and rocky ground," he thought, "it may prove too rough for their ponies
to face."

He looked eagerly out as they gained the ridge, and a bitter exclamation broke from his lips.
The ground was more open and easy than that they had just crossed. They still ran on, but now
without hope of escape, merely running forward with the instinct of flight which possesses
every hunted creature. They heard the ponies' hoofs rattle over the ridge, they heard the thud
of the galloping feet close at their backs, they heard the mocking laughs and yells of the
triumphant riders.

"I can run no farther, Jack," gasped Mr. Haydon, and pulled up.

Jack whirled round, dah in hand, and stood at bay, his blood on fire to have a stroke at those
who hunted them.

The riders were now not more than a score of yards away, and coming on at the same furious
speed. Scarce had Jack turned, when the leading horseman was upon him. Jack looked up and saw
the tossing mane and fiery eyes of the pony straining to its utmost speed, and above the tossing
mane leaned forward the half-caste, his dark eyes shining with savage fire, his mouth widened
in a cruel grin. Jack sprang aside and launched a sweeping blow at Saya Chone. The latter,
with hand and knee, swung his pony round and hurled the animal full on Jack. The knees of the
powerful beast, just rising to the first movement of the gallop, caught the English lad square
in the body and dashed him headlong to the ground. Stunned and unconscious, Jack was left in
a heap on the sand, while the horsemen encircled the other fugitives.

CHAPTER XLII.

IN THE COURTYARD.

When Jack came to himself after that rough tumble he felt bruised from crown to heel, and his
head was aching dully. For a few moments his mind was in a puzzle as returning consciousness
began slowly to array before him the last things he remembered. Then he came to himself with
a start, and looked round eagerly to see where he was and what had happened to his companions.

The first glance told him that he was once more within the deserted city. He lay in the corner
of a ruined house, bound hand and foot; two Kachins, with muskets across their knees, squatted
within six feet of him, and watched him with a fixed stare. Over his head the sky was still
bright with sunshine, but the low rays told him that the night was not far off.

"They've got us after all," thought Jack bitterly. "We're in their hands as tight as ever,
and they'll take care, I know, that we don't slip out of them again."

It was heart-sickening that after their struggle through the pass, their fight in the pagoda,
and their escape by a way which seemed to open for them in a magical fashion, that they should
end by falling once more into the hands of their cruel foes. As the light faded, Jack lay and
wondered what had become of his father and the native woman, and what would be the next turn
in their strange and wild adventures.

The sun sank, and the night fell with tropic swiftness; soon he was gazing at a velvety sky,
full of bright stars. Still no one came near them, and his guards sat before him like two statues.

An hour after nightfall a voice called to them from the lane without, and they obeyed the command
at once. They sprang up, and removed from Jack's ankles the thong which bound them together.
Next they dragged him to his feet and led him forward.

At the gap in the wall, where once a door had been, two other guards awaited the prisoner,
and marched one before and one behind him. Thus closely watched, Jack was led along the narrow
lane. They went fifty yards or more, and then entered the very courtyard into which the secret
passage opened. Here a huge fire of brushwood and broken beams was burning, and the place was
as light as day, and filled with busy figures. Jack was led across the courtyard and placed
near the opposite wall.

He looked round, but could catch no glimpse of his father. He saw the native woman, their companion
in misfortune, seated in a corner, a Kachin beside her as if on guard. The woman's head was
bent upon her breast, and her child was closely clasped in her arms. She did not look up when
Jack was brought in, and her attitude was one of utter dejection. She had already learned her
fate. She was to be taken back to the village from which she had fled, and there suffer by
fire in the presence of the other villagers. Thus would U Saw teach a lesson of obedience to all.

The Ruby King himself was seated on a rug spread over the stones of the courtyard on the other
side of the great fire. A meal was just over. A smaller fire was smouldering near the entrance
to the courtyard, and beside it lay cooking-pots and the long, square baskets in which food
had been carried. Several of the retainers were still devouring the last fragments of their
portion, and the rest were placidly smoking as they moved to and fro. U Saw was quietly pulling
at a huge cheroot, his eyes fixed dreamily on the leaping flames of the great fire, and, save
for the prisoner and his armed guards, the whole scene had the air of a peaceful camp, of a
caravan of merchants resting for a night on their march.

An hour passed, and the scene had but changed to this extent that the moving figures had settled
down to a man to give themselves up to the soothing influence of tobacco. On his rug, U Saw
had not stirred a limb save to flick the ashes from his cheroot, nor had his gaze wandered
aside from the glowing flame. The quiet had become profound. Then, in deep silence, there was
a sound of footsteps approaching the courtyard. Without turning his head, U Saw raised his
hand. The gesture was scarcely begun when Jack felt himself gripped from behind by more than
one pair of hands, and he knew among them the deadly clutch of the Strangler.

He was gripped at the same instant by the throat, the waist, and the heels, nor, so cunning
had been their approach, had he dreamed that an enemy stood behind him. In an instant the thong
at his wrists was severed and his arms drawn out to their fullest extent, a rope tight about
each wrist, while his ankles were lashed together with magical swiftness and dexterity. He
was swung against the wall despite his struggles, and his body and feet bound to an upright
beam. Then the ropes which were about his wrists were drawn taut and made fast, and he was
a helpless prisoner.

Just as the last twist was given to the bonds, a group of four entered the courtyard. Saya
Chone, the half-caste, came first, and he was followed by Mr. Haydon, under guard of a couple
of Kachins. Now U Saw slowly rose from his rug and moved forward, his silken kilt catching
the light and glowing with the softest, brightest hues of crimson and gold.

"How are you, Jack?" called out Mr. Haydon anxiously. "Any bones broken?"

"Not one, I believe, father," replied Jack; "only bruises."

"If either of you speak another word," said the half-caste smoothly, "I'll gag you till you choke."

Jack and his father knew that much significance lay under the quiet words, and they remained
silent. U Saw and Saya Chone now spoke together in a low tone, and then father and son were
brought face to face.

"You are such a slippery couple, and have evaded us so often," said the half-caste, "that we
are going to pay you the compliment of dealing with you once and for all upon the spot. Now
you can be assured that your last chance of saving your skins has arrived. Here and now we
settle the matter. You can start for Bhamo or Mandalay with the break of dawn, or you can become
food for wild beasts. It remains with you to decide."

"Don't say a word, father," broke in Jack impetuously. "Don't you see that we're done for in
any case? If you told, do you think such men as these would keep their word? Dead men tell
no tales."

"That's horribly true, Jack," said his father in a low voice.

The faces of the Ruby King and the half-caste had blackened with rage upon hearing this swift,
shrewd speech, which laid bare their motives and intentions, for Jack had hit the mark fair
in the centre. Saya Chone thrust his face forward till it was within six inches of Jack's.

"Bold words," he hissed viciously, "bold words; but we shall see before we have done with you."

At this moment there ran into the courtyard a man who panted as if he had travelled far and
fast. He bore beneath his arm a small basket made of rushes very closely and strongly woven.
The Ruby King gave a grunt of satisfaction, and moved towards him.

Saya Chone now sprang forward and seized the collar of Jack's tunic. He fixed both hands in
it and ripped it open. Then he gripped the collar of the flannel shirt beneath and made a snatch
at that With a grin of vicious pleasure he rent that open too, and tore a piece of the stuff
clean out. He raised his open hand and struck the bare breast of the English lad with a resounding
slap.

"Now we shall see," he cried, "now we shall see!"

At sight of this Mr. Haydon had attempted to spring forward, but half a dozen of the iron-muscled
little men had leapt at him like cats, and kept him in his place. They hung on to him and held
him a close prisoner during the scene which followed.

Jack was little affected by the slap. He had his eyes on U Saw. He felt strongly that the grim,
silent Ruby King was the man to be feared above all.

U Saw and the man with the basket had retired to the other side of the fire, and a group of
Kachins watched the Ruby King respectfully from a little distance. The watching group now gave
a loud murmur of wonder and admiration, as if they had divined some superlatively clever trick
of their master's, and were applauding it. "Yes; I am anxious to make you an honest woman."

"You can make no woman honest. It is altogether beyond your power."

"It will be so when you have taken this lord's money."

"I have not at any rate taken yours. It is that which would disgrace me. Between this lord and
me there has been no word that could do so."

"Will he make you his wife?"

"Wife! No. He is married for aught that I know. He has spoken to me no word except about my
profession. Nor shall you. Cannot a woman sing without being wife to any man?"

"Ha, ha, yes indeed!"

She understood the scorn intended to be thrown on her line of life by his words, and was wretched
to think that he was getting the better of her in conversation. "I can sing and I need no husband."

"It
is common with the friends of the lord that they do not generally rank very high in their
profession. I have endeavoured to save you from this kind of thing,
and see the return that I get!

You will, however, soon have left us, and you will then find that to fill first place at 'The
Embankment' is better than a second or a third at Covent Garden."

During these hot words on both sides she had been standing at a pier-glass,
arranging something in her dress intended to suit Moss's fancy upon
the stage,--Moss who was about to enact her princely lover--and then
she walked off without another word. She went through her part with
all her usual vigour and charm, and so did he. Elmira also was more
pathetic than ever, as the night was supposed to be something special,
because a royal duke and his young bride were in the stage box. The
plaudits given would have been tremendous only that the building was
so small, and the grand quartette became such a masterpiece that there
was half a column concerning it in the musical corner of the next
morning's Daily Telephone. "If that girl would only go as I'd have
her," said Mr. Moss to the most confidential of his theatrical friends,
"I'd make her Mrs. Moss to-morrow, and her fame should be blazoned
all over the world before twelve months had gone as Madame Moussa."

Jack closed his eyes and drew a long, quivering breath. This torture was exquisite beyond any
bodily pain. But there was no thought of yielding in his heart. Among these dark-skinned Asiatics
he and his father stood alone, and it lay with them to maintain the English name and credit
in this moment when men of a weaker race would have given way and cringed and begged for mercy.

Summoning up his utmost resolution, Jack opened his eyes again, resolute to deny to his enemies
the smallest token of their triumph. But he found that the horrid, gaping jaws were no longer
close to his face. U Saw had stepped a pace backwards, and was adjusting his grip of the reptile
with the greatest care.

He grasped it anew and more tightly, and stepped forward once more. Now he advanced the flat
head little by little towards Jack's naked breast. At last it was so close that the cobra's
tongue, darting in and out, was touching the lad's body. Ah! that was horrible. To feel the
cold, forked tongue playing upon the warm flesh above the beating heart, that heart which would
be silenced for ever were but the keen fangs advanced an inch or so farther.

The natural repugnance of the flesh to so horrible a situation was too strong for the spirit,
and Jack could not restrain a convulsive shudder, which shook him from head to foot. His father
groaned in rage and agony.

CHAPTER XLIII.

THE FACE AT THE DOORWAY.

The sullen face of the Ruby King was lighted up with a smile of deep relish. His savage nature
was pleased to its depths to see the effect this simple but exquisite torture had upon the
Englishman within his grasp. Again he drew back a pace, and waited a moment for Jack to recover
himself. Next he waved to the men who were holding Thomas Haydon to bring their prisoner closer
to the bound captive. They did so, and now the position of those gathered in the ruined courtyard
was as follows. Jack faced the doorway, and the Ruby King and the half-caste, with their followers
clustered behind them, were on his left. His father, under charge of the guards, was on his
right, and the fire, which was now at its highest, lighted the whole scene in most brilliant
fashion.

Now U Saw raised his arm and stepped forward. His evil grin shone out once more. He was enjoying
himself to the full. Jack braced his back against the post and clenched his fists as tightly
as the ropes around his wrists would allow, and set his teeth to endure without flinching.
His eyes were staring straight before him, into the blackness of the ruined doorway.

Suddenly into that patch of darkness there flashed a face, peeping in on the scene, and as
suddenly vanishing. Jack gave a great start and a gasp. Was the torture turning his brain?
He had known that face, but it was not the face of any living man. It was the face of Me Dain,
their brave guide, who had fallen headlong into the raging torrent, close-grappled with his
foe. Jack's movement was hailed by a grim chuckle from the ring of hostile faces. They misjudged
it altogether.

U Saw once more held the cobra forward, and glanced with savage meaning at both father and
son. Thomas Haydon watched the evil creature with fascinated eyes, and saw that the Ruby King
was loosening ever so slightly, and little by little, his grasp of the head, so that the venomous
reptile was working forward through the leathern grip towards Jack's breast.

By tiny degrees the cobra worked itself on and on, but Jack saw it not. His eyes were strained
into the outer darkness. What had it meant, that face? Was it a mere fancy, or was there more
behind it than he dreamed of? Then, with another great start of his frenzied, overwrought body,
he saw something else, a thing which none saw save himself, for every eye was fixed on the
deadly, wriggling serpent, fighting to get his venomous fangs into that smooth white breast.

There slipped into the light of the fire a little round gleaming tube of steel. Six inches
beyond the doorway was it thrust, then held still and steady. Jack knew it for the muzzle of
a Mannlicher, and realised with a swelling heart what it meant. He turned his eyes on the dark
face of the Ruby King, who, with an air of infinite enjoyment, was giving the writhing reptile
a little and a little more liberty, and Jack knew that U Saw was a dead man.

A moment later the rifle spoke. There was a sharp jet of flame, a crack, and a scream. The
three were practically simultaneous, and the scream rose from the wildly-parted lips of the
Ruby King as he whirled round and staggered against Saya Chone, a slip of lead driven through
his brain.

The fate of the half-caste was striking and dreadful. The mortally-smitten man flung out his
right arm, and the cobra was swung full against the man who stood beside him, and, at the same
instant, the Ruby King's grasp was loosened. Here was the chance for which the creature, irritated
to the utmost fury, had longed. It struck, struck with all its might, and drove its deadly
fangs deep into the throat of the half-caste.

The latter staggered back with a frightful yell, and tore the horrible reptile from its grip,
and cast it away. But the work was done, and the full-filled poison sacs had emptied their
store of venom into the blood of Saya Chone.

All this happened in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye; and before a hand could be lifted
among the retainers, a whirling hurricane of lead smote with crushing fury among the close-packed
group of Kachins which had been clustered behind the leaders. A stream of bullets was poured
into them as swiftly as magazines could be worked, and half their number went down headlong.
None of the rest stayed to face this awful and mysterious foe. To them it seemed as if evil
spirits must be encompassing their destruction, and they fled from this dreadful attack, which
leapt upon them so suddenly from the darkness and the silence. Those who could move ran for
a low place in the ruined wall, climbed it frantically, and fled into the darkness, yelling
and terror-stricken.

Now there burst into the courtyard three familiar figures. Buck Risley led the way, Jim Dent
followed, and Me Dain raced after.

"Say," cried Buck, "we only dropped on this little fandango just in time. Stand steady, Jack."
With a few swift strokes of his knife he severed Jack's bonds, and the English lad staggered
aside, and was caught by his father. They exchanged a strong, silent hand-grip, but neither
could speak.

Jim Dent, a reloaded Mauser pistol in hand, was standing on guard. But they had nothing to
fear from the groaning wounded, nothing from the Ruby King who lay with his evil smile fixed
for ever on his dark face, nothing from the half-caste, now writhing in the agonies of a terrible
death.

"Say, Professor, this is great to see you again!" cried Buck joyfully, as Mr. Haydon seized
his faithful follower's hand.

"Buck, Buck, this is wonderful," said Mr. Haydon in a shaking voice. "You have come to our
rescue at the moment of our utmost need. And Dent and Me Dain. A thousand thanks. But what
are words to tell you how we feel?"

"We know just how you feel, Professor," said Jim Dent. "We're only too glad we turned up in
time to put a stopper on their fiendish tricks. Now the word is march."

"Right, Jim," said Buck; "off we go. Come on, Me Dain."

The Burman was bending over the body of the Ruby King, and stripping off his rich silken girdle.

"I come," he said, and they trooped across the courtyard together.

Jack had not spoken a word. He had clasped the hands of his faithful friends, but he was too
overwrought and bewildered to be able to frame his feelings into speech. He stumbled as he
walked, for his limbs were numbed from his bonds, and his father and Buck supported him. Near
the doorway the native woman waited for them. Her guard had fled, and she had at once sprung
to join her companions in flight.

Their path ran across the open space before the pagoda. Here the ponies of U Saw and his men
had been picketed, and were now left without watchers, for all had been drawn to the courtyard.
Three of these were caught and saddled, and led with the party till the ruins were cleared
and the open hill-side was gained.

"Now we're right," breathed Jim Dent. "I don't reckon there was much to fear from that lot
we sent scuttling. They're dangerous enough as a rule, but this time we rattled 'em all to
pieces. Still, I'm glad to be in the open."

"Me Dain!" cried Jack, who was rapidly becoming himself again. "Is it really you, alive and
in the flesh? How did you escape after that frightful fall from the ledge?"

"I had very good luck, sahib," chuckled the Burman, "very good luck. The Kachin was under when
we drop down, and that break my fall. I very near drowned, but at last I got on bank. Then
I go on up the pass, and run to the other sahibs."

"Here's the road," said Jim Dent. "There's no moon, but we can see all we want by the stars.
Up you go."

Jack, Mr. Haydon, and the native woman were set on the ponies, and then the little cavalcade
moved briskly forward, talking as they went, and exchanging experiences.

Me Dain's story made it plain that he had cleared the mouth of the pass just before U Saw and
his men blocked the way. He had put his best foot forward and regained the camp, made in a
solitary glen among the hills, where Buck and Jim awaited him. The three of them had started
back at once well armed, but had travelled on foot in order the more easily to escape observation.
Thus the night had fallen by the time they had gained the outskirts of the ruined city. They
saw the flare of the fire, and heard the voices of the encampment. Little by little, and with
the utmost care, they crept upon the Kachins and brought aid in the very nick of time.

"Say, I don't guess we need trouble much about these little blue-kilts any more," remarked
Buck Risley.

"Not in the least, Buck," replied Mr. Haydon. "The death of their leaders sets them at once
free from their allegiance. I've no doubt in the world but that the survivors will hurry back
home and plunder U Saw's house."

"And how did that little half-caste come off?" asked Jim Dent. "I hope he had something for
his trouble."

"Say, Jim," cried Buck, "didn't you twig that? It was about the best touch in the show. The
snake they'd got ready for Jack worked loose when you dropped the King, and nipped the half-caste,
and he hit the long trail right away."

"Serve him right, the little varmint," was Jim's comment.

They had covered a league or more from the deserted city, when the tinkle of running water
fell on Jack's ears.

"That sounds like a brook," he said. "I'm fearfully thirsty."

"So am I," said his father. A brook it was, and they halted beside it and drank their fill.

"Better stop here till daylight," said Me Dain. "Not easy to find the way over hills in the
dark." So it was agreed to make a camp beside the brook. The fugitives were quite willing,
for they were exhausted by fatigue, and when they had eaten a little of the food which Me Dain
had carried in a wallet across his shoulders, and drunk once more of the water of the brook,
they lay down and slept the deep sleep of utter weariness. Their fresher companions, Buck and
Jim, took turns to watch through the night.

By an hour after dawn they were all on the move, and did not halt again till they reached the
secluded hollow where the pack-ponies, securely hobbled, were quietly grazing. In a trice Me
Dain had a fire blazing, and he and Buck soon made ready a good meal. When the meal was over
they sat in the shade of a clump of bamboos and discussed affairs.

Suddenly, with a grunt of surprise as if at his forgetfulness, Me Dain sprang up and fetched
the wallet which had been slung over his shoulders. He laid it before Mr. Haydon, and began
to draw forth a long band of rich, glittering silk.

"Why, you've brought U Saw's girdle, Me Dain," said Mr. Haydon.

"Yes, sahib," said Me Dain, a broad smile lighting up his dark face as he looked up at his
old master. "And for why? You lose a big ruby. U Saw got it."

The meaning smile on his face broadened.

Mr. Haydon slapped his knee with a crack like a pistol shot. There was no need of words between
them.

"By Jove, Me Dain!" he cried, "I shouldn't be surprised if you are right."

"Right, quite right," said Me Dain. "U Saw never leave great stone like that at home. Carry
it everywhere. U Saw trust no man."

By this time the others had grasped the meaning of this conversation. Was the great ruby in
U Saw's girdle?

CHAPTER XLIV.

HOW THINGS ENDED.

All eyes were fixed in breathless excitement on Me Dain. His swift, practised fingers rapidly
explored the intricacies of the long, soft band which had been wound twice or thrice round
the waist of the Ruby King.

"Lump here," grunted Me Dain, drawing his knife. He made a couple of rapid snicks, pulled the
silk open, glanced in, then looked up at his old master.

"Hold your hand, sahib," he said.

Mr. Haydon held out his hand, and the Burman shook the girdle sharply. A cry of admiration
and wonder burst from every watcher as an immense ruby fell into Mr. Haydon's palm and lay
there glittering with richest, deepest fire.

The great expert did not need to take a second glance. "That's my stone," he said. "Me Dain,
I am indebted to you for ever. Its value to me is beyond all money, for it represents my honour
and the good faith which I owe to those who employ me. Me Dain, my good friend, I shall give
you ten thousand rupees."

"Oh, sahib," cried the Burman, overcome with the vision of so much wealth, "it is too much
for your servant."

"Not a penny," said Mr. Haydon earnestly, "not a penny too much. You have rendered me a service
which no money can repay."

Amid a buzz of wonder and surprise and delighted congratulation, the huge stone was examined
and passed from hand to hand. Then Mr. Haydon took it again, wrapped it up in a piece of silk
cut from the girdle, and carefully bestowed it in an inner pocket.

"I'll have another try to get to London with it," he said. "We ought to manage it this time
among us."

Jack stood looking at his father with shining eyes, and Mr. Haydon now turned to his son. As
he did so, Buck slapped the tall lad on the shoulder.

"Say, Jack," he cried, "is this good enough for you? You've got your father and the big pebble.
Seems to me you've worked your way through this business pretty successful. I reckon you've
been the king pin of this outfit."

"Right, Buck, right," said Mr. Haydon in a tone of deep feeling. "I was just thinking of what
I owed to my boy." 

And here I find an unsought reason in intellectual support of that intuitional observation which
I noted down in starting--that Unamuno resembles the Welsh in that he is not ashamed of showing
his passions--a thing which he has often to do, for he is very much alive and feels therefore
plenty of them. But a word of caution may here be necessary, since that term, "passion," having
been diminished--that is, made meaner--by the world, an erroneous impression might be conveyed by
what precedes, of the life and ways of Unamuno.

Her parting words were mysterious. She said, "Tell the young sahib that he will find that I
have not forgotten him."

Me Dain asked her what she meant, but, with a smile, she refused to explain, and presently
was lost to sight along a forest path, and they saw her no more.

From Mogok the travellers pushed on straight to Mandalay, where, through a merchant of his
acquaintance, Mr. Haydon obtained sufficient money to pay Me Dain the reward he had promised.
So that this time the Burman retired to his native village with wealth beyond anything he had
ever dreamed of.

This business detained them in Mandalay for some days, but one evening Mr. Haydon said, "We'll
take the first train to-morrow morning," and the others nodded agreement.

Jack went to his room to pack the big bag which he had bought to contain his share of the baggage.
The latter had been carried to the room he occupied in the hotel, and he now began to look
over it and lay things in order. Presently he came to a torn flannel shirt, and he looked at
it with interest. It was the shirt which the half-caste had rent from his breast, and he had
replaced it with a spare one which had been among their store. He raised it, and it felt oddly
heavy. He unrolled it, and found that it was wrapped round a small parcel.

"What's this?" murmured Jack. "I never wrapped anything up in this shirt."

He took up the parcel and examined it. The outer covering was of native cloth of a dull blue
shade. Jack wondered where he had seen such cloth before, then remembered that the head-dress
of the native woman, their companion in so adventurous an escape, had been made of it.

"Looks like a bit of that great bundle of stuff she twisted round and round her head," reflected
Jack. "Let's see what she's wrapped up for a keepsake."

But the chuckle with which these thoughts passed through his mind was suddenly cut short. A
lamp burned brightly on the table beside him. He untied the scrap of cloth which was fastened
about the parcel, and unwrapped the folds. He gave a jump of astonishment and a cry of amazement.
For there before him, gleaming softly and richly in the strong light of the lamp, lay a heap
of magnificent jewels, glorious rubies every one.

He was still staring entranced at this extraordinary find among his traps when the door was
opened and a head thrust in.

"Say, Jack," began the newcomer.

"Buck!" cried the lad, "run and fetch my father and Jim, and come back with them."

Buck hurried away, and in less than a minute the four of them were gathered about the heap
of precious stones. 

But we will do our best and I will see what resources I can get together
to keep you until next year, when we can all make a fresh start."

Another class of farmers, and we suspect that their number is too
large, has said, "You never made anything this year. At last he opened his mouth. "I fancy
we've seen these before, Jack," he said.

"Rather," said his son. "These are the rubies that lay among the bones of the priests in the
secret chamber. I dropped to that at once."

"We never thought of them again," went on Mr. Haydon, "but the woman gathered them and carried
them off. Now she has passed them on to you in this fashion. She must have tucked them into
the baggage at some moment when our backs were turned."

"And this is what she meant by saying that he'd find she hadn't forgotten him," broke in Buck.
"Say, Jack, you've struck it rich this time."

The fingers of the expert were busy at the next moment among the rich stones. Mr. Haydon handled
each carefully, sorted them, then took a pencil and began to appraise them roughly on a scrap
of paper. While he did this, Jack related in a low voice to the other two the story of the
secret chamber in the pagoda.

"Well," said Mr. Haydon at length, "there are thirty-seven altogether. They vary very much
in size, but all are of excellent colour. Speaking in round figures, they are worth about ninety
thousand pounds."

"Bully for you, Jack!" exclaimed Buck.

"Bully for all of us, Buck," replied Jack quietly. "If you fancy I'm going to pocket these,
you've missed your kick by a long chalk. We'll all share and share alike. Where would my father
and myself have been if you hadn't come to the rescue?"

"Right, Jack, quite right," said Mr. Haydon. In this case, as England was at war, they were all
of the maturer kind, and, while I listened to the music of their ditties--the sense thereof being,
alas! beyond my reach--I was struck by the fact that all of them,
though different, closely resembled Don Miguel de Unamuno.

 "I've had enough of Rangoon, and this trip'll
set me up as a rich man for life."

"I hope the woman kept a few stones for herself," said Jack. His father laughed.

"If she's a wise woman she most certainly did not, my boy," he answered. "The possession of
rubies would lead to her getting her throat cut as sure as she had a throat. No, no. She's
much better off with her bag of rupees."

Five weeks later, about eleven o'clock on a Thursday morning, Jack and his father walked into
the city, and sought the offices of Messrs Lane and Baumann. They had come through from Rangoon
without a hitch, and had run into Charing Cross by the boat-train the day before.

As they walked along the crowded streets, Mr. Haydon smiled, and said quietly to his son, "You've
seen a thing or two, Jack, since last you paid a visit to Lane & Baumann."

"I have, father," said Jack. "It seems years ago since I was here instead of a few months."

Mr. Haydon had insisted on Jack accompanying him on this visit. "It was in their offices that
you vowed to begin your quest, Jack," he said; "and in their offices you shall end it, as far
as the great stone is concerned."

They were expected, and were at once shown up to Mr. Lane. The latter sprang forward and greeted
Mr. Haydon and Jack most warmly.

"Welcome home," he said, "welcome home. I am delighted to see you safe and sound in England
once more, Mr. Haydon."

"And I am very pleased to see you, Mr. Lane," said the famous expert, "and glad to say that
I have brought home in safety, after all, that big stone, an account of which I cabled to you." 

Mob law we have known in Georgia has furnished emigration agents with all the leverage they want;
it is a foundation upon which it is easy to build with a well conducted
lie or two, and they have not been slow to take advantage of it.

 Ah," he went on,
"I wonder what Baumann would say to-day if he were confronted with this wonderful proof of
his folly in leaving us."

"Mr. Baumann is no longer your partner?" cried Thomas Haydon.

"No," said Mr. Lane. "We disagreed, and he withdrew from the partnership." Mr. Lane had too
much delicacy to say that the quarrel had arisen over their respective opinions as to Thomas
Haydon's honesty. Finding that he could not induce the senior partner to make public what he
believed to be the theft of the great jewel, Baumann had broken off his connection with the firm.

"I have a long story to tell you, but this is not the time to tell it," said Jack's father.
"You are too busy."

"Will you both dine with me to-night?" cried the great merchant. "Then we can have a good talk
over things," and the invitation was accepted.

As Jack and his father walked away from the offices, the former remarked, "In one way I was
much disappointed that Baumann was not there. It would have been a cheerful arrangement to
make him eat his words. But on the whole it just caps the affair nicely to find that he won't
benefit by it. Now we'll turn our parcel of rubies into cash and set up Jim and Buck with a
good banking account apiece."

His father nodded absently. Between his fingers he held the piece of shining, delicate silk
in which the great ruby had been wrapped.

"I see you've brought the scrap of U Saw's girdle with you," said Jack.

"Yes, my boy," returned his father. "I shall never part with this patch of silk. It stands
in my eyes for a good deal. I am here safe and sound, and the big stone is at last in the right
hands."

"Yes," said Jack quietly, "with the aid of staunch friends, I have come to the end of my quest."
