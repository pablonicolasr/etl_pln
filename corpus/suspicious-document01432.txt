The following papers on Village Improvements and Farm Villages are reprinted, with some amendments,
from "Scribners Monthly." These constitute the more practical part of the book, so far as villages
are concerned.

It has, however, been judged appropriate to add to them a paper on Eastern Farming, which originally
appeared in "The Atlantic Monthly," and which continues the discussion of the question of village
residence as a means for mitigating some of the hardships which beset the lives of isolated
country families.

The wide-spread and growing interest in the topics considered makes it seem worth while to
give these short essays a more permanent form.

VILLAGE IMPROVEMENTS.

It may be because the newness of our country and the fragile character of our early structures
have prevented the accumulation of inferior, ugly, and uncomfortable houses, as the nucleus
around which later building has crystallized; it may be from circumstances which have prevented
the isolated residence of the better classes of our people; or it may be the result of accident.
Whatever the reason, it is beyond dispute that the United States is par excellence a land of
beautiful villages. North, south, east, and west, there are plenty of hideous conglomerations
of poor-looking houses, with an absence of every element of beauty; but there are thousands
of other villages scattered all over the land, which are full of the evidences of good taste
in their regulation and in their management.

As a rule, these more attractive features are very much modified by the presence of badly-kept
private places or neglected public buildings, and by a general air of untidiness. Still, the
foundation of attractiveness is there; and nothing is needed beyond a well-organized and well-guided
control of public sentiment, to remove or to hide the more objectionable features, and to permit
such beauty as the village may possess to manifest itself.

The real elements of beauty in a village are not fine houses, costly fences, paved roadways,
geometrical lines, mathematical grading, nor any obviously costly improvements. They are, rather,
cosiness, neatness, simplicity, and that homely air that grows from these and from the presence
of a home-loving people.

To state the case tersely, the shiftless village is a hideous village, while the charm which
we often realize without analyzing it comes of affectionate care and attention.

There are villages in New England, in Western New York, and all over the West, even to the
far side of Arkansas, which impress the visitor at once as being homelike and full of sociability
and kindliness; which delight him, and lead him almost to wish that his own lot had been cast
within their shades. These are chiefly villages where the evidences of public and private care
predominate, or are at least conspicuous. A critical examination would, in almost every case,
develop very serious evidence of neglect, unwholesomeness, and bad neighborhood.

Within a few years, beginning, I believe, in Massachusetts, the more thoughtful of those whose
affections are centred in their village homes have united in organized efforts to make their
villages more tidy, to interest all classes of society in attention to those little details
the neglect of which is fatal, and to make the village, what it certainly should be, an expression
of the interest of its people in their homes and in the surroundings of their daily life.

The first of these associations of which I have any knowledge (though, as such work is unobtrusive,
there may have been many before it) was the "Laurel Hill Association" of Stockbridge, Mass.
It takes its name from a wooded knoll in the centre of the village, which had been dedicated
to public use. The first object of the association was to convert this knoll into a village
park. Then they took in hand the village burial-ground, which was put in proper condition and
suitably surrounded with hedge and railing. Then the broad village street was properly graded
and drained, and agreeable walks were made at its sides. Incidentally to this, the people living
along both sides of the streets were encouraged to do what they could to give it an appropriate
setting by putting their own premises into tasteful condition and maintaining them so. The
organization worked well, and accomplished good results. The Rev. N. P. Eggleston, formerly
of Stockbridge, in a paper on village improvements written for the "New York Tribune," thus
describes the collateral work and influences of the Laurel Hill Association:--

     "Next followed the planting of trees by the roadside wherever trees
     were lacking. The children, sometimes disposed in their
     thoughtlessness to treat young trees too rudely, were brought in as
     helpers of the association, while at the same time put under a
     beneficial culture for themselves. Any boy who would undertake to
     watch and care for a particular tree for two years was rewarded by
     having the tree called by his name. Other children were paid for
     all the loose papers and other unsightly things which they would
     pick up and remove from the street.

     "Gradually the work of the association extended. It soon took in
     hand the streets connected with the main street. Year by year it
     pushed out walks from the centre of the village toward its outer
     borders; year by year it extended its line of trees in the same
     manner; and year by year there has been a marked improvement in the
     aspect of the village. Little by little, and in many nameless ways,
     the houses and barns, the dooryards and farms, have come to wear a
     look of neatness and intelligent, tasteful care, that makes the
     Stockbridge of to-day quite a different place from the Stockbridge
     of twenty years ago. Travellers passing through it are apt to speak
     of it with admiration as a finished place, and, compared with most
     even of our New England villages, it has such a look; but the
     Laurel Hill Association does not consider its home finished, nor
     its own work completed. Still the work goes on. Committees are even
     now conning plans for further improvements. By itself, or by
     suggestions and stimulations offered to others, the association is
     aiming at the culture of the village people through other agencies
     than those of outward and physical adornment. It fosters libraries,
     reading-rooms, and other places of resort where innocent and
     healthful games, music and conversation will tend to promote the
     social feeling, and lessen vice by removing some of its causes."

No one can drive through this beautiful old place without realizing the effect of some influence
different from that which has usually been at work in country towns. One feels that it is a
village of homes; that the people who live in it love it, and that it has no public or private
interest so insignificant as to be neglected.

I have cited this instance somewhat at length, because it was the first, as it is the most
complete, that has come to my notice. In other places, more serious work of improvement has
been undertaken in the direction of sewerage, gas-lighting, &c. In fact, the present writing
was suggested by frequent requests for information and advice on the more practical parts of
the subject.

At the outset it is to be said that the organization and control of the village society is
especially woman's work. It requires the sort of systematized attention to detail, especially
in the constantly-recurring duty of "cleaning up," that grows more naturally out of the habit
of good housekeeping than out of any occupation to which men are accustomed. Then, too, it
calls for a degree of leisure which women are the most apt to have, and it will especially
engage their interest as being a real addition to the field of their ordinary routine of life.
The sort of enthusiasm which has led to marked success in the Dorcas Society and other organized
action outside of the household, for which American country women are noted, will find here
a new and engaging object. This, however, is only a suggestion by the way, and one which may
or may not be appropriate under varying circumstances.

If we assume, which is not altogether true, that the main purpose of village improvement is
to improve the appearance of the village, we must still understand that the direct object of
the society should not be alone nor chiefly in the direction of appearance.

What it is especially desirable that a village should appear to be is: a wholesome, cleanly,
tidy, simple, modest collection of country homes, with all of its parts and appliances adapted
to the pleasantest and most satisfactory living of its people. All improvements should therefore
have this fundamental tendency, and every element of adornment, and every evidence of careful
attention, should be only an outgrowth of the effort to obtain the best practical results.
Costly park railing where no railing is needed, width of roadway greater than the needs of
the community require, formal geometric lines and surfaces where more natural slopes and curves
would be practically better, elaborate fountains or statuary out of keeping with the general
character of the village, (the gift of a public-spirited, ambitious, and pretentious fellow-townsman,)
and isolated examples, as in a church or schoolhouse, of a style of architecture which would
be more appropriate for a city,--all these are obtrusive and objectionable, and are consequently
in bad taste. In so far as these or any other elements of improvement are unsuited to the conditions
in which they are placed, they are undesirable; and it would be well for those having the interest
of the village in charge, to adopt an early resolution to accept no gifts, and to allow no
work of construction or embellishment, which is not, first of all, appropriate to the modest
character of a well-regulated country village.

If every public building is sufficient for its uses and suggests no undue outlay for show alone;
if the roads and walks are such as the uses of the people require; if the fountain suggests
a tasteful ornament and centre of freshness and coolness, rather than a monument of some citizens
liberality and ambition; if the village green or park is a proper pleasure-ground for old and
young; and, in short, if every thing that is done and every dollar that is expended has for
its object only the improvement of the conditions of living,--then there will be needed only
the element of careful keeping to maintain always the best sort of beauty that is possible
under the circumstances.

No satisfactory result can be attained without organization. The work will necessarily require
much money and more time in order to avoid an undue tax upon individuals. It is desirable,
too, that, so far as possible, every member of the community should be interested in the work,
and should contribute in labor or in money according to his means. This general interest can
be secured much better through the influence of an organization in which all are interested,
than by any individual effort.

The association should become the distributor, not only of the moneys accruing from membership
fees, &c., but of contributions made by citizens, or subscriptions raised by combined effort
for general or specific works of improvement. It should be, in fact, not only the inciter of
public spirit, but the director of public effort.

The precise form of constitution for such an association must necessarily depend more or less
on circumstances; and I sketch only as a basis for discussion, the following form suggested
by the regulations governing the Laurel Hill Association of Stockbridge:--

     ARTICLE I.

     This Association shall be called "The Village Improvement
     Association of ----."

     ARTICLE II.

     The object of this Association shall be to improve and ornament the
     streets and public grounds of the village by planting and
     cultivating trees, establishing and maintaining walks, grading and
     draining roadways, establishing and protecting good grass plats and
     borders in the streets and public squares, securing a proper public
     supply of water, establishing and maintaining such sewerage as
     shall be needed for the best sanitary condition of the village,
     providing public fountains and drinking-troughs, breaking out paths
     through the snow, lighting the streets, encouraging the formation
     of a library and reading-room, and generally doing whatever may
     tend to the improvement of the village as a place of residence.

     ARTICLE III.

     The officers of this Association shall be a President, two
     Vice-Presidents, a Secretary, and a Treasurer, who shall constitute
     the Executive Committee. These officers shall be elected at the
     annual meeting, and shall hold their offices until their successors
     shall have been elected.

     ARTICLE IV.

     It shall be the duty of the President, and in his absence of the
     senior Vice-President, to preside at all meetings of the
     Association, and to carry out all orders of the Executive
     Committee.

     ARTICLE V.

     It shall be the duty of the Secretary to keep a correct and careful
     record of all proceedings of the Association, and of the Executive
     Committee, in a book suitable for their preservation; to give
     notice of all meetings of the Association and of the Executive
     Committee; to make all publications, and to give all public and
     private notices ordered by the Executive Committee, and to attend
     to all the correspondence of the Association.

     ARTICLE VI.

     It shall be the duty of the Treasurer to keep the funds of the
     Association, and to make such disbursements as may be ordered by
     the Executive Committee.

     ARTICLE VII.

     It shall be the duty of the Executive Committee to manage all the
     affairs of the Association, to employ all laborers, to make all
     contracts, to expend all moneys, and generally to direct and
     superintend all improvements which in their discretion, and with
     the means at their command, will best serve the public interest.
     The Executive Committee shall hold a meeting at least once in each
     month, and as much oftener as they may deem expedient.

     The Executive Committee shall have power to institute premiums to
     be awarded for planting and protecting ornamental trees, and for
     doing such other acts as may seem to them worthy of such
     encouragement. They shall also encourage frequent public meetings
     of the Association and of citizens generally, both with a view to
     maintain an interest in their work, and for the general
     encouragement of the habit of meeting for discussion and amusement.

     ARTICLE VIII.

     Three members of the Executive Committee present at any meeting
     shall constitute a quorum for transacting business; and the vote of
     a majority of those present shall be binding on the Association.

     ARTICLE IX.

     No debt shall be contracted by the Executive Committee beyond the
     amount of available funds within their control to pay it; and no
     member of this Association shall be liable for any debt of the
     Association beyond the amount of his or her subscription.

     ARTICLE X.

     Every person over fourteen years of age who shall plant and
     protect a tree under the direction of the Executive Committee, or
     who shall pay the sum of one dollar annually, and shall obligate
     him or herself to pay the same for three years, shall be a member
     of this Association; and every child under fourteen years of age,
     who shall pay or shall become obligated to pay as before the sum of
     twenty-five cents annually for three years, shall be a member of
     this Association.

     ARTICLE XI.

     The payment of ten dollars annually for three years, or of
     twenty-five dollars in one sum, shall constitute a person a member
     of this Association for life.

     ARTICLE XII.

     The autograph signatures of all members of the Association shall be
     preserved in a book suitable for that purpose.

     ARTICLE XIII.

     An annual meeting of the Association shall be held at such place as
     the Executive Committee may direct, on the fourth Wednesday of
     August, at two o'clock, P.M. Notice of such meeting shall be posted
     on each of the churches and at the post-office at least seven days
     prior to the time of holding said meetings, and a written notice
     shall be sent to all non-resident members. Other meetings of the
     Association may be called by the Executive Committee on seven days'
     notice as above prescribed.

     ARTICLE XIV.

     At the annual meeting, the Executive Committee shall report the
     amount of money received during the year, and the source from which
     it has been received; the amount of money expended during the year,
     and the objects for which it has been expended; the number of trees
     planted at the cost of the Association; the number planted by
     individuals, with the location, the kind of tree, and the name of
     the planter; and generally all of the acts of the Committee. This
     report shall be entered on the record of the Association.

     ARTICLE XV.

     Any person who shall plant a tree under the direction of the
     Executive Committee, and shall protect it for five years, shall be
     entitled to have such tree known forever by his or her name.

     ARTICLE XVI.

     This Constitution may be amended by the Executive Committee with
     the approval of the majority of the members present at any annual
     meeting of the Association, or at any special meeting, the notice
     of which shall have been accompanied by a copy of the proposed
     amendment, with the statement that the amendment is to be voted on
     at such meeting.

I have provided, in the above draft of a constitution, for an executive committee of only five
members; for the reason that, while it will be comparatively easy to secure the services of
this number, the duties and responsibilities of a larger committee would be so distributed
that there would be too often occasion for the application of the old adage: "What is everybody's
business is nobody's business." The Laurel Hill Association has an executive committee of fifteen,
in addition to seven officers. This large committee (twenty-two) serves to secure the interest
of a larger number of citizens; but the same thing may be as well accomplished by inviting
the co-operation of citizens in the work of sub-committees, the chairman of each of which would
be a member of the regular executive committee. In Easthampton, Mass., there is a board of
fourteen directors, and there are committees on sanitary matters, on setting out trees, on
sidewalks and hitching-posts, &c. It would be prudent to restrict the number of members of
these sub-committees to three; one from the executive committee and two from outside.

Besides special executive work, a vast deal has been done wherever improvement societies have
been organized, in the way of stimulating citizens to adorn their private grounds, or at least
to keep their grounds and fences in good order, removing weeds and rubbish from the sidewalk,
keeping the grass well trimmed and free from litter and leaves. What most detracts from the
good appearance of any village is the slovenly look which comes from badly hung gates, crooked
fences, absent pickets, and general shiftlessness about private places; and it is by encouraging
citizens to take a pride in attention to these minor details, that the association will do
its best work. This result may be accomplished almost entirely without the expenditure of money.
It is in attention to little things and in securing the co-operation of private owners,--a
co-operation which will call for an inappreciable amount of labor,--that the most telling work
of the officers of the society is to be done.

So far as these details are concerned, it is hardly necessary in a paper of this sort to do
more than to call attention to them. They are within the capacity of every citizen, and they
will naturally suggest themselves to any person who would be likely to undertake the direction
of an improvement association. There are other and really more important objects looking to
a certain amount of landscape gardening and engineering, on which specific instruction may
be desired, and often in cases where it will be impracticable to employ professional assistance.
These are as follows:--

1. The construction of sidewalks.

2. The construction and care of roadways.

3. The supply of water, and the construction of drinking-troughs.

4. The laying-out and adornment of public squares and other open spaces.

5. The establishment of a system of sewerage or sanitary drainage, including the removal of
excessive soil moisture.

SIDEWALKS.

No one thing has more to do with the comfort of those living in country villages than sidewalks
which are good at all seasons of the year. Those fortunate villages which are built on a gravelly
soil, with a perfect natural drainage, need little more in this direction than such a conformation
of the surface as will prevent water from standing on the footway when the ground is frozen.
At all other times it sinks naturally away into the earth. It is much more often the case that
the character of the soil or subsoil prevents a settling away of water, or that subterranean
oozing from higher ground keeps the earth throughout the spring and autumn, and after heavy
rains in summer, damp, and often sloppy. Wherever the ground is of such a character as to prevent
the rapid sinking to a considerable depth of all excessive moisture, there is sure to be a
disagreeable condition of the footway whenever the lower soil is locked with frost, and the
surface is thawed. Even with the best drainage, natural or artificial, this condition will
exist for a short time while frost is coming out of the ground; but with good drainage it is
of so temporary a character as hardly to justify any expensive finishing of the surface, except
perhaps in the case of the most frequented walks.

To overcome occasional sloppiness where the difficulty is not deep-seated, there is no cheaper
nor better device than to dress the surface with coal-ashes. Indeed, if these are used to a
sufficient thickness, they are practically as good as concrete or the best gravel. When first
applied, they are dusty and unpleasant; but the first wetting lays the dust, and they soon
settle to a firm consistency, and make a very pleasant walk, with the great advantage of being
entirely barren, and preventing the growth of weeds and grass. If the ashes of a village are
collected and screened, the cinders being used at the bottom, and the surface being smoothly
dressed with the finer material, they will make as satisfactory walks, even where the use is
considerable, as any other material. The color is unobtrusive, and the surface soon becomes
hard enough to bear sweeping. Those who are more ambitious for effect may prefer a walk made
of tar-and-gravel concrete; and this, if well made, is good, durable, and satisfactory. So
far as the improvement association is concerned, it can find many ways for expending the difference
of cost between ashes and concrete, which will accomplish a much more telling result.

If gravel can be obtained without too much expense, it may be used with excellent results to
a depth of from one to three inches, according to the porosity of the subsoil,--more being
needed where the ground is inclined to become soft. In using gravel it is best either to screen
it, using the coarser parts below and the finer parts at the surface, or, after applying it,
to add a thin layer of earth, barely sufficient to fill its spaces,--to "bind" it so as to
give it a firm and solid consistency. Loose and rattling gravel makes a handsome walk to look
at, but an unpleasant one to walk upon. Nothing is more agreeable than well-trodden, dry, root-bound
earth, as where grass has been worn away by frequent use; but this becomes at once objectionable
on being saturated with rain or moistened by melting frost.

It is a common impression, that all thoroughly good foot-paths must be dug out to a considerable
depth, filled with loose stones, and dressed at the top with some good finishing material;
but this is not necessary even for the best work. The great point is to secure a thorough draining
of the sub-stratum, so that there shall be no rising of ooze-water from below, and so that
the ground shall be free from such saturation as to cause heaving during frost. This condition
may be secured by a suitable draining of the ground immediately under the walk, and by the
use of a well-compacted and tightly-bound surface covering of such form as to shed or turn
away rain-water. Figure 1 (p. 31) shows the cross section of a foot-path six feet wide on slightly
sloping ground, where we have to apprehend an oozing of subsoil water from the land at the
highest side. The centre of the walk is slightly crowning,--say one inch higher than the sides,--so
that rain falling upon it will flow readily toward the grass-border at either side. To prevent
the ponding of water at the sides when the ground is frozen, the surface of the walk at its
edges should be well above the level of the adjoining ground; but it may be necessary under
some circumstances to furnish, here and there, a channel or surface-gutter across the walk,
to allow the accumulation at the higher side to escape. Rarely will deep gutters at the sides
be necessary or desirable. If the walk is laid at a sufficient height to turn water on to the
adjoining ground instead of receiving water from this, it will be easy to keep it dry. We will
assume that the path in question is to be made over a tenacious clay soil, with a considerable
oozing from the hillside,--the most unfavorable condition that can be found, especially in
cold climates. The first thing to be secured is the cutting-off of the subsoil water from the
hill. This may be done by digging a trench as narrow as possible,--six inches will be better
than more, as requiring less filling material,--to a depth of three feet. In the bottom of
this drain lay a common land-tile drain, with collars at the joints if these can be procured,
and, if not, with a bit of paper laid over the joints to prevent the entrance of loose material,
and to hold the pipes in place during construction. The ditch should then be filled with cinders,
gravel, or coarse sand. If stones are to be used, they should be broken to a small size,--not
more than one inch in diameter,--and the loose bits should be mixed with them in the filling.
Very small interstices will be sufficient to allow water to pass freely through, while if large
stones are used, with large interstices, there will be danger of a washing-in of earth sufficient
in time to obstruct both the stonework and the tile. The smaller the tile, so long as it is
sufficient for its purpose, the better; for lengths of five hundred feet or less, an interior
diameter of an inch and a quarter will be sufficient; from this to one thousand feet, use an
inch and a half bore. If possible, before exceeding this length, secure an outlet for the water
in the roadside gutter or some other channel of exit. The tile-drain, at a depth of three feet,
will remove all subsoil water from under the walk, and all that may be delivered into the loosely
filled trench at its side. The loose filling of the trench should not be carried nearer than
within six inches of the surface of the ground, and should be covered with fine and well-packed
earth to prevent the entrance of surface-water which would soon carry in silt enough to stop
its action. Whatever covering is adopted for the walk itself, it must be of such a character
as to prevent any thing like a free admission of surface-water. Concrete will do this perfectly;
and either ashes, or gravel dressed at the top with ashes, if well raked and rolled at the
outset to a smooth surface, will soon become so bound together as to shed pretty nearly all
rain falling upon it. The difference in cost between a walk made in this way, and one dug out
for its whole width to a depth of two feet, and filled first with stone and then with gravel
and a suitable surface dressing, will be very important; and it is safe to say that the cheaper
will be at least as good and durable as the more expensive method. In all construction of sidewalks,
whether public or private, regard must be had to the surface conformation, and some device
must be adopted for preventing the flow of water upon the walk from the adjoining ground, and
for the easy delivery of storm-water falling upon the walk itself.

ROADWAYS.

The great expense of Macadamizing or Telfordizing puts these systems almost out of the reach
of small communities. Wherever the original expense can be borne, the subsequent cost of maintenance
will be so slight, and the result generally will be so satisfactory, as to make it always a
good investment. The circumstances under which these costly forms of construction may be adopted
will be greatly extended if we can overcome the prevalent American prejudice in favor of wide
roadways. Against wide streets there is, as a rule, no objection, though exceptional narrow
and well-shaded lanes have a rural charm that will always commend them to persons of taste.
A wide street, that is, broad spaces between fences, by no means implies a broad roadway. All
we need in the principal thoroughfare of a busy village is such a width as will allow of the
easy passing of vehicles in the middle of the road, and the standing of one vehicle at rest
at each side. This will be accomplished, even in the business street of a village, by a width
of roadway of thirty feet. Under most other circumstances twenty feet of roadway will be ample.
This will allow of the moving of three vehicles side by side, and will give a leeway of six
feet between two vehicles passing each other.

On both sides of this roadway, except for the necessary sidewalks, the whole space to the fences
should be in well-kept grass, which is the cheapest to secure, the most economical to maintain,
and the most agreeable to see, of all ground covering. It is not unusual in country towns to
find a width of from sixty to eighty feet devoted to a muddy, dusty, and ill-kept roadway.
From one-half to two-thirds of this width is waste space, which must either remain an eyesore,
or entail an undue cost for maintenance. When both sides of the street are occupied by places
of business, it may be necessary to provide for some occasional driving close to the buildings
for the delivery of merchandise; but this occasion will rarely be so regular as to cause any
serious damage to grass. If the line of hitching-posts is placed within fifteen feet of the
centre of the roadway on each side, it will be seldom that any one will drive over the bordering
grass, especially if there is, as there generally should be, a well-defined gutter or well-kept
grass with a curbstone border at each side.

In considering the width to be given to roadways, it should be understood that every form of
road is more or less costly to make and to keep in order, and that the cost of both items is
in direct proportion to the width. If to the cost of making and grading an ordinary roadway
sixty feet wide, we add the capital sum whose interest would be necessary to keep this width
in good repair, we shall have an amount that would go far toward the construction and maintenance
of a road of the very best quality only thirty feet wide. Furthermore, while it is impossible
to estimate such items exactly, and while the amount thus saved cannot be controlled for the
road-making account, the saving in the wear and tear of vehicles, and in the team force needed
to move heavy loads, constitutes an important argument in favor of the best construction. The
amount thus saved in the short streets of the village, where the principal traffic is over
rough country roads, would not be very great, but it would enable the road authorities of the
township to realize the advantage of first-rate roads and the degree to which the narrowing
of the roadway cheapens construction. As a result, there would soon be an extension of the
improvement over the more important highways into the country; where a well-metalled width
of twelve feet would accommodate nearly the whole traffic, and where the proper application
of a cheap system of under-drainage would make well-metalled roads extremely cheap to maintain.

In the island of Jersey, there are many excellent roads only six feet wide. These are provided
with frequent little bays or turn-outs to allow teams to pass each other. Although such extremely
narrow roads are not to be recommended, the difference in comfort and economy of teampower
between these and the average American dirt road is enormously in their favor. The widest roads
in Jersey, leading from a busy town of thirty thousand inhabitants into a thickly settled farming
region where business and pleasure travel is very active, and where "excursion cars" carrying
thirty or forty persons are constantly passing, are only twenty-four feet wide; often only
of this width between the hedge-rows, the road itself being an excellent footpath for its whole
width. Nowhere else in the world is the rural charm more perfectly developed than in Jersey,
and no element of its great beauty is so conspicuous and so constantly satisfactory as its
narrow and embowered lanes and roadways.

This, however, by the way, and only as a suggestion, for the sake of variety. As a rule, we
may at least accept much less width than is now usual for our country and village roads. Wherever
it is intended to build expensive stone roads, those having the work in charge will naturally
employ a competent engineer, or will at least appeal to Prof. Gillespie's work on road-making,
or to some other authority. Space need not be given here to engineering details, which would
require a lengthy elucidation. There is, however, a sort of road-making materially more costly
at the outset than that now in vogue, but much less costly in the long-run, if we consider
the element of practical value and the cost of maintenance. It depends more on fundamental
principles of construction than on special processes of finishing, and will be more or less
satisfactory according to the character of the soil and of the covering material available.

The great enemy of all roads is excessive moisture; and the chief purpose of all methods of
improvement is to get rid of this, or to counteract its effect. As in the case of foot-paths,
wherever the porous character of the subsoil, and the absence of higher-lying wet lands, is
such that no accumulation of water upon or under the roadway need be feared, the greatest difficulty
is at once set aside. Roads lying on such a soil may be over-dusty in dry weather. When the
subsoil is temporarily impervious because of its frozen condition, they may become unduly muddy,
or, when the situation is such as to lead hill-water upon them, they may be badly washed; but
they are free from the great difficulties that beset all roads which for a large part of the
year are underlaid by an over-saturated, compact subsoil. Where such natural drainage is secured,
no artificial under-drainage will be needed. In many more instances, all that will be required
in the way of draining will be to lead away the sources of wet-weather springs, which break
through the road-bed and cause deep sloughs. Where incomplete or partial artificial under-draining
is needed, the need is absolute; and whether we consider the durability of the road, or the
degree to which its traffic is interfered with by its wet condition, we may be confident that
every dollar spent in well-directed under-draining will be invested to the very best advantage.
The varying conditions of wetness, and the different sources of surplus water, must be regarded
in deciding precisely how much of this work is needed, and how it should be done. Details cannot
be fully considered here; but as a general rule it may be said, that where the subsoil generally
is of an impervious character, and where the road is more or less wet and weeping after long
rains, a continuous system of under-drains is required. If the trouble is local, here and there
in spots, and is obviously caused by the breaking up of springs from the road-bed, such partial
work may be adopted as will tap the sources of these springs, and lead their water harmlessly
away. Gisborne, one of the best agricultural writers of England, put the case tersely and well
when--objecting to the system of circumventing springs--he said, "Hit him straight in the eye,
is as good a maxim in draining as in pugilism." It is best not to pass up at the side of a
spring, and so creep around behind it to head off its water; but to drive the drain straight
through it, and far enough beyond it to tap and lead away at a lower level the water which
causes it. These drains, as well as all others intended simply to remove subsoil water, and
not to cut off a weeping stream, are best made with common drain-tiles laid as before directed,
and covered immediately with well-packed earth. Water enters an under-drain, not from above,
but from below; that is to say, as water, from whatever source, fills the subsoil, it rises
therein until it reaches the floor of the drain, when it enters and is led away, just as water
falling into a cask which stands on end flows off at the under side of the bung-hole when it
reaches its level. Even if the cask be filled to the top with earth, the rain falling upon
it will descend perpendicularly to the bottom, and will flow off at the bung only when the
soil to that level has become saturated. It will descend through the soil by the straightest
course, and will raise the general level. It will not violate the laws of gravitation, and
run diagonally toward the point of outlet, as seems to be the general supposition when the
perplexing question, "How does water get into the drain?" is first considered. When we drive
a drain through a spring and into the water-bearing stratum which feeds it, we simply make
it easier for the water to escape by the drain than to keep on at the higher level, and break
out at the surface of the ground.

As in the case of the sidewalk illustrated in Figure 1, in cutting off a continuous weeping
or ooze from higher land, it is best to introduce a vertical filling of porous material through
which the water will descend and enter the drain; but, excepting this single instance, all
that we need to do, so far as subterranean work is concerned, is to furnish an easy and sufficient
channel for the removal of subsoil water.

What constitutes a sufficient drain is something very much less than what is generally supposed.
In ordinary agricultural drainage, where the lines of tiles are forty feet apart, a well-laid
tile an inch and a quarter in diameter is sufficient for a length of one thousand feet--that
is, it is sufficient to remove the water of filtration from an acre of land. If laid with only
an inclination of six inches in one hundred feet, its delivery will be so rapid as to amount
to more than a heavy continuous rain-fall upon this area. In road drainage, the same rule would
hold true; but, as the soil offers a certain resistance to the rapid descent of water, it is
best to give a means of outlet at smaller intervals; and for the best work in roads thirty
feet wide or more, three drains could be used with advantage. In no case, however, need the
size of pipes be larger than above indicated, if the form of the tiles is true, and if they
are well joined together at their ends. Tiles of less perfect form had better be an inch and
a half or even two inches in diameter; but, as a rule, they should not be of a larger size,
for the reason that the amount of water that they may be expected to carry will not be sufficient
to keep them prop erly freed from silt unless the flow is concentrated within a narrow channel.

Figure 2 shows the cross section of a country road thirty feet wide, with three lines of tile-drain
laid at a depth of about three feet below it. Except in case of necessity, these drains should
have an inclination of not less than six inches in one hundred feet. There is no objection
to their having more than this wherever the lay of the land permits or requires it. They may
often have considerably less in case of need; but, the smaller the rate of inclination, the
greater the care needed in securing a true grade. The water of these drains should be collected
into a single drain, and led away at intervals of from five hundred to one thousand feet. It
may be delivered into a roadside gutter, or into a collecting under-drain, according to the
requirements of the situation.

It is now possible to procure drain-tiles at reasonable cost in almost all parts of the country;
and these are not only very much better than any form of stone drain, but they are also much
cheaper in construction,--the labor of preparing and handling the stone, and of excavating
the wider trench that stone requires, amounting to more than the cost of the tile, even with
a high charge of transportation added. Incidentally it is proper to say that where tiles cannot
be had, a mass of gravel or fine cinders, six inches wide and six inches deep, placed at the
bottom of the drain, and covered with well-packed soil, is preferable even to broken stone
or any other form of channel that would permit of the rapid running of water and the washing
into the drains of even a slight amount of silt.

The removal of excessive subsoil moisture being secured, attention should next be given to
the surface of the road, which should be finished with the firmest material at hand,--with
the common earth of the subsoil where nothing better can be afforded,--and which should be
brought to a true grade, with a very slight slope from the centre to the edge. For a road thirty
feet wide, the elevation of the centre above the level of the edges should not be more than
four to six inches, and the grade should be made on a straight line rather than on a curve.
If the road is made as flat as the turning-off of surface-water will permit, it will be travelled
upon in all its parts; while if it is crowned to a high arch, as is often the case, it will
soon be found that the best place to drive is in the middle of the road, and foot-tracks and
wheel-tracks will soon form slight channels or ruts which will lead water lengthwise along
the road, and which will cause an undue amount of wear and washing. A road may be actually
flat to the eye, and equally convenient for travel at every part of its width, and still have
enough lateral slope to cause water to run off from it.

It is especially desirable that no surface-water flowing from the roadside (above all, when
frost is coming out of the ground in the spring) be permitted to run on to the road. This should
be effectively prevented by the formation of sufficient gutters, with such outlets as will
prevent ponding at the sides of the road. When it is necessary to carry the water of the gutters
from one side of the road to the other, culverts should be provided; and wherever the slope
of the road is sufficient to cause water to flow along it lengthwise,--that is, wherever the
inclination is more than about one in fifty,--there should be frequent slight depressions from
the centre diagonally toward the gutters to carry the flow away before it can accumulate sufficiently
to form a washing current.

If it can be done without hauling additional material, it is always well to raise the road-bed
somewhat above the level of the adjoining land, and this may usually be accomplished by throwing
upon it the subsoil of the gutters. In no case should surface-soil sods or fine road-mud be
used for repairs. The most serious objection to the absurd system of road-mending so common
in this country lies in the fact that the annual repairing is little more than the ploughing
up and throwing back upon the roadway of the soft and unsuitable material which has been washed
into the gutters.

What is said above applies especially to country roads; but it is appropriate, so far as it
goes, to the better-made and better-kept roads of a village. In the case of these latter, except
where the soil is naturally dry and firm, some attention should be given to the improvement
of the surface; and it is to be considered whether to adopt the expensive process of covering
with broken stone road-metal, or to use gravel. One or the other of these is desirable in all
cases where there is much tendency to sloppiness in wet weather; but any form of artificial
covering is so costly that the early efforts of the improvement association will produce a
more telling result if applied in other directions. The necessary cross-walks may be satisfactorily
made with coal-ashes.

It is even more easy in a village than in the country, to have the grades of all roadways so
regulated as to shed rain-water falling upon them, and to have them so furnished with side
gutters so as to prevent water from the roadside from running on to them. The simplest way
to effect this, and the neatest way too, is to make gutters outside of the line of the road,
say six inches deep and eight feet wide, these being at once sodded or sown with grass and
grain to give an early protection against washing; made on such a shallow curve, they will
afford no obstruction to any system of mowing that may be adopted, while their great width
will give them sufficient capacity to carry away the water of considerable storms.

The work of construction having been duly attended to, it is no less important to provide for
regular and constant care. Any rutting that comes of heavy traffic in bad weather should be
obliterated either by raking, or, better still, by filling the ruts with gravel or ashes. If
such work is attended to immediately on the occasion for it arising, the amount of labor required
will be very slight; for it is especially true with reference to roads, that "a stitch in time
saves nine." If the filling of ruts and wheel-tracks be done in time, the serious damage that
comes from guttering flows of water lengthwise along the road may be almost entirely avoided.

The mere cleaning work of both the roadway and roadside grass spaces, it will be easy to induce
children to perform for slight rewards and encouragement. The daily removal of bits of paper
and other rubbish will have an excellent effect on the general appearance of the village. In
the autumn the removal of the fallen leaves will call for something more than children's work;
but ordinarily this source of cheap labor will be found sufficient if properly directed.

PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY.

As a field for encouragement, rather than as an object for the expenditure of the association's
funds, the furnishing of an ample supply of water is entitled to very early consideration.
Not only is the question of public health very seriously involved in the water problem; but
as a mere beautifying element an abundance of water, to be obtained without labor, will have
a very telling effect by the facility it gives for preserving the fresh appearance of lawns
and shrubbery, and for the cultivation of flowers and vines.

Regarded from the horticulturist's point of view, the climate of pretty nearly the whole of
this country is simply detestable. We may arrange to withstand very well the severity of our
northern winters; we expect an entire shutting-up of all garden industries, and long cold seasons
are an accustomed matter of necessity: but we have never yet learned to accept with patience
the almost annual destruction of our lawns and gardens and flower-beds by scathing drought.
No public water supply available for an ordinary village would suffice to overcome the effects
of a dry season over the whole of even a small homestead; but we may hope to secure enough
to keep one or two small sprinklers flowing steadily through the hot months, and so keep a
little grass measurably green, and preserve a semblance of life and beauty in flower-beds and
delicate shrubbery. It is very rarely that it will be possible to supply water enough in a
whole week to equal in its effect a half-hour's rain; but the difference between towns where
even the small amount of water is available for the garden and those which are hopelessly given
over to drought shows how much may be accomplished in this direction even with limited means.

As in the case of road-making in any thing like a complete and thorough manner, the providing
of a water supply must necessarily be directed by professional advice. Although the simpler
principles of hydraulics are sufficiently understood, and although it would be quite within
the ability of a number of the more intelligent men of any village to secure and distribute
a satisfactory amount of water, the cost of doing such work in an experimental way by persons
unaccustomed to its details, as compared with the cost of doing it under the direction of an
engineer whose natural judgment and capacity are supplemented by experience and skill, would
be without doubt far beyond the fee demanded for his services. In this case, as in many others
connected with public and private works, it is always bad economy to save the cost of proper
knowledge. Very likely--perhaps indeed very generally--the actual performance of the work,
the buying and laying of the pipe, and all that, can be as cheaply done under home direction
as under that of a public contractor; but the making of the plans--the deciding upon the source
of the supply, upon the means for securing a sufficient head, the sizes of the pipes, the location
and construction of fire-plugs, and all the minor details of the work--will be more or less
economical, according to the skill, experience, and capacity of the person who directs it.

The sources from which water may be obtained are various. Often enough water of the best quality
may be procured by driven, dug, or artesian wells; but, whenever this course is adopted, the
wells should be located far enough away from the village, or on land sufficiently high, to
make it impossible that there shall be any fouling of the water-bearing strata by the filtration
from barn-yards, privy-vaults, or cesspools. Generally, water so secured will have to be raised
to an elevated reservoir by some mechanical force. If the demand is to be a large one, and
if the community can afford the cost, the most reliable plan will be to use steam-power for
pumping; but in smaller places, and where economy is a great object, wind-power may serve an
excellent purpose.

If a stream of pure water is available at a sufficient height, it may be led directly to the
reservoir, or its current may be used to drive a water-wheel sufficient to do the pumping.
In a majority of cases there will be found at no great distance a stream capable of supplying
the water needed throughout the dryest season of the year, but not entirely free from organic
impurities. In such cases it is often feasible, by excavating a filtering sump or pump-well
at a little distance from the side of the stream, and at a sufficient depth below the level
of its bed to secure a supply tolerably purified by filtration through the intervening earth.
The distance at which this sump should be placed from the bed of the stream will depend on
the character of the soil. The more porous this is, the greater should the distance be. This
question as to the source from which the water is to be taken is one which, more than any other,
calls for experienced judgment.

Frequently the conformation of the surrounding country is such that, even where there is no
constant stream, it is possible by the construction of dams to pond an amount of water, to
be furnished by surface washing, sufficient to supply the demands of the longest drought. In
this case, as in all others where reservoirs are used, it is important to have a good depth
of water, and not to allow, even toward the edges, any considerable shallow area. So far as
possible, the depth should be everywhere great enough to prevent vegetation, and in all the
shallower parts the surface soil should be entirely removed. As a rule, there should be a depth
of at least fifteen feet of water, except near the very edges of the pond, and as much more
than this as circumstances will allow.

The distribution of water for private use is a simple question of construction; but, as a matter
of taste, too vehement a protest cannot be entered against the common misconception as to what
is desirable in the way of public fountains. An instance in point is furnished by the public
drinking-fountain in Newport. Some years ago there stood at the foot of the Parade a grand
old stone bowl, hewn out of a solid block of granite, and filled by a pipe leading from a copious
spring. This was a good, sensible, substantial drinking-trough, perfectly adapted to its use,
unpretending and handsome. Later, a public-spirited gentleman, desiring to leave a monument
of his regard for the city, gave a considerable sum to be used in providing a suitable drinking-fountain
at this point. Those who had the control of the fund lacked either the good taste or the courage
to refuse to expend it. The result is that this granite horse-basin--one of the best of its
sort--has been removed to an obscure position; and there has been erected in its place a wretched
cast-iron combination of bad architecture and bad statuary, such as form a conspicuous defacement
of the public squares in Philadelphia, where they serve the double purpose of furnishing water
to the people, and advertising a cheap clothing establishment. The one compensation for the
violation of good taste inseparable from these constructions is to be found in the fact that
they must, sooner or later, lead the public to realize the absolute unfitness of cast iron
for monumental and decorative uses. With the artistic influences which are now so active in
the instruction of the American people, it is not perhaps unreasonable to look forward to the
day when all of these piles of pot-metal shall be relegated to the scrap-heap, and when less
offensive fountains shall take their place. We may even hope to see the iron statue and its
stove-like support which supplies water to the horses of Newport condemned to the foundry,
and its solid old predecessor restored to the position which it ornamented for so many years.

A wide margin may be allowed for the exercise of taste in the arrangement of village fountains;
and where private munificence enables the expenditure of a considerable sum, a good amount
of exterior decoration may be admissible: but it should always be borne in mind that so much
of the outlay as is needed for the purpose should go to secure a good artistic design. Especially
should the use of cast iron be avoided, as being from every point of view, and under all circumstances,
whether in the shape of cast-iron dogs or deer, or attempts at the divine human form, absolutely
and entirely inadmissible for artistic uses. Better a dug-out log horse-trough, overflowing
through a notch in its side, as an ornament to the best-kept village green, than the most elaborate
pitcher-spilling nymph that was ever cast in an iron-foundry. So far as the mere construction
work of public drinking-fountains and horse-troughs is concerned, not much need be said except
in connection with the overflow. In cold climates, there is apt to be from all such structures
a spilling of water which covers the ground for some distance with ice. This may be avoided
by carrying the overflow by a vertical pipe descending through the body of the water by some
well-protected channel directly into a drain in the ground, at a depth beyond the direct action
of frosts. If the stream is constant, this depth need be nothing like that to which frost penetrates
into the soil,--for the constant movement of the water will prevent its freezing, even if covered
only a foot deep, though to something more than this depth it will be desirable to have the
metal pipe enclosed in a larger pipe of earthenware, giving a space of enclosed air.

Where there is no public supply of water, it is better in most cases (considering the nearness
of wells in villages to cesspools and privy-vaults), to depend entirely upon cisterns. In our
climate, where rain is abundant during a considerable portion of the year, the water falling
upon the roof of any house, if properly collected and stored, is ample for the whole supply
of the family which that roof shelters. This water as it falls is ordinarily free from any
impurity that can affect its taste, and from every source of serious fouling; though, after
a long-continued drought, it is well to divert and discharge upon the surface of the ground
the first ten minutes' flow of a shower, so that the impurities of the air and the dust of
the roof may first be removed. After this first dash, lead to the cistern all that follows.
Even with this precaution, the water will be more agreeable for use if filtered. There are
numerous systems for making filters in cisterns, but no other is so simple nor so durable and
satisfactory as the separation of that part of the cistern from which the suction-pipe leads
by a wall of brick and cement. It is simply necessary to build a wall of brick set on edge
(two and a half inches thick), so as to include about one-quarter of the area of the bottom,
sloping it back so as to terminate against the side of the cistern at a height of from four
to six feet. This wall should be so well cemented at its joints that water can only pass through
the material of brick, and for strength its form should be slightly bulging. A wall of this
sort, measuring say six feet at its base, and rising to a height of six feet at its highest
point, will transmit an amount of water sufficient to supply the demand of the most constant
pumping that any domestic use can require.

SQUARES AND PUBLIC SPACES.

As a rule, the open spaces in a country village are subject to no other criticism than that
of neglect; but the exceptions are not rare where an attempt at improvement has resulted in
a sort of cemetery look that gives any thing but a cheerful, pleasure-ground aspect.

There is not much danger that persons who are enthusiastic for the improvement of the town
in which they live will err on the side of too great simplicity. The public squares and parks
of large and wealthy cities are regulated and maintained at great cost and under skilful and
artistic management; and they cannot fail to strike country visitors as being in all ways desirable.
So indeed they are. They are a chief element of the city's beauty, and, from an æsthetic point
of view, their influence is the best to which its people are subjected. But their beauty and
their æsthetic influence are both the result of a well-directed expenditure of large sums of
money. It is quite natural that an enriched manufacturer or merchant, proud of his native village,
should be ambitious to perpetuate the memory of his benefaction by providing for some corresponding
decoration of its public green, and that he should attempt to reproduce there, on the smaller
scale proportionate to the circumstances, the sort of magnificence that he has seen in the
city park. If left to his own sweet will,--as he often is if he is willing to spend money for
the public benefit,--he will, unless a rich man of the rarer sort, succeed only in producing
a conspicuous imitation.

A park-railing of artistically-worked wrought-iron will be represented by a cast-iron substitute
of much more elaborate device; and there will probably be "piled on," here and there, an amount
of cheap ornamentation which at the first glance will have a certain imposing effect. In the
matter of planting there may be an amount and variety of foreign shrubbery and sub-tropical
plants, which, under proper care, would be of great value and beauty, but which, with the neglect
to which they are doomed in their village home, are quite certain to abort. In fact, we may
expect to see, what indeed we may now see, in painful degree, in many of our smaller towns,
a halting attempt at the outside show of the city park, which, in the absence of those elements
of artistic selection and appropriateness to the conditions which are to prevail, develop,
as time goes on, into an ignominious failure.

The trouble is, that, in all expenditures of this sort, we are apt to begin at the wrong end.
In the making of a park, every step that is taken, whether the park be large or small, is a
costly one; and, if taken in their reverse order, every step is a wasted one. The chief reason
why the final decoration of a city park is so satisfactory is that it is only the crowning
work of many processes which have had the best and most careful attention from the outset.
The wrought-iron grille, the architectural fountain, the bronze statue, the delicate trees
and shrubbery, and the smoothly-finished walks and drives, depend for their success upon a
vast amount of costly fundamental work, and a provision for constant skilful care, which have
cost a deal of money, and which look to a large permanent outlay. The elaborate fence must
stand on no unstable foundation; the fountain must be only the ornamental central point of
artistic and well-kept lawns and approaches; the statue must stand amid appropriate surroundings;
and all but the simpler native vegetation must have its suitable soil, and be insured its needed
protection and care at all seasons. The degree to which these more ornamental features may
be given to the village green with any hope of satisfaction will depend almost entirely upon
the thoroughness with which it has been prepared to receive them. Could the enthusiastic members
of the improvement association be brought face to face with the cost that is needed for quite
hidden fundamental work in order to prepare their green for the more elaborate artistic decoration,
they would be deterred at the outset from attempting any thing so ambitious. Could they know
the cost of the mere work of grading and subsoil cultivation, under-draining, manuring, laying
the deep foundation for foot-paths, and securing that perfect growth of grass without which
all park-like ornament is robbed of half its value, they would set their faces resolutely against
all propositions on the part of public-spirited citizens to veneer their unprepared grounds
with misplaced exterior adornment.

If money enough can be provided to do the work thoroughly well from its very foundation, then
of course nothing more is needed than that its direction be placed in accomplished hands; but
unless this is fully assured, if--as is nearly always the case,--economy is the first thing
to be considered, then the rule of action is fully stated in two words, simplicity and thoroughness.

Avoid all fantastic ornament, and all decoration of every sort, that would be appropriate only
to work of a more complete and substantial character. Let whatever is done be done in the most
thorough way. If the ability is only enough to secure good grass, then do every thing that
is necessary to furnish the best conditions for the growth of grass, make suitable provision
for its care, and attempt nothing further. Good lawn-like grass surfaces, crossed only by foot-worn
pathways over the turf, will be more beautiful and more satisfactory than will poor grass and
cheaply made and ill-kept walks.

If something more than securing the best grass is possible, then let the next expenditure be
in the direction of paths, applying to the construction of these the principles set forth in
what has hitherto been said about sidewalks. In the case of level walks, with imperfect means
of drainage, it is often desirable to secure the better foundation that is given by filling
in to the depth of a foot or more with small stone.

       *       *       *       *       *

Whatever may be the natural character of the soil, unless always well drained by a porous subsoil,
the first step toward establishing a good lawn is to secure perfect underdrainage. Establish
a good outlet at the depth of three and a half or four feet below the surface at the lowest
point of the area to be drained, and then, selecting the necessary lines for main drains, lay
out parallel lines (thirty feet apart at a depth of three and a half feet, or forty feet apart
at a depth of four feet) to include the whole area, and on these lines lay well-constructed
drains of small open-jointed tiles. Cover these tiles with the most compact earth that has
been excavated, and, after filling to a depth of one foot, tramp or ram this earth tightly.
Then fill the rest of the trench, heaping over the lines any excess of material that may need
the settling effect of heavy rains to work it into place.

The next step is to reverse or thoroughly mix the whole soil to a depth of at least fifteen
inches. This work can be completely done only with the aid of hand-shovelling, but the aid
of the plough will greatly facilitate it. Its purpose is to secure such an admixture of the
organic matter of the surface soil with the more compact material of the subsoil as will make
it sufficiently porous and fertile for the easy penetration of roots. It is best that this
work should be done in autumn; and, if the land is level, that the freshly raised subsoil should
be left exposed in its rough and lumpy condition--without harrowing--to the frosts of winter.
If washing is to be apprehended, then sow the ground thickly with rye, harrowing in the seed
only roughly. If the seed is sown early enough, the growth will be sufficient to protect the
surface from washing. During the winter, let the whole surface be heavily covered with stable-manure,--the
more heavily the better, as there is no limit to the amount of coarse manure that may with
advantage be used for the establishment of permanent grass. In the spring, as soon as the ground
is dry enough to work easily, plough in the manure with as shallow furrows as will suffice
to cover the most of it; then harrow repeatedly, bringing the surface to as true a grade as
possible, and sow it heavily with a mixture of Rhode Island bent grass, Kentucky blue grass,
and white clover. As soon as the seed is well sprouted, showing green over the whole ground,
roll the area repeatedly and thoroughly until it is as smooth and hard as it is possible to
make it. As soon as the grass has attained the height of three inches, let it be cut with a
lawn-mower, and let the cutting be repeated at least weekly throughout the season of rapid
growth, and as often as necessary until the end of autumn.

If paths are to be made, it will simplify matters to make them after the grass has become well
established, supposing only a good surface footway of ashes or concrete to be needed; for the
small amount of excavation necessary under either of these systems may be scattered over the
grass spaces without injury. But if the more thorough system is adopted of underlaying the
walk with a foot or more of stones, then the work, except the final dressing of gravel or ashes,
should be done in the autumn, or, in any case, before the final preparation of the soil for
seeding.

Concerning trees and ornamental shrubbery for parks and open spaces, it is not possible to
give detailed directions here, beyond recommending, as in the case of roadside plantations,
that, unless the work is to remain permanently in the charge of an experienced gardener, with
the necessary appliances for the care and protection of the more delicate specimens, the arrangement
and the selection should be confined to the more hardy and vigorous trees and shrubs which
experience has shown to be adapted to the climate and soil of the locality.

For roadsides, and largely in parks and village greens, the world offers no tree that can compare
in dignity and grace with the broad-spreading American elm; though, for the sake of variety,
and for the sake of an earlier effect, many other trees may be added.

VILLAGE SANITARY WORK.

It is a recently recognized but an old and universal truth, that human life involves the production
of refuse matters, which, unless proper safeguards are taken, are sure to become a source of
disease and death. The danger is not confined alone nor chiefly to that element of household
waste which is most manifestly offensive, but in almost equal degree to all manner of organic
refuse. It is true that fæcal matters are often accompanied by the inciting agent of the propagation
of infectious diseases. For convenience, and as indicating the more probable means for disseminating
infection, we may call this agent "germs." It has not yet been demonstrated with scientific
completeness that a disease is spread by living germs whose growth in a new body produces a
corresponding disorder; but all that is known of the circumstances of infection, and of the
means for preventing it, may be fully explained by this theory. Typhoid fever, cholera, epidemic
diarrh[oe]a, and some other prevalent diseases, are presumed by the germ theory to be chiefly,
if not entirely, propagated by germs thrown off by a diseased body. So far as these ailments
are concerned, there is therefore a very serious element of danger added in the case of fæces
to the other evil effects which are produced by an improper disposal of any refuse organic
matter. That any one or all of these diseases can originate from the decomposition, under certain
circumstances of fæcal matters, is not clearly determined. There is, however, good reason for
believing that one common effect of the gases arising from improperly treated matters of this
kind is to debilitate the human system, and so to create a disposition to receive contagion,
or to succumb to minor diseases which are not contagious.

The same debilitating effect and the same injurious influences often result from the neglect
of other organic wastes. The refuse of the kitchen sink is free from fæcal matter; but it contains,
in a greater or less degree, precisely the kind of organic material which has gone to make
up the more offensive substance. If its final disposition is such as to contaminate the water
that we drink or the air that we breathe with the products of their decay, the danger to life
is hardly less than that from the decomposition of fæcal accumulations.

It is proposed now to set forth, in the simplest way and without much discussion of principles
(which may be studied elsewhere), the methods and processes by which village households and
communities may be protected against the influences that come from an excess of soil-moisture,
from damp walls, and from imperfect removal or improper disposal of organic filth.

We will assume that a village has a water supply sufficient to admit of the use of water-closets
in all houses, and to furnish a good flushing for kitchen sinks, &c. A necessary complement
of this work--indeed, it should properly precede it--is the establishment of a system of sewers
by which all of this liquid outflow may be carried safely away. It would be out of the question
in a small or scattered community, especially where roadways are unpaved, to establish any
system which should include in its working the removal of surface water. The moment we undertake
to make sewers of sufficient capacity to carry away the storm water of large districts, then
we enormously increase the scale and cost of the work.

So far as the removal of house sewage alone is concerned, the work need by no means be very
costly. If a tolerable inclination can be given to the line of sewers,--say a fall of one in
two hundred,--a six-inch pipe will have a capacity quite up to the requirements of a village
of two thousand inhabitants using one hundred gallons of water per day per head. It will, however,
be safe to use a pipe of this size only when it is true in form and carefully laid, so that
there shall be no retarding of the flow at the joints from the intrusion of mortar, or any
other form of irregularity. Unless the joints are wiped quite smooth, the roughness remaining
will serve as a nucleus for the accumulation of hair, shreds of cloth, and other matters which
will hold silt and grease, and form in time a serious obstruction. Nothing smaller than six-inch
pipe should be adopted for a street sewer. Unless the work is to be most carefully done, for
all but the branch lines, for a population of five thousand, or less according to the fall
of the sewer, it will be safer to use eight-inch pipes. These pipes must be laid with great
accuracy as to grade and direction. All corners should be turned with curves of large radius
and regular sweep, and with an additional fall to compensate for the increased resistance of
curves. The weight of the pipe should not be supported upon the sockets (see Figure 3), partly
as a question of strength, and partly because any irregularity of form or thickness of the
socket would change the inclination of the sewer. The bottom of the trench being brought exactly
to the required grade, let there be dug out a depression greater than the projection of the
socket, the pipe resting upon its finished bottom for its whole length. (See Figure 4.) Too
much care cannot be given to the thorough filling with cement of the space between the socket
and the pipe inserted into it; the whole circle being well flushed and wiped, so that there
may be no possibility of leakage.

The objection to leakage is twofold: sewage matters escaping into the soil might contaminate
wells and springs; and it would also rob the flow through the pipes of water needed to carry
forward the more solid contents. The continued efficiency of these small drains for carrying
away the solid or semi-solid outflow of the house is dependent very largely upon the presence
of sufficient water to create a scouring current. While eight-inch pipes are admissible as
a safeguard against imperfect laying, they are liable to the grave objection, that, where the
service to be performed is greatly less than their capacity, the stream flowing through them
will not be sufficiently concentrated to carry forward the more solid parts of the sewage.
Up to the limit of their capacity, six-inch pipes properly laid are greatly to be preferred,
as insuring a deeper stream which will more generally attain the velocity of three feet per
second, needed to move the heavier constituents of the sewage. The difference in cost between
six-inch and eight-inch pipes will be sufficient to cover any extra cost of the most careful
workmanship. However much attention may be given to the cementing of the joints, it will be
impossible to prevent the running into the pipes of a certain amount of mortar; and the workman
should have a swab or a disk of India rubber of the exact size of the bore of the pipe, with
a short handle attached to its middle, to draw forward as each joint is finished, and so scrape
away any excess of mortar before it hardens.

Wherever it is, or may probably become, necessary to attach a house-drain or land-drain, there
should be used a length of pipe having a side branch, oblique to the direction of the flow,
to receive such connection. The location of these branches should be accurately indicated on
the plan; and they should be closed with a flat stone or a bit of slate, well cemented in place.

It will at times be necessary to use larger conduits than even an eight-inch pipe. Up to a
diameter of fifteen inches, it is cheapest to use pipes, but for eighteen inches or more, brick-work
is cheaper; and at that size--a considerable regular flow of water being insured--the slight
roughness of brick-work offers no serious objection. The use of oval or egg-shaped sewers will
rarely be necessary under the circumstances that we are considering; but there may be exceptional
conditions where the covering-in of a brook, or storm-water course, cannot be avoided; and
in such cases the volume of water may vary so greatly that there will at times be a mere thread
of a stream, and at times a torrent. Here the oval form is the best, as concentrating a small
flow within a narrow and deep channel, and still giving the capacity needed for exceptionally
large volumes. All bricks used for sewers, man-holes, &c., should be of the very hardest quality,
and true in form. The general rule is to be kept in mind, that the thickness of the wall of
a brick sewer should not be less than one-ninth of the inner diameter; that is to say, that
up to a diameter of three feet the thickness of the wall should equal the width of a brick,--four
inches. This applies to circular sewers only: the oval form, being less strong, calls for a
wall of a thickness equal to one-eighth of the largest diameter.

Connecting drains leading from houses to the sewer are to be made at private cost; but they
should be made in accordance with plans furnished by the public authority, and by a workman
acceptable to that authority.

The householder might be permitted to take the responsibility of the finishing of his drain,
but for the fact that the working of the public sewer calls for the largest amount of water
in proportion to the amount of solid matters that it is possible to secure, and thus makes
it imperative that this drain should be absolutely tight, so that the liquid parts of the house
outflow shall not trickle away through its joints, leaving only the more solid parts to flow
into the public sewer.

Properly graded and smoothly jointed, a four-inch pipe will carry more water than even the
largest boarding-house or country hotel is likely to discharge. There is, however, a tendency
in all house-drains to become filled in the early part of their course by the accumulation
of grease and solid matters caught in the grease. Where no form of grease-trap is used, there
is a certain argument in favor of the use of six-inch pipes for the upper part of house-drains.
The use of a grease-trap, however, should always be insisted upon; and with its aid these obstructing
matters will be retained, and the outflow may be perfectly carried by a four-inch pipe.

So far as the public sewer is concerned, it makes little difference what is the size of the
house connection drain through the greater part of its course; but the junction with the sewer
should, under no circumstances, where six-inch sewer-pipes are adopted, be more than four inches.
I should even insist on four-inch connections with an eight-inch sewer. Through neglect, or
by reason of improper management, many kinds of rubbish find their way into house-drains; and
a four-inch opening will admit as many of these into the sewer as it will be able to carry
away. If, by reason of bad construction or neglect, an obstruction is to be caused at any point,
it should be in the drain, which the person responsible for it must cleanse or repair.

The grease-trap referred to above may be any form of reservoir which will retain the flow from
the kitchen sink until it has time to cool, when its grease will be solidified, and will float
at the surface. The outlet from this trap should be at such a distance below the surface of
the water, that there will be no danger of its floating matter passing in with the discharge.
A very simple device for this purpose is shown in Figure 5. From a trap of this sort the flow
is constant whenever additions are made to its contents.

Figure 6 shows the invention of an English engineer, Mr. Rogers Field, which has the effect
of retaining all of the outflow from the kitchen sink until it is entirely filled,--say thirty
gallons. When filled, any sudden addition of a few quarts of water, as from the emptying of
a dish-pan, brings into action a siphon whose entrance is near the bottom of the tank; and
this siphon rapidly discharges all of the contents above its mouth in a flow having sufficient
force to carry forward not only any solid matters which it may contain, but also any ordinary
obstructing accumulations in the drain below. The soil-pipe, carrying the discharge of water-closets,
should not be delivered into the flush-tank, but at a point farther down the drain, so that
any solid matter it may deposit shall be swept forward by the next action of the flush-tank.
The more often the flush-tank is filled, and the greater the proportion of its water to its
impurities, the more efficient will be its action. Therefore the slop closet waste leading
from the upper story, and even the outlet pipes of bathing-tubs, may with advantage be delivered
into it.

Although the flush-tank may receive no fæcal matter, and even though the housemaid's sink may
not deliver into it, it will contain in the discharge from the kitchen alone an amount of organic
matter which will produce offensive and dangerous gases by its decomposition. To provide for
the safe removal of these gases, a ventilating pipe should be carried up to some point not
near to any window or chimney-top.

From the time the sewers are ready for service no accumulation of fæcal matter or other organic
household waste should be allowed to remain in the village. All old vaults and cesspools should
be filled with earth, and disinfected by the admixture of lime with the upper layers of the
filling. The use of water-closets in all houses should be made imperative; and the construction
and arrangement of soil-pipes and of all outlets should be regulated by the health authorities.

It is not worth while here to discuss the details of the construction of water-closets and
other interior plumbing work, except with reference to soil-pipes and such drains as may deliver
the outflow of soil-pipes to the public sewer. The soil-pipe should be of cast iron, carefully
jointed with lead, not less than four inches in diameter, and carried by the straightest course
possible up through the roof and generally higher than the ridge-pole. Its open top must not
be near any window, and if within ten feet of a chimney it should be at least one foot below
the level of the top of that chimney. There should be no trap in the soil-pipe, and no trap
in a private drain between the outlet of the soil-pipe and the sewer. The reasons for this
rule are twofold:--

1. No matter what amount of water may be used for flushing out the soil-pipe, its sides will
always be more or less coated with organic filth; and, however slight this coating, there will
be a certain amount of decomposition. The decomposition of all such matters must be rapid and
complete, not slow and partial. A necessary condition of complete destructive decomposition
is an abundance of atmospheric air to supply the oxygen which complete decomposition demands.
If the soil-pipe is closed at its top, or if it is obstructed by a trap in the lower part of
its course, there can be no such circulation of air as safety requires.

If there is an opportunity for the free admission of air from the well-ventilated sewer to
feed the upward current almost constantly prevailing in a soil-pipe open at both ends, the
gases resulting from the decomposition will be of a different and less injurious character
than where the air is confined,--and by the mere volume of air passing through the pipe they
will be so diluted that even were they originally poisonous their power for harm will be lessened.

The gases formed by the decomposition of organic matter in the sewer itself, or in the soil-pipe,
have a certain expansive force which is greatly increased by the elevation of temperature,
caused, for example, by the discharge of hot water into the pipe or sewer. If the soil-pipe
is open at its upper end this expansion will be at once relieved; but if the top of the pipe
be closed there will always be danger of the forcing of the feeble barrier offered by the ordinary
water-seal trap of a branch pipe leading from a wash-basin or sink. Then, too, the sealing-water
of the trap readily absorbs any foul gases presented at its outer end, toward the soil-pipe,
and gives it off in an unchanged condition at the inner or house end. Such traps retard, but
do not prevent, the entrance of sewer gases into the house. Water-seal traps which are unused
for any considerable time are emptied by evaporation, and thus open a channel through which
the air of the soil-pipe may find its way into the house.

It is usual in modern plumbing to relieve the pressure of gas in the soil-pipe by what is called
a "stench-pipe." This is a pipe from one to two inches in diameter, leading from the highest
point of the soil-pipe to the outside of the roof, where it is bent over to prevent the entrance
of foreign matter, or is closed at the top and perforated with holes to allow the gas to escape.
This small stench-pipe is inadequate for the necessary work. It is very important that there
be the freest possible channel for the movement of air; and nothing will suffice for this save
the continuing of the pipe, at its full size, to its very outlet. Indeed, angles and bends
in a pipe by increasing friction form a serious obstruction.

The arrangement of the soil-pipe here indicated, although excellent and efficient, is susceptible
of further improvement by the use of a ventilating cowl or hood at its top. There are many
forms of such cowls in use which are effective whenever there is a sufficient current of wind;
but most of them require a certain force to bring them into action, and when this force is
absent they usually retard the flow they are intended to increase. This is true of a recent
invention known as "Banner's ventilating cowl," which so long as the wind blows is a most effective
device. When the air is perfectly still, however, it offers by its curved air-way a certain
resistance to the current, and in the case of baffling winds and flaws the air may blow directly
into its opening.

Among the various inventions of this sort nothing seems so free from objection as the old arrangement
known as the "Emerson" ventilator, shown in Figure 7. This gives a straight outlet, protected
by a disk far enough above it not to prevent its delivery of air; and it becomes an effective
suction cowl, with the least movement of the wind from any side or from above or below. No
eddy caused by the angles of gable roofs can give it a backward draught; and if a pipe armed
with it be held toward the strongest gale a puff of smoke blown into its other end will be
instantly drawn through. As the patent for this invention has run out, it is competent for
any tinsmith to make it, and it is a common article of manufacture.

2. What is said above concerning the ventilation of the soil-pipe from end to end relates to
the interest of the private owner. The interest of the public gives an equally strong argument
in its favor. The sewer should be as far as possible removed from the condition of an "elongated
cesspool." There must be no halting of its contents, and no deposit of filth or silt at any
point. Within the shortest time possible, every thing received into the sewer must be passed
on and delivered at its outlet. Still, however perfectly this may be accomplished, there will
always be a certain adhesion of slime to the walls of the sewer; and this slime must always
be in a state of decomposition, a constant source of offence and possible danger. The only
way to avert this danger is to give the sewer such a thorough ventilation that the decomposition
shall be rapid and safe, and that the resultant gases shall be at once diluted with fresh air.

This may be measurably accomplished by the simple ventilation of the sewer itself, through
open-topped man-holes; but such ventilation is less effective in the case of small sewers than
of large ones. In the case of either large or small sewers, it will be vastly increased if
we compel every householder who makes a connection with the sewer, to carry a drain and soil
pipe, nowhere less than four inches in diameter, from the point of junction with the main line
to the open air above the roof. Where houses are near enough to make the use of a public sewer
advisable, the aggregate of these soil-pipes, having almost constantly an upward current, will
make such a draught upon the sewer, to be supplied by a downward current through the man-hole
covers, as will maintain a perfect and continuous ventilation.

Important as it is to secure the proper arrangement and construction of sewers and house-drains,
it is still more important to provide for the safe disposition of the sewage.

We must begin at the outset with the understanding that all sewage matters not only are of
no value to the community, but that it will cost money to get rid of them.

There is hardly an instance, after all the efforts that have been made, of the profitable disposal
of the outflow of public sewers. The theoretical value of the wastes of human life is very
great, but the cost of any method for utilizing them seems at least equally great. The question
of cost is so much more important (to the community) than the question of agricultural value,
that the practical thing to do is to make such disposition as will cost the least, while fully
meeting the best sanitary requirements.

So far as village sewage is concerned, there are three means open for its disposal: to discharge
it into running water or into deep tide-water, to use it for the surface irrigation of land,
or to distribute it through sub-irrigation pipes placed at little distance below the surface
of the soil. Experiments are being made with more or less promise of success in the direction
of the chemical treatment of this liquid so as to purify its effluent water, and retain in
a solid form, and in combination with certain valuable added ingredients, all of its undissolved
impurities. None of these processes can as yet claim consideration in regulating public works.

The cheapest way to get rid of sewage is to discharge it into a running stream or into tide-water.
So far as the community itself is concerned, this is often the best way; but there will very
often arise the objection that the community has no moral or legal right to foul a stream of
which others make use in its further course. Where the amount of water constantly flowing is
very large, and where the discharge is rapid,--any given part of the sewage reaching the open
air within a few hours from the time of its entering the pipes,--and where it flows in moving
water for a considerable distance before reaching others who may have occasion to use the stream,
no practical danger is to be apprehended. But where the sewage is more foul, more sluggish,
or exposed in the open current for a shorter time, the danger may be serious. The pouring of
sewage into tide-water is always admissible where floats show that there is no danger of a
return and deposit of solid filth; but the delivery at all stages of the tide, in the immediate
neighborhood of salt marshes and mud flats, and in land-locked harbors, is to be avoided.

Where an unobjectionable natural outflow cannot be provided, the irrigation of agricultural
lands affords the best relief. The action of vegetation, the oxidation which takes in the upper
and well-aërated layers of soil, and the well-known but not yet fully explained disinfecting
qualities of common earth, are effective in removing the dangerous and offensive impurities,
and in converting them into a more or less important source of fertility. Precisely how far
this system may be available during winter, it is not easy to say. While the earth is locked
with frost, there must be very little, if any, infiltration; but, as an offset, the action
of a low temperature upon the sewage matters will clearly be antiseptic; and it is only necessary
to provide against an undue washing away of the surface of the ground during thaws, and against
the flowing of the sewage beyond the proper limits.

Generally in the neighborhood of villages it will be easy to find lands over which the delivery
may be carried on throughout the year without objection. The sewer, or some form of covered
channel, should lead far enough from any public road to avoid offence. From this point it may
be led by open gutters to the land over which it is to be spread,--or rather through such a
system of surface gutters as will enable us to deliver it at different parts of the field,
according to the requirements of the crops, and so as to use fresh land at frequent intervals,
leaving that which has been saturated to the purifying processes of vegetation and atmospheric
action.

The gutters having been made, it is easy, by the use of portable dams,--of thin boiler-iron,
like broad shovels,--which may be set in the course of the flow, to divert the current into
any branch channel, or to stop it at any desired part of this channel. All the gutters having
sufficient descent to lead the sewage rapidly forward, it is usual to set a dam near the far
end of the gutter, and allow the sewage to overflow and run down over the surface until it
has reached as far as the formation of the ground and the quantity of the liquid will allow
it to spread. This portion having received its due amount of the liquid, the dam is moved to
a higher point, and the overflow is allowed to spread over a second area. In this way, step
by step, we irrigate all that may be reached by a single gutter. Then the moving of the dam
in the main line turns the water into another gutter, and this is proceeded with in like manner.
In practice it is found best to begin the overflow at the farthest end of the lowest-lying
gutter, working back step by step until the higher parts of the field are reached. It would
be better that there should be land enough to require the irrigation of any given area not
oftener than once in one or two weeks. The amount required for a given population cannot be
determined by any fixed rule,--so much depending on the amount of water used per capita, and
on the absorptive character of the irrigated soil. In the case of villages, one acre to each
five hundred of the population would generally be found ample.

There are several instances of the successful use of a much smaller area than is here indicated,
by the use of intermittent downward filtration. The most noted success in this direction is
that at Merthyr-Tydvil in Wales, a large mining town, where the allowance is only one acre
to each two thousand of the population. There are two filter-beds of light loam over a gravelly
subsoil thoroughly underdrained with tiles at a depth of six feet. One of these beds is cultivated
with some crop like Italian rye-grass, which bears copious irrigation; and the other by some
crop like wheat, which, in the absence of irrigation, will thrive on the fertility left over
from the previous season. The volume of sewage is very great, but the action of the six feet
of earth in removing its impurities seems to be complete; the water flowing out from the drains
having been proved by analysis to be really far purer than the standard fixed by the Rivers
Pollution Commission.

It is an important condition of this system that the sewage, where its quantity is small, shall
be stored in tanks until a large volume has accumulated, and that it then be rapidly discharged
over the soil. There is no objection to an actual saturation of the ground, provided the soil
is not of such a retentive character as to be liable to become puddled, and so made impervious.
The tanks being emptied, the flow ceases until they are again filled. During the interval,
the liquid settles away in the soil, by which its impurities are removed. Its descent is followed
by the entrance of fresh air, and the oxidizing action of this, accompanied during the growing
season by the purifying effect of the growing crop, leads to an entire decomposition or destruction
of all organic matters.

The third system--the distribution of sewage through irrigation-pipes laid at a depth of ten
or twelve inches below the surface of the ground--has its efficiency attested by numerous instances
in private grounds. I have adopted this system for disposing of the sewage of the village of
Lenox, Mass., where there was no other means available short of cutting an outlet, at great
expense, through a considerable elevation. This method is an extremely simple one, and is available
in every instance where even a small area of land lying slightly below the level of the outlet
is to be commanded. The arrangement of the sub-irrigation pipes is easily made: Suppose that
in land having an inclination of about one in two hundred, occupied by grass or other growth,
a trench be dug twelve inches deep, that there be laid upon the bottom of this trench a narrow
strip of plank to insure a uniform grade, and that upon this plank is laid a line of common
agricultural land-drain tiles, say two inches in diameter. However carefully these tiles may
be placed, there will be at their joints a sufficient space for the leaking out of any liquid
they may contain; the tiles being laid either with collars around the joints, or with bits
of paper laid over them, to prevent the rattling in of loose earth during the filling. The
excavated earth is to be returned to its place, well compacted, and covered with its sod. Suppose
this drain to have a cross-section equal to three square inches, and a length of one hundred
feet, its capacity will equal about sixteen gallons, or a half-barrel. If this amount of liquid
be rapidly discharged into the drain, the inclination being slight, it will at once be filled
or nearly filled for its whole length, and the liquid will leak away in tolerably uniform proportion
at every joint along the line, and will saturate the surrounding earth. The plan adopted at
Lenox, and recommended for all small villages which cannot secure a better outlet, is simply
a multiplication of these drains to a sufficient extent.

A description of the manner in which the Lenox work is arranged will illustrate the adaptation
of the system to its circumstances. As circumstances vary, the adaptation must be modified.
(See Figure 8.)

The main outlet sewer delivers at a distance of about one-half mile from the last junction
with a branch sewer. It is a six-inch pipe five feet below the surface of the ground, and it
delivers into a flush-tank like that shown in Figure 6, but having a capacity of about five
hundred cubic feet. This tank stands at the upper side of a field having an inclination of
seven in one hundred. There is a branch from the main sewer, above the tank, supplied with
a stop-cock, by which, in case of need, the sewage may be carried on down the hill without
going into the tank. The outlet from the chamber below the siphon leads off in another direction
down the hill, and has a stop-cock and a branch which will allow its flow to be diverted. The
discharge of this diverted stream and the discharge through the branch of the main above the
tank, both deliver into a horizontal surface gutter to be well grassed, and lying at the top
of the land to be irrigated. By this arrangement, should repairs become necessary in the tank,
the flow may be turned into the gutter; or, should it be desired for any reason to use the
outflow of the tank for surface irrigation, the second branch outlet will deliver it into the
same gutter, where, the outflow being uniform along the whole length of five hundred feet,
the stream will pass in a thin sheet off on to the descending ground. The hill-side, immediately
below the gutter, is brought to a true grade and covered with grass. As its inclination is
much greater than would be admissible for sub-irrigation drains, these are laid obliquely in
parallel lines at intervals of six feet from one end to the other over the whole graded slope.
These drains are connected at their upper ends with the direct outlet-pipe leading from the
siphon chamber. They have an aggregate length of about ten thousand feet. The method of operation
is as follows:--

The capacity of the tank is supposed to equal about two days' discharge, or about thirty-five
hundred gallons; and the whole capacity of the drains is about half that of the tank, so that
the rapid emptying of the whole volume into them will insure their being pretty thoroughly
filled from end to end. This arrangement will provide for the saturation of the soil about
once in two days, and will leave a sufficient interval between the periods of saturation for
the thorough dispersal and aëration of the filth.

The extent to which this system will be interfered with by frost, it is impossible to say.
This will probably be less than would be supposed, for the reason that the ground would often
be covered with snow, and that the sewage will have sufficient warmth to exert considerable
thawing influence. Whenever the discharge of the liquid through irrigation pipes is shown to
have become obstructed by freezing, it will only be necessary to divert the flow, and turn
it into the surface gutter to be distributed over the ground.

It is possible that in this case, as in the one which has been under my observation for six
years past, there will be no interruption of the working because of cold; but, should the interruption
become serious, I shall propose the planting of evergreen trees in parallel rows midway between
the drains. The protection that would thus be afforded, both by the trees and by the drifting
snow which they would gather, would probably keep the ground free throughout the winter. Incidentally
to the chief advantage of this system, there will be, so long as the land is in grass, quite
an addition to its product.

       *       *       *       *       *

There are hundreds of villages, with and without a water supply, where the houses are too scattering
and the street lengths too great to make it advisable that the cost of any form of public sewerage
should be assumed. In all such villages, the public authority or the active influence of the
village improvement association should be exerted to secure a regular and systematic adoption
of some more perfect system for the private disposal of household drainage than is usual. Fortunately,
the best system is the cheapest.

No form of cesspool, no leaching vault, and no cemented tank, should be allowed under any circumstances.
Neither should there be permitted any form of the old-fashioned out-of-door privy with a vault.
Every household should be supplied with water-closets or well-arranged earth-closets, to which
reference will be made below.

The foul water discharge of kitchen sinks, or of whatever form of slop-sink is used for the
water of bedrooms, should discharge into a flush-tank, and should be led from this by a tightly
cemented four-inch drain to a tight settling basin in the ground beyond. If water-closets are
used, the soil-pipe should deliver into the drain between the flush-tank and the settling basin.
The settling basin should be constructed as shown in Figure 9; and this, as well as the flush-tank,
the soil-pipe, and the connecting drains, should be amply ventilated. The outlet from the settling
basin should be carried by well-cemented vitrified pipes (four-inch) to the connection with
the subsoil irrigation pipes. The flush-tank discharging at each operation of its siphon about
thirty gallons of liquid, two hundred feet of drain, unless the soil is very compact, will
dispose of the whole discharge with sufficient rapidity. The tank being emptied, the flow ceases;
and within a very short time the drain becomes empty of its contents, which are absorbed by
the sponge-like action of the earth, and are subjected to the combined influence of the roots
of plants, and of the concentrated oxygen contained among the particles of the soil. They will
soon have their character entirely changed, so that the earth will become purified, and will
be ready to receive the next discharge from the tank. In the case of my own drains, after five
years of unremitted use, the gradual accumulation of bits of grease and more solid matters
obstructed the drains, and there appeared undue moisture about their upper ends. All that was
then necessary was to re-open the trenches, and remove, wash, and replace the tiles. This operation
cost, for a length of two hundred feet, less than three dollars.

For any ordinary household of six or eight persons, where the water-closet is not used, two
hundred feet of drain of this sort will be sufficient. If there are water-closets, it may be
well to duplicate the length; and, to provide for the necessary connections to lead the liquid
to the drains, we may assume that in all five hundred feet of length will be required. The
cost of two-inch tiles at the works, in small lots, and where collars are furnished, is about
three cents per foot; and we will suppose that transportation will increase the cost to five
cents per foot, making the cost of this item twenty-five dollars. The strips of board (three
inches wide) will cost, at a very liberal estimate, five dollars more, and the cost of digging
and laying not more than another five dollars; so that the establishment of this means of disposal,
under the most liberal allowance of prices, will not exceed thirty-five dollars. Ordinarily,
especially where neighbors combine to buy their material in larger quantities, it will hardly
exceed one-half of this amount. This, be it understood, is for a complete and permanent substitute
for the expensive and nasty cesspool now so generally depended upon in the country.

A piece of ground fifty feet square, having ten rows of tile five feet apart and fifty feet
long, will suffice for even a large household with an abundant water supply. For the better
illustration of the arrangement of this system, I give in Figure 10 a plan for the work in
the case of a lot fifty feet wide, with a depth of open ground behind the house of somewhat
more than fifty feet. The leaching drains may safely begin at a distance of even ten feet from
the back of the house, requiring for the whole a clear area of only fifty feet by sixty feet.
With small households, the length of drain may be very much shortened. In my own case, where
water-closets are not used, the total length of irrigation drain is, as before stated, only
two hundred feet.

The earth-closet was invented by the Rev. Henry Moule, vicar of Fordington, in England, more
than ten years ago. Its progress in England has been considerable, and its introduction there
has resulted in a profit to the company undertaking it. In this country it has met with less
general favor. Two companies with large capital, after expending all their resources, have
been obliged to abandon their attempts to build up a profitable business. Having been actively
interested in the enterprise from its inception, and having given constant attention to the
merits of the system, I am to-day more than ever convinced that the solution of one of the
most difficult problems connected with country and village life is to be sought in its general
adoption. The public reports of sanitary officers in England, who have investigated the subject
to its foundation, fully confirm every thing that has been claimed by the advocates of the
earth-closet, unless perhaps in connection with the incidental question of the value of the
product as a manure.

The only thing which now deters the authorities of some of the larger manufacturing towns of
the North of England from adopting the dry-earth-system as a means of relief, under the sharp
exaction of the law that prohibits their further fouling of water-courses, is the belief that
the labor of bringing into the town the enormous amount of earth required to supply such an
immense number of closets, and the labor of removing the product at frequent intervals, would
be so great as to constitute an insurmountable obstruction.

Prof. Voelcker, in a paper published in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society, shows
pretty conclusively that even the use of the same earth four or five times over, although perfectly
successful in accomplishing the chief purpose of deodorization, fails to add to it a sufficient
amount of fertilizing matter to make it an available commercial manure. Extended experience
in small villages and public institutions seems to confirm his view, that, if the earth-closet
is to be adopted by towns, they cannot depend either on farmers buying the manure, or undertaking
the labor of supplying and removing it. It is estimated, that, for a population of one hundred
thousand persons, there would be required seventy-five tons of earth per day, to say nothing
of heavy refuse matters which would be thrown into the closets, and would increase the amount
to be removed. Even the quantity required for a village of a few hundred inhabitants, if it
were to be brought in and carried out, would entail a considerable cost for handling.

I have recently concluded an experiment of six years' duration, the result of which seems to
show that this objection to the adoption of the earth-closet system may be set aside, or at
least reduced to such proportions as to make it unimportant. In the autumn of 1870 I had brought
to my house, where only earth-closets are used, two small cart-loads of garden earth, dried
and sifted. This was used repeatedly in the closets; and, when an increased quantity was required,
additions were made of sifted anthracite ashes. I estimate that the amount of material now
on hand is about two tons. We long since stopped adding to the quantity, finding that the amount
was ample to furnish a supply of dry and decomposed material whenever it becomes necessary
to refill the reservoirs of the closets.

The accumulation under the seats is discharged through simply arranged valves into bricked
vaults in the cellar. When these vaults become filled,--about three times in a year,--their
contents, which are all thoroughly decomposed, are piled up in a dry and ventilated place with
a slight covering of fresh earth to keep down any odor that might arise. After a sufficient
interval these heaps are ready for further use, there being no trace, in any portion, of foreign
matter nor any appearance or odor differing from that of an unused fresh mixture of earth and
ashes. In this way the material has been used over and over again, at least ten times; and
there is no indication to the senses of any change in its condition.

A sample of this material has recently been analyzed by Prof. Atwater, at the Connecticut Agricultural
Station at Middletown. The analysis shows that it contains no more organic matter than Prof.
Voelcker found in fresh earth prepared for use in the closet,--say about two hundred pounds,--nearly
all of which organic matter it undoubtedly contained when first made ready for use. In my case,
there was an addition, at a moderate calculation of at least, 800 pounds of solid dry matter
during the six years' use by an average of four adult persons. Prof. Voelcker's analysis showed
that the unused earth contained about twelve pounds of nitrogen. Prof. Atwater's analysis shows
that my two tons contained only about eleven pounds of nitrogen. By calculation, the 800 pounds
of solid dry matters added in the use of my material contained 230 pounds of nitrogen.

Doubtless the constitution of Prof. Voelcker's sample was somewhat different from the original
constitution of my own; but practically, except perhaps for the addition of a trifling amount
of residual carbon remaining after the decomposition, they were about the same; and, after
being used ten times over, the whole of the 800 pounds of organic matter added, including 230
pounds of nitrogen, seem to have entirely disappeared.

It becomes interesting and important to know what has become of this added matter. That it
was absorbed into the particles of the earth, is a matter of course; and the result proves
that after such absorption it was subjected to such a chemical action of the concentrated oxygen
always existing in porous dry material as led to its entire destruction. Porous substances
condense gases--air, oxygen, etc.--in proportion to the extent of their interior surface. The
well-known disinfecting action of charcoal--the surface of the interior particles of which
equal from fifty to one hundred square feet to each cubic inch of material, and all of which
surface is active in condensing oxygen--is due not simply to an absorption of foul-smelling
odors, but to an actual destruction of them by slow combustion, so that the same mass of charcoal,
if kept dry and porous, will continue almost indefinitely its undiminished disinfecting action.

The earth used in the closet is a porous material, sufficiently dry for the free admission
of air or of oxygen. The foulest materials when covered with dry earth at once lose their odor,
and are in time as effectively destroyed by combustion (oxidized) as though they had been burned
in a furnace. The process is more slow, but none the less sure; and it is clear that in the
case of my dirt-heap the foul matters added have thus been destroyed. The practical bearings
of this fact are of the utmost importance. Earth is not to be regarded as a vehicle for the
inoffensive removal beyond the limits of the town of what has hitherto been its most troublesome
product, but as a medium for bringing together the offensive ingredients of this product, and
the world's great scavenger, oxygen. My experiment seems to demonstrate the fact that there
is no occasion to carry away the product from the place where it has been produced, as after
a reasonable time it has ceased to exist, and there remains only a mass of earth which is in
all respects as effective as any fresh supply that could be substituted.

The quantity necessary to be provided can be determined only by extended trial. My experiment
proves that the amount needed does not exceed one thousand pounds for each member of the household,
and that this amount once provided will remain permanently effective to accomplish its purpose.

With a suitable public supply of water for the purpose, and with a suitable means of disposal,
nothing can be better and nothing is more easily kept in good condition than well-regulated
and properly ventilated water-closets. Where these are available, with enough water for their
flushing, their use is to be recommended. Where there is not sufficient water, there a well-regulated
system of earth-closets seems to be imperatively demanded. By one process or the other we must
prevent the fouling of the lower soil, and the consequent tainting of wells and springs, and
the ground under houses and adjoining their cellars. With a system of sub-irrigation pipes
which deliver foul matters into earth that is subject to the active operation of oxidizing
influences, we need fear no contamination of the deep and unaërated soil. It would be better,
however, where this system is used for the disposal of the outflow of soil-pipes, to avoid
the use of wells. As a general rule, it is safer not to use for drinking purposes the water
of any well near a house or a stable: practically, it is better not to use wells at all as
a source of water for domestic supply. Filtered cistern-water is greatly to be preferred.

FARM VILLAGES.

     "God made the country, and man made the town."

Cowper's view of the charm of country life as compared with life in the town is a very natural
one. The same view suggests itself to every cultivated denizen of the city who finds himself
in the country on a beautiful June morning, or under a warm September sun, or during the time
of brilliant autumn foliage, or when the sun sets with a warm glow, gilding the clean, bare
boughs of November trees, or when the whole countryside is covered with spotless snow, or when
grass and leaves and buds and birds first feel the awakening warmth of spring. The scene is
full of a charm and a novelty which appeal to him most strongly; and he believes, for the moment
at least, that nothing could make him so entirely happy as to spend his life away from the
noise and confusion of the town, and amid such scenes of rural peace and beauty. Filled with
this enthusiasm, one builds with reference to a magnificent view, and without regard to the
practical inconveniences of the site, fancying that true happiness requires only a continuance
of the novel charms which have enraptured him.

The cultivated countryman, too,--one who has learned to use his eyes, and to see what nature
has to offer him,--appreciates even more thoroughly, if not so keenly, the never-ending and
ever-changing interest by which he is surrounded. His admiration and enthusiasm, however, are
tempered by familiarity with some disadvantages of country life,--just as the romantic house-builder
finds on closer acquaintance that, magnificent though a hill-top view may be, a hill-top residence
is not without its grave drawbacks, nor free from annoyances and practical objections which
too often throw a veil over the most majestic outlook.

A blue-sided, white-capped mountain, reflected in a broad, placid, shimmering lake, and framed
between fleeting clouds, graceful trees, and verdant lawn, is beyond compare the strongest
inducement and the best reward one can offer to a visiting friend; but vile roads, distant
neighbors, discontented and transitory servants, and all the thousand and one obstructions
to the machinery of domestic life, soon blind the eye of the unhappy householder to the beauty
which lies ever before him, until at last the one great good thing which commands his constant
thought is that romantic and pecunious friend who shall come some happy day to purchase his estate.

There is another class, and a very large one, whose opinion concerning the godlike character
of the country it is our especial purpose to consider here. The farmer and the farmer's family
may or may not be cultivated persons. Cultivation does not come by nature; and the incessant
and increasing duties of farm life leave one, however well disposed, but little time and but
scant strength for æsthetic study. The farmhouse is the centre of the home life and of the
homely thought and feeling of its inmates. The farm on which one has been born and bred is
the centre and standpoint from which he regards the world without. All those more tender emotions
which are common to our nature, and which attach themselves to the home, find their development
on the farm as well as in the town. Sentimentally considered, it matters little whether the
object of these emotions be on the farm, in the wilderness, in the village, or in the city.
Fortunately, man is by no means a creature of emotion alone; and the satisfaction and good
of living are less a matter of feeling than of activity, industry, and intelligence. The place
in which one lives is more or less satisfactory in proportion as it facilitates and encourages
the better and more useful living.

Just as the citizen feels the attractions of the country, which are so novel to his town-bred
taste, so the countryman finds a charm in the novelty of the town. As one is led toward the
quiet and solitude of the fields and woods, so the other is drawn by the life and interest
of the community.

As a rule, at least in America, where the facilities for pleasant country living are far less
than in England, the countryman who goes to town is less likely to wish himself back on the
farm than is the town-bred farmer to long for the comforts and conveniences of his former condition.

"Man is a social animal," and the aphorism is especially true of his wife and daughter. As
the lives of the wife and daughter are much more confined to the immediate surroundings of
the domicile than is that of the man himself, so the question as between town and country should
be considered more especially with reference to them.

There is a certain amount of truth on both sides of every question; and the one which we are
now considering is not to be answered by a decision in favor of the heart of a great city,
or of the entire solitude of an outlying farm. As is so often the case, its solution lies between
the two extremes. If one may be permitted to imagine the conditions best suited to the perfect
physical, intellectual, and social development of the human being, one would naturally think
of a small town or a large village where society is sufficient, where the facilities for instruction
are good, where communication with the large centres is easy, where the conveniences and facilities
for household economy are complete, and where the country with its beauty and quiet and freshness
is close at hand,--where one feels on this side the influence of a complete social organization,
and on that the sweet breath of mother earth.

Unfortunately, these imaginings can never be freed from the practical bearing of the bread-winning
and money-making interests. Men must live, not where they prefer to live, but where their interests
compel them to live. The town and the country have their mutual economic duties by which their
life must be controlled. All that we can hope to do is, on one hand, to ameliorate the hardness
and solitude of country living, and, on the other, to bring the citizen into nearer relation
with the invigorating fields and woods and boundless air of the country.

Devising no modern Sybaris, where all possible good of life may follow from the unaided operation
of a perfect social and industrial organization, I propose to confine myself to the simple
question of the best practical development of village life for farmers. The village or its
immediate vicinity seems to me to offer the urbanist the nearest approach to the country that
is available for his purposes; and in like manner village life, so far as it can be made to
fit his conditions, offers to the farmer as much of the benefit of town life as the needs of
his work will allow him to obtain. If those who now seek the pleasures of retirement in costly
and soul-wearying country-seats would congregate into spacious and well-kept villages, and
if those who now live in the solitary retirement of the mud-bound farmhouse would congregate
into villages, we should secure far more relief from the confinement of the town and a wider-reaching
attractiveness in agricultural life; this latter leading to the improvement of our farming
by a solution of that long-mooted problem, "How to keep the boys on the farm."

Nearly everywhere on the Continent of Europe those who are engaged in the cultivation of the
land live in villages. An observation of the modes of life and industry of these villages has
led me to consider whether some similar system might not tend to the improvement of the conditions
of our own farmers, and to the amelioration of some hardships to which their families are subjected.

In Europe, as here, the methods of living have grown from natural causes. There it was a necessary
condition of agricultural industry, that those who tilled the soil should be protected by the
military power of their lord or chief; and their houses were clustered under the shadow of
his castle wall. The castles have crumbled away, and the protecting arm of the old baron has
been replaced by the protecting arm of the nation.

The community of living, which grew from necessity, having proved its fitness by long trial,
is still maintained; but there seems to have been no general tendency toward the formation
of such little communities here. Save in a few exceptional cases,--as in the old villages of
the Connecticut Valley, where protection against Indians or safety from inundation compelled
the original settlers to gather into communities,--the pioneer built his cabin in his new clearing,
and, as his circumstances improved, changed his cabin for a house, and his small house for
a larger one, and finally established his comfortable home in connection with his fertile fields.
This method has been adopted throughout the whole country; and the peculiarly American system
of isolated farm-life has become almost universal throughout the length and breadth of the land.

I am not so enthusiastic as to believe that a radical change from this universal system is
to be hoped for at any early day; but I believe that it is worth while for farmers to consider
how far they may, without permanent harm to the interests for which they are working, secure
for themselves, and especially for their families, the benefits of village life.

To this end are adduced the following examples, both of which are of course purely imaginary.
The first has reference to a new settlement of wild land, where, by the Government's system
of division, the boundaries are rectangular, and where the political subdivisions are of uniform
measurement. The second relates to the necessary change of conditions now existing in the longer-settled
parts of the country.

For this latter, the illustration is taken from an actual accurate survey[1] of a purely agricultural
district in Rhode Island, showing the roads, houses, and field boundaries as they now exist,
followed by a suggestion as to the manner in which the same division of estates might be made
to conform to the assembling of their owners into a village.

[Footnote 1: A map of the United States Coast Survey.]

The Government division is into townships six miles square. It is proposed to divide each township
into nine settlements, giving to each a square of two miles, or 2,560 acres. Each of these
settlements should have its whole population concentrated in a village at its centre. A suitable
method of division would be that indicated in Figure 11, where a public road crosses the middle
of the tract north and south, and east and west. The outside of the tract, for the width of
half a mile all around, is laid off in farms of 80 acres and 160 acres. These are bounded on
the inner sides by a road. Inside of this road again is a series of smaller farms (40 acres),
and inside of these a tier of still smaller places (10 acres), separated from the central village
by a narrow road. The village itself occupies 40 acres.

The division of the agricultural land is as follows:--

    4 farms of   160 acres   640
   16     "       80   "   1,280
   12     "       40   "     480
   12     "       10   "     120

in all, 44 tracts, aggregating 2,520 acres, and averaging nearly 60 acres each, the most distant
being less than a mile from the village green. This division is arbitrary; in practice, the
more industrious members of the community would buy land from their less industrious neighbors,
and the size and arrangement of the farms would vary. Often, too, the division would be into
farms averaging more than sixty acres. In such cases there would usually be about the same
population, as the larger holders would employ more workmen.

What is attempted is chiefly to show how four square miles of land may be so divided that its
occupiers may be conveniently gathered into a village; and it may fairly be assumed, that,
except in the more remote grazing and grain-growing regions, the population (including laborers)
would generally be about one household for each sixty acres. In the more thickly settled regions,
this limit is exceeded now; and, as population increases, this condition will extend. In any
case, the principle advanced remains the same, whether there be thirty households or sixty.

A suitable division of the village is shown in Figure 12. Its centre is occupied by a public
square at the intersection of the main roads. The road surrounds a piece of ornamental ground,
containing about one acre. North and south of the square are the sites of two churches, a schoolhouse,
and a store and public house. This is again arbitrary; the purpose is to have these spaces
occupied by somewhat important buildings, which it will not be necessary to enclose by fences,
so that an appearance of more size may be given to the central feature of the village.

The spaces set apart for these buildings, as well as the village green, should be surrounded
by regularly planted trees, such as will grow to a large size, like the American elm. But the
whole open space should remain otherwise free from planting. Smooth, well-kept grass, and large
trees planted in formal lines, with an entire absence of fences, posts, chains, bushes, and
all decorations, will give a dignity and character which an excess of ornamentation would spoil.
A certain amount of judicious bedding would be permissible, but it would be best that even
this should be confined to private places. Any fund available for embellishing the village
green will be best used in keeping its grass cut and its walks clean,--entire neatness and
simplicity being its most effective characteristics.

On the streets leading east and west from the green there are shown sixteen lots 100 X 250
(one-half acre), eight 50 X 250 (one-quarter acre). These lots all open on narrow lanes at
the rear. On the streets leading north and south there are twelve lots 50 X 650 (three-quarters
acre), and eight lots 100 X 650 (one and one-half acres). These are the village lots proper,
but the twelve ten-acre tracts which front on its surrounding street would be the residences
of their owners; and these semi-detached houses--the most distant not a quarter of a mile from
the green--would form a part of the village, and come within the operation of its rules of
association. Probably the blacksmith, the wheelwright, and the builder would occupy these outlying
places, with an "annex" of farming to supplement their trades.

The village lots proper are all large enough for a kitchen-garden, barn, barn-yard, &c.; and
all have means of access from the rear, so that their street fronts may be kept for ornamental
purposes.

It would be a good rule that no house should stand nearer to the street line than thirty feet,
and that no fence should be made nearer to the street than sixty feet. This would add very
much to the largeness of appearance of the whole village; would decorate every street with
the ornamental fronts of the houses and with their plants and shrubbery, and would, at the
same time, shut off from the ornamental parts every thing belonging to the working department
of the village life. Even the baker and the shoemaker should conform to this rule, and their
shops should be made to help the neatness of appearance of the village.

The larger farmers, having the most cattle, would occupy the largest lots, which would readily
accommodate their larger needs. The more ambitious of them would probably buy land, for night
pasture or for cultivation, from a ten-acre neighbor opposite their rear line.

The village population would be somewhat as follows: two clergymen, one doctor, one teacher,
one baker, one shoemaker, one tailor, two store-keepers, one carpenter, one wheelwright, one
blacksmith, one dressmaker, one innkeeper, forty-four farmers: total, fifty-eight heads of
families. Probably, including hired laborers and servants, the average would be six persons
to each household. This would make the population of the village about 350. No part of the
whole scheme is more arbitrary than this arrangement of its human element; and no part of it
would be more modified in different cases by the element of human nature. Still, this sketch
of the industrial division of the community would probably be approximated in any purely agricultural
village of this size,--with such changes in the detail as would come from individual enterprise
or indolence.

Taking the whole area at 2,560 acres, and the population at 350 persons, we have an area of
about 7-1/3 acres to furnish the support and home of each member of the community,--an amount
ample for the purpose.

Figure 13 suggests the arrangement of the central open space of the village,--all of which
should be in well-kept grass, except where roads and paths are needed. Paths should be reduced
to the least amount that will furnish the necessary accommodation, and they should be kept
in neat condition. If no provision can be made for this, it will be better to leave the people
to beat their own tracks across the grass as their needs direct. These beaten foot-paths are
never unsightly (in small villages), for the reason that they are never large, and that they
are only of such width as their regular use will keep clean: the grass maintains its effort
to spread, and grows always close up to the necessary foot-way. Even in Hyde Park (London),
where the people have made short cuts across the broad lawns, the paths thus marked out, and
receiving no attention, are not only unobjectionable, but are a charming feature of that beautiful
pleasure-ground.

The foot-path indicated for the village green will be demanded by the more ambitious village
improvers; but were I making an ideal village for moderate and tasteful people, the road surrounding
the green should enclose only a level, close-cropped lawn, neatly trimmed at its edges, surrounded
by fine and simple trees, and traced here and there with the foot-paths that honest use had
marked out and made, and by the suggestive diamond-shaped track and bases of the village base-ball
club. It should be perfect in grade, in outline, in regularity of planting, and in mowing;
but it should be a perfect lawn plus the wear of constant use and frequent pleasure.

       *       *       *       *       *

The second example is taken from existing conditions in my own neighborhood. The United States
Coast Survey has furnished all the necessary details save the farm boundaries. The field boundaries
and roads are exact.

The tract is of the same size with the one just considered,--two miles square. Its centre is
in one direction about two miles from a small village, and in the other about seven miles from
a large town which furnishes the chief market for its agricultural products, and is the source
of all (or nearly all) of its supplies.

Figure 14 shows the present settlement of this area, the houses, about sixty in number, being
scattered over the whole tract, with no near approach to a "neighborhood" at any point. These
are practically all farmers' houses, some trade being carried on here and there in connection
with the farm-work. A few of the houses belong to farms which lie mainly outside of my lines.
Deducting a fair proportion for this, and others for the wheelwright, blacksmith, &c., we shall
have about the same number of farmers as in the former instance, say forty-four; and, taking
the same area for the village, we shall have the same amount of farm and village property for
their support.

Figure 15 shows a suitable division of property and the location of the village, on a short
cross street running from one to the other of the main public roads, and extending a short
distance up and down these roads.

It would be a necessary condition precedent, that the whole property taken for the village
should be set apart for the purpose. This requirement and the cost of moving buildings from
the farms to the village would doubtless be an serious obstacle to the immediate carrying out
of the plan. And thus the theory must long remain a theory only. No sudden change of the sort
could be made in practice.

It would not be impossible, however, to bring about the end in time, if a few of the larger
proprietors could secure possession of the village tract by exchange, and would dedicate it
to the purpose, agreeing at any future time to sell small lots for building at a fixed low
rate. In the instance under consideration, the village tract is thinly settled, and so situated
as to be available at moderate cost. If a church, a schoolhouse, and a store could be established
as a nucleus of the village, the young couples of the neighborhood might incline to settle
there; and in time the settlement could be made so attractive--as compared with the outlying
farmhouses--as to lead to the concentration of the whole population.

This part of the subject is, however, foreign to the present purpose. If the desirability of
village life for farmers can be established, the ways and means may safely be left to those
interested in securing it. The influences now at work to make the farmers' children seek a
better social condition, together with the necessity which confines them to some form of agricultural
work, must be depended on to secure the relief suggested, unless some better relief can be found.

In this case, as in every other of village construction, the original plan should include some
quality or feature, which, while appropriate to the modest end in view, will give character
to the place.

Every village has in its situation, its uses, or its origin, some characteristic which may
be developed into a leading and an attractive feature. Especially when the work is to be begun
from the foundation, and when there are no buildings to be torn down or removed, a consistent
and dignified result may be planned for at the outset.

The characteristic feature of the village we are now considering is that it is to consist of
a single long, straight street cut off at each end by other roads. After removing one unimportant
house, there remains no obstacle to the laying-out of one straight street two hundred feet
wide, with either two or four rows of spreading elms. This street, two thousand feet long,
mainly in well-kept grass, with only the necessary width of road and the requisite paths,--having
perhaps a well-kept and home-like private place opposite each of its ends,--would stamp the
village at once with an attraction which would have a constant civilizing effect on those living
under its influence.

Such a village street, entirely without costly ornamentation, and requiring only the simplest
care, would soon take on a look of appropriate neatness and freshness; and, as the trees grew,
it would acquire a dignity and beauty which could in no other way be so well secured.

The church and the schoolhouse, being placed in broad recesses opposite the central point of
the street, would gain importance from their position; and, these main features being attended
to, the character of the village would be fixed, and it would be difficult to make any arrangement
of its private places which would spoil its beauty. Neatness and a reasonable care in the matter
of house-gardening, the planting of flower-beds, vines, etc., are all that would be needed.

With so wide a street, it would be as well to bring all house-fronts to the street line, completing
this line with simple fences, and paying some attention to the ornamentation of the enclosed yards.

In this village, as in the other, all meretricious ornamentation should be avoided, whether
public or private. All money available for such improvement should be spent in securing perfect
neatness. In fact, the two radical requirements of good taste in all such cases are an absence
of obvious money-spending, and the evidence of constant care and attention. "Showiness" is
common in every trumpery village in the land. What we should seek in our farm-villages is the
most modest simplicity, shining with the polish of an affectionate care. Every spot should
breathe of homely influences and moral peacefulness.

Figure 16 shows the general plan of the village. If other public buildings are needed, they
might very well be placed opposite the ends of the main street.

It is not possible, in remodelling an old farming district, where boundaries and roads are
irregular, to apportion the division of land among the population with especial reference to
its distance from the village; so, for example, that the small farmers, who have little team-force,
shall not have so far to go as the larger ones who are better equipped; but, even in this case,
the most distant farm will be rarely a mile from the village, where all the farmers, their
families, and their work-people, and their flocks and herds, would be gathered together, under
the best circumstances for getting out of their lives as much good as the need for earning
a living by arduous work will allow them to get anywhere,--more than they could hope to get
in the isolation of the distant farmhouse.

Having now considered the methods by which farmers may congregate their homes and their farm-buildings,
and live in villages, let us take up the more important question of policy.

Which would be better for a young man, just starting in life with a young wife,--to go to a
distant farmhouse to found his home, or to settle in a well-ordered farm-village under substantially
the conditions described above?

There is much more to be said, on both sides of this question, than there is room to say here;
but certain points are worthy of consideration.

There is no doubt that in a strictly money-making aspect there is an advantage in having the
animals on the land from which they are fed, and the men on the farm which they are to work.
It is certain, also, that the men and the women must be near the stables, that the early and
late work of feeding and milking may be promptly and regularly performed. If the family is
to live in the village, the cattle must live in the village too. This involves the hauling
home of all the hay and grain, and the hauling out again of all manure,--no slight task. If
the work is all concentrated on the farm, under the immediate supervision of the farmer, there
will be a certain convenience and economy of time.

The same principle holds true in all other relations. The merchant would find a certain advantage
in living at his warehouse, the engine-builder at his factory, the cotton-spinner at his mill,
the carpenter at his shop, and the grocer at his store. All of these have found that, so far
as may be, they get certain other and greater advantages in living away from their business.
One and all carry to their homes, at least occasionally, books, papers, and plans for work
that needs attention out of the regular business hours.

The farmer alone--and in this country especially--disregards the benefits of living away from
his shop, and passes his whole life--day and night--in close contact with his field of operations.
He might, if he chose, make his home nearer to other homes, taking with him so much of his
work as is not necessarily confined to the farm.

For his own sake, it does not make so much difference; but for the sake of his wife and children
it makes all the difference between life and stagnation. The business needs which call him
to town, and the habit he has of passing his evenings at "the store," give him a certain amount--and
a certain kind--of social intercourse which keeps him from absolute rust. The amount of society
available for his family is not usually great, and the dulness and confinement of farmhouse
life need no description.

The main reason for preferring village life is principally because it is better for the women
and children; but there are reasons, in the same direction, why better social conditions would
give the farmer himself decided benefits. The life, too, would be more attractive for both
boys and girls, and would be divested of that naked and dismal gloom and dryness which now
drive so much of the best farmer blood of the whole country to work-benches and counters,--to
any position, in fact, which promises relief from the stifling isolation of the country.

While conceding that, just as a cabinet-maker would make more money if he lived in his back
shop, and had little thought from early dawn until late evening except for his work, so the
farmer may make more money if he lives on his farm than if he lives at a distance, still it
must be said that the difference in profit is by no means so great as would be supposed.

It may be fairly assumed, that, at least in the more thickly settled farming regions at the
East, the average distance at which farmers live from the nearest centre of population that
supplies their "shopping," and from church, is not less than three miles. The visiting acquaintance
of the family is nearly or quite as remote; and there is, altogether, so much driving to be
done, as to make it necessary to keep a decent carriage and horses, and to supply a certain
amount of extra horse service. Indeed, among those who are tolerably well off it would be moderate
to set down the total services of one good horse as needed to supply the family's demand for
transportation.

Then, too, the need of the farmer himself to go to town to sell and to buy, to get repairs
and information, and (a much more generally gratified taste than he would always care to confess
to his wife) to satisfy his craving after intercourse with his kind,--who shall estimate the
aggregate of all this travel, or even of that part of it which, under the pretext of business,
is really only an habitual going for gossip? All of this driving is confined to no season;
it is perennial,--in good weather and in bad,--and it costs an amount of time and money that
few farmers would like to put down in black and white, and charge to their expense accounts.
It would form one of the most serious items of their budget.

Did the farmer live in a pleasant and attractive village, among neighbors and friends, nearly
all of this driving would be saved. The appliances for the family's pleasure-driving might
be entirely done away with, for the wife and daughters would gladly exchange the means for
occasional visiting and for distant shopping, for an agreeable circle of friends near at hand
and a good village store and post-office within five minutes' walk. In such a settlement as
is contemplated, most of the business needs of the farmer would be amply supplied, and he would
find the companionship at hand even more satisfactory, because more familiar, than that which
he now finds in the town.

It is not worth while to calculate the cash saving that would come of this reduction of road-*work.
It is enough to consider it as an important offset to the cost of carrying men and manure to
the field and of bringing crops to the village.

Under the present system the women have the worst of it. They have the confinement and seclusion
and dulness. Under the village system the men would have the discomfort, and this is why it
will be less easy to secure its adoption; for the men control, and prefer not to have the heavy
end of life's log to carry.

Under either of the plans given herewith, the greatest--not the average--distance from the
house to the farm would be about one mile, and it would have to be travelled only during the
working weather of the warmer months, and during the good wheeling of winter. In summer, all
hands would have to set off early, and come home late, often carrying their dinner with them
as mechanics do; but when field-work did not call them out, as during rains, or when the ground
is too wet to be disturbed, their barn-work and shop-work would be at home; and, all the winter
through, the only road-work to be done would be to send the teams to haul out the manure, and
to bring home the hay, which would be best stored under "Dutch hay-barracks" in the fields
when it was made. This work would be systematic and simple; and it may fairly be questioned
whether it would not, in many cases, amount to less than the cost of the "driving" that is
now done, and which in the village might be foregone. Especially would this be the case when
all the heavy farm-work is done by oxen, which when idle, instead of eating their heads off
like horses, are accumulating valuable flesh. With sufficient ox-power to do the work easily,
the whole transportation of tools and men, and all the hay-tedding and hay-raking, would be
easily done by one horse, with leeway enough to allow for a fair amount of business or pleasure
travel.

So far as the presence of the farmer himself is concerned, it is to be considered that if his
farm and cattle are near his house in the village, he will be within easy reach of them very
often at times when his visits to the distant town would take him away from them if they were
on the farm. In the village, during the whole winter, and in bad weather at other seasons,
he would have little necessity or temptation to absent himself from home. Indeed, those who
have had an opportunity to watch the life of the exceptional farmers whose houses and barns
and stables are in a village cannot have failed to notice how much more home-like and engaging
is the whole farm establishment than it usually is in the country. It is hardly too much to
say that the few instances that we have, as in the farm-villages of New England, show that
these village-living farmers are apparently more attentive to their home duties than are their
isolated brethren, at least in the matter of tidiness.

To complete the comparison with the merchant or manufacturer, who takes his papers or plans
home with him for work out of regular hours, one might say that the farmer who lives at a distance
from his land, with his flocks and herds gathered about his homestead, has such of his work
as needs early and late attention close at hand, while his regular workshop, the farm, calls
him away for certain regular hours and regular duties.

It is not worth while here to enter into the details of the question. They are of serious moment,
and involve among other things the driving of animals to and from pasture, versus the raising
of soiling crops to be fed in the stall or yard. All of these questions have been satisfactorily
solved in the experience of many exceptional cases in this country, and of the almost universal
conditions obtaining in Europe. They present no practical difficulty, and need constitute no
serious objection to the general plan.

The items of economical working and money-making being fully weighed, the more serious considerations
of the mode of life, and the good to be got from it, demand even greater attention. It may
seem a strange doctrine to be advanced by a somewhat enthusiastic farmer, but it is a doctrine
that has been slowly accepted after many years' observation, a conviction that has taken possession
of an unwilling mind, that the young man who takes his young wife to an isolated farmhouse
dooms her and himself and their children to an unwholesome, unsatisfactory, and vacant existence,--an
existence marked by the absence of those more satisfying and more cultivating influences which
the best development of character and intelligence demand. It is a common experience of farmers'
wives to pass week after week without exchanging a word or a look with a single person outside
of their own family circles.

The young couple start bravely, and with a determination to struggle against the habit of isolation
which marks their class. But this habit has grown from the necessity of the situation; and
the necessities of their own situation bring them sooner or later within its bonds. During
the first few years they adhere to their resolution, and go regularly to church, to the lecture,
and to the social gatherings of their friends; but home duties increase with time, and the
eagerness for society grows dull with neglect. Those who have started out with the firmest
determination to avoid the rock on which their fathers have split, give up the struggle at
last, and settle down to a humdrum, uninteresting, and uninterested performance of daily tasks.

In saying all this,--and I speak from experience, for I have led the dismal life myself,--it
is hardly necessary to disclaim the least want of appreciation of the sterling qualities which
have been developed in the American farm household. But it may be safely insisted that these
qualities have been developed, not because of the American mode of farm life, but in spite
of it; and, as I think over the long list of admirable men and women whose acquaintance I have
formed on distant and solitary farms, I am more and more impressed with certain shortcomings
which would have been avoided under better social conditions. If any of these is disposed to
question the justice of this conclusion, I am satisfied to leave the final decision with his
own judgment, formed after a fair consideration of what is herein suggested.

If American agriculture has an unsatisfied need, it is surely the need for more intelligence
and more enterprising interest on the part of its working men and women. From one end of the
land to the other, its crying defect--recognized by all--is, that its best blood, or, in other
words, its best brains and its best energy, is leaving it to seek other fields of labor. The
influence which leads these best of the farmers' sons to other occupations is not so much the
desire to make more money, or to find a less laborious occupation, as it is the desire to lead
a more satisfactory life,--a life where that part of us which has been developed by the better
education and better civilization for which in this century we have worked so hard and so well,
may find responsive companionship and encouraging intercourse with others.

It so happens that the few farm villages to which we can refer--such as Farmington, Hadley,
and Deerfield--have become so attractive by means of their full-grown beauty, or have been
so encroached upon by the wealth that has come over the district to which they belong, that
they are no longer to be taken as types of pure country villages; nor do I recall a single
village in the land which is precisely what I have now in mind.

Assuming that a farming neighborhood--two miles, or at the utmost three miles, square--had
been so arranged as to have all of its buildings (with the exception of hay-barracks in the
fields, and cattle-shelters in the pastures) in a village, let us consider what would be the
advantages in the manner of living which it would have to offer.

The social benefits, and the facilities for frequent neighborly and informal intercourse, are
obvious. To say nothing of the companionships and intimacies among the young people, their
fathers and mothers would be kept from growing old and glum by constant friction with their
kind; and, in so far as a more satisfactory social relation with one's fellow-men gives cheerfulness
and the richness of a wider human interest, in that proportion would the village life have
a wholesome, mellowing effect that is not to be found in the remote farmhouse, nor even in
the sort of neighborhood we sometimes find in the country where several farmhouses are within
a quarter of a mile of each other. The habit of "running in" for a moment's chat with a neighbor
is a good one, and it gets but scant development among American farmers. This view of the case
will suggest itself quite naturally on the first consideration of the subject.

If the first need of the rising generation--the men and women of the future--is education,
then the village beats the farm by long odds. The country school-district, sparsely settled
and chary of its taxes, is apt to obey the law in the scantiest way possible. Three months
school in winter and three months more in summer, under the supervision--it can hardly be called
the instruction--of a young miss who is by no means well educated herself, and who is entirely
often without training as a teacher, gathers together all of the school-going children of a
wide neighborhood. Big and little, boys and girls, are huddled together in a sort of mental
jumble, where the best that the most skilful manager can hope for is to regulate the instruction
and the discipline to suit the average of the scholars. The best result attainable is to secure
a good amount of schooling: the word "education" would be quite misapplied here.

In the village, the number of scholars would be sufficiently large to warrant the establishment
and to bear the maintenance of one good school, with one, if not more, teachers, regularly
employed, and worthy to be called teachers rather than "school-marms." Pupils would be graded
according to their ages and acquirements, and a due use could be made of the stimulus of competition.
A real school, a real instrument of education, would take the place of the noisy congregation
of uncontrolled boys and girls, who, in the country district-school, are apt to acquire less
of valuable learning than of the minor viciousness that prevails among country children.

In this connection, I was forcibly struck with the announcement of a German farmer once in
my employ, whose reason for leaving me, after his children had reached the ages of seven and
eleven, to return to his little village in Germany, was that it was impossible in this country--and
this, be it remembered, was in New England--to secure satisfactory instruction for them. He
thought that in their experience at school here they had gained little beyond a familiarity
with English, and with a large admixture of "bad words" at that. At home they would have, within
the elementary range of a primary-school education, a thorough training and a severe drilling
which he could not hope for here, and without which he was unwilling that they should grow
up. I have seen his village school in Germany, and the cloud of tow-headed children who fill
it; and I am prepared to believe that his preference was not without foundation. Of course
we have all the material for as good or better schools in this country. What we need is longer
terms, better trained and educated teachers, graded classes, and better books and appliances.
These cannot be afforded in the small country school-district. They can be had in their perfection
in even a small village; and this consideration alone, even if this were all, should be a controlling
argument in favor of village life.

But this is by no means all. Another great benefit is to be found in the post-office near at
hand, with its daily mail as an encouragement to correspondence and to interest in the affairs
of the outside world. A village, such as is here pictured, could afford its weekly or semi-monthly
public lecture, furnishing a means for instruction and entertainment, and for frequent gatherings.
The church, too, would probably be conducted in a more satisfactory way than is usual in the
country; and the conditions would be the best suited for fostering that interest in the collateral
branches of the church, the Bible-class, the Sunday school, and the Dorcas society, by which
the women of the community get, aside from the other good that they receive and do, advantages
of a character somewhat corresponding to those which men get from their clubs.

I should hope further, as an outgrowth from the community of living, for a modest village library
and reading-room. Indeed, if I could have my own way, I should not confine the attraction and
entertainment of the village to strictly "moral" appliances. It would probably be wiser to
recognize the fact that young men find an attraction in amusements which our sterner ancestors
regarded as dangerous; and I would not eschew billiards, nor even, "by rigorous enactment,"
the milder vice of social tobacco. Better have a little harmless wickedness near home and under
the eye of parents than to encounter the risk that boys, after a certain age, would seek a
pretext for more uncontrolled indulgences in the neighboring town.

One might go on through the long range of incidental arguments--such as lighted streets, well-kept
sidewalks, winter snow-ploughs, and good drainage, and a wholesome pride in a tidy, cosey village,
until even the most close-fisted of all our class would confess that the extra cost would bring
full value in return, and until he would recognize the fact that the attractions of such a
home as the village would make possible would be likely to insure his being succeeded in his
wholesome trade by the brightest and best of his sons,--a result that would surely be worth
more than all it would cost.

But my purpose has been only to suggest a scheme which seems to me entirely, even though remotely,
practicable, and in which I hope for the sympathy and help of the country-bound farmers' wives
and daughters,--a scheme which promises what seems the easiest, if not the only, relief for
the dulness and desolation of living which make American farming loathsome to so many who ought
to glory in its pursuit, but who now are only bound to it by commanding necessity.

LIFE AND WORK OF THE EASTERN FARMER.

We are all familiar with the lavish praise bestowed--especially when votes are to be secured--upon
the "bone and sinew of the country;" but the farmers themselves are very far from accepting
as true, even if sincere, the estimate of their qualities which the editor and the public speaker
so loudly profess.

The average farmer is precisely what any other average man would be who had grown up under
the same conditions. There is no mysterious charm belonging to his occupation which removes
him beyond the reach of the influences by which all mankind are controlled. Coming from the
same original stock and inheriting the same peculiarities of race, he is essentially the same
as men in other vocations. The character of his work, the necessities of his financial condition,
and the social surroundings amid which he has been reared, have had the same influence in moulding
his character that similar conditions have had in moulding the characters of others.

Farming is in a certain sense the basis of all individual and national prosperity; but the
case would be more fairly stated were we to say that farming happens to be the first step in
an industrial process, many steps of which are alike essential to civilization. The farmer
produces raw material, and without raw material the world must come to a stop; but the butcher,
the baker, the spinner, the weaver, and every artisan, render as essential service in the development
of this raw material into the forms demanded by modern life, as does the farmer in growing it.

As a member of the farmer class, I hasten to disclaim for it any especial consideration given
it because of its contribution to the welfare of mankind. We are as useful as any other hard-working
people, no more and no less. We claim no higher appreciation for muscular effort exerted in
swinging the flail than for that applied to the wielding of the hammer.

The controlling motive of a farmer in performing his work and carrying on his business is the
hope of material gain. He works for the money that he expects to earn, and not with any conscious
reference to the service he is rendering to the world. In this capacity as a farmer he is neither
a philanthropist nor a patriot, only a man of business. If we wish properly to estimate his
character and his value as a factor of modern civilization, we must not be misled by sentimental
considerations as to his relation with nature and his "noble" occupation.

The conditions of Eastern farming and of Eastern farm life are the true index, as they are
the true cause, of the character of the Eastern farmer. These conditions are constantly varying,
and their effect is always modified by individual qualities.

It may be possible to strike such an average as shall afford a tolerably good suggestion of
the real character and condition of the farmer, and a hint as to his future; that is to say,
certain prevalent influences tend to mark the type, and certain modifications of these influences
may lead to its improvement. Any attempt to portray the class as a whole would be met by such
a list of exceptions as would seriously affect the result; but the following may be considered
true in a large number of cases, and applicable, with minor changes, to many more.

Let us take the case of an outlying farm in New England, of one hundred acres,--a farm that
has been in cultivation from the earlier settlement of the country, and which is of the average
degree of improvement, with the usual division into arable, mowing, pasture, and wood land.
It lies two or three miles away from a considerable town or village, and its chief industry
is the selling of milk in the town. With an allowance of two acres per cow for summer pasture,
and of one and a half acres of mowing-land for winter feeding, the cows it keeps number about
a dozen. For team-work on the farm and for road-work and pleasure-driving, there are kept two
horses and two oxen. In addition to these there will be a greater or less amount of young stock
and the usual swine and poultry, and perhaps a few sheep. The farmer himself is the chief workman
on the place, and he has the regular help of a hired man or a grown son. An extra hand during
the working season is usual; but in winter the farmer and his one assistant will do all of
the work of feeding, milking, delivering the milk, hauling out manure, etc.

A few years ago the housework was done almost entirely by the mother of the family and her
daughters, or by a girl taken to "bring up;" but latterly the more troublesome element of an
Irish girl in the kitchen has become general, for the daughter of the farmer has aspirations
and tastes which disqualify her for efficient household drudgery. In spite of all modern appliances,
much of the work of the farmer's household must be so characterized. The life of American farm
women is, however, not now under discussion: the subject is a fruitful one, and has important
bearings upon the development of the race; but what we are to consider here is simply the work
and condition of the farmer himself. The milk-selling farmer--and this industry is one of the
most wide-spread in Eastern farming--is more regularly employed than any other. Winter and
summer his cows must be milked twice a day. Evening's milk must be cooled and safely kept until
morning; and morning's milk must be ready for early delivery. It is usual for the farmer to
rise at three every morning, winter and summer, to milk his cows,--with one assistant,--and
to start as early as five o'clock to deliver his milk. Returning about the middle of the forenoon,
he is able to attend to the details of barn-work in winter and field-work in summer, until
half-past two or three o'clock in the afternoon, less the brief interval needed for the consumption
of food. Early in the afternoon the cows must be again milked, and the cans of milk must in
summertime be set in spring water for cooling. Then comes the feeding of the stock and the
greasing of axles, the mending of harness, the repairing of tools, and the thousand and one
odds and ends of the farmer's irregular work. In the winter, save for the early rising and
the work of cold mornings, life is by no means hurried; and after a very early supper there
is often a stroll to the corner store or to a neighbor's house, for a little wholesome idleness
and gossip,--the latter not invariably wholesome. At about the hour when the average reader
of "The Atlantic" has finished his after-dinner cigar, all lights are extinguished, and the
farm household is wrapped in heavy slumber; for such early rising as the milk-farmer is condemned
to must needs trench upon the valuable evening hours for requisite rest and sleep.

In summer the conditions of life are immeasurably hardened. The farmer himself is necessarily
absent several hours every morning with his milk-wagon; but, although he cannot lend a hand
at the early field work, this work must go on with promptness, and he must arrange in advance
for its proper performance. From the moment when he has finished his late breakfast until the
last glimmer of twilight, he is doomed to harrowing and often anxious toil. There is no wide
margin of profit that will admit of a slackening of the pace. Land must be prepared for planting;
planting must be done when the condition of the ground and the state of the weather permit.
Weeds grow without regard to our convenience, and they must be kept down from the first; and
well on into the intervals of the hay-harvest the corn-field needs all of the cultivation that
there is time for. Regularly as clock-work, in the late hours of the night and the early hours
of the afternoon, the milking must be attended to; and the daily trip to town knows no exception
because of heat, rain, or snow. At rigidly fixed hours this part of the work must be done;
and all other hours of the growing and of the harvest seasons are almost more than filled with
work of imperative need. These alone seem to make a sufficient demand on the patience and endurance
of the most industrious farmer; but, aside from these, he is loaded with the endless details
of an intricate business, and with the responsibility of the successful management of a capital
of from fifteen to twenty thousand dollars, upon the safety and the economical management of
which his success entirely depends; he must avoid leakage and waste, and make every dollar
paid for labor, or seed, or manure, or live stock, bring its adequate return.

Probably no occupation in the world can compare with farming in the opportunity that it offers
for the losing of money. Nothing is so enticing as slate-and-pencil farming. Ten acres of land
can be ploughed, manured, and planted with corn, and the crop can be well cultivated and harvested
for so many dollars. Such land with such manuring and cultivation may be trusted to yield so
many bushels of corn to the acre; and, after making due allowance for chance, the balance of
the calculation shows a snug profit. In like manner we may figure out a corresponding return
from the hay-fields, from the root-crops, from two or three acres of potatoes, and from a patch
of garden-truck for which the neighboring village will furnish a good market. Then the poultry
will return a profitable income in eggs and in "broilers;" and altogether it is easy for an
enthusiastic person to show how interest on invested capital and good compensation for labor
are to be secured in agriculture.

But when the test of practice is applied to our well-studied and proven scheme; when we see
how far our allowance for "chances" has fallen below what is needed to cover the contingencies
of late springs, dry summers, early frosts, grasshoppers, wire-worms, Colorado beetles, midge,
weevil, pip, murrain, garget, milk-fever, potato-rot, oats-rust, winter-killing, and all the
rest; when we learn the degree of vigilance needed to keep every minute of hired labor and
team-work effectively employed; and when we come finally to the items of low markets and bad
debts,--we shall see how far these and similar drawbacks have undone our arithmetic, and how
often our well-contrived balance must be taken into the footings of the other column of figures.

The regular work of the farmer, as indicated in the foregoing sketch of his occupations, and
as perceptible to the summer boarder who watches his work from the piazza, although arduous
and exacting, may be quite compatible with a happy life; and, when we estimate the promise
of the occupation as offering a pleasant livelihood, no able-bodied man need be deterred by
it. But when we add this long list of contingencies, and consider the ceaseless anxiety that
they bring, we may well hesitate before adopting such a life for ourselves or desiring it for
our children. No true estimate of the developed character of the farmer can be formed without
giving due value to this uncertain factor in the calculation.

Instances are hardly exceptional where a clear natural intelligence, an indomitable courage,
and great industry, have turned themselves into a real source of mental and moral strength.
Success achieved in spite of such drawbacks is all the sweeter and all the more inspiriting
because of them. But if we take the case of the average farmer with average human weaknesses,
we cannot fail to see, that, however well he may have borne up against the more obvious requirements
of his work, he has been warped and cramped, and often made in many ways unlovely, by the hard
and anxious toil through which his halting success has been attained.

In nearly every other occupation than farming, the hardest worker finds a daily relief from
his toil, and from the suggestion of toil, in a home that is entirely apart from his industry.
However arduous and anxious and long-continued the work, there comes a time when it is laid
aside, and when the workman goes into a new sphere, where the atmosphere is entirely changed.
His home is a place of rest and pleasure, or at least a place of change. The pen and the hammer
are left in the counting-room and in the shop; and, however far the home may fall below his
desires and ambition, it is at least free from the cares of the day's occupation.

The American farmer has no such relief. His house is a part of his farm; his fireside is shared
by an uncongenial hired man, his family circle includes too often a vulgar and uninteresting
servant; and from one year to another, his living-room being the kitchen and work-room of the
busy farmhouse, he rarely knows what it is to divest himself of the surroundings of his labor
and business, and to give himself over to the needed domestic enjoyment and recreation. It
is this feature of his life, more than any other, which seems objectionable. If it is objectionable
for him, it is infinitely more so for his wife and daughters, who, lacking the frequent visit
to the town or occasional chat with strangers, and the invigorating effect of open-air work,
yield all the more completely to depressing cares. They become more and more deficient in the
lightness and cheerfulness and mental gayety to which in any other occupation the chief toiler
of the family would look for recreation at his own fireside.

So far as interest in his business is concerned, the farmer's condition is in every way elevated
when he devotes himself to some improved form of agriculture, or to some special industry which
gives him better compensation for his work. This benefit by no means generally results from
an attempt at "scientific" agriculture, nor is the adoption of a special industry by any means
generally successful. Failure in either of these directions is disheartening and discouraging
to those who are watching his example. There are many well-tried improvements upon the old
methods of our fathers which are universally adopted, especially in the direction of the use
of better implements and more judicious care in the application of manure. But the average
agricultural newspaper, while doing great good, has naturally led enthusiastic men to see a
chance for ameliorating their condition by the adoption of processes which are not suited to
their circumstances, or which they themselves are not qualified to carry out. It is this that
has led to the outcry--much more prevalent a generation ago than now--against "book-farming."
On the whole, whatever may have been the influences of agricultural writers upon the fortunes
of their early converts, they have vastly modified and improved all modern farm-work, and have
greatly benefited the more recent farmer.

The conditions of the industry are hard, chiefly because the business of farming is a laborious
one, and one in which an enormous population is working, with dogged industry, for a moderate
reward. However enterprising and intelligent a farmer may be, when he goes to market to sell
his crops he finds himself in active competition with men who are working for their bare subsistence.

Much is said about the competition of the farmers of the rich West as a serious obstacle to
success at the East. This is the case only in so far as the Eastern farmer attempts to compete
with the Western in the production of crops which will bear storage and long transportation.
As a business proposition, it seems clear that this drawback is to be overcome only by the
cultivation at the East of such products as it is not within the power of Western competition
to supply, or only such as our situation and the good quality of our land will enable us to
produce at low cost. Milk, fresh butter, and hay are the three most promising staples, for
which so large a demand exists as to furnish employment for the whole farming population. Hay
from its bulk does not bear a very long transportation. Milk will always bring a higher price
when produced near to the point where it is to be consumed. Butter-making is not an especially
profitable industry if we depend upon the average grocery-store demand; but it is possible
for any farmer at the East, who will take the trouble to make and to retain a good reputation
for his dairy, to secure a price enough higher than that of the regular market to constitute
a good margin of profit.

So far as relief in Eastern farming is to be achieved with no material change in the character
of life and work, it must apparently be sought in these directions. In his relation to Eastern
civilization, past, present, and prospective, it may fairly be questioned whether the influence
of the Eastern farmer is increased since the general introduction of railroads; and we are
justified in looking with some anxiety to the relative position which he is to hold hereafter.

There are well-known influences at work which are not promising. The desire of the sons and
daughters of the farmer to obtain some other means of livelihood, and the too frequent yielding
to this temptation on the part of the more intelligent of these young persons, is the most
obvious danger to the future of the industry.

Much has been said of the dignity and independence which come of the ownership of land; but
it is possible that this influence has been over-estimated, and that our ideas of it have been
derived more or less from our European traditions. Perhaps, after all, we ought to and do attach
the most importance to that which is the most rare. In England, where the ownership of land
carries with it a certain social dignity, and where the mere possession of money has a less
marked influence in this direction, there is no doubt that the title-deeds to broad acres constitute
a certain sort of patent of nobility. In this country, where land is plenty and cheap and where
large fortunes are rare, a farmer gets consideration less for the amount of land that he himself
owns, than for the sum-total of the mortgages which he holds upon his neighbors' land. That
is to say, it is better to be rich in money than in land; and instances are comparatively rare,
even among those who are cultivating their ancestral acres, where the farm would not be gladly
sold for a sum of which the income would secure a better and easier mode of life. The farm
is not regarded with especial affection: it is mainly regarded--along with its stock and tools--as
an instrument for making money.

The American farmer is distinguished from the English farmer chiefly by having his capital
invested in the land which he cultivates, rather than in the tools and live stock and working
capital needed to carry on his business. As a general rule the farmer's whole fortune is invested
in his land. Often his farm is mortgaged, and he has little loose money with which to improve
his system of work. The necessity for making a living and paying interest, without sufficient
capital for the best management, makes the life of the farmer too often a grinding one. If
he is skilful and industrious and prudent, he may hope with certainty to free himself from
debt, and to accumulate a respectable support for his old age.

When we consider any class of working people, as a class, this is perhaps all that we can hope
for under any circumstances. The unhopeful thing about it all is that while farmers work less
hard than their fathers did, and while they get a better return for their work, the surroundings
of their life have not improved as have those of men engaged in other industries, so that although
actually much better off than their ancestors were, they are relatively less well off in the
more attractive conditions of other classes of workmen; and this deficiency is driving away
the children on whom they ought to depend for assistance and for succession.

In the abstract, farming is a dignified occupation, and in proportion as it borrows aid from
science it becomes more dignified. So far as the casual observer can see, it combines more
of what is desirable than does any other pursuit. While it promises no brilliant reward, it
insures a steady, reliable, and sufficient return for the capital and labor invested in it.
It promises a sure provision for old age, and it secures the wholesome pride that comes of
the ownership of visible property. Indeed, look at it and argue about it as we may, it is not
easy to see why it is not the best occupation for a wholesome and intelligent man.

Those who know the condition of the art intimately, and who have studied the influences of
its work and its life upon those who are engaged in it, recognize serious drawbacks which must
in some way be removed unless it is to fall away still more from its original character, and
is to be given over to German and Irish immigrants, who, during one or two generations, will
be contented with what it has to offer. It is difficult even to theorize as to the means of
relief, if farming must be considered, first of all, as a means for obtaining a livelihood
and for making money; and no effort to improve the situation of the farmer will be successful
which does not keep this prime necessity always in view. It is easy to see how the condition
of any farmer's family might be improved by a large additional income; but there is no obvious
source from which this increase is to be drawn, nor will he adopt any scheme that will endanger
the income that he now receives.

If we could convert the farmer into a chemist and physiologist, and give him the satisfaction
that comes of controlling the combinations of physical and chemical materials according to
laws which he understands, and of securing his results with scientific accuracy, we should
accomplish our purpose; for no man with such scientific knowledge, realizing its relation to
his daily work, could fail of an enthusiastic fondness for his profession. But the worst of
it is that all efforts in this direction have generally ended in producing a "smatterer," whose
theories are baffled by constant disappointment, and whose worldly prosperity is lessened by
his mistaken experiments.

Successful farming implies, first of all, steady and dogged hard work, coupled with prudent
and watchful skill. When the hopes of enthusiastic agricultural reformers are considered with
the practical eye of cold common sense, they must inevitably be condemned to disappointment.
In so far as they constitute an incentive towards improvement, they work great good; but the
success of the future is to be attained too often through the distressing failure of the present.
The art is an experimental one, and the temptations to extend experiments are enticing. Unfortunately,
novel processes depend for their success upon contingencies which are likely to be disregarded
at the outset; and, however much any improvement may be destined to prosper after its application
shall have been practically tested and modified, it is altogether likely that its first introduction
will result in failure. The mere money losses coming of these failures are not so serious;
but the discouragement and disappointment that they entail exert the gravest influence where
what is chiefly needed is the encouragement of success.

It is something to know the direction that improving effort should take; and it seems to be
generally conceded that what American agriculture needs, at the East and at the West, but especially
at the East, is an improvement in the character of its personnel. There is everywhere ample
opportunity for the profitable and successful introduction of modified processes and of new
industries. There is, too, hardly an instance where the processes and industries now pursued
are not susceptible of great improvement of detail. There are few farms so well managed and
so successful, that if given into the hands of better, more intelligent, and more enterprising
farmers, they would not produce better results. The father is working according to his light,
and is directing his work by such intelligence as his natural capacity and his training have
given him. His brighter son, with more natural intelligence, with a better education, and less
trammelled by traditions and prejudices, might so modify the same industry as to make it more
certain, more profitable, and in every way more satisfactory.

The change that is now taking place, especially in New England, is toward the greater economy
of living, and the harder work and closer management of business, that comes with immigrant
proprietorship; and this element is by no means to be depended upon for the improvement of
our farming. It may result in a more money-making agriculture, but it will supplant our best
political element by the introduction of what has thus far seemed to be one of the worst.

Look at this question as we will, it is difficult to see how else than by improving the race
of American farmers we are to accomplish any result whose good effect will be radical and lasting.
This brings us around to that threadbare subject of the vague discussion of agricultural writers:
"How to keep the boys on the farm."

The devices recommended for accomplishing this result have thus far failed of their object.
The average farmer boy is not a sentimentalist, and he is not likely to be moved by the sort
of talk so often lavished upon him. To use a vulgarism, he has an extremely "level head." He
fails to realize the attraction and the dignity which are implied by what he is told of the
nobleness of his father's calling, of the purifying and elevating influences of a daily intercourse
with nature. He is not to be caught with this sort of chaff. His cultivation has not been of
that æsthetic character that he has an especial drawing toward nobleness, or purity, or elevation.
Nature, as he knows it, shows at times an unattractive side; and he fails to recognize precisely
what is meant by Mother Earth as a source of dignity. To him Mother Earth is an exacting parent,
calling for constant and regular toil, and whipping him on day by day with weeds to be hoed,
dry gardens to be watered, snowdrifts to be shovelled, and an almost endless round of embarrassments
to be overcome. As for the purity and simplicity of the farmer's life, he knows very much better
than to pin his faith to it. To him the farmer's house is too often a place where the mother
is overworked, tired, wearied with constant annoyance, and made peevish and fretful. The conversation
of hired men and young neighbors and brothers is not marked by refined delicacy and simplicity,
as he understands these terms. At the end of all our preaching he will say, at least to himself,
that this is probably the sort of talk that we consider appropriate to the occasion, but that,
if we knew what he knows about farming, we should see how little effect it is likely to have.
If he sought our motive in saying it, he would conclude that we were interested in keeping
up the supply of farm labor; and that so far as he was concerned, since he must work for a
living, he would work at some other industry if he could get a chance, and leave those who
were less fortunate to work on the farm.

The more sentimental and more influential considerations governing in this matter were very
well set forth by Dr. Holland in a paper on Farm Life in New England, published in "The Atlantic
Monthly" some twenty years ago. While acknowledging the frequency of bright exceptions to the
rule, he does not hesitate to set it down as a rule that the life described is in every way
a hateful one; where every member of the family, from father to child, is driven by the lash
of stern necessity, and where many conditions which are deemed requisite in the life of all
other classes of the same wealth are comparatively rare; where the expectant mother of the
child is worked without stint to her last day, while the mother of the colt is relieved from
all hard toil and treated with consideration throughout the last months of her time; where,
in short, whether from interest or from a mistaken idea of necessity, hard work long hours,
poor food, and dismal surroundings are the rule of the farmer's household.

Since that time there have been noticeable modifications, involving the introduction of more
or less tastefulness, because of the cheap literature and cheap music of these later days.
But, much as these have done to affect the individual characters of the younger members of
the family, they have only aggravated the evil, so far as farm-work is concerned, by creating
a desire, born of knowledge, for the pleasanter manner of life which the town has to offer.
The young girls whom one now sees about railway stations in the most distant part of the country
are dressed after the instructions of "Harper's Bazar" and "Peterson's Magazine;" and they
know more than their older sisters did of the difference between their own life and that of
their city cousins. They are certainly not to be blamed if they long for some vocation in which
they can more freely indulge their growing ideas of luxury, and gratify their growing desire
for better dress and more interesting companionship.

All that has here been said is seriously true and important. The circumstances described are
so generally prevalent as to constitute, with constant minor variations, an almost universal
rule. Where we are to look for relief, is the most serious problem. Relief must be found, or
the character of our farming class must assuredly degenerate. In one way or another we must
change, in a radical degree, the conditions of the farmer's life. We can perfectly understand
why it should be distasteful to any young person of ordinary ambition or intelligence; and
we know, from the constant flocking of farmers' sons and daughters to even the least attractive
employments of the town or village, that this distaste is everywhere a controlling one.

It is easy to say that the farmer's life must be made more cheerful, attractive, and refined,
and less arduous; but it is by no means easy to see how the improvement is to be brought about.
The cardinal defect is the loneliness and dulness of the isolated farmhouse. Intelligent and
educated young women, brought up among the pleasantest surroundings, marry young farmers, and
undertake their new life with the determination that, in their case at least, the more obvious
social requirements shall be met. During the earlier years after marriage they adhere to their
resolution, and are regular in attendance at the church and public lecture; and they keep up,
so far as possible, social intercourse with their neighbors. But as time goes on, as the family
increases, as toil begins to tell on health and strength and energy, they drop out, little
by little, from the habit of going abroad, until often for weeks together they never exchange
a look or thought with any human being outside of their own households. Aside from the overworked
members of their own families, their companionship is confined to hired men who smell of the
stable, and to hired girls with whom they are yoked in the daily round of household duties.

Having given much consideration to the subject, I have come to believe that the agriculture
of Continental Europe is far more wisely arranged than ours; for there, almost as a universal
rule, isolated farm-life is unknown. The reward of the cultivator is less, and his labor is
at least as great. The people are of a very much lower order, and are lacking in the cultivated
intelligence which distinguishes so many of our own farming class. Women and even young girls
perform rude labor in the field and in the stable; and those aspirations which are born of
a universal diffusion of periodical literature are almost unknown. At the same time, when the
hard and long day's work is over, there comes to all the inexpressible relief and delight of
the active social intercourse of the village, where the tillers of the country for a mile around
have gathered together their homes and their herds, and where the most intimate social life
prevails.

Observation even indicates that the habit of out-of-door labor has had no injurious effect
upon the women of these villages. The "nut-brown maid" grows too fast into the wrinkled-brown
woman; but better a sunburnt and weather-beaten cheek than that pallor that comes of anthracite
and in-door toil. Better the broad back and stout limb of the peasant mother than the hollow
chest and wasted energy of the American farmer's wife.

I by no means intend to say that our own farming class is not far superior to the peasantry
of Europe; but I do believe that if a good system of village life for farmers could be adopted
here under the modifying influences of the more refined and intelligent American character,
we should have gained a most important step in advance. We have in New England many villages
almost exclusively of farmers,--villages where the old-time settlers gathered together for
defence against the Indians, and for the protection of houses and stock and store from river
floods. These villages are as different as it is possible to conceive from the ordinary European
cluster of unattractive cottages, lining both sides of a street which is filled for one-half
of its width with manure-heaps. It may be naturally assumed that any adaptation of the village
system among us would be governed by the same refining influences which have made our few existing
agricultural villages so beautiful and attractive.

That which most distinguishes American people is the general spread of education among them;
but it is, after all, an education which soon reaches its limit, and, so far as the district-school
of a sparsely-settled country neighborhood is concerned, it goes little beyond the simplest
rudiments. An inexperienced young miss holds school for not more than one-half the year in
an unattractive and inconvenient room, in which are gathered together most of the boys and
girls of the school-going age from all the farms about. The books and other appliances of instruction
are inadequate. There is no grading of the pupils, and the frequent change of teachers prevents
the possibility of experienced instructions. Even in the meanest peasant village of Germany,
a village always prolific in children, an inexorable law compels all between the ages of five
and fourteen to attend regularly the teaching of a master, an officer of the state, who has
generally adopted his profession for life, and who adds to a certain specified degree of capability
the advantages of long experience.

No thoughtful person can fail to be convinced, after a due consideration of the argument in
its favor, that, if the social influences inseparable from village-life could be secured to
the American farmer, the greatest drawback of his life would be done away with. It remains,
unfortunately, a serious question, how far such a radical change is practicable. There is little
doubt that the family would naturally drift into some more costly style of living; and the
necessity for hauling to a distant home all the crops of the fields, and of hauling out the
manure made at the homestead, would add somewhat to the expenses of the business.

In the case of the individual farmer now cultivating land upon which he lives, it is not unlikely
that he would find a certain pecuniary disadvantage in the change. But, as a broad question
of the future benefit of our agriculture, it must be conceded that whatever will tend to make
the occupation more attractive cannot fail, by enlisting the services of more intelligent minds,
to insure its very decided improvement. As the case now stands, the farmer's son will become
a clerk or a mechanic rather than remain a farmer, because clerks and mechanics live in communities
where there is more to interest the mind, and where, too, the opportunities for enjoyment and
amusement are greater. The farmer's daughter will marry the clerk or the mechanic rather than
a farmer, because she knows the life of a farmer's wife to be a life of dulness and dearth,
while she believes that the wife of the clerk or mechanic will be condemned to less arduous
labor, and will have much more agreeable surroundings. I have no means of judging what may
have been the experience in Deerfield, Mass., for instance; but I am confident that many a
mechanic's daughter, and indeed many young women of much higher position in life, would consider
her lot a fortunate one in becoming the wife of a farmer whose homestead lay on the beautiful
street of this old village.

All that is here said is, to a certain extent, mere theory; but the subject is one that has
not thus far met any practical solution, and in which, therefore, nothing except theorizing
is possible. The broad fact is that the farming class in this country is degenerating by the
withdrawal of its best blood; and still more serious injury is being done to it by the introduction
of the lower class of foreigners. It may well be doubted whether it is possible so to modify
the manner of life of the isolated farmhouse as to make it materially more attractive to American
boys and girls. All that can be done is to rob it of its isolation by withdrawing its people,
and placing them under better conditions of life.

In a word, the only way that seems to offer to keep the boys on the farm is to move everybody
off of the farm, bringing them together into snug little communities, where they may secure,
without abandoning the manifest advantages of their occupation, the greater social interest
and stimulus which they now hope to enjoy by going into other callings whose natural advantages
are less. That such a course as this would restore the farmer to his former position as a leading
element in Eastern civilization, cannot be questioned. That he will retain even the relative
influence that he exercises to-day, unless some radical change is made, is at least very doubtful.

In considering the questions here suggested, we must never lose sight of the fact that the
controlling element is economy. The farmer exists because he is needed. The world demands the
products that he produces, and the world must needs pay him a living compensation for them.
No change will be possible which disregards this; and all who know the present circumstances
which control the reward of the farming class know that these circumstances would be inadequate
to maintain him in a life of greater ease, while calling for greater expense. This gives the
added embarrassment that we must not only change the mode of life, but must also increase the
ratio of profit, if this is possible. This is possible only through a reduction of the area
cultivated, the cultivation of this reduced area in a more thorough and profitable way, and
the turning of farming industry into channels better adapted to securing a profitable return.

To discuss a modification of the whole system of farming would involve far more detail than
is possible in this paper, since such a discussion must include the consideration of features
which would change with changing locality; but, by way of illustration, we may take the previously
supposed case of a farmer owning one hundred acres of land, and milking a dozen cows, selling
the milk as before in the distant town. Assume that he and his neighbors within a radius of
about a mile are living in a central village, from which his land is one mile distant. During
the working season, say from the middle of April until late in October, he must, with his teams
and assistants, spend the whole day on the land. The cows are milked and all stable work done
before breakfast, and some one drives them out to pasture. The men remain a-field until an
hour before sunset. They must be content with a cold dinner, as is the usual custom with mechanics
and laborers. The cows are driven home in time for the evening milking, and are put into the
barnyard at night with green fodder brought home by the returning teams. After the "chores"
are done, and a hearty and substantial supper is eaten,--the principal meal of the day,--all
hands will be too weary for much enjoyment of the evening, but not so weary that they will
not appreciate the difference between the lounging places of a village and the former dulness
at the farm. Other farmers in the neighborhood will, many of them, also be milk producers;
and, as the stables are near together, they will naturally co-operate, sending their milk to
market with a single team, employing the services of a single man in the place of five or six
men and teams heretofore needed to market the same milk. I have recently received an account
of this sort of co-operation, where the cost of selling was reduced to a fraction over eight
cents for each hundred quarts.

This arrangement will have the still further benefit of allowing the farmer to remain at home
and attend to his more important work, leaving the detail of marketing to be done by a person
especially qualified for it and therefore able to do it more cheaply than he could do it in
person. During the working season there will be enough rainy weather to allow the work of the
stable, the barnyard, and the woodshed to be properly attended to. There will of course be
sudden showers and occasional storms, and other inconveniences, which will make the farmer
regret at times that he lives at such a distance from his field work; but he will find more
than compensation in the advantages that come naturally from living in a village.

For his wife and children the improvement will be absolute; and it will be no slight argument
in favor of the change, that both in doors and out of doors a better class of servants will
be available, because of the better life that can be offered. It will be easier to secure the
services of laborers who are married and who live in their own houses, and so avoid the serious
annoyance to the household that attends the boarding of hired men.

To make this radical change in any farming neighborhood as at present constituted, would be
impracticable. It would probably take a generation to convince the farmers of a community of
its advantages; it would cost too much, even if not entirely impracticable, to move the house
and stables to the central point; and it would involve such a change of habits of labor and
of living as must necessarily be the work of time. However, if the principle commends itself
to the leading men of the neighborhood, and especially to young men about to marry, the nucleus
of a village may be established, and sooner or later the present or the coming generation will
find a way to come into the fold.

If we assume that by this or some other means the more intelligent of the young men are induced
to remain farmers, it is interesting to consider in what way their greater intelligence is
to be made to tell on their work so as to secure the necessary improvement. It would not be
unreasonable to suppose that young men of the class we have in mind, those who now seek occupations
which afford a better field for their intelligence, and who seek them because of their intelligence,
would establish such centres of discussion and interest in improved farming as would not only
mitigate the worthless gossip now so common at the country store, but would awaken a real enthusiasm
in better processes and systems.

Not only would there be this tendency toward improvement; but where farmers are close neighbors,
and are able to conduct their interests in such a way as to help each other, there would naturally
grow up some sort of co-operative business. By the establishment of a butter-factory or cheese-factory,
or by the common ownership of a milk-route, or where tobacco is grown by the undertaking of
its manufacture as an employment for winter, or by the raising of honey or of poultry, or by
the establishment of some valuable breed of live stock with a reputation for excellence that
will cause it to be sought for from abroad, or by some other combination, they would secure
profitable business.

Of course all the farmers in New England cannot within the next ten years move into villages;
but what is suggested is that the farmers of some one community should try the experiment.
Their success might induce others to follow the example; and little by little, in proportion
to the promise of a good result, more and more would seek the advantages which the system would
offer, so that sooner or later the benefits which are now experienced in village life in Europe
might be felt here in the higher degree which greater intelligence and greater freedom would
be sure to produce.

While advancing these suggestions, with much confidence in their practical value, I would by
no means confine the outlook for Eastern farming to this single road to success. Co-operative
industry may be largely adopted among farmers living at some distance from each other. The
cheese-factory has become an institution. The better quality of the product when made in large
quantities, and the better price that its quality and the improved system for marketing have
secured, constitute a very decided success in our agriculture. Butter-factories are coming
into vogue with a promise of equally good results.

A very good substitute for the co-operative management of a milk route is in very general adoption
throughout New England, where some single farmer who devotes himself to selling milk buys the
product of his neighbor's dairies for a certain fixed price, taking upon himself the labor,
the risk, and the profit of marketing. The co-operative breeding of live stock cannot as yet
be said to have become well established, but its possibilities of success are considerable.
A community can afford to buy and keep a thorough-bred horse, or bull, or boar, or buck, which
would cost far too much for the means of a single owner, and thus gradually give to the stock
of the whole neighborhood a superiority that will secure it a wide-spread reputation and insure
good prices. Let us keep always in view the important principle of making two blades of grass
grow where but one grew before; but let us remit no effort which may tend to make one blade
worth what two were worth before.

Incidentally, there may be combinations to secure good outlet drainage for tracts of land belonging
to different owners, and later a provision for the general irrigation of these lands.

It is not to be hoped, that, either as a whole or in its details, agricultural improvement
is to be advanced with any thing like a rush. Farmers are generally "conservative" in the worst
sense of the term. They have during the past generation adopted many improvements and modifications
in the methods of their work, the mere suggestion of which would have been scouted by their
fathers; but they are themselves as ready as their fathers were to scout any further new suggestion,
and it is only by iteration and reiteration that the shorter steps of tentative experiment
can be urged upon their acceptance.

In reviewing what is written above, the thought arises that the one impression that it will
surely produce will be that its writer fails to appreciate the better influences that cluster
around the better class of farmers' homes. Such an inference would be quite unjust. Knowing
as I do the intrinsic worth and the charming qualities of very many of these households, I
appeal to the best of the thoughtful men and women whom they include, to confirm my statement
that they find many elements of their life to be pinching and hard, and that however admirable
they may now be, they would be in no way injured, but in many ways improved, by more frequent
intercourse with their equals, and especially with their betters.

That the picture I have sketched of the average farmer's family is not overdrawn, I appeal
to every country clergyman and physician to bear witness. The truths suggested are patent to
all. They are set forth in no spirit of hypercriticism, and with no other view than to help
to ameliorate the condition of those to whom they refer. Knowing the farmer more intimately
than does the average editor or orator, I am confident that my estimate of his character and
of his life will strike him as being more just, if not more honest.
