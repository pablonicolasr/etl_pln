CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, by HORACE E. SCUDDER.

Each about 140 pages, 16mo, with photogravure portrait, vols. The biographies which I have
found most useful are the "Life," by John Henry Sherburne, published in 1825, which is mainly
a collection of Jones's correspondence; another volume, composed largely of extracts from his
letters and journals, called the "Janette-Taylor Collection," published in 1830; the first
and only extended narrative at once readable and impartial, by Alexander Slidell MacKenzie,
published in 1845; and the recently published "Life" by Augustus C. Buell. To Mr. Buell's exhaustive
work I am indebted for considerable original material not otherwise accessible to me. On the
basis of the foregoing mass of material I have attempted, in a short sketch, to give merely
an unbiased account of the man.

PAUL JONES

I

EARLY VOYAGES

John Paul, known as Paul Jones, who sought restlessly for distinction all his life, was born
the son of a peasant, in July, 1747, near the ocean on which he was to spend a large portion
of his time. His father lived in Scotland, near the fishing hamlet of Arbigland, county of
Kirkcudbright, on the north shore of Solway Firth, and made a living for the family of seven
children by fishing and gardening. The mother, Jeanne Macduff, was the daughter of a Highlander,
and in Paul Jones's blood the Scotch canniness and caution of his Lowland father was united
with the wild love of physical action native to his mother's race.

Little is known of the early life of the fifth and famous child of the Scotch gardener. He
went to the parish school, but not for long, for the sea called him at an early age. When he
was twelve years old he could handle his fishing-boat like a veteran. His skill and daring
were the talk of the village. One day James Younger, a ship-owning merchant from Whitehaven,
then a principal seaport on the neighboring coast of England, visited Arbigland, in search
of seamen for one of his vessels. It happened on that day that Paul Jones was out in his yawl
when a severe squall arose. Mr. Younger and the villagers watched the boy bring his small sailing-boat
straight against the northeaster into the harbor; and Mr. Younger expressed his surprise to
Paul's father, who remarked: "That's my boy conning the boat, Mr. Younger. This isn't much
of a squall for him." The result was that Mr. Younger took Paul back with him to Whitehaven,
bound shipmaster's apprentice. A little while after that, Paul Jones made his first of a series
of merchant-ship voyages to the colonies and the West Indies. He continued in Mr. Younger's
employ for four years; when he was seventeen he made a round voyage to America as second mate,
and was first mate a year later.

Paul left Mr. Younger's service in 1766 and acquired a sixth interest in a ship called King
George's Packet, in which he went, as first mate, to the West Indies. The business instinct,
always strong in him, received some satisfaction during this voyage by the transportation of
blacks from Africa to Jamaica, where they were sold as slaves. The slave-trade was not regarded
at that time as dishonorable, but Jones's eagerness to engage in "any private enterprise"--a
phrase constantly used by him--was not accompanied by any keen moral sensitiveness. Mr. Schoolcraft
was killed and his niece taken prisoner.

In June, John Owens, John Juggins and Owen Owens, were attacked by
some Indians, as they were going to their cornfield on Booth's creek;
and the two former were killed and scalped.

Owen Owens being some distance behind them, made his escape to the fort. John Owens the younger,
who had been to the pasture field for the plough horses, heard the guns, but not suspecting
any danger to be near, rode forward towards the cornfield. As he was proceeding along the
path by a fence side, riding one and leading another horse, he was fired at by several Indians,
some of whom afterwards rushed forward and caught at the bridle reins; yet he escaped unhurt
from them all.

The savages likewise visited Cheat river, during the spring, and coming to the house of John Sims,
were discovered by a negro woman, who ran immediately to the door and alarmed the family.--Bernard
Sims (just recovering from the small pox) taking down his gun, and going to the door, was
shot.

The Indians, perceiving that he was affected with a disease, of all others the most terrifying
to them, not only did not perform the accustomed operation of scalping, but retreated with as
much rapidity, as if they had been pursued by an overwhelming force of armed men,--exclaiming
as they ran "small pox, small pox."

After the attack on Donnelly's fort in May 1778, the Indians made no attempt to effect farther
mischiefs in the Greenbrier country, until this year. The fort at Point Pleasant guarded the principal
pass to the settlements on the Kenhawa, in the Levels, and on Greenbrier river, and the reception
with which they had met at Col. Donnelly's, convinced them that not much was to be gained by
incursions into that section of the frontiers. But as they were now making great preparations for
effectual operations against the whole border country, a party of them was despatched to this portion
of it, at once for the purpose of rapine and murder, and to ascertain the state of the country
and its capacity to resist invasion.

The party then sent into Greenbrier consisted of twenty-two [211] warriors, and committed their
first act of atrocity near the house of Lawrence Drinnan, a few miles above the Little Levels.
Henry Baker and Richard Hill, who were then staying there, going early in the morning to the river
to wash, were shot at by them: Baker was killed, but Hill escaped back to the house. When
the Indians fired at Baker, he was near a fence between the river and Drinnan's and within
gunshot of the latter place.

Fearing to cross the fence for the purpose of scalping him, they prized it up, and with a pole fastening
a noose around his neck, drew him down the river bank & scalped and left him there.

Apprehensive of an attack on the house, Mr. Drinnan made such preparations as were in his power
to repel them, and despatched a servant to the Little Levels, with the intelligence and to procure
assistance. He presently returned with twenty men, who remained there during the night, but in the
morning, seeing nothing to contradict the belief that the Indians had departed, they buried Baker,
and set out on their return to the Levels, taking with them all who were at Drinnan's and
the most of his property. Arrived at the fork of the road, a question arose whether they should
take the main route, leading through a gap which was deemed a favorable situation for an ambuscade,
or continue on the farther but more open and secure way. A majority preferred the latter; but
two young men, by the name of Bridger, separated from the others,
and travelling on the nearer path, were both killed at the place,
where it was feared danger might be lurking.

The Indians next proceeded
to the house of Hugh McIver, where they succeeded in killing its owner,
and in making prisoner his wife; and in going from thence, met with
John Prior, who with his wife and infant were on their way to the
country on the south side of the Big Kenawha. Prior was shot through
the breast, but anxious for the fate of his wife and child, stood
still, 'till one of the Indians came up and laid hold on him. Notwithstanding
the severe wound which he had received, Prior proved too strong for
his opponent, and the other Indians not interfering, forced him at
length to disengage himself from the struggle. In Jones's intercourse with these men he showed himself
one of the most fiery of Whigs. In a letter to Joseph Hewes written in 1774, he tells how a
British officer made a remark reflecting on the virtue of colonial women. "I at once knocked
Mr. Parker down," he adds, in a style that suggests the straightforward character of his official
reports.

Although dueling was at that time the conventional method of settling affairs of that nature,
no personal encounter resulted between Jones and Mr. Parker. Jones, indeed, did not seem averse
to such an issue, for he sent a friend to propose pistols, with which he was a crack shot.
It is nevertheless a striking fact that Paul Jones, the desperate fighter, who was certainly
as brave as any one, and was often placed in favorable situations for such settlements, never
fought a duel. Add to this that his temper was quick and passionate, and that he had to the
full the high-flown sentiments of honor of the time, and the fact seems all the more remarkable.
The truth is that Jones was as cautious as he was brave. He acted sometimes impulsively, but
reflection quickly came, and he never manifested a dare-devil desire to put his life unnecessarily
in danger. When there was anything to be gained by exposing his person, he did it with the
utmost coolness, but he consistently refused to put himself at a disadvantage. When, on at
least one occasion, he was challenged to fight with swords, with which he was only moderately
skillful, he demanded pistols. Fame was Jones's end, and he knew that premature death was inconsistent
with that consummation.

Although Jones was, at the time, in financial difficulties, he no doubt welcomed the outbreak
of the war. Service in the cause of the colonies could not be remunerative, and Jones knew
it. A privateering command would have paid better than a regular commission, but Jones constantly
refused such an appointment; and yet he has been called buccaneer and pirate by many who have
written about him, including as recent writers as Rudyard Kipling, John Morley, and Theodore
Roosevelt. Nor is it likely that a feeling of patriotism led Jones to serve the colonies against
his native land. The reason lay in his overpowering desire of action. He saw in the service
of the colonies an opportunity to employ his energies on a larger and more glorious scale than
in any other way. Service in the British navy in an important capacity was impossible for a
man with no family or position. Jones accordingly went in for the highest prize within his
reach, and with the instinct of the true sportsman served well the side he had for the time
espoused.

Soon after the battle of Lexington Jones wrote a letter to Joseph Hewes, sending copies to
Jefferson, Robert Morris, and Livingston. "I cannot conceive of submission to complete slavery.
Therefore only war is in sight.... I beg you to keep my name in your memory when the Congress
shall assemble again, and ... to call upon me in any capacity which your knowledge of my seafaring
experience and your opinion of my qualifications may dictate." Soon after Congress met, a Marine
Committee, Robert Morris, chairman, was appointed, and Jones was requested to report on the
"proper qualifications of naval officers and the kind of armed vessels most desirable for the
service of the United States, keeping in view the limited resources of the Congress." He was
also asked to serve on a committee to report upon the availability of the vessels at the disposal
of Congress. Jones was practically the head of this committee, and showed the utmost industry
and efficiency in selecting, arming, and preparing for sea the unimportant vessels within the
disposition of the government.

At the beginning of the war there was no American navy. Some of the colonies had, indeed, fitted
out merchant vessels with armaments, to resist the aggressions of the British on their coasts,
and in several instances the cruisers of the enemy had been captured while in port by armed
citizens. The colonial government had empowered Washington, as commander in chief, to commission
some of these improvised war vessels of the colonies to attack, in the service of the "continent,"
the transports and small cruisers of the British, in order to secure powder for the Continental
army. It was not, however, until October of 1775 that the first official attempt towards the
formation of a continental, as opposed to a colonial, navy, was made. The large merchant marine
put at the disposal of the new government many excellent seamen and skippers and a good number
of ships, few of them, however, adapted for war. To build regular warships on a large scale
was impossible for a nation so badly in need of funds. It was almost equally difficult to secure
officers trained in naval matters, for the marine captains, although as a rule good seamen,
were utterly lacking in naval knowledge and the principles of organization.

In this state of affairs Paul Jones proved a very useful man. He was not only a thorough seaman,
but had studied the art of naval warfare, was in some respects ahead of his time in his ideas
of armament, and was familiar with the organization and history of the British navy. In the
early development of our navy he played, therefore, an important part, not only in equipping
and arming ships for immediate service, and in determining upon the most effective and practicable
kind of vessels to be built, but also in laying before the committee a statement of the necessary
requirements for naval officers.

To the request of Congress for reports, Jones answered with two remarkable documents. One was
a long, logical argument in favor of swift frigates of a certain size, rather than ships of
the line, and showed thorough knowledge, not only of naval construction and cost of building,
but also of the general international situation, and the best method of conducting the war
on the sea. On the latter point he wrote: "Keeping such a squadron in British waters, alarming
their coasts, intercepting their trade, and descending now and then upon their least protected
ports, is the only way that we, with our slender resources, can sensibly affect our enemy by
sea-warfare." This is an exact outline of the policy which Jones and other United States captains
actually carried out.

Jones also made the statement, wonderfully foreshadowing his own exploits and their effect,
that, "the capture ... of one or two of their crack frigates would raise us more in the estimation
of Europe, where we now most of all need countenance, than could the defeat or even capture
of one of their armies on the land here in America. And at the same time it would fill all
England with dismay. If we show to the world that we can beat them afloat with an equal force,
ship to ship, it will be more than anyone else has been able to do in modern times, and it
will create a great and most desirable sentiment of respect and favor towards us on the continent
of Europe, where really, I think, the question of our fate must ultimately be determined.

"Beyond this, if by exceedingly desperate fighting, one of our ships shall conquer one of theirs
of markedly superior force, we shall be hailed as the pioneers of a new power on the sea, with
untold prospects of development, and the prestige if not the substance of English dominion
over the ocean will be forever broken. Happy, indeed, will be the lot of the American captain
upon whom fortune shall confer the honor of fighting that battle!"

Jones was that happy captain, for both the events mentioned as highly desirable he brought to pass.

In the report on the qualifications of naval officers Jones showed himself to be quite abreast
of our own times in the philosophy of naval organization, and, moreover, possessed of a pen
quite capable of expressing, always with clearness and dignity and sometimes with elegance,
the full maturity of his thought. George Washington, one of whose great qualities was the power
to know men, read this report of Jones and said: "Mr. Jones is clearly not only a master mariner
within the scope of the art of navigation, but he also holds a strong and profound sense of
the political and military weight of command on the sea. His powers of usefulness are great
and must be constantly kept in view."

Jones was appointed first lieutenant in the navy on the 22d of December, 1775. He was sixth
on the list of appointees, the other five being made captains. Subsequent events showed that
Jones would have been the best man for the first place. He thought so himself, but hastened
on board his ship to serve as lieutenant, and was the first man who ever hoisted the American
flag on a man-of-war,--a spectacular trifle that gave him much pleasure.

II

CRUISES OF THE PROVIDENCE AND THE ALFRED

The infant squadron of the United States, under the command of Ezek Hopkins, consisting of
the Alfred, of which Jones was the first lieutenant, the Columbus, the Andria Doria, and the
Cabot, sailed in February, 1776, against Fort Nassau, New Providence Island, in the Bahamas.
The only vessel of any force in the squadron was the Alfred, an East Indiaman, which Jones
had armed with twenty-four nine-pounders on the gun-deck, and six six-pounders on the quarter-deck.
The only officer in the fleet who, with the exception of Jones, ever showed any ability was
Nicholas Biddle of the Doria. The expedition, consequently, was sufficiently inglorious. A
barren descent was made on New Providence Island, and later the fleet was engaged with the
British sloop of war Glasgow, which, in spite of the odds against her, seems to have had the
best of the encounter. Jones was stationed between decks to command the Alfred's first battery,
which he trained on the enemy with his usual efficiency. He says in his journal what was evidently
true: "Mr. Jones, therefore, did his duty; and as he had no direction whatever, either of the
general disposition of the squadron, or the sails and helm of the Alfred, he can stand charged
with no part of the disgrace of that night."

A number of courts-martial resulted from this inept affair and from other initial mistakes.
Captain Hazard of the Providence, a sloop of war of fourteen guns and 103 men, was dismissed
from the service, and Jones was put in command of the ship. "This proves," said Jones, "that
Mr. Jones did his duty on the Providence expedition."

Jones continued to do his duty by making a number of energetic descents on the enemy's shipping.
His method was to hunt out the merchant vessels in harbor, whence they could not escape, rather
than to search for them on the open sea. In June, 1776, he cruised in the Providence from Bermuda
to the Banks of Newfoundland, a region infested with the war vessels of the British, captured
sixteen vessels, made an attack on Canso, Nova Scotia, thereby releasing several American prisoners,
burned three vessels belonging to the Cape Breton fishery, and in a descent on the Isle of
Madame destroyed several fishing smacks. He twice escaped, through superior seamanship, from
heavy English frigates. One of these strong frigates, the Milford, continued to fire from a
great distance, after the little Providence was out of danger. Of this Jones wrote: "He excited
my contempt so much, by his continued firing, at more than twice the proper distance, that
when he rounded to, to give his broadside, I ordered my marine officer to return the salute
with only a single musket."

While Jones was on this cruise his plantation was ravaged by the British--buildings burned,
live stock destroyed, and slaves carried off. He was dependent upon the income from this estate,
having drawn up to that time only £50 from the government, not for pay, but for the expense
of enlisting seamen. On his return to port he wrote to Mr. Hewes: "It thus appears that I have
no fortune left but my sword, and no prospect except that of getting alongside the enemy." 

Jackson (who was hunting sheep not far off) hearing the report of the guns, ran towards the spot,
and being in sight of the Indian when West shot, saw him fall and afterwards recover and hobble
off. Simon Schoolcraft, following after West, came to him just after Jackson, with his gun cocked;
and asking where the Indians were, was advised by Jackson to get behind a tree, or they would soon
let him know where they were. Instantly the report of a gun was heard, and Schoolcraft let fall
his arm. The ball had passed through it, and striking a steel tobacco box in his waistcoat pocket,
did him no farther injury. Cutright, when West fired at one of the Indians, saw another of them
drop behind a log, and changing his position, espied him, where the log was a little raised from
the earth. With steady nerves, he drew upon him. The moaning cry of the savage, as he sprang
from the ground and moved haltingly away, convinced them that the shot had taken effect. The
rest of the Indians continued behind trees, until they observed a reinforcement coming up to
the aid of the whites, and they fled with the utmost precipitancy.

Night soon coming on, those who followed them, had to give over the pursuit.

A company of fifteen men went early next morning to the battle ground, and taking the trail of
the Indians and pursuing it some distance, came to where they had some horses (which they had
stolen after the skirmish) hobbled out on a fork of Hacker's creek. They [210] then found
the plunder which the savages had taken from neighboring houses, and supposing that their wounded
warriors were near, the whites commenced looking for them, when a gun was fired at them by an
Indian concealed in a laurel thicket, which wounded John Cutright.[5]
The whites then caught the stolen horses and returned with them and
the plunder to the fort.

For some time after this, there was nothing occurring to indicate
the presence of Indians in the Buchannon settlement, and some of those
who were in the fort, hoping that they should not be again visited
by them this season, determined on returning to their homes. To Joseph Hewes:
"There are characters among the thirteen on the list who are truly contemptible--with such,
as a private gentleman, I would disdain to sit down--I would disdain to be acquainted.... Until
they give proof of their superior ability, I never shall acknowledge them as my senior officers--I
never will act under their command." He wrote to Robert Morris: " ... Nor will I ever draw
my sword under the command of any man who was not in the service as early as myself, unless
he hath merited a preference by his superior services or abilities." In these and similar remarks,
Jones did not show that sense of absolute subordination which he had said, in his report on
the qualifications of naval officers, was of prime importance, and which he strenuously demanded
from his inferiors in rank. He was always jealous of any superior in his own line, but, fortunately,
after his first cruise, he was always the ranking officer on his ship.

Jones protested, however, without avail, but on the 4th of November, 1776, he was put in command
of the Alfred, and with the Providence in company made a cruise of about a month, captured
seven merchant ships of the enemy, several of them carrying valuable supplies to the army,
and again cleverly avoided the superior British frigates. Complaining of the action of the
Providence, "which gave him the slip in the night," as he put it, Jones wrote Hewes: "If such
doings are permitted, the navy will never rise above contempt!... the aforesaid noble captain
doth not understand the first case of plain Trigonometry." On the subject of the navy he wrote
Robert Morris, at a later period: "The navy is in a wretched condition. It wants a man of ability
at its head who could bring on a purgation, and distinguish between the abilities of a gentleman
and those of a mere sailor or boatswain's mate." In still another letter: "If my feeble voice
is heard when I return to Philadelphia, our navy matters will assume a better face." Again,
as late as 1782, he wrote Captain O'Neill: "I am altogether in the dark about what has been
done to reëstablish the credit of our marine. In the course of near seven years' service I
have continually suggested what has occurred to me as most likely to promote its honor and
render it serviceable; but my voice has been like a cry in the wilderness."

After his return from the cruise in the Alfred, Jones served on the Board of Advice to the
Marine Committee, and was very useful in many ways. He urged strongly the necessity of making
a cruise in European waters for the sake of moral prestige,--he, of course, to be in command
of the squadron. His energy and dashing character made a strong impression on Lafayette, who
was then in the country, and who heartily supported Jones in the projected scheme. Lafayette
was one of the strongest advocates for an alliance between the colonies and France, and believed
that a fleet fitted out in French ports under the United States flag would not only help out
the weak colonial navy, but would precipitate war between England and France. He wrote a letter
to General Washington strongly recommending Jones as leader of such an undertaking. About the
same time Jones had an interview with Washington to appeal against what he deemed another injustice.
The Trumbull, one of the fine new frigates just completed and built in accordance with Jones's
recommendations, was placed under the command of Captain Saltonstall, who had been captain
of the Alfred when Jones was first lieutenant of the same ship, and against whom the latter
had made charges of incompetence. Jones did not get the Trumbull, but the interview was probably
instrumental in procuring an order from the Marine Committee for Jones to enlist seamen for
a European cruise. On June 14, 1777, Congress appointed him to the command of the sloop of
war Ranger, eighteen guns, and on the same day the permanent flag of the United States was
determined upon. Jones, as usual, saw his spectacular opportunity and said: "That flag and
I are twins; born the same hour from the same womb of destiny. We cannot be parted in life
or in death. So long as we can float, we shall float together. If we must sink, we shall go
down as one!"

Jones, with the Ranger, sailed for France under the Stars and Stripes November 1, 1777, bearing
with him dispatches to the American commissioners, the news of Burgoyne's surrender, and instructions
from the Marine Committee to the commissioners to invest him with a fine swift-sailing frigate.
On his arrival at Nantes he immediately sent to the commissioners--Benjamin Franklin, Silas
Deane, and Arthur Lee--a letter developing his general scheme of annoying the enemy. "It seems
to be our most natural province," he wrote, "to surprise their defenseless places, and thereby
divert their attention and draw it from our own coasts."

It had been the intention of the commissioners to give Jones the Indien, a fine strong frigate
building secretly at Amsterdam. But this proved to be one more of Jones's many disappointments,
for the British minister to the Netherlands discovered the destination of the vessel and protested
to the States-General. The result was that the commissioners were forced to sell the ship to
France, to keep her out of the hands of England, and Jones was compelled to make his invasion
in the Ranger.

While proceeding in this little sloop to L'Orient, for the purpose of fitting her out, he met
the great French fleet and demanded and obtained the first salute ever given the United States
flag by the war vessels of a foreign power. As the secret treaty between France and the United
States was signed about that time, it perhaps needed less than the pertinacity of Paul Jones
to extract a salute from the imperial fleet. Shortly before sailing on his first famous cruise,
the restless man sent Silas Deane a letter proposing a plan of operations for the French fleet
in the coming war with England. The scheme was for the superior French fleet to attack the
English fleet under Lord Howe, and destroy it or block it up in the Delaware. Jones said in
his journal that the plan, which was adopted, would have succeeded if it had been put in immediate
execution, and complained because the credit of the scheme had been given to others.

This was only one of the bits of business which the energetic Jones transacted before he sailed
in the Ranger to harass England. He wrote, as usual, innumerable letters, proposing, condemning,
recommending. He had trouble with an insubordinate first lieutenant. He began, too, his social
career in France. It was then that he met the Duchesse de Chartres, great-granddaughter of
Louis XIV. and mother of Louis Philippe, who at a later time called Jones the Bayard of the
Sea, and whom Jones at that time promised "to lay an English frigate at her feet." He kept
his word in spirit, for years afterwards he gave her the sword of Captain Pearson, commander
of his famous prize, the Serapis.

III

THE CRUISE OF THE RANGER

Jones started on his cruise in the Ranger April 10, 1778, and, after taking several unimportant
prizes on the way to the Irish Channel, decided to make a descent upon the town that had served
him as headquarters when he was a merchant sailor, Whitehaven, where he knew there were about
two hundred and fifty merchant ships, which he hoped to destroy; "to put an end," as he said,
"by one good fire, in England, of shipping, to all the burnings in America."

Owing to contrary winds Jones was unable to make the attack until midnight of April 22. His
daring scheme was, with the small force of thirty-two men in two small boats, to land in a
hostile port, defended by two forts, surprise the sleeping inhabitants, and burn the ships
before the people could assemble against him. By the time the boats reached the outer pier,
day had dawned and no time was to be lost. Bobby is strong too but he isn't any bigger than I am,
and he is always nice to me. He has a long shaggy brown coat and a long pointed nose, and
a nice collar of white fur and people sometimes say to daddy what a nice collie that is and daddy
says yes isn't he and he takes to the boy so. I don't know what a collie is but I have fun with
Bobby all the time. Sometimes he lets me ride on his back and we talk to each other and have
secrets even though I don't think he is very smart. I don't know why mommy and daddy don't understand
me when I talk to them the way I talk to Bobby but maybe they just pretend they can't hear
me talk that way.

I am always sorry when daddy goes to work in the morning. Daddy is nice to me most times and takes
me and Bobby for walks.

But mommy never takes me for walks and when we are alone she is busy and she isn't nice to
me. Sometimes she says I am a bad boy and makes me stay in my room even when I haven't done
anything bad and sometimes she thinks things in her head that she doesn't say to me. I don't
know why mommy doesn't like me and Bobby doesn't know either, but we like it best when mommy
lets us go outdoors to play in the barn or down by the creek. If I get my feet wet mommy says
I am very bad so I stay on the bank and let Bobby go in, but one day when Bobby went into the water
just before we went home for supper mommy scolded me and told me I was bad for letting Bobby
go into the water and when I told her she hadn't told me not to let
Bobby go in she was angry and I could tell that she didn't like me
at all that day.

Almost every day I do something that mommy says is bad even when I try specially to be good. Sometimes
right after daddy goes away in the morning I know that mommy is angry and is going to spank
me sooner or later that day because she is already thinking how she will spank me, but she never says
so out loud. Sometimes she pretends that she's not angry and takes me up on her lap and says
I'm her nice little boy but all the time I can hear her thinking that she doesn't really like
me even when she tries and she doesn't even want to touch me if she can help it. I can hear her
wondering why my hair doesn't grow nice like the Bennet twins that live up the road. I don't
see how mommy can be saying one thing out loud and something else inside her head at the same
time but when I look at her she puts me down and says she's busy and will I get out from underfoot,
and then pretty soon I do something that makes her angry and she makes me go to my room or she
spanks me. Bobby doesn't like this. Once when she spanked me he growled at mommy, and mommy chased
him outdoors with a broom before she sent me to bed. I cried all day that day because it was cold
outdoors and I wanted to have Bobby with me.

I wonder why mommy doesn't like me?

* * * * *

One day I was a bad boy and let Bobby come into the house before mommy told me I could. Bobby hadn't
done anything bad but mommy hit him on the back with the broom and hurt him and chased him back
outdoors and then she told me I was a very bad boy.

I could tell that she was going to spank me and I knew she would hurt me because she was so
big, and I ran upstairs and hid in my room. Then mommy stamped her foot hard and said Jimmy you
come down here this minute. I didn't answer and then she said if I have to come upstairs and get
you I'll whip you until you can't sit down, and I still didn't answer
because mommy hurts me when she gets angry like that.

Then I heard her coming up the stairs and into my room and she opened the closet door and found
me. I said please don't hurt me mommy but she reached down and caught my ear and dragged me out of
the closet. I was so scared I bit her hand and she screamed and let go and I ran and locked
myself in the bathroom because I knew she would hurt me bad if I didn't. I stayed there all day long
and I could hear mommy running the sweeper downstairs and I couldn't see why she wanted to hurt me
so much just because I let Bobby come in before she told me I could. But somehow it seemed that
mommy was afraid of me even though she was so big and strong. I don't see why anybody as big
as mommy should be afraid of me but she was.

When daddy came home that night I heard him talking to mommy, and then he came up to the bathroom
and said open the door Jimmy I want to talk to you.

I said I want Bobby first so he went down and called Bobby and then
I opened the door and came out of the bathroom.

Daddy reached down and lifted me high up on his shoulder and took
me into my bedroom and just sat there for a long time patting Bobby's
head and I couldn't hear what he was thinking very well.

Finally he said out loud Jimmy you've got to be good to your mommy and do what she says and
not lock yourself up in rooms any more.

I said but mommy was going to hurt me and daddy said when you're a bad boy your mommy has to
punish you so you'll remember to be good, but she doesn't like to spank you. She only does it
because she loves you.

I knew that wasn't true because mommy likes to punish me but I didn't dare say that to daddy.
Daddy isn't afraid of me the way mommy is and he is nice to me most times, so I said all right
if you say so. Daddy said fine, will you promise to be nice to mommy
from now on?

I said yes if mommy won't hit Bobby any more with the broom. And daddy said well after all Bobby
can be a bad dog just the way you can be a bad boy, can't he? I knew Bobby was never a bad dog on
purpose but I said yes I guessed so. Then I wanted to ask daddy why mommy was afraid of me but
I didn't dare because I knew daddy liked mommy more than anybody and maybe he would be angry at
me for saying things like that about her.

That night I heard mommy and daddy talking down in the living room and I sat on the top step
so I could hear them. Bobby sat there too, but I knew he didn't know what they were saying because
Bobby isn't very smart and can't understand word-talk like I can. He can only understand think-talk,
and he doesn't understand that very well. But now even I couldn't understand what mommy was saying.
She was crying and saying Ben I tell you there's something wrong with the child, he knows what
I'm thinking, I can tell it by the way he looks at me. And daddy said darling, that's ridiculous,
how could he possibly know what you're thinking? Mommy said I don't know but he does! Ever since
he was a little boy he's known--oh, Ben, it's horrible, I can't do anything with him because he
knows what I'm going to do before I do it. Then daddy said Carol,
you're upset about today and you're making things up.

The child is just a little smarter than most kids, there's nothing wrong with that. And mommy said
no, there's more to it than that and I can't stand it any longer. We've got to take him to a
doctor, I don't even like to look at him. Daddy said you're tired, you're just letting little
things get on your nerves. So maybe the boy does look a little strange, you know the doctor
said it was just that the fontanelles hadn't closed as soon as they should have and lots of
children don't have a good growth of hair before they're six or seven. After all he said he isn't
a bad looking boy.

Then mommy said that isn't true, he's horrible! I can't bear it, Ben, please do something, and daddy
said what can I do? I talked to the boy and he was sorry and promised he'd behave himself. And
mommy said then there's that dog--it follows him around wherever he goes, and he's simply wicked
if the dog isn't around, and daddy said isn't it perfectly normal for a boy to love his dog?
Mommy said no, not like this, talking to him all the time, and the dog acting exactly as if
he understands--there's something wrong with the child, something horribly wrong.

Then daddy was quiet for a while, and then he said all right, if it will make you feel any
better we can have Doctor Grant take another look at him. Maybe he can convince you that there's
nothing wrong with the boy, and mommy said please, Ben, anything,
I can't stand much more of this.

When I went back to bed and Bobby curled up on the floor, I asked him what were fontanelles,
and Bobby just yawned and said he didn't know but he thought I was nice, and he would always
take care of me, so I didn't worry any more and went to sleep.

I have a panda out in the barn and the panda's name is Bobby too and at first Bobby the dog
was jealous of Bobby the panda until I told him that the panda was only a make-believe Bobby
and he was a real Bobby. Then Bobby liked the panda, and the three of us played out in the
barn all day. We decided not to tell mommy and daddy about the panda, and kept it for our own secret.
It was a big panda, as big as mommy and daddy, and sometimes I thought maybe I would make the panda
hurt mommy but then I knew daddy would be sorry so I didn't.

Bobby and I were playing with Bobby the panda the day the doctor came and mommy called me in and made
Bobby stay outside. I didn't like the doctor because he smelled like a dirty old cigar and
he had a big red nose with three black hairs coming out of it and he wheezed when he bent down
to look at me.

Daddy and mommy sat on the couch and the doctor said let me have a look at you young fellow and I
said but I'm not sick and the doctor said ha ha, of course you aren't, you're a fine looking
boy but just let me listen to your chest for a minute. So he put a cold thing on my chest and
stuck some tubes in his ears and listened, and then he looked in my eyes with a bright light
and looked into my ears, and then he felt my head all over. He had big hairy hands and I didn't
like him touching me but I knew mommy would be angry if I didn't hold still so I let him finish.
Then he told daddy some big words that I couldn't understand, but
in think-talk he was saying that my head still hadn't closed up right
and I didn't have as much hair as you'd expect but otherwise I seemed
to be all right.

He said I was a good stout looking boy but if they wanted a specialist in to look at me he
would arrange it. Daddy asked if that would cost very much and the doctor said yes it probably
would and he didn't see any real need for it because my bones were just a little slow in developing,
and mommy said have you seen other children like that? The doctor said no but if the boy seems
to be normal and intelligent why should she be worrying so? Then mommy told me to go upstairs, and I
went but I stopped on the top stair and listened.

When I was gone the doctor said now Carol what is it that's really bothering you? Then mommy
told him what she had told daddy, how she thought I knew what she
was thinking, and the doctor said to daddy, Ben, have you ever felt
any such thing about the boy?

Daddy said of course not, sometimes he gives you the feeling that he's smarter than you think
he is but all parents have that feeling about their children sometimes. And then mother broke
down and her voice got loud and she said he's a monster, I know it,
there's something wrong and he's different from us, him and that horrible
dog.

The doctor said but it's a beautiful collie, and mommy said but he talks to it and it understands
him, and the doctor said now, Carol, let's be reasonable. Mommy said I've been reasonable too long,
you men just can't see it at all, don't you think I'd know a normal child if I saw one? And then she
cried and cried, and finally she said all right, I know I'm making
a fool of myself, maybe I'm just overtired, and the doctor said I'm
sure that's the trouble, try to get some rest, and sleep longer at
night, and mommy said I can't sleep at night, I just lie there and
think.

The doctor said well we'll fix that, enough of this nonsense now, you need your sleep and if
you're not sleeping well it's you that should be seeing the doctor. He gave her some pills from
his bag and then he went away, and pretty soon daddy let Bobby in,
and Bobby came upstairs and jumped up and licked my face as if he'd
been away for a hundred million years.

Later mommy called me down for supper, and she wasn't crying any
more, and she and daddy didn't say anything about what they had said
to the doctor.

Mommy made me a special surprise for dessert, some ice cream with
chocolate syrup on top, and after supper we all went for a walk, even
though it was cold outside and snowing again.

Then daddy said well, I think things will be all right, and mommy said I hope so, but I could
tell that she didn't really think so, and she was more afraid of me than ever.

* * * * *

For a while I thought mommy was really going to be nice to me and Bobby then. She was especially
nice when daddy was home but when daddy was away at work sometimes mommy jumped when she saw
me looking at her and then sent me outdoors to play and told me not to come in until lunch. I liked
that because I knew if I weren't near mommy everything would be all right. When I was with mommy
I tried hard not to look at her and I tried not to hear what she
was thinking, but lots of times I would see her looking first at me
and then at Bobby, and those times I couldn't help hearing what she
was thinking because it seemed so loud inside my head that it made
my eyes hurt.

But I knew mommy would be angry so I pretended I couldn't hear what she was thinking at all.

One
day when we were out in the barn playing with Bobby the panda we saw mommy coming down through the
snow from the kitchen and Bobby said look out Jimmy mommy is coming and I quick told Bobby the
panda to go hide under the hay so mommy couldn't see him. But the panda was so big his whole
top and his little pink nose stuck out of the hay. Mommy came in and looked around the barn
and said you've been out here for a long time, what have you been doing? I said nothing, and
Bobby said nothing too, only in think-talk. And mommy said you are too, you've been doing
something naughty, and I said no mommy we haven't done anything, and then the panda sneezed
and I looked at him and he looked so funny with his nose sticking
out of the hay that I laughed out loud.

Mommy looked angry and said well what's so funny, what are you laughing at? I said nothing,
because I knew mommy couldn't see the panda, but I couldn't stop
laughing because he looked so funny sticking out of the hay.

Then mommy got mad and grabbed my ear and shook me until it hurt and said you naughty boy, don't you
lie to me, what have you been doing out here? She hurt me so much I started to cry and then
Bobby snarled at mommy loud and low and curled his lips back over his teeth and snarled some
more.

And mommy got real white in the face and let go of me and she said get out of here you nasty
dog and Bobby snarled louder and then snapped at her. She screamed and she said Jimmy you come
in the house this minute and leave that nasty dog outdoors and I said I won't come, I hate
you.

Then mommy said Jimmy! You wicked, ugly little monster, and I said I don't care, when I get
big I'm going to hurt you and throw you in the wood shed and lock you in until you die and
make you eat coconut pudding and Bobby hates you too. And mommy looked terrible and I could
feel how much she was afraid of me and I said you just wait, I'll hurt you bad when I get big,
and then she turned and ran back to the house.

And Bobby wagged his tail and said don't worry, I won't let her hurt you any more and I said
Bobby you shouldn't have snapped at her because daddy won't like me when he comes home but Bobby
said I like you and I won't let anything ever hurt you. I'll always take care of you no matter
what. And I said promise? No matter what? And Bobby said I promise. And then we told Bobby the panda to
come out but it wasn't much fun playing any more.

After a little while mommy called me and said lunch was ready. She was still white and I said
can Bobby come too and she said of course Bobby can come, Bobby's a nice dog, so we went in
to eat lunch. Mommy was talking real fast about what fun it was to play in the barn and was I sure
I wasn't too cold because it was below zero outside and the radio said a snowstorm was coming,
but she didn't say anything about Bobby and me being out in the barn. She was talking so fast I couldn't
hear what she was thinking except for little bits while she set my lunch on the table and
then she set a bowl of food on the floor for Bobby even though it
wasn't Bobby's time to eat and said nice Bobby here's your dinner.

Bobby came over and sniffed the bowl and then he looked up at me and said it smells funny and
mommy said nice Bobby, it's good hamburger just the way you like it--

And then for just a second I saw what she was thinking and it was terrible because she was
thinking that Bobby would soon be dead, and I remembered daddy saying a long time ago that
somebody fed bad things to the Bennet's dog and the dog died and I said don't eat it, Bobby, and
Bobby snarled at the dish. And then mommy said you tell the dog to eat it and I said no you're bad and
you want to hurt Bobby, and then I picked up the dish and threw it
at mommy.

It missed and smashed on the wall and she screamed and turned and ran out into the other room.
She was screaming for daddy and saying I can't stand it, he's a monster, a murderous little
monster and we've got to get out of here before he kills us all, he knows what we're thinking,
he's horrible, and then she was on the telephone, and she couldn't make the words come out right
when she tried to talk.

I was scared and I said come on Bobby let's lock ourselves up in my room and we ran upstairs
and locked the door. Mommy was banging things and laughing and crying downstairs and screaming
we've got to get out, he'll kill us if we don't, and a while later I heard the car coming up
the road fast, and saw daddy run into the house just as it started to snow. Then mommy was
screaming please, Ben, we've got to get out of here, he tried to
kill me, and the dog is vicious, he bit me when I tried to make him
stop.

The next minute daddy was running up the stairs two at a time and I could feel him inside my
head for the first time and I knew he was angry. He'd never been this angry before and he rattled
the knob and said open this door Jimmy in a loud voice. I said no I won't and he said open the
door or I'll break your neck when I get in there and then he kicked the door and kicked it again.
The third time the lock broke and the door flew open and daddy stood there panting. His eyes looked
terrible and he had a leather belt doubled up in his hand and he said now come out here and
his voice was so loud it hurt my ears.

Down below mommy was crying please Ben, take me away, he'll kill us both, he's a monster! I
said don't hurt me daddy it was mommy, she was bad to me, and he
said I said come out here even louder.

I was scared then and I said please daddy I'll be good I promise. Then he started for me with
the belt and I screamed out Bobby! Don't let him hurt me, Bobby, and Bobby snarled like a wild
animal and jumped at daddy and bit his wrist so bad the blood spurted out. Daddy shouted and
dropped the belt and kicked at Bobby but Bobby was too quick. He jumped for daddy again and I saw
his white teeth flash and heard him snap close to daddy's throat and then Bobby was snarling
and snapping and I was excited and I shouted hurt him, Bobby, he's been bad to me too and he wants
to hurt me and you've got to stop him.

Then I saw daddy's eyes open wide, and felt something jump in his mind, something that I'd never
felt there before and I knew he was understanding my think-talk.

I said I want Bobby to hurt you and mommy because you're not nice to me, only Bobby and my
panda are nice to me. Go ahead, Bobby, hurt him, bite him again and make him bleed. And then
daddy caught Bobby by the neck and threw him across the room and slammed the door shut and dragged
something heavy up to block it. In a minute he was running downstairs shouting Carol, I heard it! you
were right all along--I felt him, I felt what he was thinking!

And mommy cried please, Ben, take me away, let's leave them and never come back, never, and
daddy said it's horrible, he told that dog to kill me and it went right for my throat, the
boy is evil and monstrous. Even from downstairs I could feel daddy's fear pounding into my
head and then I heard the door banging and looked out the window
and saw daddy carrying suitcases out through the snow to the car and
then mommy came out running and the car started down the hill and
they were gone. Everything downstairs was very quiet. I looked out
the window and I couldn't see anything but the big falling snowflakes
and the sun going down over the hill.

Now Bobby and I and the panda
are all together and I'm glad mommy and daddy are gone. I went to
sleep for a little while because my head hurt so but now I'm awake
and Bobby is lying across the room licking his feet and I hope mommy
and daddy never come back because Bobby will take care of me. Bobby
is my friend and he said he'd always take care of me no matter what
and he understands my think-talk even if he isn't very smart.

It's
beginning to get cold in the house now because nobody has gone down
to fix the fire but I don't care about that. Pretty soon I will tell
Bobby to push open the door and go down and fix the fire and then
I will tell him to get supper for me and then I will stay up all night
because mommy and daddy aren't here to make me go to bed. There's
just me and Bobby and the panda, and Bobby promised he'd take care
of me because he's my friend.

It's getting very cold now, and I'm
getting hungry.

On the 23d of September the squadron was chasing a ship off Flamborough Head, when the Baltic
fleet of merchantmen, for which Jones had been looking, hove in sight. The commodore hoisted
the signal for a general chase. Landais, however, ignored the signal and went off by himself.
The merchant ships, when they saw Jones's squadron bearing down upon them, made for the shore
and escaped, protected by two ships of war, frigates, which stood out and made preparations
to fight, in order to save their convoy.

These British ships of war were the Serapis, a new frigate of forty-four guns, and the Countess
of Scarborough, twenty guns. The Alliance, at that time, which was late in the afternoon, was
not in sight, and the little Vengeance, which had been sent to look for Landais, was also not
available. There were, therefore, two ships on each side, and Jones ordered Captain Cottineau,
of the Pallas, to look after the Countess of Scarborough, while he himself took care of the
Serapis. Jones never lost his head in action, and yet he decided, with that "cool, determined
bravery," of which Benjamin Franklin spoke, and with "that presence of mind which never deserted
him" in action, recorded by Fanning, to engage a ship known by him to be the superior of the
Bonhomme Richard in almost every respect. It has been said of Jones by one who fought with
him that only in battle was he absolutely at ease: only at times of comparative inaction, when
he could not exert himself fully, was he restless and irritable. On this occasion he joyfully
engaged a ship which threw a weight of metal superior to his by three to two, that sailed much
faster, and was consequently at an advantage in manoeuvring for position, and that had a crew
equal to that of Jones in numbers, and far more disciplined and homogeneous. A battle resulted
which for desperate fighting has never been excelled, and perhaps never equaled on the sea.

V

THE FIGHT WITH THE SERAPIS

Jones crowded on all possible sail, and the Bonhomme Richard came within pistol shot of the
Serapis. It was seven o'clock of a fine moonlight night. Captain Pearson, of the British ship,
then hailed, and was answered with a whole broadside from the Bonhomme Richard, an unfriendly
salute which was promptly returned by the British ship.

From the beginning the fight seemed to go against the Bonhomme Richard. There was hardly any
stage of the three and a half hours' desperate combat when Jones might not, with perfect propriety,
have surrendered. Hardly had the battle begun when two of the six old eighteen-pounders forming
the battery of the lower gun-deck of the Richard exploded, killing the men working them and
rendering the whole battery useless for the rest of the action. Captain Pearson, perceiving
his advantage in speed and power of shot, attempted again and again to pass the bow of the
Richard and rake her. Jones's whole effort, on the other hand, was to close with the Serapis
and board, knowing that it was only a question of time when, in a broadside fight, the Richard
would be sunk.

After the broadsiding had continued with unremitting fury for about three quarters of an hour,
and several of the Richard's twelve-pounders also had been put out of action, Captain Pearson
thought he saw an opportunity, the Serapis having veered and drawn ahead of the Richard, to
luff athwart the latter's hawse and rake her. But he attempted the manoeuvre too soon, and
perceiving that the two ships would be brought together if he persisted in his course, he put
his helm alee, bringing the two vessels in a line; and the Serapis having lost her headway
by this evolution, the Richard ran into her weather quarter. Jones was quick to make his first
attempt to board, but he could not mass enough men at the point of contact to succeed, and
the ships soon swung apart.

The Richard, even at this early stage of the action, was in a deplorable condition. Little
of her starboard battery was left. Henry Gardner, a gunner during the action, stated in his
account of the battle that, at this time, of the 140 odd officers and men stationed in the
main gun-deck battery at the beginning, over eighty were killed or wounded. There were three
or four feet of water in the hold, caused by the Serapis's eighteen-pound shot, which had repeatedly
pierced the hull of the Richard.

It is no wonder that Captain Pearson, knowing that his enemy was hard put to it, thought, after
the failure to board, that Jones was ready to surrender.

"Has your ship struck?" he called, and Jones made his famous reply:--

"I have not yet begun to fight."

That Jones really made some such reply, there is no doubt. Certainly, it was characteristic
enough. Jones fought all his life, and yet when he died he had hardly begun the conflict, so
many of his ambitious projects remained unrealized.

When the ships had swung apart, the broadsiding continued, increasingly to the advantage of
the Serapis. Had not a lucky wind, favorable to the Richard, arisen at this point, doubtless
her time above water would have been short. The veering and freshening breeze enabled the Richard
to blanket the enemy's vessel, which consequently lost her headway, and another fortunate puff
of wind brought the Richard in contact with the Serapis in such a way that the two vessels
lay alongside one another, bow to stern, and stern to bow. Jones, with his own hand, helped
to lash the two ships together. The anchor of the Serapis fortunately hooked the quarter of
the Richard, thus binding the frigates still more firmly together.

During the critical time when Jones was bending every nerve to grapple with the Serapis, the
Alliance made her first appearance, poured a broadside or two into the Richard, and disappeared.
It is probable that the Serapis also suffered from Landais's attack, but not so much as the
Richard, which lay between the other two ships.

After the Serapis and the Richard had been well lashed together, there began a new phase of
the battle, which had already lasted about an hour. There were only three guns left in action
on the Richard, nine-pounders on the quarter-deck, and the ship was badly leaking. The eighteen-pounders
of the enemy had riddled the gun-deck of the American ship, rendering her, below-decks, entirely
untenable. The real fight from this time to the end was consequently above-decks. Jones abandoned
any attempt at great gun fire, except by the three small pieces on the quarter-deck, drew practically
his entire remaining crew from below to the upper deck and the tops, and devoted his attention
to sweeping the decks of the enemy by the musketry of his French marines from the quarter and
poop decks, and of the American sailors in the tops. The crew of the Serapis, on the other
hand, were forced mainly to take refuge in their well-protected lower decks, from which they
continued to fire their great guns into the already riddled hull and lower decks of the Richard.

After the juncture of the vessels Captain Pearson made several desperate attempts to cut the
anchor loose, hoping in that way to become free again of the Richard, in which case he knew
that the battle was his. Jones, of course, was equally determined to defend the anchor fastenings.
He personally directed the fire of his French marines against the British in their repeated
attempts to sever the two ships, to such good purpose that not a single British sailor reached
the coveted goal. So determined was Jones on this important point that he took loaded muskets
from the hands of his French marines and shot down several of the British with his own hand.

The captain of the French marines, who rendered at this important stage of the action such
good service, had been wounded early in the battle, and the succeeding lieutenants had also
been either killed or disabled. The marines had been greatly diminished in numbers and were
much disheartened at the time Jones took personal command of them. Nathaniel Fanning vividly
narrates the manner in which Jones handled these Frenchmen: "I could distinctly hear, amid
the crashing of the musketry, the great voice of the commodore, cheering the French marines
in their own tongue, uttering such imprecations upon the enemy as I never before or since heard
in French or any other language, exhorting them to take good aim, pointing out objects for
their fire, and frequently giving them direct example by taking their loaded muskets from their
hands into his and firing himself. In fact, toward the very last, he had about him a group
of half a dozen marines who did nothing but load their firelocks and hand them to the commodore,
who fired them from his own shoulder, standing on the quarter-deck rail by the main topmast
backstay."

A French sailor, Pierre Gerard, who has left a memoir of the battle, tells how his countrymen
responded to Jones's presence: "Commodore Jones sprang among the shaking marines on the quarter-deck
like a tiger among calves. They responded instantly to him. In an instant they were filled
with courage! The indomitable spirit, the unconquerable courage of the commodore penetrated
every soul, and every one who saw his example or heard his voice became as much a hero as himself!"

Both vessels were at this time, and later, on fire in various places. Captain Pearson says
in his official report that the Serapis was on fire no less than ten or twelve times. Half
the men on both ships had been killed or disabled. The leak in the Richard's hold grew steadily
worse, and the mainmast of the Serapis was about to go by the board. The Alliance again appeared
and, paying no heed to Jones's signal to lay the Serapis alongside, raked both vessels for
a few minutes indiscriminately, went serenely on her way, and brought her inglorious and inexplicable
part in the action to a close. Captain Pearson had, for a moment, towards the end of the action,
a ray of hope. A gunner on the Richard, thinking the ship was actually sinking, called for
quarter, but Jones stunned him with the butt end of a pistol, and replied to Pearson, who had
again hailed to know if the Richard had struck, to quote his own report, "in the most determined
negative." About the same time, the master at arms, also believing the ship to be sinking,
opened the hatches and released nearly two hundred British prisoners, taken in the various
prizes of the cruise.

Nothing, apparently, could be more desperate than the situation of Paul Jones then. His guns
useless, his ship sinking and on fire, half of his crew dead or disabled, the Alliance firing
into him, a portion of his crew panic-stricken, and two hundred British prisoners at large
on the ship! But with Lieutenant Richard Dale to help him, he boldly ordered the prisoners
to man the pumps, and continued the fight with undiminished energy. Soon after occurred the
event which practically decided the battle in his favor. He had given orders to drop hand grenades
from the tops of the Richard down through the enemy's main hatch. It was by this means that
the Serapis had been so often set on fire. Now at an opportune moment, a hand grenade fell
among a pile of cartridges strung out on the deck of the Serapis and caused a terrible explosion,
killing many men. This seemed to reduce materially the fighting appetite of the British, and
soon after a party of seamen from the Richard, with the dashing John Mayrant at their head,
boarded the Serapis, and met with little resistance. Captain Pearson thereupon struck his colors,
and the victory which marked the zenith of Jones's career, and upon which all else in his life
merely served as commentary, was scored. Captain Pearson, in his court-martial, which was a
formality in the British navy in case of defeat, explained Jones's victory in a nutshell: "It
was clearly apparent," he said, "that the American ship was dominated by a commanding will
of the most unalterable resolution," and again, "the extraordinary and unheard-of desperate
stubbornness of my adversary had so depressed the spirits of my people that, when more than
two hundred had been slain or disabled out of 317 all told, I could not urge the remnant to
further resistance."

The capture of the British ship, which took place about half-past ten at night, came none too
soon, for the old Bonhomme Richard was sinking. The flames were extinguished by combined efforts
of crew and prisoners by ten o'clock the next morning, but with seven feet of water, constantly
increasing in the hold, it was then apparent that it was impossible to keep the old vessel
afloat, and men, prisoners, and powder were transferred to the Serapis. On the morning of the
25th Jones obtained, "with inexpressible grief," as he said, "the last glimpse of the Bonhomme
Richard," as she went down.

The desperate battle fought in the bright moonlight was witnessed by many persons in Scarborough
and on Flamborough Head, and they spread the alarming tidings throughout England. In a letter
to Robert Morris, written soon after, Jones said, of the cruise in general: "We alarmed their
coasts prodigiously from Cape Clear round to Hull; and had I not been concerned with sons of
interest I could have done much."

With his two new prizes (for the Countess of Scarborough had after a short action struck to
the greatly superior Pallas) Jones set off for the Texel, with a most dilapidated crew and
fleet. The Alliance, well called a "Comet" by the editor of the Janette-Taylor collection of
Jones's papers, disappeared again after the battle. Landais, whose conduct was described by
Jones as being that of "either a fool, a madman, or a villain," was afterwards dismissed the
service, but not until he had cut up other extraordinary pranks. He now went off with his swift
and uninjured frigate to the Texel, leaving Jones, laden down with prisoners and wounded, unassisted.
Of the Richard's crew of 323, 67 men had been killed, leaving 106 wounded and 150 others to
be accommodated on the injured Serapis. Then there were 211 English prisoners on the Richard
at the beginning of the action; and of the 332 (including 8 sick men and 7 non-combatants)
men composing the crew of the Serapis, there were 245 left to be cared for--134 wounded, 87
having been killed. There were, consequently, only 150 well men to look after 562 wounded and
prisoners. Some of the latter were afterwards transferred to the Pallas, but altogether it
was an unwieldy fleet which slowly sailed for the Texel, at which neutral port Jones arrived
October 3, none too soon, for as he entered the roads, an English squadron, consisting of a
sixty-four ship of the line and three heavy frigates, which had been looking for him, hove
in sight.

The effect of the cruise was very great. The English people, alarmed and incensed, never forgot
it. Never before had one of their ships of war been conquered by a vessel of greatly inferior
force. Their coasts, deemed impregnable, were again invaded by the man whom they called, in
the blindness of their rage, pirate and renegade. Professor Houghton, a serious-minded historian,
writing of Jones said: "His moral character can be summed up in one word--detestable." English
comment on Paul Jones may be summed up truthfully in one word,--envenomed. Jones's exploits,
moreover, greatly increased the prestige of young America, and made of himself a still greater
hero at home and particularly in France. For the rest of his life, indeed, Jones, in France
especially, where spectacles are peculiarly appreciated, was the man on horseback, and he enjoyed
the position intensely. Fanning narrates how Jones, while at Amsterdam, soon after his arrival
in the Texel, "was treated as a conqueror. This so elated him with pride, that he had the vanity
to go into the State House, mount the balcony or piazza, and show himself in the front thereof,
to the populace and people of distinction then walking on the public parade."

VI

DIPLOMACY AT THE TEXEL

Jones found himself in a position at the Texel which demanded all the shrewdness as well as
the determination of his character. Impatient, irritable, and passionate as he often was, his
judgment was nevertheless excellent. Benjamin Franklin, when Jones at a later time was again
put in a delicate situation, wrote him:--

"You have shown your abilities in fighting; you have now an opportunity of showing the other
necessary part in the character of a great chief,--your abilities in policy."

Jones's ability in policy appeared in a more favorable light in the Texel than at any other
period of his career, although too great weight has been laid upon the degree of it. The important
problem to be solved was how to induce the Dutch authorities to allow him and his battered
ships to remain for a time in the shelter of their port. Jones knew that the attainment of
this object would help to bring about a rupture between England and Holland. The latter country
was secretly in sympathy with the revolted colonies, but eager at that time to maintain officially
friendly relations with England. Consequently, when Jones arrived with his prizes, the Dutch
authorities were in a quandary, much aggravated by the action of the British minister in Holland,
Sir Joseph Yorke, who demanded that the "pirate's" prizes be delivered up to England. He reiterated
his demand to the States-General in the following language: "I only discharge the orders of
his Majesty in renewing the most strong and urgent demand for the seizure and restitution of
said vessels as well as for the enlargement of their crews, who have been seized by the pirate,
Paul Jones, a Scotchman, a rebellious subject, and state criminal."

Jones, in reply to the allegations of the British minister, copies of whose letters had been
sent him, wrote the States-General an able letter. He inclosed a copy of his commission from
the United States government, and then argued that the United States was a "sovereign power"
and entitled to issue such a commission. He pointed out that the sovereignty had been recognized
by France and Spain, and that belligerent rights had been recognized by Prussia and by Russia.
Only one of Sir Joseph's charges he admitted to be true,--that he was a Scotchman, but he denied
the inference made from it,--that he was a "state criminal." He wrote: "It cannot have escaped
the attention of Your High Mightinesses that every man now giving fealty to the cause of American
Independence was born a British subject." If he were a "state criminal," then, he argued, General
Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and all other American patriots were also "state criminals."

Soon after this letter was received the States-General passed a resolution declining to "consider
any question affecting the validity of Paul Jones's commission or his status as a person."
They declined likewise "to do anything from which it might lawfully be inferred that they recognized
the independence of the American colonies." They also resolved that Paul Jones should be asked
to leave their port, but not until the wind and weather should be favorable. They had refused,
therefore, to consider Jones as a pirate, or to deliver up his prizes.

Paul Jones's plan was not to admit that a favorable wind had arisen until the last possible
moment. He did not wish to be taken by the strong British fleet waiting for him outside the
harbor, and he desired, as he said, in order to provoke war between Holland and England, "to
try the patience of the English party to the last bit of strain it would bear by keeping my
anchorage in Dutch waters on plea of distress, and at the same time I wished to be ready for
instant departure the moment I saw that the plea of distress could no longer be plausibly held."

The French Minister of Marine, de Sartine, however, fearing that ultimately the pressure would
be so great that the squadron would be compelled to depart and thus fall into the clutches
of the British, demanded that the French flag, which naturally commanded greater respect from
Holland than the flag of the United States, should be displayed. Benjamin Franklin agreed with
the French minister, but Jones protested:--

"In vain I expostulated with them that by accepting the shelter of the French flag I should
do exactly of all things what Sir Joseph Yorke wished me to do, namely, withdraw all pretensions
of the United States as a party to the situation, and thereby confess that the United States
claimed no status as a sovereign power in a neutral port."

Jones was forced to yield, the French flag was displayed, the command was given to the French
captain, Cottineau, and Jones retained only the Alliance, an American ship, from which he was
allowed, however, to fly the American flag.

To add to Jones' sorrows de Sartine offered him, through the Duc de Vauguyan, a French commission
to command the Alliance as a letter of marque. He rejected it with indignation: "My rank from
the beginning knew no superior in the marine of America; how then must I be humbled were I
to accept a letter of marque! I should, my lord, esteem myself inexcusable were I to accept
even a commission of equal or superior denomination to that I bear, unless I were previously
authorized by Congress, or some other competent authority in Europe." That the Serapis, the
prize for which he had so bravely contended, had been taken from him, was another of the wrongs
which rankled deeply in Jones's soul.

Jones must have got a great deal of satisfaction, however, from the fact that he continued
defiantly to wave the American flag from the Alliance, and that he delayed his enforced departure,
in spite of great pressure from the admiral of the Dutch fleet, until December 26, when with
the Alliance he dashed out of the harbor "under his best American colors," ran the gauntlet
of the British fleet cruising outside, and escaped into the open sea.

Before leaving the Texel, Jones, on December 17, 1779, wrote Dr. Bancroft: "I am sure that
the strain put upon the relations between Holland and England must end in rupture between them
within this year."

War was indeed declared between England and Holland on December 19, 1780, and in the bill of
grievances set forth in the proclamation of a state of war against Holland, the statement is
made: "That, in violation of treaty, they [the States-General] suffered an American Pirate
(one Paul Jones, a Rebel, and State Criminal) to remain several weeks in one of their ports."

It is clear, therefore, that Jones's pertinacious stay in the Dutch port brought about important
results.

Another instance of Jones's sang-froid in matters where time was given for his judgment to
come into play, was the way he treated Landais at the Texel. On his arrival at that port Jones
sent to Dr. Franklin charges against the captain of the Alliance, whom he removed from command.
Whereupon Landais sent Jones a challenge to a duel. Fanning narrates: "But the latter [Jones],
perhaps not thinking it prudent to expose himself with a single combatant, who was a complete
master of the smallsword, declined." In the second edition of his memoir Fanning said that
Jones accepted Landais's challenge, but insisted on substituting pistols, with which he was
an expert, for swords, a proposition which Landais refused.

Although again on the sea and free from the irritations of the Texel, Jones, when he had eluded
the British fleet, found plenty of other things to annoy him. He had fortunately transferred
many of his trustworthy men from the Serapis to the Alliance, but there were enough of the
latter ship's old officers and men to divide the crew into two hostile camps. The discontent
at the delay over payment of wages and prize money had deepened. Although the crew was large,
fierce in temper, and at first very anxious to look for further prizes, they yet, after the
cruise had continued for some time without success, refused to continue unless they were paid.
Jones, in order to induce them to embark from Corunna, Spain, where the Alliance had put in
for repairs and provisions, promised that he would sail immediately for L'Orient, where they
should receive their prize money. As soon as he was again at sea, however, Jones informed his
officers that he intended to make a further cruise of twenty days. Fanning, one of the officers,
quotes Jones:--

"'And,' says he, with a kind of contemptuous smile, which he was much addicted to, 'Gentlemen,
you cannot conceive what an additional honor it would be to all of us, if in cruising a few
days we should have the good luck to fall in with an English frigate of our force and carry
her in with us.... This would crown our former victories, and our names, in consequence thereof,
would be handed down to latest posterity by some faithful historian of our country.'" Fanning
adds in a footnote: "Jones had a wonderful notion of his name being handed down to posterity."

When the officers remonstrated on the ground that the men were badly clothed, Jones flew into
a rage and ordered them to go to their duty. He found, however, that he could not, with a mutinous
crew, continue his course effectively, and reluctantly sailed for L'Orient, where he arrived
on February 10, 1780.

VII

SOCIETY IN PARIS

The following year, passed mainly in France, at Paris or L'Orient, was spent by Jones in trying
to collect prize money, secure an important command, and in society, where he shone more resplendently
than ever. He wrote rather more than his usual large number of letters,--to Franklin, Robert
Morris, the Duchesse de Chartres, Arthur Lee, Dr. Bancroft, and many others,--in practically
all of them urging some one of his warmly desired projects.

His correspondence with Benjamin Franklin was largely about prize money and the expense of
repairing the Alliance, which he undertook to do immediately on his arrival at L'Orient. The
frugal doctor attempted to curb, in the matter of expense, the free-handed Jones. The latter
had an enormous respect for Franklin, and it is quite likely that he attempted to be economical,
but he seems to have been less successful in that direction than in any other. Fanning speaks
of the "great and unnecessary expense" involved in Jones's elaborate alterations, and narrates
how, at a later period, when Jones was in command of the Ariel, anchored in the harbor at L'Orient,
a magnificent spectacle was given on board for the entertainment of the ladies and gentlemen
invited by Jones. A mock fight between the Bonhomme Richard and the Serapis, in which vast
quantities of ammunition were destroyed, took place. The vessel was finely carpeted and decorated,
a regal banquet was served, military music played, and in general "neither cash nor pains,"
says Fanning, "were spared in order that the scene every way should appear magnificent." Although
the hero never seemed to take account of the extreme poverty of the infant republic, it is
only fair to add that he spent his own money as freely as any one else's, and that he often
served without pay, a fact continually attested to by himself in his letters and journals.

Jones's lack of success, in spite of his energetic attempts in collecting at this time the
prize money, about which there were many annoying technicalities, increased the discontent
of his crew, and prepared the way for the seizure of the Alliance by the mad Landais. Arthur
Lee, formerly one of the American commissioners in Europe, had always been hostile to Jones
and unsympathetic with Dr. Franklin and with the revolutionary party generally; to such a degree,
indeed, that he was accused, not unjustly, of treachery to the cause of American independence.
At the time that the Alliance was at L'Orient, Lee was waiting an opportunity to return to
America. Captain Landais, who had been deprived of the command of the Alliance by order of
Benjamin Franklin, then the sole representative of the United States in France, and who had
likewise been ordered by the doctor to report to the Marine Committee on the charge of infamous
conduct, planned to take the Alliance from Jones, and was supported in the attempt by Lee,
who contended that neither Franklin nor Jones could deprive Landais of a command given him
by Congress. Lee's desire to take the ship from Jones was augmented by the latter's refusal
to make room for the ex-commissioner's many effects, including two fine coaches,--space which
was much needed for the accommodation of supplies for Washington's army.

Lee and Landais consequently encouraged the discontent among the crew of the Alliance, and
one day, June 13, when Jones was on shore at L'Orient, Landais went on board the ship, and,
supported by his old officers and by Lee, took possession. When Jones heard of it he was very
angry, and acted, according to Fanning, "more like a madman than a conqueror;" but, as usual,
his anger was quickly controlled and the definite steps he took in the affair were marked by
great moderation. The commandant of the defenses at L'Orient had received orders from the French
government to fire on the Alliance, if Landais should attempt to take her out of the harbor;
and it seems he would have obeyed and probably sunk the ship, had not Jones himself interfered,
and induced him to stay his hand. In a letter to Franklin, Jones said:--

"Your humanity will, I know, justify the part I acted in preventing a scene that would have
made me miserable the rest of my life."

Jones was probably not over sorry to lose the Alliance. There was nothing very thrilling in
the prospect of carrying supplies to America, and Jones at that time hoped fervently to get
hold of the Serapis and other ships and make another warlike cruise against the coast of England.
So Landais sailed away with the Alliance, but to his own ruin, as the clear-sighted Jones had
predicted in a remarkable letter written a short time before the ship sailed to a mutinous
officer on the Alliance. On the voyage Landais's eccentricity caused his friend Lee to put
him under arrest, and on the arrival in America, a court of inquiry found him unfit for command,
and he never again burdened the service.

Jones was left at L'Orient with the little Ariel, armed with eighteen twelve-pounders and four
six-pounders, a ship loaned by the king to Dr. Franklin, and with high hopes, as usual, of
more glorious opportunities. But many months intervened before he sailed again,--a time he
devoted to business and society. As Jones and his interesting midshipman Fanning separated
at the end of this period, the latter's final impressions of his captain may here be given:--

"Captain Jones was a man of about five feet six inches high, well shaped below his head and
shoulders, rather round shouldered, with a visage fierce and warlike, and wore the appearance
of great application to study, which he was fond of. He was an excellent seaman and knew naval
tactics as well as almost any man of his age; but it must be allowed that his character was
somewhat tinctured with bad qualities ... his courage and bravery as a naval commander cannot
be doubted. His smoothness of tongue and flattery to seamen when he wanted them was persuasive,
and in which he excelled any other man I was ever acquainted with.... His pride and vanity
while at Paris and Amsterdam was not generally approved of."

Fanning has many anecdotes to relate in regard to Jones's affairs of gallantry of an humble
character. Several of Jones's biographers have dwelt upon the gorgeous and aristocratic nature
of the hero's amours. Fanning has the solitary distinction of narrating the other side. Jones,
indeed, was a good deal of a snob, but he was broadly appreciative of the fair sex. He probably
was never deeply in love with anybody, certainly not with any woman of humble character. Of
such his appreciation was of a simple and earthly kind.

Although Jones seems to have had no intimate friends, with possibly one exception, there certainly
was about him a very strong charm, which made him a favorite in good society. He had a flattering
tongue, a ready wit, and a gallant manner. Of Jones's attractions Benjamin Franklin once wrote
to a woman:--

"I must confess to your Ladyship that when face to face with him neither man nor, so far as
I can learn, woman can for a moment resist the strange magnetism of his presence, the indescribable
charm of his manner, a commingling of the most compliant deference with the most perfect self-esteem
that I have ever seen in a man; and, above all, the sweetness of his voice and the purity of
his language."

Mr. Varnum of Rhode Island, who met Jones only in connection with public business, said of him:--

"I confess there was a magic about his way and manner that I have never before seen. Whatever
he said carried conviction with it."

Even more sensible of Jones's charms than the men were the women, who were universally dazzled
by the brilliant hero. Miss Edes-Herbert, an Englishwoman living in Paris, writes, among other
flattering things about him:--

"Since my last, the famous Paul Jones has dined here and also been present at afternoon teas.
If I am in love with him, for love I may die, I am sure, because I have as many rivals as there
are ladies."

She records that Jones wrote verses for the ladies extempore, and gives a sample, the sentiments
of which are as characteristic of the declamatory century as of the naïvely vain Jones:--

     "Insulted Freedom bled,--I felt her cause,
     And drew my sword to vindicate her laws,
     From principle, and not from vain applause.
     I've done my best; self-interest far apart,
     And self-reproach a stranger to my heart;
     My zeal still prompts, ambitious to pursue
     The foe, ye fair, of liberty and you:
     Grateful for praise, spontaneous and unbought,
     A generous people's love not meanly sought;
     To merit this, and bend the knee to beauty,
     Shall be my earliest and latest duty."

Many of Jones's flowery letters to distinguished women are preserved. On one occasion he wrote
to a certain countess, informing her that he was composing a secret cipher for a key to their
correspondence, and added: "I beseech you to accept the within lock (of hair). I am sorry that
it is now eighteen inches shorter than it was three months ago."

The only case in which Jones's affections seem to have reached beyond good nature, common kindness,
or gallantry, to the point of love, was that of Aimée de Thelison. She was the natural daughter
of Louis XV., and this fact no doubt greatly heightened her interest in the eyes of the aristocratic
Jones. She was a person of beauty and charm, and felt deep love for Jones. His love for her
was of a cool character, which did not interfere with any of the enterprises taking him so
frequently away from Paris. His letters to her are with one exception hardly love letters.
The warmest words in that exception are:--

"The last French packet brought no letter to me from the person whose happiness is dearer to
me than anything else.... Your silence makes even honors insipid."

It was while Jones was waiting thus gayly to sail for America, that the king of France bestowed
upon him, in recognition of his services to the common cause, the Royal Order of Military Merit
and a gold-mounted sword of honor, and made him Chevalier of France. It was, as Jones himself
frequently wrote, a singular honor, he being the first alien to be made a French chevalier;
and Jones prized this favor from a king more than he would the gift of a million dollars. The
gold sword also pleased him deeply, and he asked the countess to whom he had sent the lock
of hair to keep it for him, lest he lose it. He wrote of this gift:--

"His Majesty ordered a superb sword to be made for me, which I have since received, and it
is called much more elegant than that presented to the Marquis de la Fayette."

VIII

PRIVATE AMBITION AND PUBLIC BUSINESS

Benjamin Franklin, knowing the value of the supplies to Washington's army, had implored Jones
to embark several months before the little Ariel actually set sail, October 8, 1780. But Jones,
hoping for an important command in Europe, and delayed by business in connection with fitting
out his ship, and perhaps by the gayeties he was engaged in at Paris, did not show much concern
over General Washington's distress. When he finally did sail, he encountered a terrible storm,
and it was only the best of seamanship which enabled him to avoid shipwreck. As it was, he
was compelled to put back for repairs to L'Orient, where, in a series of letters, he manoeuvred
in vain for the loan of the fine ship Terpsichore.

It was not until December 18 that the Ariel got under way again for America. The voyage was
uneventful, with the exception of a night battle with a British privateer sloop of inferior
force. Jones cleverly concealed his greater strength, and thus lured the Englishman to engage.
After a ten-minute fight, the Triumph struck its colors, but, when the Ariel ceased firing,
sailed away and escaped, to Jones's exceeding mortification.

"The English captain," he wrote in his journal, "may properly be called a knave, because after
he surrendered his ship, begged for and obtained quarter, he basely ran away, contrary to the
laws of naval war and the practice of civilized nations."

Paul Jones, when he arrived in Philadelphia, the 18th of February, 1781, was thirty-three years
old and had actively served in the United States navy for five years and five months. He never
fought another battle under the United States flag; indeed, with the exception of his distressing
experiences in Russia, he never fought again under any flag. But to his dying day he did not
cease to plan great naval deeds and to hope for greater opportunity to harass the enemy--any
enemy. In view of his great ambition and ability, circumstances allowed him to accomplish little.
He had only one opportunity, and the way he responded made him famous; but though it brought
him honor it did not satisfy him, and the rest of his life was a series of disappointments.
His bitterness grew apace, and before he died he was a genuinely pathetic figure.

Soon after Jones's arrival at Philadelphia, the Board of Admiralty required him to give "all
the information in his power relative to the detention of the clothing and arms in France intended
for Washington's army;" and a series of forty-seven questions, on the subject not only of the
delay but also on matters connected generally with his cruises, were submitted to him. He attributed,
with probable justice, the instigation of this investigation to his enemy Arthur Lee, whom
he desired in consequence to challenge to a duel. He was dissuaded, however, from this step,
as well as from the publication of a paper he had written called "Arthur Lee in France," in
which he made a circumstantial charge against Lee of "treason, perfidy, and the office of a
spy," by some of his distinguished friends, including Morris and Livingston.

Without either the duel or the publication of the paper, Jones was, however, completely vindicated.
He answered the questions with clearness and skill, to the complete satisfaction of the board,
which recommended that Congress confer on the hero some distinguished mark of approbation.
A committee was appointed to question Jones personally, and the impression he made upon it
is another proof of the remarkable suavity, plausibility and magnetism of the man. One of the
examining committeemen wrote:--

"From his beginning no one thought of disputing him. Toward the end we seldom ventured to ask
him any questions. He made himself master of the situation throughout. At the end the committee
felt honored by having had the privilege of listening to him."

On the committee's recommendation Congress, which had already on Jones's arrival resolved "that
Congress entertain a high sense of the distinguished bravery and military conduct of John Paul
Jones, Esq., captain in the navy of the United States, and particularly in his victory over
the British frigate Serapis," gave Jones a further vote of thanks, "for the zeal, prudence,
and intrepidity with which he has supported the honor of the American flag; for his bold and
successful enterprises to redeem from captivity the citizens of these States who had fallen
under the power of the enemy, and in general for the good conduct and eminent services by which
he has added lustre to his character and to the American arms."

Soon after, the intrepid man to whom were given so many testimonials and so few satisfactory
commands received an appreciative letter from General Washington, who, after stating his satisfaction
with Jones's explanation of the delay of the supplies, said:--

"Whether our naval affairs have in general been well or ill conducted would be presumptuous
in me to determine. Instances of bravery and good conduct in several of our officers have not,
however, been wanting. Delicacy forbids me to mention that particular instance which has attracted
the admiration of all the world and which has influenced the most illustrious monarch to confer
a mark of his favor which can only be obtained by a long and honorable service or by the performance
of some brilliant action."

It now seemed to Jones a favorable opportunity to improve his rank, and on May 28 he sent a
memorial to Congress reiterating his claims to stand above the captains who had been unjustly
put ahead of him. He failed, probably on account of the political influence wielded by the
captains; but in the way of compensation he was appointed commander of the new vessel then
building at Portsmouth, a seventy-four, called the America, the only ship of the line owned
by the States,--a "singular honor," as he expressed it. John Adams, who had at one time been
unfriendly to Jones, looking upon him as "a smooth, plausible, and rather capable adventurer,"
wrote him, à propos of this appointment:--

"The command of the America could not have been more judiciously bestowed, and it is with impatience
that I wish her at sea, where she will do honor to her name."

Jones had hoped to join Washington's army, then campaigning against Cornwallis, as a volunteer,
but he cheerfully gave up this exciting prospect in order to prepare the America for sea,--"the
most lingering and disagreeable task," he wrote, "he had been charged with during the whole
of the war." He did his job with his usual efficiency, however, and with his usual extravagance,
which he called simplicity. He wrote in his journal: "The plan which Captain Jones projected
for the sculpture expressed dignity and simplicity. The head was a female figure crowned with
laurels. The right arm was raised, with the forefinger pointing to heaven.... On the left arm
was a buckler, with a blue ground and thirteen silver stars. The legs and feet were covered
here and there with wreaths of smoke, to represent the dangers and difficulties of war. On
the stern, under the windows of the great cabin, appeared two large figures in bas-relief,
representing Tyranny and Oppression, bound and biting the ground, with the cap of Liberty on
a pole above their heads. On the back part of the starboard quarter was a large Neptune; and
on the back part of the larboard quarter gallery, a large Mars."

As a reward for all this industry and æsthetic effort Jones had another disappointment; for
in August, 1782, the French seventy-four gunship, the Magnifique, was wrecked at the entrance
to Boston harbor, and Congress gave the America to the king of France.

With undaunted energy Jones now attempted to get hold of the South Carolina, originally called
the Indien, which he had formerly, when he crossed the ocean in the Ranger, failed to secure.
She was now, under the new name, in the service of the States, and Robert Morris tried to turn
her over to Jones, that he might again "harass the enemy." But the plan failed, and Jones remained
without a command. Unable to rest, although his health had for some time been failing, he now
requested and obtained consent "to embark as a volunteer in pursuit of military marine knowledge
with the Marquis de Vaudreuil, in order to enable him the better to serve his country when
America should increase her navy." He went off, accordingly, on the cruise with the French
fleet; but the expedition, during the course of which peace was declared, was uneventful, and
Jones, who had had an attack of fever, spent the summer of 1783 quietly in the town of Bethlehem.
In the following November, however, he renewed his activity, and on his application was appointed
by Congress agent to collect all moneys due from the sale of the prizes taken in European waters
by vessels under his command.

Although money was subordinate, in Jones's mind, to glory and the opportunity for action, he
was an excellent business man. His commercial transactions had been successful enough to enable
him to pay with his own resources the crews of the Alfred and Providence, so that when he set
sail in the Ranger he had advanced £1500 to the United States. After the close of the war,
at a period of comparative inactivity, he began a profitable trade in illuminating oils, and
in his character as prize money agent he continued to show his business dexterity. He began
a long campaign of a year of most pertinacious and vigorous dunning for money due the United
States, himself, and the officers and sailors under his command. He wrote innumerable letters
to Franklin, to de Castries, the new Minister of Marine, to de Vergennes, Minister of Foreign
Affairs; to many others, and prepared for the king a careful account of his cruises, in order
to show that prize money was due. In arguing for all that he could get he showed great acuteness,
legal sense, and, beyond everything, invincible determination. He also again demonstrated his
happy talent for abuse of those who stood in his way. He finally secured the allowance of his
claims; and the settlements, which began in January, 1784, were completed, as far as France
was concerned, in July, 1785. He was paid 181,000 livres, which he turned over, less deductions
for expenses and his own share of the prize money, to Thomas Jefferson, then minister to France,
who approved the account. Jones charged for his ordinary expenses, however, the sum of 48,000
livres and his share of prize money was 13,000 livres, a total of 61,000 livres, a generous
allowance. One of the free-handed man's biographers, A. S. MacKenzie, pointed out that Jones
"charged his shipmates for his expenses, during less than two years, more than General Washington
did the people of the United States throughout the Revolutionary War."

The next public business of Jones was to attempt to collect indemnity from the Danish government
for the delivery to England of the prizes sent by the mad Landais, during Jones's most famous
cruise, to Bergen, Denmark. He delayed his trip to Copenhagen, however, for a number of reasons.
At this time he was carrying on several private business enterprises of importance, was occupied
with society in London and Paris, and was eagerly desirous of being sent by the French government
against the Dey of Algiers, who held in bondage many Christians. At various times during his
career Jones showed a keen sense of the wrongs inflicted on Americans by the Barbary pirates
in search of tribute, and in his letters to Jefferson and others he often suggested plans for
their extermination. For de Vergennes and de Castries he prepared a memorandum urging the necessity
of a movement against the pirates, and ably pointing out the good that would accrue therefrom
to the world, and particularly to France, to which nation he attributed future dominion in
North Africa, provided action was taken in time to forestall Great Britain.

"The knowledge of the race persuades me," he wrote, "that England will soon invade the Mediterranean--doubtless
as soon as she recovers from the exhaustion of the late war."

The United States, however, were after the war lacking so completely in resources that a war
with the pirates was impossible, and France was on the brink of her great Revolution, and had
more important things to consider. So Jones died before the expedition for which he had so
ardently hoped, and which brought so much honor, as he had predicted, to the man who commanded
it--Commodore Dale, once Jones's first lieutenant on the Bonhomme Richard--was dispatched.

Jones finally set off for Copenhagen to collect the indemnity from the Danish government; but
hearing of a crisis in an important business matter in which he was interested, he made, before
arriving at his destination, a flying trip to America. While there, he was awarded a gold medal
by Congress, and said in his journal that such a medal had been given to only six officers.

"To General Washington, for the capture of Boston; General Gates, for the capture of Burgoyne's
army; General Wayne, for the taking of Rocky Point;... General Morgan, for having defeated
and destroyed a detachment of 1100 officers and soldiers of the best troops of England, with
900 militia merely; General Greene, for having scored a decisive victory on the enemy at Euta
Spring.... But all these medals, although well merited, were given in moments of enthusiasm.
I had the unique satisfaction of receiving the same honor, by the unanimous voice of the United
States assembled in Congress, the sixteenth October, 1787, in memory of the services which
I rendered eight years earlier."

It was not until January, 1788, that Paul Jones arrived at Copenhagen, where, during his short
stay, he was magnificently entertained by the court. The negotiations for the indemnity, which
he began almost immediately, were abruptly terminated by the transfer of the matter for settlement
to Paris. Jones, on the day he agreed to suspend the negotiations, received from the Danish
government a patent for a pension of 1500 crowns a year, "for the respect he had shown the
Danish flag while he commanded in the European seas." Jones kept this transaction, for which
he possibly felt ashamed, to himself, until several years afterwards, when, writing to Jefferson,
he said: "I have felt myself in an embarrassing situation, with regard to the king's patent,
and I have not yet made use of it, though three years have elapsed since I received it."

On Jones's return to Paris from America, previous to his Copenhagen trip, the Russian ambassador
to France, Baron Simolin, had made, through Mr. Jefferson, a proposition looking to the appointment
of the conqueror of the Serapis to a position in the navy of Russia, then about to war with
the Turks. Simolin wrote Catherine II. of Russia that, "with the chief command of the fleet
and carte blanche he would undertake that in a year Paul Jones would make Constantinople tremble."
This exciting possibility was no doubt constantly in Jones's mind while he was at Copenhagen,
and probably increased his willingness to dismiss the indemnity negotiations. He began immediately
to manoeuvre for the highest command possible. He demurred to the rank of captain-commandant,
equal to that of major-general in the army, and maintained that nothing less than rear-admiral
was fitting. He laid the account of all his deeds and honors before the dazzled Russian minister
at Copenhagen, and said: "The unbounded admiration and profound respect which I have long felt
for the glorious character of her Imperial Majesty, forbids the idea that a sovereign so magnanimous
should sanction any arrangement that may give pain at the outset to the man she deigns to honor
with her notice, and who wishes to devote himself entirely to her service." In order to be
in a better position for extorting honors from the empress, Jones wrote Jefferson suggesting
that Congress bestow upon him the rank of rear-admiral; and took occasion to assert, on the
eve of taking service under a despot, the undying character of his love for America.

"I am not forsaking," he wrote, "the country that has had so many distinguished and difficult
proofs of my affection; and can never renounce the glorious title of a citizen of the United
States" [Italics are Jones's].

Jones left Copenhagen on his ill-fated Russian mission, April 11, and made a flying and perilous
trip to St. Petersburg. He crossed the ice-blocked Baltic in a small boat, compelled, at the
muzzle of his pistols, the unwilling boatmen to proceed, and on his arrival at his destination,
on April 23, was presented to the empress, who conferred upon him the coveted rank of rear-admiral,
to the intense irritation of many of the English officers in the service of Russia, who looked
upon Jones as a red-handed pirate. In June Catherine wrote to her favorite at the time: "I
am sorry that all the officers are raging about Paul Jones. I hope fervently that they will
cease their mad complaints, for he is necessary to us." In 1792, long after the war in which
Jones had played a part, Catherine said, with a different accent: "Ce Paul Jones était une
bien mauvaise tête." Certainly Jones's diplomacy, which was of a direct character, was not
equal to his present situation, unfamiliar to him, and for success demanding conduct tortuous
and insincere to an Oriental degree. Jones, in comparison with his associates in Russia, was
remarkably truthful,--a trait which involved him in humiliating difficulties, and which was
a source of irritation to the empress and to all concerned.

IX

IN THE RUSSIAN SERVICE

Paul Jones left St. Petersburg on May 7, to take command of the Russian squadron in the Black
Sea. Before his departure he requested of the empress "never to be condemned unheard." This,
one of the most modest demands Jones ever made, was, as the sequel will show, denied him. He
arrived on the 19th at St. Elizabeth, the headquarters of Prince Potemkin, the former favorite
of the empress and the commander in chief of the war against the Turks. Potemkin, under whose
orders Jones stood, was of a thoroughly despotic type. As Potemkin was a prince, Jones was
at first disposed to flatter him extravagantly, but the commodore was by nature averse to being
dictated to, particularly by those whom he deemed his inferiors, and it was not long before
they began to quarrel.

Paul Jones was put in command of the squadron which was to oppose the fleet of the Capitan
Pacha, and thus help the Russian army to take Oczakow, a town lying at the junction of the
Bog with the Knieper, which had been strongly fortified by the Turks. Unfortunately, Jones
was not only subject to the orders of Prince Potemkin, but the immediate command of the fleet
was divided between him and a thoroughly incompetent and arrogant adventurer, the Prince of
Nassau. Jones commanded the heavier ships, forming the squadron, while Nassau was in charge
of a considerable force of Russian gunboats and barges, composing what was called the flotilla.
Between Jones and Nassau existed extreme jealousy. In fact, the only officer in high position
with whom Jones stood on an amicable footing was the distinguished General Suwarrow. Early
in the campaign the Russian had advised Jones to allow Potemkin to take the credit of any success
that might result, and to hold his tongue,--two things which Jones, unfortunately, was quite
incapable of doing.

It is impossible to enter into the details of this campaign, but enough may be given to explain
the difficulties which Jones encountered. After some unimportant engagements between the two
fleets, an action of importance occurred which disclosed the deep differences between Jones
and his Russian allies. The Capitan Pacha attempted to attack the Russian fleet, but one of
his ships ran aground, and the others anchored. Jones saw his opportunity and ordered a general
attack on the confused Turkish fleet, which cut anchor and fled, with Jones in pursuit. The
Wolodimer, Jones's flagship, steered straight for the Capitan Pacha's ship, which ran aground;
whereupon one of Jones's officers, without orders, dropped the Wolodimer's anchor. In the mean
time the flotilla, under Nassau, lagged behind, and Jones, in order to offset the operations
of the Turkish flotilla, which had already destroyed one of the Russian frigates, left his
anchored flagship to go in search of Nassau, whom he found with his flotilla occupied in firing
on two Turkish ships which were aground and were, moreover, under the guns of the Russian ships,
and might justly be regarded as prizes. Nassau persisted in this useless undertaking until
the enemy's vessels had been burned and the crews had perished in the flames. When Jones found
he was unable to withdraw the prince from this bloody and unprofitable proceeding, he ordered
an attack, with a part of Nassau's ships, upon the Turkish flotilla, which was soon driven off.

During the night the Capitan Pacha attempted to pass out from the Liman, with the remains of
his squadron; but nine of his ships grounded, and, being thus brought within range of the Russian
fort on the extreme point of Kinburn, were fired upon and were practically at the mercy of
the Russians. Nevertheless, the Prince of Nassau advanced in the morning with his flotilla,
and, to Jones's extreme rage, burned the grounded Turkish ships, three thousand Turks who were
practically prisoners perishing in the flames.

On July 1 Nassau, with his flotilla, advanced against the flotilla of the Turks, but did not
seem anxious to go within grapeshot; and Jones, with his heavier ships, went to capture five
Turkish galleys lying under the cover of the guns of the Turkish battery and flotilla. Two
of these galleys were captured and the others destroyed. Nassau and Alexiano directed their
belligerent efforts against the captured galleys, one of which was--with all the slaves on
board,--ruthlessly burned. Other Turkish ships were likewise needlessly destroyed, a mode of
warfare quite at variance with the traditions of Jones. He expressed his consequent disgust
in terms more genuine than diplomatic.

As a reward of his idiotic actions, on the basis of an inflated and dishonest report of the
battle which was sent to the empress, Nassau received a valuable estate, the military order
of St. George, and authority to hoist the flag of rear-admiral; other officers were also substantially
rewarded; while all that was given to Jones, whose honest but unflattering report had been
rejected by Potemkin, was the order of St. Anne. It is easy to imagine Jones's bitterness.
He says in his journal: "If he (Nassau) has received the rank of vice-admiral, I will say in
the face of the universe that he is unworthy of it."

Referring to the cowardice of his associates who, in order to escape, he says, provided their
boats with small chaloupes, Jones writes:--

"For myself I took no precautions. I saw that I must conquer or die."

Jones's bitterness, partly justified by the facts, seems at this time to have reached almost
the point of madness, and the quarrel between him and his associates increased in virulence.
In the course of the unimportant operations following the defeat of the Turks, during which
the squadron maintained a strict blockade of Oczakow, Jones was sent on a number of trivial
enterprises by Potemkin, whose language was carefully chosen to irritate the fiery Scotchman.
On one occasion he commanded Jones "to receive him (the Capitan Pacha) courageously, and drive
him back. I require that this be done without loss of time; if not, you will be made answerable
for every neglect." In reply, Jones complained of the injustice done his officers. Shortly
afterwards Jones doubted the wisdom of one of Potemkin's orders, and wrote: "Every man is master
of his opinion, and this is mine." When Potemkin again wrote Jones "to defend himself courageously,"
the latter's annotation was: "It will be hard to believe that Prince Potemkin addressed such
words to Paul Jones." To the prince he wrote in terms alternately flattering and complaining:--

"Your Highness has so good a heart that you will excuse the hastiness of expression which escaped
me. I am anxious to continue in the service."

But the despotic Potemkin had made up his mind that he could not get along with Paul Jones,
and with an indirectness characteristic of him, secured an order for the latter for service
"in the northern seas." This was practically a dismissal for Jones, who returned in virtual
disgrace to St. Petersburg, where he hoped to be put in command of the Baltic fleet. Catherine,
however, was now sincerely anxious to get rid of Jones, but on account of his powerful friends
in France did not dare to do so openly. She had "condemned him unheard," and repeated her injustice
in a still more pointed way; for in March, 1789, while Jones was waiting for the command which
never came, he was falsely accused of an atrocious crime and forbidden to approach the palace
of the empress, being again "condemned unheard." Had it not been for the French ambassador,
de Ségur, who had a strong influence on Catherine, the crime might always have been attributed
to Paul Jones. De Ségur, however, proved to Catherine that Jones was the victim of a plot,
and she was forced to recall the unfortunate man to court. Soon afterwards Jones, who had for
a long time been greatly suffering in health, was given two years' leave of absence.

Paul Jones's experience in Russia was the most unfortunate part of an unfortunate career. His
services to that country, which were considerable, were never recognized. His report of the
Liman campaign had been rejected, and he had been unjustly deposed from the actual command
and an empty promise substituted. His letters had been systematically intercepted, and he was
a victim, not only of a detestable plot involving his moral character, but of many other charges
equally virulent and untrue.

It was grotesquely reported, for instance, that he had murdered his nephew, who in reality
did not exist. The leave of absence, moreover, must have been to a man of his spirit a severe blow.

At the close of the journal of the Liman campaign Jones's bitterness is pathetically expressed
in inflated self-praise, called out by the desire to confute the calumnies of his enemies.
"Every one to whom I have the honor to be known," he wrote, "is aware that I am the least selfish
of mankind.... This is known to the whole American people.... Have I not given proofs sufficiently
striking that I have a heart the most sensitive, a soul the most elevated?... I am the only
man in the world that possesses a sword given by the king of France ... but what completes
my happiness is the esteem and friendship of the most virtuous of men, whose fame will be immortal;
and that a Washington, a Franklin, a D'Estaing, a La Fayette, think the bust of Paul Jones
worthy of being placed side by side with their own.... Briefly, I am satisfied with myself."

X

LAST DAYS

On August 18, 1789, Paul Jones left St. Petersburg, never to return, and never again to fight
a battle. He was only forty-two years old, but although his ambition was as intense as ever,
his health had through unremitting exertions and exposure become undermined. For many years
the active man had not known what it was to sleep four hours at a time, and now his left lung
was badly affected, and he had only a few years more to live. After an extended tour, devoted
mainly to business and society,--during the course of which he met Kosciusko at Warsaw, visited,
among other cities, Vienna, Munich, Strassburg, and London,--Jones reached Paris, where Aimée
de Thelison and his true home were, on May 30, 1790. He resigned from his position in the Russian
navy, and remained most of the time until his death in the French capital.

The great French Revolution had taken place; and Paul Jones occupied the position, unusual
for him, of a passive spectator of great events. Acquainted with men of all parties, with Bertrand
Barère, Carnot, Robespierre, and Danton, as well as with the more conservative men with whom
his own past had led him to sympathize,--Lafayette, Mirabeau, and Malesherbes,--Jones's last
days were not lacking in picturesque opportunity for observation. He felt great sympathy for
the king, with whom he had been acquainted, and who had bestowed upon him the title of chevalier
and the gold sword. For Mirabeau, as for other really great men Jones knew,--Franklin, Washington,
and Suwarrow,--he had extreme admiration, and on the occasion of the famous Frenchman's death
wrote: "I have never seen or read of a man capable of such mastery over the passions and the
follies of such a mob. There is no one to take the place of Mirabeau." Of the mob Jones wrote
with aristocratic hatred: "There have been many moments when my heart turned to stone towards
those who call themselves 'the people' in France. More than once have I harbored the wish that
I might be intrusted by Lafayette with the command of the Palace, with carte blanche to defend
the constitution; and that I might have once more with me, if only for one day, my old crews
of the Ranger, the Richard, and the Alliance! I surely would have made the thirty cannon of
the courtyard teach to that mad rabble the lesson that grapeshot has its uses in struggles
for the rights of man!"

Jones always had much to say on the organization of navies and the principles of naval warfare.
About this time he wrote a letter to Admiral Kersaint, of the French navy, in which he criticised
fearlessly and trenchantly the naval tactics of the French. Their policy, he explained, was
to "neutralize the power of their adversaries, if possible, by grand manoeuvres rather than
to destroy it by grand attack;" and objecting to this policy, the dashing Jones, who always
desired to "get alongside the enemy," wrote: "Their (the French) combinations have been superb;
but as I look at them, they have not been harmful enough; they have not been calculated to
do as much capturing or sinking of ships, and as much crippling or killing of seamen, as true
and lasting success in naval warfare seems to me to demand.... Should France thus honor me
[with a command] it must be with the unqualified understanding that I am not to be restricted
by the traditions of her naval tactics; but with full consent that I may, on suitable occasion,
to be decreed by my judgment on the spot, try conclusions with her foes to the bitter end or
to death, at shorter range and at closer quarters than have hitherto been sanctioned by her
tactical authorities."

Paul Jones, although in these last years he was forced, more than was agreeable to him, to
play the rôle of an intelligent commentator, remained a man of action to the end. He sought,
this time in vain, to extract from the French government wages still due the crew of the old
Bonhomme Richard. His failure brought out an unusually bitter letter, in which he again recounted
his services and the wrongs done him by the various ministers of marine. As he grew older and
more disappointed the deeds he had done seemed mountain high to him. "My fortitude and self-denial
alone dragged Holland into the war, a service of the greatest importance to this nation; for
without that great event, no calculation can ascertain when the war would have ended.... Would
you suppose that I was driven out of the Texel in a single frigate belonging to the United
States, in the face of forty-two English ships and vessels posted to cut off my retreat?"

With equal energy the failing commodore never ceased to hope and strive for an important command.
To head an expedition against the Barbary pirates had long been with him a favorite scheme,
and now he looked forward eagerly to a position in the French navy.

By the irony of fate a letter came from Mr. Jefferson announcing Jones's appointment as commissioner
for treating with the Dey and government of Algiers. But it was too late, for before the letter
arrived in Paris Paul Jones was dead. 1. 'Every game of chance presents two kinds of chances which
are very distinct,--namely, those relating to the person interested, that is, the player; and
those inherent in the combinations of the game.'

In the former there is what must be called, for the want of a better name, 'good luck' or 'bad luck,'
that is, some mysterious cause which at times gives the play a 'run' of good or bad luck; in
the latter there is the entire doctrine of 'probabilities' aforesaid, which, according to M. Houdin's
gaming hero, may be completely discarded for the following axiom:--
2. 'If chance can bring into the game all possible combinations,
there are, nevertheless, certain limits at which it seems to stop.
Such, for instance, as a certain number turning up ten times in succession
at Roulette. My friends, I would
love to pursue this theme, but, as you see, my voice is failing and my lower limbs become swollen
when I stand up too long. At any rate I have said enough. I am now ready to act whenever and
wheresoever bidden by the voice of France."

Jones's cough and the swelling in his legs continued; a few days later jaundice and dropsy
set in, and it was clear to his friends that the end was near. Aimée de Thelison, Gouverneur
Morris, and some of the distinguished revolutionists were about him during the last few days
of his life. On the afternoon of July 18, 1792, his will was witnessed, and about seven o'clock
in the evening he was found in his room, lying with his clothes on, face down across the middle
of the bed, dead.

The next day the National Assembly passed a resolution decreeing "that twelve of its members
shall assist at the funeral of a man who has so well served the cause of liberty."

True or not, the words attributed to Napoleon after Trafalgar, in 1805, are no more than justice
to Paul Jones.

"How old," Napoleon asked, "was Paul Jones when he died?"

On being told that Jones was forty-five years old at the time of his death, Napoleon said:--

"Then he did not fulfill his destiny. Had he lived to this time, France might have had an admiral."

Paul Jones has been called by his friends patriot, and by his enemies pirate. In reality he
was neither. He was not one of those deeply ethical natures that subordinate personal glory
and success to the common good. As an American he cannot be ranked with his great contemporaries,
for his patriotism consisted merely in being fair and devoted to the side he had for the time
espoused rather than in quiet work as a citizen after the spectacular opportunity had passed. An
Attorney,--who was generally a Newgate solicitor.

12. A Captain,--who was to fight any gentleman who might be peevish at losing his money.
13. An Usher,--who lighted the gentlemen up and down stairs, and
gave the word to the porter.

14. In search for fame he gave up family, friends, and religion. In these
relations of life he would have been and was, as far as he went, tolerant and kind; but in
them he was not interested. Love of glory made him a lonely figure. It rendered him a poseur,
vain and snobbish, but it also spurred him on to contend, with phenomenal energy, against almost
innumerable difficulties.

As far as his deeds are concerned, Paul Jones appears in the popular consciousness as he really
was,--a bolt of effectiveness, a desperate, successful fighter, a sea captain whose habit was
to appear unexpectedly to confound his enemies, and then to disappear, no one knew where, only
to reappear with telling effect. Sometimes avidity makes terrible mistakes; many, in order to
win more, have lost their all to persons who had not a shilling to lose. During the depth of a
severe winter, a gamester beheld with terror the bottom of his purse.
