She took him by the arm, and walked with him about a quarter of a mile into the country; they
arrived at a lonely house, surrounded with gardens and canals. The old woman knocked at a little
door, it opened, she led Candide up a private staircase into a small apartment richly furnished.
She left him on a brocaded sofa, shut the door and went away. Candide thought himself in a
dream; indeed, that he had been dreaming unluckily all his life, and that the present moment
was the only agreeable part of it all.

The old woman returned very soon, supporting with difficulty a trembling woman of a majestic
figure, brilliant with jewels, and covered with a veil.

"Take off that veil," said the old woman to Candide.

The young man approaches, he raises the veil with a timid hand. Oh! what a moment! what surprise!
he believes he beholds Miss Cunegonde? he really sees her! it is herself! His strength fails
him, he cannot utter a word, but drops at her feet. Cunegonde falls upon the sofa. The old
woman supplies a smelling bottle; they come to themselves and recover their speech. As they
began with broken accents, with questions and answers interchangeably interrupted with sighs,
with tears, and cries. The old woman desired they would make less noise and then she left them
to themselves.

"What, is it you?" said Candide, "you live? I find you again in Portugal? then you have not
been ravished? then they did not rip open your belly as Doctor Pangloss informed me?"

"Yes, they did," said the beautiful Cunegonde; "but those two accidents are not always mortal."

"But were your father and mother killed?"

"It is but too true," answered Cunegonde, in tears.

"And your brother?"

"My brother also was killed."

"And why are you in Portugal? and how did you know of my being here? and by what strange adventure
did you contrive to bring me to this house?"

"I will tell you all that," replied the lady, "but first of all let me know your history, since
the innocent kiss you gave me and the kicks which you received."

Candide respectfully obeyed her, and though he was still in a surprise, though his voice was
feeble and trembling, though his back still pained him, yet he gave her a most ingenuous account
of everything that had befallen him since the moment of their separation. Cunegonde lifted
up her eyes to heaven; shed tears upon hearing of the death of the good Anabaptist and of Pangloss;
after which she spoke as follows to Candide, who did not lose a word and devoured her with
his eyes.

VIII

THE HISTORY OF CUNEGONDE.

"I was in bed and fast asleep when it pleased God to send the Bulgarians to our delightful
castle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh; they slew my father and brother, and cut my mother in pieces.
A tall Bulgarian, six feet high, perceiving that I had fainted away at this sight, began to
ravish me; this made me recover; I regained my senses, I cried, I struggled, I bit, I scratched,
I wanted to tear out the tall Bulgarian's eyes--not knowing that what happened at my father's
house was the usual practice of war. The brute gave me a cut in the left side with his hanger,
and the mark is still upon me."

"Ah! I hope I shall see it," said honest Candide.

"You shall," said Cunegonde, "but let us continue."

"Do so," replied Candide.

Thus she resumed the thread of her story:

"A Bulgarian captain came in, saw me all bleeding, and the soldier not in the least disconcerted.
The captain flew into a passion at the disrespectful behaviour of the brute, and slew him on
my body. He ordered my wounds to be dressed, and took me to his quarters as a prisoner of war.
I washed the few shirts that he had, I did his cooking; he thought me very pretty--he avowed
it; on the other hand, I must own he had a good shape, and a soft and white skin; but he had
little or no mind or philosophy, and you might see plainly that he had never been instructed
by Doctor Pangloss. In three months time, having lost all his money, and being grown tired
of my company, he sold me to a Jew, named Don Issachar, who traded to Holland and Portugal,
and had a strong passion for women. This Jew was much attached to my person, but could not
triumph over it; I resisted him better than the Bulgarian soldier. A modest woman may be ravished
once, but her virtue is strengthened by it. In order to render me more tractable, he brought
me to this country house. Hitherto I had imagined that nothing could equal the beauty of Thunder-ten-Tronckh
Castle; but I found I was mistaken.

"The Grand Inquisitor, seeing me one day at Mass, stared long at me, and sent to tell me that
he wished to speak on private matters. I was conducted to his palace, where I acquainted him
with the history of my family, and he represented to me how much it was beneath my rank to
belong to an Israelite. A proposal was then made to Don Issachar that he should resign me to
my lord. Don Issachar, being the court banker, and a man of credit, would hear nothing of it.
The Inquisitor threatened him with an auto-da-fé. At last my Jew, intimidated, concluded a
bargain, by which the house and myself should belong to both in common; the Jew should have
for himself Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, and the Inquisitor should have the rest of the
week. It is now six months since this agreement was made. Quarrels have not been wanting, for
they could not decide whether the night from Saturday to Sunday belonged to the old law or
to the new. For my part, I have so far held out against both, and I verily believe that this
is the reason why I am still beloved.

"At length, to avert the scourge of earthquakes, and to intimidate Don Issachar, my Lord Inquisitor
was pleased to celebrate an auto-da-fé. He did me the honour to invite me to the ceremony.
I had a very good seat, and the ladies were served with refreshments between Mass and the execution.
I was in truth seized with horror at the burning of those two Jews, and of the honest Biscayner
who had married his godmother; but what was my surprise, my fright, my trouble, when I saw
in a san-benito and mitre a figure which resembled that of Pangloss! I rubbed my eyes, I looked
at him attentively, I saw him hung; I fainted. Scarcely had I recovered my senses than I saw
you stripped, stark naked, and this was the height of my horror, consternation, grief, and
despair. I tell you, truthfully, that your skin is yet whiter and of a more perfect colour
than that of my Bulgarian captain. This spectacle redoubled all the feelings which overwhelmed
and devoured me. I screamed out, and would have said, 'Stop, barbarians!' but my voice failed
me, and my cries would have been useless after you had been severely whipped. How is it possible,
said I, that the beloved Candide and the wise Pangloss should both be at Lisbon, the one to
receive a hundred lashes, and the other to be hanged by the Grand Inquisitor, of whom I am
the well-beloved? Pangloss most cruelly deceived me when he said that everything in the world
is for the best.

"Agitated, lost, sometimes beside myself, and sometimes ready to die of weakness, my mind was
filled with the massacre of my father, mother, and brother, with the insolence of the ugly
Bulgarian soldier, with the stab that he gave me, with my servitude under the Bulgarian captain,
with my hideous Don Issachar, with my abominable Inquisitor, with the execution of Doctor Pangloss,
with the grand Miserere to which they whipped you, and especially with the kiss I gave you
behind the screen the day that I had last seen you. I praised God for bringing you back to
me after so many trials, and I charged my old woman to take care of you, and to conduct you
hither as soon as possible. She has executed her commission perfectly well; I have tasted the
inexpressible pleasure of seeing you again, of hearing you, of speaking with you. But you must
be hungry, for myself, I am famished; let us have supper."

They both sat down to table, and, when supper was over, they placed themselves once more on
the sofa; where they were when Signor Don Issachar arrived. It was the Jewish Sabbath, and
Issachar had come to enjoy his rights, and to explain his tender love.

IX

WHAT BECAME OF CUNEGONDE, CANDIDE, THE GRAND INQUISITOR, AND THE JEW.

This Issachar was the most choleric Hebrew that had ever been seen in Israel since the Captivity
in Babylon.

"What!" said he, "thou bitch of a Galilean, was not the Inquisitor enough for thee? Must this
rascal also share with me?"

In saying this he drew a long poniard which he always carried about him; and not imagining
that his adversary had any arms he threw himself upon Candide: but our honest Westphalian had
received a handsome sword from the old woman along with the suit of clothes. He drew his rapier,
despite his gentleness, and laid the Israelite stone dead upon the cushions at Cunegonde's feet.

"Holy Virgin!" cried she, "what will become of us? A man killed in my apartment! If the officers
of justice come, we are lost!"

"Had not Pangloss been hanged," said Candide, "he would give us good counsel in this emergency,
for he was a profound philosopher. Failing him let us consult the old woman."

She was very prudent and commenced to give her opinion when suddenly another little door opened.
It was an hour after midnight, it was the beginning of Sunday. This day belonged to my lord
the Inquisitor. He entered, and saw the whipped Candide, sword in hand, a dead man upon the
floor, Cunegonde aghast, and the old woman giving counsel.

At this moment, the following is what passed in the soul of Candide, and how he reasoned:

If this holy man call in assistance, he will surely have me burnt; and Cunegonde will perhaps
be served in the same manner; he was the cause of my being cruelly whipped; he is my rival;
and, as I have now begun to kill, I will kill away, for there is no time to hesitate. This
reasoning was clear and instantaneous; so that without giving time to the Inquisitor to recover
from his surprise, he pierced him through and through, and cast him beside the Jew.

"Yet again!" said Cunegonde, "now there is no mercy for us, we are excommunicated, our last
hour has come. How could you do it? you, naturally so gentle, to slay a Jew and a prelate in
two minutes!"

"My beautiful young lady," responded Candide, "when one is a lover, jealous and whipped by
the Inquisition, one stops at nothing."

The old woman then put in her word, saying:

"There are three Andalusian horses in the stable with bridles and saddles, let the brave Candide
get them ready; madame has money, jewels; let us therefore mount quickly on horseback, though
I can sit only on one buttock; let us set out for Cadiz, it is the finest weather in the world,
and there is great pleasure in travelling in the cool of the night."

Immediately Candide saddled the three horses, and Cunegonde, the old woman and he, travelled
thirty miles at a stretch. While they were journeying, the Holy Brotherhood entered the house;
my lord the Inquisitor was interred in a handsome church, and Issachar's body was thrown upon
a dunghill.

Candide, Cunegonde, and the old woman, had now reached the little town of Avacena in the midst
of the mountains of the Sierra Morena, and were speaking as follows in a public inn.

X

IN WHAT DISTRESS CANDIDE, CUNEGONDE, AND THE OLD WOMAN ARRIVED AT CADIZ; AND OF THEIR EMBARKATION.

"Who was it that robbed me of my money and jewels?" said Cunegonde, all bathed in tears. "How
shall we live? What shall we do? Where find Inquisitors or Jews who will give me more?"

"Alas!" said the old woman, "I have a shrewd suspicion of a reverend Grey Friar, who stayed
last night in the same inn with us at Badajos. God preserve me from judging rashly, but he
came into our room twice, and he set out upon his journey long before us."

"Alas!" said Candide, "dear Pangloss has often demonstrated to me that the goods of this world
are common to all men, and that each has an equal right to them. But according to these principles
the Grey Friar ought to have left us enough to carry us through our journey. Have you nothing
at all left, my dear Cunegonde?"

"Not a farthing," said she.

"What then must we do?" said Candide.

"Sell one of the horses," replied the old woman. "I will ride behind Miss Cunegonde, though
I can hold myself only on one buttock, and we shall reach Cadiz."

In the same inn there was a Benedictine prior who bought the horse for a cheap price. Candide,
Cunegonde, and the old woman, having passed through Lucena, Chillas, and Lebrixa, arrived at
length at Cadiz. A fleet was there getting ready, and troops assembling to bring to reason
the reverend Jesuit Fathers of Paraguay, accused of having made one of the native tribes in
the neighborhood of San Sacrament revolt against the Kings of Spain and Portugal. Candide having
been in the Bulgarian service, performed the military exercise before the general of this little
army with so graceful an address, with so intrepid an air, and with such agility and expedition,
that he was given the command of a company of foot. Now, he was a captain! He set sail with
Miss Cunegonde, the old woman, two valets, and the two Andalusian horses, which had belonged
to the grand Inquisitor of Portugal.

During their voyage they reasoned a good deal on the philosophy of poor Pangloss.

"We are going into another world," said Candide; "and surely it must be there that all is for
the best. For I must confess there is reason to complain a little of what passeth in our world
in regard to both natural and moral philosophy."

"I love you with all my heart," said Cunegonde; "but my soul is still full of fright at that
which I have seen and experienced."

"All will be well," replied Candide; "the sea of this new world is already better than our
European sea; it is calmer, the winds more regular. It is certainly the New World which is
the best of all possible worlds."

"God grant it," said Cunegonde; "but I have been so horribly unhappy there that my heart is
almost closed to hope."

"You complain," said the old woman; "alas! you have not known such misfortunes as mine."

Cunegonde almost broke out laughing, finding the good woman very amusing, for pretending to
have been as unfortunate as she.

"Alas!" said Cunegonde, "my good mother, unless you have been ravished by two Bulgarians, have
received two deep wounds in your belly, have had two castles demolished, have had two mothers
cut to pieces before your eyes, and two of your lovers whipped at an auto-da-fé, I do not conceive
how you could be more unfortunate than I. Add that I was born a baroness of seventy-two quarterings--and
have been a cook!"

"Miss," replied the old woman, "you do not know my birth; and were I to show you my backside,
you would not talk in that manner, but would suspend your judgment."

This speech having raised extreme curiosity in the minds of Cunegonde and Candide, the old
woman spoke to them as follows.

XI

HISTORY OF THE OLD WOMAN.

"I had not always bleared eyes and red eyelids; neither did my nose always touch my chin; nor
was I always a servant. I am the daughter of Pope Urban X,[10] and of the Princess of Palestrina.
Until the age of fourteen I was brought up in a palace, to which all the castles of your German
barons would scarcely have served for stables; and one of my robes was worth more than all
the magnificence of Westphalia. As I grew up I improved in beauty, wit, and every graceful
accomplishment, in the midst of pleasures, hopes, and respectful homage. Already I inspired
love. My throat was formed, and such a throat! white, firm, and shaped like that of the Venus
of Medici; and what eyes! what eyelids! what black eyebrows! such flames darted from my dark
pupils that they eclipsed the scintillation of the stars--as I was told by the poets in our
part of the world. My waiting women, when dressing and undressing me, used to fall into an
ecstasy, whether they viewed me before or behind; how glad would the gentlemen have been to
perform that office for them!

"I was affianced to the most excellent Prince of Massa Carara. Such a prince! as handsome as
myself, sweet-tempered, agreeable, brilliantly witty, and sparkling with love. I loved him
as one loves for the first time--with idolatry, with transport. The nuptials were prepared.
There was surprising pomp and magnificence; there were fêtes, carousals, continual opera bouffe;
and all Italy composed sonnets in my praise, though not one of them was passable. I was just
upon the point of reaching the summit of bliss, when an old marchioness who had been mistress
to the Prince, my husband, invited him to drink chocolate with her. He died in less than two
hours of most terrible convulsions. But this is only a bagatelle. My mother, in despair, and
scarcely less afflicted than myself, determined to absent herself for some time from so fatal
a place. She had a very fine estate in the neighbourhood of Gaeta. We embarked on board a galley
of the country which was gilded like the great altar of St. Peter's at Rome. A Sallee corsair
swooped down and boarded us. Our men defended themselves like the Pope's soldiers; they flung
themselves upon their knees, and threw down their arms, begging of the corsair an absolution
in articulo mortis.

"Instantly they were stripped as bare as monkeys; my mother, our maids of honour, and myself
were all served in the same manner. It is amazing with what expedition those gentry undress
people. But what surprised me most was, that they thrust their fingers into the part of our
bodies which the generality of women suffer no other instrument but--pipes to enter. It appeared
to me a very strange kind of ceremony; but thus one judges of things when one has not seen
the world. I afterwards learnt that it was to try whether we had concealed any diamonds. This
is the practice established from time immemorial, among civilised nations that scour the seas.
I was informed that the very religious Knights of Malta never fail to make this search when
they take any Turkish prisoners of either sex. It is a law of nations from which they never
deviate.

"I need not tell you how great a hardship it was for a young princess and her mother to be
made slaves and carried to Morocco. You may easily imagine all we had to suffer on board the
pirate vessel. My mother was still very handsome; our maids of honour, and even our waiting
women, had more charms than are to be found in all Africa. As for myself, I was ravishing,
was exquisite, grace itself, and I was a virgin! I did not remain so long; this flower, which
had been reserved for the handsome Prince of Massa Carara, was plucked by the corsair captain.
He was an abominable negro, and yet believed that he did me a great deal of honour. Certainly
the Princess of Palestrina and myself must have been very strong to go through all that we
experienced until our arrival at Morocco. But let us pass on; these are such common things
as not to be worth mentioning.

"Morocco swam in blood when we arrived. Fifty sons of the Emperor Muley-Ismael[11] had each
their adherents; this produced fifty civil wars, of blacks against blacks, and blacks against
tawnies, and tawnies against tawnies, and mulattoes against mulattoes. In short it was a continual
carnage throughout the empire.
