Names of a nautical turn are to be expected for quilts which originate in seaside cottages
and seaport villages. "Bounding Betty," "Ocean Waves," and "Storm at Sea" have a flavour as
salty as the spray which dampens them when they are spread out to sun by the sandy shore.

That poetry and romance have left their mark on the quilt is shown by the names that have been
drawn from these sources. "Lady of the Lake," "Charm," "Air Castle," "Wheel of Fortune," and
"Wonder of the World" are typical examples. Sentimental names are also in evidence, as "Love
Rose," "Lovers' Links," "True Lovers' Knot," "Friendship Quilt," and "Wedding Knot."

Nature furnishes more suggestions for beautiful quilt designs than any other source. So frequently
are her models resorted to by quilt makers the world over that many different designs have
been inspired by the same leaf or flower. The rose especially is used again and again, and
will always be the favourite flower of the quilter. He was an advanced leader in the "program
school," being endowed with considerably more constructive power
than Berlioz, who often fell between two stools: in that while his
subject demanded the freest treatment, he lacked the vigor to break
away from the formal routine of his classic models.

    In Liszt's
    orchestral works,
    however, the
    term "Symphonic
    Poem"--one of
    his own invention--is
    fully justified,
    i.e., they are
    symphonic
    in that they
    have organic
    unity, although
    this is not attained
    by preserving the classic
    number and arrangement
    of themes;
    and they are also
    poetic, being
    not a presentation
    of abstract
    tone patterns, but illustrative of some external idea which shapes
the course of the music entirely to its own needs.[245] The distinguishing
quality of the Symphonic Poem is its unbroken continuity.

Although objective points are reached, and while there are broad
lines of demarcation with reference to the varied moods of the poem
to be illustrated, there are no rigid stops--everything is fused together
into a continuous whole.

    Liszt was an advocate
    of persistent
    development, i.e.,
    the music going
    out into space
    like a straight
    line instead
    of returning on itself. Inner
    evidence shows,
    however, that
    although
    he avoided
    many needless and
    conventional repetitions,
    he could not
    entirely throw overboard
    the cyclical law
    of restatement;
    for there is not one of
    his Symphonic Poems
    which does
    not repeat, at
    the end, thematic
    material already
    heard.
     The names of
many of the quaint varieties that flourish in old-fashioned gardens, as lilacs, phlox, larkspur,
and marigolds, are absent from the list. This is because their lacy foliage and complex arrangement
of petals cannot be reproduced satisfactorily in quilt materials.

Even the lowly vegetables secure some mention among quilt names with "Corn and Beans." The
fruits and trees are well represented, as noted by the following list:

    Apple Hexagon
    Cherry Basket
    California Oak Leaf
    Cypress Leaf
    Christmas Tree
    Fruit Basket
    Grape Basket
    Hickory Leaf
    Imperial Tea
    Indian Plum
    Live Oak Tree
    Little Beech Tree
    Maple Leaf
    May Berry Leaf
    Olive Branch
    Orange Peel
    Oak Leaf and Tulip
    Oak Leaf and Acorns
    Pineapple
    Pine Tree
    Sweet Gum Leaf
    Strawberry
    Tea Leaf
    Tufted Cherry
    Temperance Tree
    Tulip Tree Leaves

The names of birds and insects are almost as popular as those of flowers, as this list will
bear witness:

    Bluebird
    Brown-tailed Moth
    Butterflies
    Bird's Nest
    Crow's Foot
    Chimney Swallows
    Cockscomb
    Dove in the Window
    Duck and Ducklings
    Four Little Birds
    Goose Tracks
    Goose in the Pond
    Honeycomb
    Honeycomb Patch
    Hen and Chickens
    King's Crows
    Peacocks and Flowers
    Spider's Den
    Shoo Fly
    Spider's Web
    Swarm of Bees
    The Two Doves
    Wild Goose Chase

The animals also must be credited with their share of names:

    Bear's Foot
    Bear's Paws
    Bat's Wings
    Bunnies
    Cats and Mice
    Flying Bat
    Four Frogs Quilt
    Leap Frog
    Puss-in-the-Corner
    The Snail's Trail
    Toad in the Puddle
    The Lobster (1812)

Occasionally the quilt maker was honoured by having her name given to her handiwork, as "Mrs.
Morgan's Choice," "Mollie's Choice," "Sarah's Favourite," and "Fanny's Fan." The chief groups of the
pianoforte works are (1) the transcriptions of songs, notably of Schubert and Schumann, and of
operas, particularly of Wagner. In this group should also be included the remarkable arrangement
for solo-pianoforte of all the Beethoven Symphonies. 

The "degrees" are--1. Le lissé, or thread, large or small; 2. Le perlé, or pearl, le soufflet,
or blow; 4. La plume, the feather; 5.

    Le boulet, the
    ball, large
    or small; 6. Le cassé,
    the crack; and, 7. the
    caramel. So complete
    is M. Jarrin's system
    of confectionery, that
    he is "independent
    of every other
    artist;" for he
    even explains
    engraving on
    steel and on wood.
    What a host
    of disappointments
    this must prevent!

If
    we look further
    into, or "drink
    deep" of the art
    of confectionery,
    we shall find it to be
    a perfect Microcosm--a
    little creation; for
    our artist talks
    familiarly of "producing
    picturesque scenery,
    with trees,
    lakes, rocks,
    &c.; gum paste,
    and modelling
    flowers, animals, figures,
    &c." with astonishing
    mimic strife. We must
    abridge one of these
    receipts for a "Rock Piece Montée in a lake."

    "Roll out confectionery
    paste, the size of
    the dish intended
    to receive it;
    put into a mould representing
    your pond a lining
    of almond paste,
    coloured pale pink,
    and place in the centre
    a sort of pedestal
    of almond paste,
    supported by lumps
    of the same
    paste baked; when
    dry put
    it into the
    stove. Prepare
    syrup to fill the
    hollow of the lake,
    to represent the water;
    having previously
    modelled in gum paste
    little swans, place
    them in various parts of
    the syrup; put it
    into the stove
    for three hours, then
    make a small
    hole through the paste,
    under your lake,
    to drain off
    the syrup; a crust
    will remain
    with the swans
    fixed in it, representing
    the water.

Next build the rock on the pedestal with rock sugar, biscuits, and other appropriate articles
in sugar, fixed to one another, supported by the confectionery paste
you have put in the middle, the whole being cemented together with
caramel, and ornamented. This latter design is quite a popular one in the Middle West, where it is
known also as "Star Flower."

Figures and letters come in for some attention, for a few of the designs thus named are quite
artistic. The best known are "Boxed I's," "Capital I," "Double Z," "Four E's," "Fleur-de-Lis,"
"Letter H," "Letter X," and "T Quartette."

Inanimate objects, particularly those about the house, inspired many names for patterns, some
of which are quite appropriate. A number of such names are given here:

    Base Ball
    Basket Quilt
    Block Album
    Brickwork Quilt
    Carpenter's Rule
    Carpenter's Square

    Ice Cream Bowl
    Log Patch
    Log Cabin
    Necktie

Occasionally the wag of the family had his opportunity, for it took some one with a strain
of dry humour to suggest "Old Bachelor's Puzzle," "Drunkard's Path," and "All Tangled Up,"
or to have ironically called one quilt a "Blind Man's Fancy."

Imagination was not lacking when it came to applying apt names to some of the simplest designs.
To have called rows of small triangles running diagonally across a quilt the "Wild Goose Chase,"
the maker must have known something of the habits of wild geese, for as these migrate from
North to South and back again following the summer's warmth, they fly one behind the other
in long V-shaped lines. The resemblance of these lines, swiftly moving across the sky, to her
neat rows of triangles supplied the quilt maker with her inspiration.

Names that are grotesque, or fanciful, or so descriptive that their mention is sure to provoke
a grin, occur with pleasing frequency. Who can help but smile at "Hairpin Catcher," "Hearts
and Gizzards," or "Tangled Garters?" That monarch did nothing for them;--either Nature had not endowed
him with a good appetite, (for what prince ever was perfect,) or he
looked upon them, as, in the last century, we looked upon soups, as
things of hardly any use; but in return they also did nothing for him.

    
    
    It is very remarkable,
    that in France,
    where there
    is but one
    religion, the
    sauces are infinitely
    varied, whilst
    in England, where
    the different
    sects are innumerable,
    there is, we
    may say, but one single sauce.
     Homely and prosaic as their owners,
the following names have a peculiar rugged quality entirely lacking in the fanciful ones given
to their more artistic sisters:

    An Old Patchwork
    Bedtime
    Coarse Woven Patch
    Country Farm
    Crib Quilt
    Crosses and Losses
    Economy
    Home Treasure
    Odds and Ends
    Odd Patchwork
    Old Scrap Patchwork
    Right and Left
    Simple Design
    Swinging Corners
    The Old Homestead
    Twist and Turn
    Twist Patchwork
    Winding Walk
    Workbox

In the old days grown-up folks were not the only ones who had to do with naming the quilts;
children shared in the honour, and many of the quaint and fantastic names were the result of
humouring their fancies. There was no "B'rer Rabbit" in quilt lore, but he was not missed when
the two or three youngsters who cuddled in the old-fashioned trundle bed could have so many
other fascinating names for their quilts. "Four Little Birds," "Ducks and Ducklings," "Children's
Delight," "The Little Red House," "Goose in the Pond," "The House That Jack Built," "Toad in
the Puddle," and "Johnny Around the Corner" are some of the old names still in use to-day.
Any one of these patterns made up into a quilt was a treasure to imaginative children, and
it was doubly so when they could pick out among the tiny blocks bits of colour that were once
in their own gay dresses and pinafores.
