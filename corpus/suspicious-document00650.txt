AUTHOR'S NOTE

The poem "Casey" used in Chapter IX was written by the late Arthur W. Ferguson, formerly Executive
Secretary for the Philippine Government. It has been edited and amplified but is substantially
as written by him. A man of unusual facility, Mr. Ferguson composed the verses under circumstances
somewhat similar to those set down herein, and with like spontaneity.

CHAPTER I

THE FOX

The frosty silence of the snow-mantled hills was rent by the vicious crack of a high-powered,
small-calibered rifle. The hunter sprang from the thicket in which he had lain concealed and
crossed the gully to a knoll where a black furry bundle had dropped to the snow after one convulsive
leap.

Exultant, Terry bent down to examine the silky black coat.

"Right through the ear. Well, Mister Fox, you're mine--though you did lead me a merry chase
for twelve days! You laughed at me till the snow came--knew I wouldn't bring you out of your
hole with formalin, that it was a square game we played. But to-day everything broke against
you, boy,--sun and wind and snow. And perhaps hunger."

The twinge of pain that stabs every true sportsman as he realizes that he has extinguished
a spark of life shadowed Terry's thin, sensitive face. It was a face of singular appeal, dominated
by a queer twist of upper lip that stamped his mouth with a permanent wistfulness. Even in
the bracing cold of the winter morning his skin was white, but the clear pallor was belied
by the swift energy with which he moved and the eager sparkle of his dark gray eyes. He picked
up the fluffy bundle and stroked the sleek fur.

"Hard luck, old boy! But now you'll never be hungry again, or cold. And I haven't hunted you
all this time just for the sake of the sport." His face lighted. "You're going to be a proud
little fox. If foxes have souls--and I don't see why we should deny you what we lay selfish
claims to for ourselves--yours will rejoice in the purpose of your end. Every night and every
morning you--"
