THE PERFECT TRIBUTE

THE PERFECT TRIBUTE

On the morning of November 18, 1863, a special train drew out from Washington, carrying a distinguished
company. The presence with them of the Marine Band from the Navy Yard spoke a public occasion
to come, and among the travellers there were those who might be gathered only for an occasion
of importance. There were judges of the Supreme Court of the United States; there were heads
of departments; the general-in-chief of the army and his staff; members of the cabinet. In
their midst, as they stood about the car before settling for the journey, towered a man sad,
preoccupied, unassuming; a man awkward and ill-dressed; a man, as he leaned slouchingly against
the wall, of no grace of look or manner, in whose haggard face seemed to be the suffering of
the sins of the world. Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, journeyed with his
party to assist at the consecration, the next day, of the national cemetery at Gettysburg.
The quiet November landscape slipped past the rattling train, and the President's deep-set
eyes stared out at it gravely, a bit listlessly. From time to time he talked with those who
were about him; from time to time there were flashes of that quaint wit which is linked, as
his greatness, with his name, but his mind was to-day dispirited, unhopeful. The weight on
his shoulders seemed pressing more heavily than he had courage to press back against it, the
responsibility of one almost a dictator in a wide, war-torn country came near to crushing,
at times, the mere human soul and body. There was, moreover, a speech to be made to-morrow
to thousands who would expect their President to say something to them worth the listening
of a people who were making history; something brilliant, eloquent, strong. The melancholy
gaze glittered with a grim smile. He--Abraham Lincoln--the lad bred in a cabin, tutored in
rough schools here and there, fighting for, snatching at crumbs of learning that fell from
rich tables, struggling to a hard knowledge which well knew its own limitations--it was he
of whom this was expected. He glanced across the car. Edward Everett sat there, the orator
of the following day, the finished gentleman, the careful student, the heir of traditions of
learning and breeding, of scholarly instincts and resources. The self-made President gazed
at him wistfully. From him the people might expect and would get a balanced and polished oration.
For that end he had been born, and inheritance and opportunity and inclination had worked together
for that end's perfection. While Lincoln had wrested from a scanty schooling a command of English
clear and forcible always, but, he feared, rough-hewn, lacking, he feared, in finish and in
breadth--of what use was it for such a one to try to fashion a speech fit to take a place by
the side of Everett's silver sentences? He sighed. Yet the people had a right to the best he
could give, and he would give them his best; at least he could see to it that the words were
real and were short; at least he would not, so, exhaust their patience. And the work might
as well be done now in the leisure of the journey. He put a hand, big, powerful, labor-knotted,
into first one sagging pocket and then another, in search of a pencil, and drew out one broken
across the end. He glanced about inquiringly--there was nothing to write upon. Across the car
the Secretary of State had just opened a package of books and their wrapping of brown paper
lay on the floor, torn carelessly in a zigzag. The President stretched a long arm.

"Mr. Seward, may I have this to do a little writing?" he asked, and the Secretary protested,
insisting on finding better material.

But Lincoln, with few words, had his way, and soon the untidy stump of a pencil was at work
and the great head, the deep-lined face, bent over Seward's bit of brown paper, the whole man
absorbed in his task.

Earnestly, with that "capacity for taking infinite pains" which has been defined as genius,
he labored as the hours flew, building together close-fitted word on word, sentence on sentence.
As the sculptor must dream the statue prisoned in the marble, as the artist must dream the
picture to come from the brilliant unmeaning of his palette, as the musician dreams a song,
so he who writes must have a vision of his finished work before he touches, to begin it, a
medium more elastic, more vivid, more powerful than any other--words--prismatic bits of humanity,
old as the Pharaohs, new as the Arabs of the street, broken, sparkling, alive, from the age-long
life of the race. Abraham Lincoln, with the clear thought in his mind of what he would say,
found the sentences that came to him colorless, wooden. A wonder flashed over him once or twice
of Everett's skill with these symbols which, it seemed to him, were to the Bostonian a key-board
facile to make music, to Lincoln tools to do his labor. He put the idea aside, for it hindered
him. As he found the sword fitted to his hand he must fight with it; it might be that he, as
well as Everett, could say that which should go straight from him to his people, to the nation
who struggled at his back towards a goal. At least each syllable he said should be chiselled
from the rock of his sincerity. So he cut here and there an adjective, here and there a phrase,
baring the heart of his thought, leaving no ribbon or flower of rhetoric to flutter in the
eyes of those with whom he would be utterly honest. And when he had done he read the speech
and dropped it from his hand to the floor and stared again from the window. It was the best
he could do, and it was a failure. So, with the pang of the workman who believes his work done
wrong, he lifted and folded the torn bit of paper and put it in his pocket, and put aside the
thought of it, as of a bad thing which he might not better, and turned and talked cheerfully
with his friends.

At eleven o'clock on the morning of the day following, on November 19, 1863, a vast, silent
multitude billowed, like waves of the sea, over what had been not long before the battle-field
of Gettysburg. There were wounded soldiers there who had beaten their way four months before
through a singing fire across these quiet fields, who had seen the men die who were buried
here; there were troops, grave and responsible, who must soon go again into battle; there were
the rank and file of an everyday American gathering in surging thousands; and above them all,
on the open-air platform, there were the leaders of the land, the pilots who to-day lifted
a hand from the wheel of the ship of state to salute the memory of those gone down in the storm.
Most of the men in that group of honor are now passed over to the majority, but their names
are not dead in American history--great ghosts who walk still in the annals of their country,
their flesh-and-blood faces were turned attentively that bright, still November afternoon towards
the orator of the day, whose voice held the audience.

For two hours Everett spoke and the throng listened untired, fascinated by the dignity of his
high-bred look and manner almost as much, perhaps, as by the speech which has taken a place
in literature. As he had been expected to speak he spoke, of the great battle, of the causes
of the war, of the results to come after. It was an oration which missed no shade of expression,
no reach of grasp. Yet there were those in the multitude, sympathetic to a unit as it was with
the Northern cause, who grew restless when this man who had been crowned with so thick a laurel
wreath by Americans spoke of Americans as rebels, of a cause for which honest Americans were
giving their lives as a crime. The days were war days, and men's passions were inflamed, yet
there were men who listened to Edward Everett who believed that his great speech would have
been greater unenforced with bitterness.

As the clear, cultivated voice fell into silence, the mass of people burst into a long storm
of applause, for they knew that they had heard an oration which was an event. They clapped
and cheered him again and again and again, as good citizens acclaim a man worthy of honor whom
they have delighted to honor. At last, as the ex-Governor of Massachusetts, the ex-ambassador
to England, the ex-Secretary of State, the ex-Senator of the United States--handsome, distinguished,
graceful, sure of voice and of movement--took his seat, a tall, gaunt figure detached itself
from the group on the platform and slouched slowly across the open space and stood facing the
audience. A stir and a whisper brushed over the field of humanity, as if a breeze had rippled
a monstrous bed of poppies. This was the President. A quivering silence settled down and every
eye was wide to watch this strange, disappointing appearance, every ear alert to catch the
first sound of his voice. Suddenly the voice came, in a queer, squeaking falsetto. The effect
on the audience was irrepressible, ghastly. After Everett's deep tones, after the strain of
expectancy, this extraordinary, gaunt apparition, this high, thin sound from the huge body,
were too much for the American crowd's sense of humor, always stronger than its sense of reverence.
A suppressed yet unmistakable titter caught the throng, ran through it, and was gone. Yet no
one who knew the President's face could doubt that he had heard it and had understood. Calmly
enough, after a pause almost too slight to be recognized, he went on, and in a dozen words
his tones had gathered volume, he had come to his power and dignity. There was no smile now
on any face of those who listened. People stopped breathing rather, as if they feared to miss
an inflection. A loose-hung figure, six feet four inches high, he towered above them, conscious
of and quietly ignoring the bad first impression, unconscious of a charm of personality which
reversed that impression within a sentence. That these were his people was his only thought.
He had something to say to them; what did it matter about him or his voice?

There was no sound from the silent, vast assembly. The President's large figure stood before
them, at first inspired, glorified with the thrill and swing of his words, lapsing slowly in
the stillness into lax, ungraceful lines. He stared at them a moment with sad eyes full of
gentleness, of resignation, and in the deep quiet they stared at him. Not a hand was lifted
in applause. Slowly the big, awkward man slouched back across the platform and sank into his
seat, and yet there was no sound of approval, of recognition from the audience; only a long
sigh ran like a ripple on an ocean through rank after rank. In Lincoln's heart a throb of pain
answered it. His speech had been, as he feared it would be, a failure. As he gazed steadily
at these his countrymen who would not give him even a little perfunctory applause for his best
effort, he knew that the disappointment of it cut into his soul. And then he was aware that
there was music, the choir was singing a dirge; his part was done, and his part had failed.

When the ceremonies were over Everett at once found the President. "Mr. President," he began,
"your speech--" but Lincoln had interrupted, flashing a kindly smile down at him, laying a
hand on his shoulder.

"We'll manage not to talk about my speech, Mr. Everett," he said. "This isn't the first time
I've felt that my dignity ought not to permit me to be a public speaker."

He went on in a few cordial sentences to pay tribute to the orator of the occasion.

The special train which left Gettysburg immediately after the solemnities on the battle-field
cemetery brought the President's party into Washington during the night. There was no rest
for the man at the wheel of the nation next day, but rather added work until, at about four
in the afternoon, he felt sorely the need of air and went out from the White House alone, for
a walk. His mind still ran on the events of the day before--the impressive, quiet multitude,
the serene sky of November arched, in the hushed interregnum of the year, between the joy of
summer and the war of winter, over those who had gone from earthly war to heavenly joy. The
picture was deeply engraved in his memory; it haunted him. And with it came a soreness, a discomfort
of mind which had haunted him as well in the hours between--the chagrin of the failure of his
speech. During the day he had gently but decisively put aside all reference to it from those
about him; he had glanced at the head-lines in the newspapers with a sarcastic smile; the Chief
Executive must he flattered, of course; newspaper notices meant nothing. He knew well that
he had made many successful speeches; no man of his shrewdness could be ignorant that again
and again he had carried an audience by storm; yet he had no high idea of his own speech-making,
and yesterday's affair had shaken his confidence more. He remembered sadly that, even for the
President, no hand, no voice had been lifted in applause.

"It must have been pretty poor stuff," he said half aloud; "yet I thought it was a fair little
composition. I meant to do well by them."

His long strides had carried him into the outskirts of the city, and suddenly, at a corner,
from behind a hedge, a young boy of fifteen years or so came rushing toward him and tripped
and stumbled against him, and Lincoln kept him from falling with a quick, vigorous arm. The
lad righted himself and tossed back his thick, light hair and stared haughtily, and the President,
regarding him, saw that his blue eyes were blind with tears.

"Do you want all of the public highway? Can't a gentleman from the South even walk in the streets
without--without--" and the broken sentence ended in a sob.

The anger and the insolence of the lad were nothing to the man who towered above him--to that
broad mind this was but a child in trouble. "My boy, the fellow that's interfering with your
walking is down inside of you," he said gently, and with that the astonished youngster opened
his wet eyes wide and laughed--a choking, childish laugh that pulled at the older man's heart-strings.
"That's better, sonny," he said, and patted the slim shoulder. "Now tell me what's wrong with
the world. Maybe I might help straighten it."

"Wrong, wrong!" the child raved; "everything's wrong," and launched into a mad tirade against
the government from the President down.

Lincoln listened patiently, and when the lad paused for breath, "Go ahead," he said good-naturedly.
"Every little helps."

With that the youngster was silent and drew himself up with stiff dignity, offended yet fascinated;
unable to tear himself away from this strange giant who was so insultingly kind under his abuse,
who yet inspired him with such a sense of trust and of hope.

"I want a lawyer," he said impulsively, looking up anxiously into the deep-lined face inches
above him. "I don't know where to find a lawyer in this horrible city, and I must have one--I
can't wait--it may be too late--I want a lawyer now" and once more he was in a fever of excitement.

"What do you want with a lawyer?" Again the calm, friendly tone quieted him.

"I want him to draw a will. My brother is--" he caught his breath with a gasp in a desperate
effort for self-control. "They say he's--dying." He finished the sentence with a quiver in
his voice, and the brave front and the trembling, childish tone went to the man's heart. "I
don't believe it--he can't be dying," the boy talked on, gathering courage. "But anyway, he
wants to make a will, and--and I reckon--it may be that he--he must."

"I see," the other answered gravely, and the young, torn soul felt an unreasoning confidence
that he had found a friend. "Where is your brother?"

"He's in the prison hospital there--in that big building," he pointed down the street. "He's
captain in our army--in the Confederate army. He was wounded at Gettysburg."

"Oh!" The deep-set eyes gazed down at the fresh face, its muscles straining under grief and
responsibility, with the gentlest, most fatherly pity. "I think I can manage your job, my boy,"
he said. "I used to practise law in a small way myself, and I'll be glad to draw the will for you."

The young fellow had whirled him around before he had finished the sentence. "Come," he said.
"Don't waste time talking--why didn't you tell me before?" and then he glanced up. He saw the
ill-fitting clothes, the crag-like, rough-modelled head, the awkward carriage of the man; he
was too young to know that what he felt beyond these was greatness. There was a tone of patronage
in his voice and in the cock of his aristocratic young head as he spoke. "We can pay you, you
know--we're not paupers." He fixed his eyes on Lincoln's face to watch the impression as he
added, "My brother is Carter Hampton Blair, of Georgia. I'm Warrington Blair. The Hampton Court
Blairs, you know."

"Oh!" said the President.

The lad went on:

"It would have been all right if Nellie hadn't left Washington to-day--my sister, Miss Eleanor
Hampton Blair. Carter was better this morning, and so she went with the Senator. She's secretary
to Senator Warrington, you know. He's on the Yankee side"--the tone was full of contempt--"but
yet he's our cousin, and when he offered Nellie the position she would take it in spite of
Carter and me. We were so poor"--the lad's pride was off its guard for the moment, melted in
the soothing trust with which this stranger thrilled his soul. It was a relief to him to talk,
and the large hand which rested on his shoulder as they walked seemed an assurance that his
words were accorded respect and understanding. "Of course, if Nellie had been here she would
have known how to get a lawyer, but Carter had a bad turn half an hour ago, and the doctor
said he might get better or he might die any minute, and Carter remembered about the money,
and got so excited that they said it was hurting him, so I said I'd get a lawyer, and I rushed
out, and the first thing I ran against you. I'm afraid I wasn't very polite." The smile on
the gaunt face above him was all the answer he needed. "I'm sorry. I apologize. It certainly
was good of you to come right back with me." The child's manner was full of the assured graciousness
of a high-born gentleman; there was a lovable quality in his very patronage, and the suffering
and the sweetness and the pride combined held Lincoln by his sense of humor as well as by his
soft heart. "You sha'n't lose anything by it," the youngster went on. "We may be poor, but
we have more than plenty to pay you, I'm sure. Nellie has some jewels, you see--oh, I think
several things yet. Is it very expensive to draw a will?" he asked wistfully.

"No, sonny; it's one of the cheapest things a man can do," was the hurried answer, and the
child's tone showed a lighter heart.

"I'm glad of that, for, of course, Carter wants to leave--to leave as much as he can. You see,
that's what the will is about--Carter is engaged to marry Miss Sally Maxfield, and they would
have been married now if he hadn't been wounded and taken prisoner. So, of course, like any
gentleman that's engaged, he wants to give her everything that he has. Hampton Court has to
come to me after Carter, but there's some money--quite a lot--only we can't get it now. And
that ought to go to Carter's wife, which is what she is--just about--and if he doesn't make
a will it won't. It will come to Nellie and me if--if anything should happen to Carter."

"So you're worrying for fear you'll inherit some money?" Lincoln asked meditatively.

"Of course," the boy threw back impatiently. "Of course, it would be a shame if it came to
Nellie and me, for we couldn't ever make her take it. We don't need it--I can look after Nellie
and myself," he said proudly, with a quick, tossing motion of his fair head that was like the
motion of a spirited, thoroughbred horse. They had arrived at the prison. "I can get you through
all right. They all know me here," he spoke over his shoulder reassuringly to the President
with a friendly glance. Dashing down the corridors in front, he did not see the guards salute
the tall figure which followed him; too preoccupied to wonder at the ease of their entrance,
he flew along through the big building, and behind him in large strides came his friend.

A young man--almost a boy, too--of twenty-three or twenty-four, his handsome face a white shadow,
lay propped against the pillows, watching the door eagerly as they entered.

"Good boy, Warry," he greeted the little fellow; "you've got me a lawyer," and the pale features
lighted with a smile of such radiance as seemed incongruous in this gruesome place. He held
out his hand to the man who swung toward him, looming mountainous behind his brother's slight
figure. "Thank you for coming," he said cordially, and in his tone was the same air of a grand
seigneur as in the lad's. Suddenly a spasm of pain caught him, his head fell into the pillows,
his muscles twisted, his arm about the neck of the kneeling boy tightened convulsively. Yet
while the agony still held him he was smiling again with gay courage. "It nearly blew me away,"
he whispered, his voice shaking, but his eyes bright with amusement. "We'd better get to work
before one of those little breezes carries me too far. There's pen and ink on the table, Mr.--my
brother did not tell me your name."

"Your brother and I met informally," the other answered, setting the materials in order for
writing. "He charged into me like a young steer," and the boy, out of his deep trouble, laughed
delightedly. "My name is Lincoln."

The young officer regarded him. "That's a good name from your standpoint--you are, I take it,
a Northerner?"

The deep eyes smiled whimsically. "I'm on that side of the fence. You may call me a Yankee
if you'd like."

"There's something about you, Mr. Lincoln," the young Georgian answered gravely, with a kindly
and unconscious condescension, "which makes me wish to call you, if I may, a friend."

He had that happy instinct which shapes a sentence to fall on its smoothest surface, and the
President, in whom the same instinct was strong, felt a quick comradeship with this enemy who,
about to die, saluted him. He put out his great fist swiftly. "Shake hands," he said. "Friends
it is."

"'Till death us do part,'" said the officer slowly, and smiled, and then threw back his head
with a gesture like the boy's. "We must do the will," he said peremptorily.

"Yes, now we'll fix this will business, Captain Blair," the big man answered cheerfully. "When
your mind's relieved about your plunder you can rest easier and get well faster."

The sweet, brilliant smile of the Southerner shone out, his arm drew the boy's shoulder closer,
and the President, with a pang, knew that his friend knew that he must die.

With direct, condensed question and clear answer the simple will was shortly drawn and the
impromptu lawyer rose to take his leave. But the wounded man put out his hand.

"Don't go yet," he pleaded, with the imperious, winning accent which was characteristic of
both brothers. The sudden, radiant smile broke again over the face, young, drawn with suffering,
prophetic of close death. "I like you," he brought out frankly. "I've never liked a stranger
as much in such short order before."

His head, fair as the boy's, lay back on the pillows, locks of hair damp against the whiteness,
the blue eyes shone like jewels from the colorless face, a weak arm stretched protectingly
about the young brother who pressed against him. There was so much courage, so much helplessness,
so much pathos in the picture that the President's great heart throbbed with a desire to comfort
them.

"I want to talk to you about that man Lincoln, your namesake," the prisoner's deep, uncertain
voice went on, trying pathetically to make conversation which might interest, might hold his
guest. The man who stood hesitating controlled a startled movement. "I'm Southern to the core
of me, and I believe with my soul in the cause I've fought for, the cause I'm--" he stopped,
and his hand caressed the boy's shoulder. "But that President of yours is a remarkable man.
He's regarded as a red devil by most of us down home, you know," and he laughed, "but I've
admired him all along. He's inspired by principle, not by animosity, in this fight; he's real
and he's powerful and"--he lifted his head impetuously and his eyes flashed--"and, by Jove,
have you read his speech of yesterday in the papers?"

Lincoln gave him an odd look. "No," he said, "I haven't."

"Sit down," Blair commanded. "Don't grudge a few minutes to a man in hard luck. I want to tell
you about that speech. You're not so busy but that you ought to know."

"Well, yes," said Lincoln, "perhaps I ought." He took out his watch and made a quick mental
calculation. "It's only a question of going without my dinner, and the boy is dying," he thought.
"If I can give him a little pleasure the dinner is a small matter." He spoke again. "It's the
soldiers who are the busy men, not the lawyers, nowadays," he said. "I'll be delighted to spend
a half hour with you, Captain Blair, if I won't tire you."

"That's good of you," the young officer said, and a king on his throne could not have been
gracious in a more lordly yet unconscious way. "By the way, this great man isn't any relation
of yours, is he, Mr. Lincoln?"

"He's a kind of connection--through my grandfather," Lincoln acknowledged. "But I know just
the sort of fellow he is--you can say what you want."

"What I want to say first is this: that he yesterday made one of the great speeches of history."

"What?" demanded Lincoln, staring.

"I know what I'm talking about." The young fellow brought his thin fist down on the bedclothes.
"My father was a speaker--all my uncles and my grandfather were speakers. I've been brought
up on oratory. I've studied and read the best models since I was a lad in knee-breeches. And
I know a great speech when I see it. And when Nellie--my sister--brought in the paper this
morning and read that to me I told her at once that not six times since history began has a
speech been made which was its equal. That was before she told me what the Senator said."

"What did the Senator say?" asked the quiet man who listened.

"It was Senator Warrington, to whom my sister is--is acting as secretary." The explanation
was distasteful, but he went on, carried past the jog by the interest of his story. "He was
at Gettysburg yesterday, with the President's party. He told my sister that the speech so went
home to the hearts of all those thousands of people that when it was ended it was as if the
whole audience held its breath--there was not a hand lifted to applaud. One might as well applaud
the Lord's Prayer--it would have been sacrilege. And they all felt it--down to the lowest.
There was a long minute of reverent silence, no sound from all that great throng--it seems
to me, an enemy, that it was the most perfect tribute that has ever been paid by any people
to any orator."

The boy, lifting his hand from his brother's shoulder to mark the effect of his brother's words,
saw with surprise that in the strange lawyer's eyes were tears. But the wounded man did not notice.

"It will live, that speech. Fifty years from now American schoolboys will be learning it as
part of their education. It is not merely my opinion," he went on. "Warrington says the whole
country is ringing with it. And you haven't read it? And your name's Lincoln? Warry, boy, where's
the paper Nellie left? I'll read the speech to Mr. Lincoln myself."

The boy had sprung to his feet and across the room, and had lifted a folded newspaper from
the table. "Let me read it, Carter--it might tire you."

The giant figure which had crouched, elbows on knees, in the shadows by the narrow hospital
cot, heaved itself slowly upward till it loomed at its full height in air. Lincoln turned his
face toward the boy standing under the flickering gas-jet and reading with soft, sliding inflections
the words which had for twenty-four hours been gall and wormwood to his memory. And as the
sentences slipped from the lad's mouth, behold, a miracle happened, for the man who had written
them knew that they were great. He knew then, as many a lesser one has known, that out of a
little loving-kindness had come great joy; that he had wrested with gentleness a blessing from
his enemy.

"'Fourscore and seven years ago,'" the fresh voice began, and the face of the dying man stood
out white in the white pillows, sharp with eagerness, and the face of the President shone as
he listened as if to new words. The field of yesterday, the speech, the deep silence which
followed it, all were illuminated, as his mind went back, with new meaning. With the realization
that the stillness had meant, not indifference, but perhaps, as this generous enemy had said,
"The most perfect tribute ever paid by any people to any orator," there came to him a rush
of glad strength to bear the burdens of the nation.

There was deep stillness in the hospital ward as there had been stillness on the field of Gettysburg.
The soldier's voice broke it. "It's a wonderful speech," he said. "There's nothing finer. Other
men have spoken stirring words, for the North and for the South, but never before, I think,
with the love of both breathing through them. It is only the greatest who can be a partisan
without bitterness, and only such to-day may call himself not Northern or Southern, but American.
To feel that your enemy can fight you to death without malice, with charity--it lifts country,
it lifts humanity to something worth dying for. They are beautiful, broad words and the sting
of war would be drawn if the soul of Lincoln could be breathed into the armies. Do you agree
with me?" he demanded abruptly, and Lincoln answered slowly, from a happy heart.

"I believe it is a good speech," he said.

The impetuous Southerner went on: "Of course, it's all wrong from my point of view," and the
gentleness of his look made the words charming. "The thought which underlies it is warped,
inverted, as I look at it, yet that doesn't alter my admiration of the man and of his words.
I'd like to put my hand in his before I die," he said, and the sudden, brilliant, sweet smile
lit the transparency of his face like a lamp; "and I'd like to tell him that I know that what
we're all fighting for, the best of us, is the right of our country as it is given us to see
it." He was laboring a bit with the words now as if he were tired, but he hushed the boy imperiously.
"When a man gets so close to death's door that he feels the wind through it from a larger atmosphere,
then the small things are blown away. The bitterness of the fight has faded for me. I only
feel the love of country, the satisfaction of giving my life for it. The speech--that speech--has
made it look higher and simpler--your side as well as ours. I would like to put my hand in
Abraham Lincoln's--"

The clear, deep voice, with its hesitations, its catch of weakness, stopped short. Convulsively
the hand shot out and caught at the great fingers that hung near him, pulling the President,
with the strength of agony, to his knees by the cot. The prisoner was writhing in an attack
of mortal pain, while he held, unknowing that he held it, the hand of his new friend in a torturing
grip. The door of death had opened wide and a stormy wind was carrying the bright, conquered
spirit into that larger atmosphere of which he had spoken. Suddenly the struggle ceased, the
unconscious head rested in the boy's arms, and the hand of the Southern soldier lay quiet,
where he had wished to place it, in the hand of Abraham Lincoln.
