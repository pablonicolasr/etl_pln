THE MARRIAGE OF ELINOR.

CHAPTER I.

John Tatham, barrister-at-law, received one summer morning as he sat at breakfast the following
letter. It was written in what was once known distinctively as a lady's hand, in pointed characters,
very fine and delicate, and was to this effect:--

"DEAR JOHN, Have you heard from Elinor of her new prospects and intentions? I suppose she must
have written to you on the subject. Do you know anything of the man?... You know how hard it
is to convince her against her will of anything, and also how poorly gifted I am with the power
of convincing any one. And I don't know him, therefore can speak with no authority. If you
can do anything to clear things up, come and do so. I am very anxious and more than doubtful;
but her heart seems set upon it.

"Your affect. "M. S. D."

Mr. Tatham was a well-built and vigorous man of five-and-thirty, with health, good behaviour,
and well-being in every line of his cheerful countenance and every close curl of his brown
hair. His hair was very curly, and helped to give him the cheerful look which was one of his
chief characteristics. Nevertheless, when these innocent seeming words, "Do you know the man?"
which was more certainly demonstrative of certain facts than had those facts been stated in
the fullest detail, met his eye, Mr. Tatham paused and laid down the letter with a start. His
ruddy colour paled for the moment, and he felt something which was like the push or poke of
a blunt but heavy weapon somewhere in the regions of the heart. For the moment he felt that
he could not read any more. "Do you know the man?" He did not even ask what man in the momentary
sickness of his heart. Then he said to himself, almost angrily, "Well!" and took up the letter
again and read to the end.

Well! of course it was a thing that he knew might happen any day, and which he had expected
to happen for the last four or five years. It was nothing to him one way or another. Nothing
could be more absurd than that a hearty and strong young man in the full tide of his life and
with a good breakfast before him should receive a shock from that innocent little letter as
if he had been a sentimental woman. But the fact is that he pushed his plate away with an exclamation
of disgust and a feeling that everything was bad and uneatable. He drank his tea, though that
also became suddenly bad too, full of tannin, like tea that has stood too long, a thing about
which John was very particular. He had been half an hour later than usual this morning consequent
on having been an hour or two later than usual last night. These things have their reward,
and that very speedily; but as for the letter, what could that have to do with the bad toasting
of the bacon and the tannin in the tea? "Do you know the man?" There was a sort of covert insult,
too, in the phraseology, as if no explanation was needed, as if he must know by instinct what
she meant--he who knew nothing about it, who did not know there was a man at all!

After a while he began to smile rather cynically to himself. He had got up from the breakfast
table, where everything was so bad, and had gone to look out of one of the windows of his pleasant
sitting-room. It was in one of the wider ways of the Temple, and looked out upon various houses
with a pleasant misty light upon the redness of their old brickwork, and a stretch of green
grass and trees, which were scanty in foliage, yet suited very well with the bright morning
sun, which was not particularly warm, but looked as if it were a good deal for effect and not
so very much for use. That thought floated across his mind with others, and was of the same
cynical complexion. It was very well for the sun to shine, making the glistening poplars and
plane-trees glow, and warming all the mellow redness of the old houses, but what did he mean
by it? No warmth to speak of, only a fictitious gleam--a thing got up for effect. And so was
the affectionateness of woman--meaning nothing, only an effect of warmth and geniality, nothing
beyond that. As a matter of fact, he reminded himself after a while that he had never wanted
anything beyond, neither asked for it, nor wished it. He had no desire to change the conditions
of his life: women never rested till they had done so, manufacturing a new event, whatever
it might be, pleased even when they were not pleased, to have a novelty to announce. That,
no doubt, was the state of mind in which the lady who called herself his aunt was: pleased
to have something to tell him, to fire off her big guns in his face, even though she was not
at all pleased with the event itself. But John Tatham, on the other hand, had desired nothing
to happen; things were very well as they were. He liked to have a place where he could run
down from Saturday to Monday whenever he pleased, and where his visit was always a cheerful
event for the womankind. He had liked to take them all the news, to carry the picture-papers,
quite a load; to take down a new book for Elinor; to taste doubtfully his aunt's wine, and
tell her she had better let him choose it for her. It was a very pleasant state of affairs:
he wanted no change; not, certainly, above everything, the intrusion of a stranger whose very
existence had been unknown to him until he was thus asked cynically, almost brutally, "Do you
know the man?"

The hour came when John had to assume the costume of that order of workers whom a persistent
popular joke nicknames the "Devil's Own:"--that is, he had to put on gown and wig and go off
to the courts, where he was envied of all the briefless as a man who for his age had a great
deal to do. He "devilled" for Mr. Asstewt, the great Chancery man, which was the most excellent
beginning: and he was getting into a little practice of his own which was not to be sneezed
at. But he did not find himself in a satisfactory frame of mind to-day. He found himself asking
the judge, "Do you know anything of the man?" when it was his special business so to bewilder
that potentate with elaborate arguments that he should not have time to consider whether he
had ever heard of the particular man before him. Thus it was evident that Mr. Tatham was completely
hors de son assiette, as the French say; upset and "out of it," according to the equally vivid
imagination of the English manufacturer of slang. John Tatham was a very capable young lawyer
on ordinary occasions, and it was all the more remarkable that he should have been so confused
in his mind to-day.

When he went back to his chambers in the evening, which was not until it was time to dress
for dinner, he saw a bulky letter lying on his table, but avoided it as if it had been an overdue
bill. He was engaged to dine out, and had not much time: yet all the way, as he drove along
the streets, just as sunset was over and a subduing shade came over the light, and that half-holiday
look that comes with evening--he kept thinking of the fat letter upon his table. Do you know
anything of the man? That would no longer be the refrain of his correspondent, but some absurd
strain of devotion and admiration of the man whom John knew nothing of, not even his name.
He wondered as he went along in his hansom, and even between the courses at dinner, while he
listened with a smile, but without hearing a word, to what the lady next him was saying--what
she would tell him about this man? That he was everything that was delightful, no doubt; handsome,
of course; probably clever; and that she was fond of him, confound the fellow! Elinor! to think
that she should come to that--a girl like her--to tell him, as if she was saying that she had
caught a cold or received a present, that she was in love with a man! Good heavens! when one
had thought her so much above anything of that kind--a woman, above all women that ever were.

"Not so much as that," John said to himself as he walked home. He always preferred to walk
home in the evening, and he was not going to change his habit now out of any curiosity about
Elinor's letter. Oh, not so much as that! not above all women, or better than the rest, perhaps--but
different. He could not quite explain to himself how, except that he had always known her to
be Elinor and not another, which was a quite sufficient explanation. And now it appeared that
she was not different, although she would still profess to be Elinor--a curious puzzle, which
his brain in its excited state was scarcely able to tackle. His thoughts got somewhat confused
and broken as he approached his chambers. He was so near the letter now--a few minutes and
he would no longer need to wonder or speculate about it, but would know exactly what she said.
He turned and stood for a minute or so at the Temple gates, looking out upon the busy Strand.
It was still as lovely as a summer night could be overhead, but down here it was--well, it
was London, which is another thing. The usual crowd was streaming by, coming into bright light
as it streamed past a brilliant shop window, then in the shade for another moment, and emerging
again. The faces that were suddenly lit up as they passed--some handsome faces, pale in the
light; some with heads hung down, either in bad health or bad humour; some full of cares and
troubles, others airy and gay--caught his attention. Did any of them all know anything of this
man, he wondered--knowing how absurd a question it was. Had any of them written to-day a letter
full of explanations, of a matter that could not be explained? There were faces with far more
tragic meaning in them than could be so easily explained as that--the faces of men, alas! and
women too, who were going to destruction as fast as their hurrying feet could carry them; or
else were languidly drifting no one knew where--out of life altogether, out of all that was
good in life. John Tatham knew this very well too, and had it in him to do anything a man could
to stop the wanderers in their downward career. But to-night he was thinking of none of these
things. He was only wondering how she would explain it, how she could explain it, what she
would say; and lingering to prolong his suspense, not to know too soon what it was.

At last, however, as there is no delay but must come to an end one time or another, he found
himself at last in his room, in his smoking-coat and slippers, divested of his stiff collar--at
his ease, the windows open upon the quiet of the Temple Gardens, a little fresh air breathing
in. He had taken all this trouble to secure ease for himself, to put off a little the reading
of the letter. Now the moment had come when it would be absurd to delay any longer. It was
so natural to see her familiar handwriting--not a lady's hand, angular and pointed, like her
mother's, but the handwriting of her generation, which looks as if it were full of character,
until one perceives that it is the writing of the generation, and all the girls and boys write
much the same. He took time for this reflection still as he tore open the envelope. There were
two sheets very well filled, and written in at the corners, so that no available spot was lost.
"My dear old John," were the first words he saw. He put down the letter and thought over the
address. Well, she had always called him so. He was old John when he was fourteen, to little
Elinor. They had always known each other like that--like brother and sister. But not particularly
like brother and sister--like cousins twice removed, which is a more interesting tie in some
particulars. And now for the letter.

"MY DEAR OLD JOHN: I want to tell you myself of a great thing that has happened to me--the
very greatest thing that could happen in one's life. Oh, John, dear old John, I feel as if
I had nobody else I could open my heart to; for mamma--well, mamma is mamma, a dear mother
and a good one; but you know she has her own ways of thinking----"

He put down the letter again with a rueful little laugh. "And have not I my own ways of thinking,
too?" he said to himself.

"Jack dear," continued the letter, "you must give me your sympathy, all your sympathy. You
never were in love, I suppose (oh, what an odious way that is of putting it! but it spares
one's feelings a little, for even in writing it is too tremendous a thing to say quite gravely
and seriously, as one feels it). Dear John, I know you never were in love, or you would have
told me; but still----"

"Oh," he said to himself, with the merest suspicion of a little quiver in his lip, which might,
of course, have been a laugh, but, on the other hand, might have been something else, "I never
was--or I would have told her--That's the way she looks at it." Then he took up the letter again.

"Because--I see nothing but persecution before me. It was only a week ago that it happened,
and we wanted to keep it quiet for a time; but things get out in spite of all one can do--things
of that sort, at least. And, oh, dear Jack, fancy! I have got three letters already, all warning
me against him; raking up trifling things that have occurred long ago, long before he met me,
and holding them up before me like scarecrows--telling me he is not worthy of me, and that
I will be wretched if I marry him, and other dreadful lies like that, which show me quite plainly
that they neither know him nor me, and that they haven't eyes to see what he really is, nor
minds to understand. But though I see the folly of it and the wickedness of it, mamma does
not. She is ready to take other people's words; indeed, there is this to be said for her, that
she does not know him yet, and therefore cannot be expected to be ready to take his own word
before all. Dear Jack, my heart is so full, and I have so much to tell you, and such perfect
confidence in your sympathy, and also in your insight and capacity to see through all the lies
and wicked stories which I foresee are going to be poured upon us like a flood that--I don't
know how to begin, I have so many things to say. I know it is the heart of the season, and
that you are asked out every night in the week, and are so popular everywhere; but if you could
but come down from Saturday to Monday, and let me tell you everything and show you his picture,
and read you parts of his letters, I know you would see how false and wrong it all is, and
help me to face it out with all those horrid people, and to bring round mamma. You know her
dreadful way of never giving an opinion, but just saying a great deal worse, and leaving you
to your own responsibility, which nearly drives me mad even in little things--so you may suppose
what it does in this. Of course, she must see him, which is all I want, for I know after she
has had a half-hour's conversation with him that she will be like me and will not believe a
word--not one word. Therefore, Jack dear, come, oh, come! I have always turned to you in my
difficulties, since ever I have known what it was to have a difficulty, and you have done everything
for me. I never remember any trouble I ever had but you found some means of clearing it away.
Therefore my whole hope is in you. I know it is hard to give up all your parties and things;
but it would only be two nights, after all--Saturday and Sunday. Oh, do come, do come, if you
ever cared the least little bit for your poor cousin! Come, oh, come, dear old John!

"Your affect. "E------."

"Is that all?" he said to himself; but it was not all, for there followed a postscript all
about the gifts and graces of the unknown lover, and how he was the victim of circumstances,
and how, while other men might steal the horse, he dared not look over the wall, and other
convincing pleadings such as these, till John's head began to go round. When he had got through
this postscript John Tatham folded the letter and put it away. He had a smile on his face,
but he had the air of a man who had been beaten about the head and was confused with the hurry
and storm of the blows. She had always turned to him in all her difficulties, that was true:
and he had always stood by her, and often, in the freemasonry of youth, had thought her right
and vindicated her capacity to judge for herself. He had been called often on this errand,
and he had never refused to obey. He had come to her aid many a time. But he had never thought
to be called upon by her in such a way as this. He folded the letter up carefully and put it
in a drawer. Usually when he had a letter from Elinor he put it into his pocket, for the satisfaction
of reading it over again: for she had a fantastic way of writing, adding little postscripts
which escaped the eye at first, and which it was pleasant to find out afterwards. But with
this letter he did not do so. He put it in a drawer of his writing-table, so that he might
find it again when necessary, but he did not put it in his breast pocket. And then he sat for
some time doing nothing, looking before him, with his legs stretched out and his hand beating
a little tattoo upon the table. "Well: well? well!" That was about what he said to himself,
but it meant a great deal: it meant a vague but great disappointment, a sort of blank and vacuum
expressed by the first of these words--and then it meant a question of great importance and
many divisions. How could it ever have come to anything? Am I a man to marry? What could I
have done, just getting into practice, just getting a few pounds to spend for myself? And then
came the conclusion. Since I can't do anything else for her; since she's done it for herself--shall
I be a beast and not help her, because it puts my own nose out of joint? Not a bit of it! The
reader must remember that in venturing to reflect a young man's sentiments a dignified style
is scarcely possible; they express themselves sometimes with much force in their private moments,
but not as Dr. Johnson would have approved, or with any sense of elegance; and one must try
to be truthful to nature. He knew very well that Elinor was not responsible for his disappointment,
and even he was aware that if she had been so foolish as to fix her hopes upon him, it would
probably have been she who would have been disappointed, and left in the lurch. But still----

John had gone through an interminable amount of thinking, and a good deal of soda-water (with
or without, how should I know, some other moderate ingredient), and a cigar or two--not to
speak of certain hours when he ought to have been in bed to keep his head clear for the cases
of to-morrow: when it suddenly flashed upon him all at once that he was not a step further
on than when he had received Mrs. Dennistoun's letter in the morning, for Elinor, though she
had said so much about him, had given no indication who her lover was. Who was the man?

CHAPTER II.

It was a blustering afternoon when John, with his bag in his hand, set out from the station
at Hurrymere for Mrs. Dennistoun's cottage. Why that station should have had "mere" in its
name I have never been able to divine, for there is no water to be seen for miles, scarcely
so much as a duckpond: but, perhaps, there are two meanings to the words. It was a steep walk
up a succession of slopes, and the name of the one upon which the cottage stood was Windyhill
not an encouraging title on such a day, but true enough to the character of the place. The
cottage lay, however, at the head of a combe or shelving irregular valley, just sheltered from
the winds on a little platform of its own, and commanding a view which was delightful in its
long sweeping distance, and varied enough to be called picturesque, especially by those who
were familiar with nothing higher than the swelling slopes of the Surrey hills. It was wild,
little cultivated, save in the emerald green of the bottom, a few fields which lay where a
stream ought to have been. Nowadays there are red-roofed houses peeping out at every corner,
but at that period fashion had not even heard of Hurrymere, and, save for a farm-house or two,
a village alehouse and posting-house at a corner of the high-road, and one or two great houses
within the circuit of six or seven miles, retired within their trees and parks, there were
few habitations. Mrs. Dennistoun's cottage was red-roofed like the rest, but much subdued by
lichens, and its walls were covered by climbing plants, so that it struck no bold note upon
the wild landscape, yet was visible afar off in glimpses, from the much-winding road, for a
mile or two before it could be come at. There was, indeed, a nearer way, necessitating a sharp
scramble, but when John came just in sight of the house his heart failed him a little, and,
notwithstanding that his bag had come to feel very heavy by this time, he deliberately chose
the longer round to gain a little time--as we all do sometimes, when we are most anxious to
be at our journey's end, and hear what has to be told us. It looked very peaceful seated in
that fold of the hill, no tossing of trees about it, though a little higher up the slim oaks
and beeches of the copse were flinging themselves about against the grey sky in a kind of agonised
appeal. John liked the sound of the wind sweeping over the hills, rending the trees, and filling
the horizon as with a crowd of shadows in pain, twisting and bending with every fresh sweep
of the breeze. Sometimes such sounds and sights give a relief to the mind. He liked it better
than if all had been undisturbed, lying in afternoon quiet as might have been expected at the
crown of the year--but the winds had always to be taken into account at Windyhill.

When he came in sight of the gate, John was aware of some one waiting for him, walking up and
down the sandy road into which it opened. Her face was turned the other way, and she evidently
looked for him by way of the combe, the scrambling steep road which he had avoided in despite:
for why should he scramble and make himself hot in order to hear ten minutes sooner what he
did not wish to hear at all? She turned round suddenly as he knocked his foot against a stone
upon the rough, but otherwise noiseless road, presenting a countenance flushed with sudden
relief and pleasure to John's remorseful eye. "Oh, there you are!" she said; "I am so glad.
I thought you could not be coming. You might have been here a quarter of an hour ago by the
short road."

"I did not think there was any hurry," said John, ungraciously. "The wind is enough to carry
one off one's feet; though, to be sure, it's quiet enough here."

"It's always quiet here," she said, reading his face with her eyes after the manner of women,
and wondering what the harassed look meant that was so unusual in John's cheerful face. She
jumped at the idea that he was tired, that his bag was heavy, that he had been beaten about
by the wind till he had lost his temper, always a possible thing to happen to a man. Elinor
flung herself upon the bag and tried to take possession of it. "Why didn't you get a boy at
the station to carry it? Let me carry it," she said.

"That is so likely," said John, with a hard laugh, shifting it to his other hand.

Elinor caught his arm with both her hands, and looked up with wistful eyes into his face. "Oh,
John, you are angry," she said.

"Nonsense. I am tired, buffeting about with this wind." Here the gardener and man-of-all-work
about the cottage came up and took the bag, which John parted with with angry reluctance, as
if it had been a sort of weapon of offence. After it was gone there was nothing for it but
to walk quietly to the house through the flowers with that girl hanging on his arm, begging
a hundred pardons with her eyes. The folly of it! as if she had not a right to do as she pleased,
or he would try to prevent her; but finally, the soft, silent apology of that clinging, and
the look full of petitions touched his surly heart. "Well--Nelly," he said, with involuntary
softening.

"Oh, if you call me that I am not afraid!" she cried, with an instant upleaping of pleasure
and confidence in her changeable face, which (John tried to say to himself) was not really
pretty at all, only so full of expression, changing with every breath of feeling. The eyes,
which had only been brown a moment before, leaped up into globes of light, yet not too dazzling,
with some liquid medium to soften their shining. Even though you know that a girl is in love
with another man, that she thinks of you no more than of the old gardener who has just hobbled
round the corner, it is pleasant to be able to change the whole aspect of affairs to her and
make her light up like that, solely by a little unwilling softening of your gruff and surly tone.

"You know, John," she said, holding his arm tight with her two hands, "that nobody ever calls
me Nelly--except you."

"Possibly I shall call you Nelly no longer. Why? Why, because that fellow will object."

"That fellow! Oh, he!" Elinor's face grew very red all over, from the chin, which almost touched
John's arm, to the forehead, bent back a little over those eyes suffused with light which were
intent upon all the changes of John's face. This one was, like the landscape, swept by all
the vicissitudes of sun and shade. It was radiant now with the unexpected splendour of the
sudden gleam.

"Oh, John, John, I have so much to say to you! He will object to nothing. He knows very well
you are like my brother--almost more than my brother--for you could help it, John. You almost
chose me for your friend, which a brother would not. He says, 'Get him to be our friend and
all will be well!'"

He had not said this, but Elinor had said it to him, and he had assented, which was almost
the same--in the way of reckoning of a girl, at least.

"He is very kind, I am sure," said John, gulping down something which had almost made him throw
off Elinor's arm, and fling away from her in indignation. Her brother----!! But there was no
use making any row, he said to himself. If anything were to be done for her he must put up
with all that. There had suddenly come upon John, he knew not how, as he scanned her anxious
face, a conviction that the man was a scamp, from whom at all hazards she should be free.

Said Elinor, unsuspecting, "That is just what he is, John! I knew you would divine his character
at once. You can't think how kind he is--kind to everybody. He never judges anyone, or throws
a stone, or makes an insinuation." ("Probably because he knows he cannot bear investigation
himself," John said, in his heart.) "That was the thing that took my heart first. Everybody
is so censorious--always something to say against their neighbours; he, never a word."

"That's a very good quality," said John, reluctantly, "if it doesn't mean confounding good
with bad, and thinking nothing matters."

Elinor gave him a grieved, reproachful look, and loosened the clasping of her hands. "It is
not like you to imagine that, John!"

"Well, what is a man to say? Don't you see, if you do nothing but blow his trumpet, the only
thing left for me to do is to insinuate something against him? I don't know the man from Adam.
He may be an angel, for anything I can say."

"No; I do not pretend he is that," said Elinor, with impartiality. "He has his faults, like
others, but they are nice faults. He doesn't know how to take care of his money (but he hasn't
got very much, which makes it the less matter), and he is sometimes taken in about his friends.
Anybody almost that appeals to his kindness is treated like a friend, which makes precise people
think----but, of course, I don't share that opinion in the very least."

("A very wasteful beggar, with a disreputable set," was John's practical comment within himself
upon this speech.)

"And he doesn't know how to curry favour with people who can help him on; so that though he
has been for years promised something, it never turns up. Oh, I know his faults very well indeed,"
said Elinor; "but a woman can do so much to make up for faults like that. We're naturally saving,
you know, and we always keep those unnecessary friends that were made before our time at a
distance; and it's part of our nature to coax a patron--that is what Mariamne says."

"Mariamne?" said John.

"His sister, who first introduced him to me; and I am very fond of her, so you need not say
anything against her, John. I know she is--fashionable, but that's no harm."

"Mariamne," he repeated; "it is a very uncommon name. You don't mean Lady Mariamne Prestwich,
do you? and not--not----Elinor! not Phil Compton, for goodness' sake? Don't tell me he's the man?"

Elinor's hands dropped from his arm. She drew herself up until she seemed to tower over him.
"And why should I say it is not Mr. Compton," she asked, with a scarlet flush of anger, so
different from that rosy red of love and happiness, covering her face.

"Phil Compton! the dis-Honourable Phil! Why, Elinor! you cannot mean it! you must not mean
it!" he cried.

Elinor said not a word. She turned from him with a look of pathetic reproach but with the air
of a queen, and walked into the house, he following in a ferment of wrath and trouble, yet
humbled and miserable more than words could say. Oh, the flowery, peaceful house! jasmine and
rose overleaping each other upon the porch, honeysuckle scenting the air, all manner of feminine
contrivances to continue the greenness and the sweetness into the little bright hall, into
the open drawing-room, where flowers stood on every table amid the hundred pretty trifles of
a woman's house. There was no one in this room where she led him, and then turned round confronting
him, taller than he had ever seen her before, pale, with her nostrils dilating and her lips
trembling. "I never thought it possible that you of all people in the world, you, John--my
stand-by since ever I was a baby--my---- Oh! what a horrid thing it is to be a woman," cried
Elinor, stamping her foot, "to be ready to cry for everything!--you, John! that I always put
my trust in--that you should turn against me--and at the very first word!"

"Elinor," he said, "my dear girl! not against you, not against you, for all the world!"

"And what is me?" she said, with that sudden turning of the tables and high scorn of her previous
argument which is common with women; "do I care what you do to me? Oh, nothing, nothing! I
am of no account, you can trample me down under your feet if you like. But what I will not
bear," she said, clenching her hands, "is injustice to him: that I will not bear, neither from
you, Cousin John, who are only my distant cousin, after all, and have no right to thrust your
advice upon me--or from any one in the world."

"What you say is quite true, Elinor, I am only a distant cousin--after all: but----"

"Oh, no, no," she cried, flying to him, seizing once more his arm with her clinging hands,
"I did not mean that--you know I did not mean that, my more than brother, my good, good John,
whom I have trusted all my life!"

And then the poor girl broke out into passionate weeping with her head upon his shoulder, as
she might have leant upon the handy trunk of a tree, or on the nearest door or window, as John
Tatham said in his heart. He soothed her as best he could, and put her in a chair and stood
with his hand upon the back of it, looking down upon her as the fit of crying wore itself out.
Poor little girl! he had seen her cry often enough before. A girl cries for anything, for a
thorn in her finger, for a twist of her foot. He had seen her cry and laugh, and dash the tears
out of her eyes on such occasions, oh! often and often: there was that time when he rushed
out of the bushes unexpectedly and frightened her pony, and she fell among the grass and vowed,
sobbing and laughing, it was her fault! and once when she was a little tot, not old enough
for boy's play, when she fell upon her little nose and cut it and disfigured herself, and held
up that wounded little knob of a feature to have it kissed and made well. Oh, why did he think
of that now! the little thing all trust and simple confidence! There was that time too when
she jumped up to get a gun and shoot the tramps who had hurt somebody, if John would but give
her his hand! These things came rushing into his mind as he stood watching Elinor cry, with
his hand upon the back of her chair.

She wanted John's hand now when she was going forth to far greater dangers. Oh, poor little
Nelly! poor little thing! but he could not put her on his shoulder and carry her out to face
the foe now.

She jumped up suddenly while he was thinking, with the tears still wet upon her cheeks, but
the paroxysm mastered, and the light of her eyes coming out doubly bright like the sun from
the clouds. "We poor women," she said with a laugh, "are so badly off, we are so handicapped,
as you call it! We can't help crying like fools! We can't help caring for what other people
think, trying to conciliate and bring them round to approve us--when we ought to stand by our
own conscience and judgment, and sense of what is right, like independent beings."

"If that means taking your own way, Elinor, whatever any one may say to you, I think women
do it at least as much as men."

"No, it does not mean taking our own way," she cried, "and if you do not understand any better
than that, why should I---- But you do understand better, John," she said, her countenance
again softening: "you know I want, above everything in the world, that you should approve of
me and see that I am right. That is what I want! I will do what I think right; but, oh, if
I could only have you with me in doing it, and know that you saw with me that it was the best,
the only thing to do! Happiness lies in that, not in having one's own way."

"My dear Elinor," he said, "isn't that asking a great deal? To prevent you from doing what
you think right is in nobody's power. You are of age, and I am sure my aunt will force nothing;
but how can we change our opinions, our convictions, our entire points of view? There is nobody
in the world I would do so much for as you, Elinor: but I cannot do that, even for you."

The hot tears were dried from her cheeks, the passion was over. She looked at him, her efforts
to gain him at an end, on the equal footing of an independent individual agreeing to differ,
and as strong in her own view as he could be.

"There is one thing you can do for me," she said. "Mamma knows nothing about--fashionable gossip.
She is not acquainted with the wicked things that are said. If she disapproves it is only because----
Oh, I suppose because one's mother always disapproves a thing that is done without her, that
she has no hand in, what she calls pledging one's self to a stranger, and not knowing his antecedents,
his circumstances, and so forth! But she hasn't any definite ground for it as you--think you
have, judging in the uncharitable way of the world--not remembering that if we love one another
the more there is against him the more need he has of me! But all I have to ask of you, John,
is not to prejudice my mother. I know you can do it if you please--a hint would be enough,
an uncertain word, even hesitating when you answer a question--that would be quite enough!
John, if you put things into her head----"

"You ask most extraordinary things of me," said John, turning to bay. "To tell her lies about
a man whom everybody knows--to pretend I think one thing when I think quite another. Not to
say that my duty is to inform her exactly what things are said, so that she may judge for herself,
not let her go forth in ignorance--that is my plain duty, Elinor."

"But you won't do it; oh, you won't do it!" she said. "Oh, John, for the sake of all the time
that you have been so good to Nelly--your own little Nelly, nobody else's! Remember that I
and everybody who loves him know these stories to be lies--and don't, don't put things into
my mother's head! Let her judge for herself--don't, don't prejudice her, John. It can be no
one's duty to repeat malicious stories when there is no possibility of proving or disproving
them. Don't make her think---- Oh, mamma! we couldn't think where you had gone to. Yes, here
is John."

"So I perceive," said Mrs. Dennistoun. It was getting towards evening, and the room was not
very light. She could not distinguish their looks or the agitation that scarcely could have
been hidden but for the dusk. "You seem to have been having a very animated conversation. I
heard your voices all along the garden walk. Let me have the benefit of it, if there is anything
to tell."

"You know well enough, mamma, what we must have been talking about," said Elinor, turning half
angrily away.

"To be sure," said the mother, "I ought to have known. There is nothing so interesting as that
sort of thing. I thought, however, you would probably have put it off a little, Elinor."

"Put it off a little--when it is the thing that concerns us more than anything else in the world!"

"That is true," said Mrs. Dennistoun, with a sigh. "Did you walk all the way, John? I meant
to have sent the pony-cart for you, but the man was too late. It is a nice evening though,
and coming out of town it is a good thing for you to have a good walk."

"Yes, I like it more than anything," said John, "but the evening is not so very fine. The wind
is high, and I shouldn't wonder if we had rain."

"The wind is always high here," said Mrs. Dennistoun. "We don't have our view for nothing;
but the sky is quite clear in the west, and all the clouds blowing away. I don't think we shall
have more than a shower."

Elinor stood listening to this talk with restrained impatience, as if waiting for the moment
when they should come to something worth talking about. Then she gave herself a sort of shake--half
weary, half indignant--and left the room. There was a moment's silence, until her quick step
was heard going to the other end of the house and up-stairs, and the shutting of a door.

"Oh, John, I am very uneasy, very uneasy," said Mrs. Dennistoun. "I scarcely thought she would
have begun to you about it at once; but then I am doing the very same. We can't think of anything
else. I am not going to worry you before dinner, for you must be tired with your walk, and
want to refresh yourself before we enter upon that weary, weary business. But my heart misgives
me dreadfully about it all. If I only had gone with her! It was not for want of an invitation,
but just my laziness. I could not be troubled to leave my own house."

"I don't see what difference it would have made had you been with her, aunt."

"Oh, I should have seen the man: and been able to judge what he was and his motive, John."

"Elinor is not rich. He could scarcely have had an interested motive."

"There is some comfort in that. I have said that to myself again and again. He could not have
an interested motive. But, oh! I am uneasy! There is the dressing-bell. I will not keep you
any longer, John; but in the evening, or to-morrow, when we can get a quiet moment----"

The dusk, was now pervading all the house--that summer dusk which there is a natural prejudice
everywhere against cutting short by lights. He could not see her face, nor she his, as they
went out of the drawing-room together and along the long passage, which led by several arched
doorways to the stairs. John had a room on the ground floor which was kept for gentlemen visitors,
and in which the candles were twinkling on the dressing-table. He was more than ever thankful
as he caught a glimpse of himself in the vague reflected world of the mirror, with its lights
standing up reflected too, like inquisitors spying upon him, that there had not been light
enough to show how he was looking: for though he was both a lawyer and a man of the world,
John Tatham had not been able to keep the trouble which his interview with Elinor had caused
him out of his face.

CHAPTER III.

The drawing-room of the cottage was large and low, and had that faux air of being old-fashioned
which is dear to the hearts of superior people generally. Mrs. Dennistoun and her daughter
scarcely belonged to that class, yet they were, as ladies of leisure with a little taste for
the arts are bound to be, touched by all the fancies of their time, which was just beginning
to adore Queen Anne. There was still, however, a mixture of luxury with the square settees
and spindle-legged cabinets which were "the fashion:" and partly because that was also "the
fashion," and partly because on Windyhill even a July evening was sometimes a little chill,
or looked so by reason of the great darkness of the silent, little-inhabited country outside--there
was a log burning on the fire-dogs (the newest thing in furnishing in those days though now
so common) on the hearth. The log burned as little as possible, being, perhaps, not quite so
thoroughly dry and serviceable as it would have been in its proper period, and made a faint
hissing sound in the silence as it burned, and diffused its pungent odour through the house.
The bow window was open behind its white curtains, and it was there that the little party gathered
out of reach of the unnecessary heat and the smoke. There was a low sofa on either side of
this recess, and in the centre the French window opened into the garden, where all the scents
were balmy in the stillness which had fallen upon the night.

Mrs. Dennistoun was tall and slim, a woman with a presence, and sat with a sort of dignity
on her side of the window, with a little table beside her covered with her little requirements,
the properties, so to speak, without which she was never known to be--a book for moments when
there was nothing else to interest her, a case for work should there arise any necessity for
putting in a stitch in time, a bottle of salts should she or any one else become suddenly faint,
a paper cutter in cases of emergency, and finally, for mere ornament, two roses, a red and
a white, in one of those tall old-fashioned glasses which are so pretty for flowers. I do wrong
to dismiss the roses with such vulgar qualifications as white and red--the one was a Souvenir
de Malmaison, the other a General ---- something or other. If you spoke to Mrs. Dennistoun
about her flowers she said, "Oh, the Malmaison," or "Oh, the General So-and-so." Rose was only
the family name, but happily, as we all know, under the other appellation they smelt just as
sweet. Mrs. Dennistoun kept up all this little state because she had been used to do so; because
it was part of a lady's accoutrements, so to speak. She had also a cushion, which was necessary,
if not for comfort, yet for her sense of being fully equipped, placed behind her back when
she sat down. But with all this she was not a formal or prim person. She was a woman who had
not produced a great deal of effect in life; one of those who are not accustomed to have their
advice taken, or to find that their opinion has much weight upon others. Perhaps it was because
Elinor resembled her father that this peculiarity which had affected all Mrs. Dennistoun's
married life should have continued into a sphere where she ought to have been paramount. But
she was with her daughter as she had been with her husband, a person of an ineffective character,
taking refuge from the sensation of being unable to influence those about her whose wills were
stronger than her own, by relinquishing authority, and in her most decided moments offering
an opinion only, no more. This was not because she was really undecided, for on the contrary
she knew her own mind well enough; but it had become a matter of habit with her to insist upon
no opinion, knowing, as she did, how little chance she had of imposing her opinion upon the
stronger wills about her. She had two other children older than Elinor: one, the eldest of
all, married in India, a woman with many children of her own, practically altogether severed
from the maternal nest; the other an adventurous son, who was generally understood to be at
the ends of the earth, but seldom or never had any more definite address. This lady had naturally
gone through many pangs and anxieties on behalf of these children, who had dropped away from
her side into the unknown; but it belonged to her character to have said very little about
this, so that she was generally supposed to take things very easily, and other mothers were
apt to admire the composure of Mrs. Dennistoun, whose son might be being murdered by savages
at any moment, for anything she knew--or minded, apparently. "Now it would have driven me out
of my senses!" the other ladies said. Mrs. Dennistoun perhaps did not feel the back so well
fitted to the burden as appeared--but she kept her own sentiments on this subject entirely
to herself.

(I may say too--but this, the young reader may skip without disadvantage--by way of explanation
of a peculiarity which has lately been much remarked as characteristic of those records of
human history contemptuously called fiction, i.e., the unimportance, or ill-report, or unjust
disapproval of the mother in records of this description--that it is almost impossible to maintain
her due rank and character in a piece of history, which has to be kept within certain limits--and
where her daughter the heroine must have the first place. To lessen her pre-eminence by dwelling
at length upon the mother, unless that mother is a fool, or a termagant, or something thoroughly
contrasting with the beauty and virtues of the daughter--would in most cases be a mistake in
art. For one thing the necessary incidents are wanting, for I strongly object, and so I think
do most people, to mothers who fall in love, or think of marriage, or any such vanity in their
own person, and unless she is to interfere mischievously with the young lady's prospects, or
take more or less the part of the villain, how is she to be permitted any importance at all?
For there cannot be two suns in one sphere, or two centres to one world. Thus the mother has
to be sacrificed to the daughter: which is a parable; or else it is the other way, which is
against all the principles and prepossessions of life.)

Elinor did not sit up like her mother. She had flung herself upon the opposite sofa, with her
arms flung behind her head, supporting it with her fingers half buried in the twists of her
hair. She was not tall like Mrs. Dennistoun, and there was far more vivid colour than had ever
been the mother's in her brown eyes and bright complexion, which was milk-white and rose-red
after an old-fashioned rule of colour, too crude perhaps for modern artistic taste. Sometimes
these delightful tints go with a placid soul which never varies, but in Elinor's case there
was a demon in the hazel of the eyes, not dark enough for placidity, all fire at the best of
times, and ready in a moment to burst into flame. She it was who had to be in the forefront
of the interest, and not her mother, though for metaphysical, or what I suppose should now
be called psychological interests, the elder lady was probably the most interesting of the
two. Elinor beat her foot upon the carpet, out of sheer impatience, while John lingered alone
in the dining-room. What did he stay there for? When there are several men together, and they
drink wine, the thing is comprehensible; but one man alone who takes his claret with his dinner,
and cares for nothing more, why should he stay behind when there was so much to say to him,
and not one minute too much time till Monday morning, should the house be given up to talk
not only by day but by night? But it was no use beating one's foot, for John did not come.

"You spoke to your cousin, Elinor, before dinner?" her mother said.

"Oh, yes, I spoke to him before dinner. What did he come here for but that? I sent for him
on purpose, you know, mamma, to hear what he would say."

"And what did he say?"

This most natural question produced a small convulsion once more on Elinor's side. She loosed
the hands that had been supporting her head and flung them out in front of her. "Oh, mamma,
how can you be so exasperating! What did he say? What was he likely to say? If the beggar maid
that married King Cophetua had a family it would have been exactly the same thing--though in
that case surely the advantage was all on the gentleman's side."

"We know none of the particulars in that case," said Mrs. Dennistoun, calmly. "I have always
thought it quite possible that the beggar maid was a princess of an old dynasty and King Cophetua
a parvenu. But in your case, Elinor----"

"You know just as little," said the girl, impetuously.

"That is what I say. I don't know the man who has possessed himself of my child's fancy and
heart. I want to know more about him. I want----"

"For goodness' sake, whatever you want, don't be sentimental, mamma!"

"Was I sentimental? I didn't mean it. He has got your heart, my dear, whatever words may be used."

"Yes--and for ever!" said the girl, turning round upon herself. "I know you think I don't know
my own mind; but there will never be any change in me. Oh, what does John mean, sitting all
by himself in that stuffy room? He has had time to smoke a hundred cigarettes!"

"Elinor, you must not forget it is rather hard upon John to be brought down to settle your
difficulties for you. What do you want with him? Only that he should advise you to do what
you have settled upon doing. If he took the other side, how much attention would you give him?
You must be reasonable, my dear."

"I would give him every attention," said Elinor, "if he said what was reasonable. You don't
think mere blind opposition is reasonable, I hope, mamma. To say Don't, merely, without saying
why, what reason is there in that?"

"My dear, when you argue I am lost. I am not clever at making out my ground. Mine is not mere
blind opposition, or indeed opposition at all. You have been always trained to use your own
faculties, and I have never made any stand against you."

"Why not? why not?" said the girl, springing to her feet. "That is just the dreadful, dreadful
part of it! Why don't you say straight out what I am to do and keep to it, and not tell me
I must make use of my own faculties? When I do, you put on a face and object. Either don't
object, or tell me point-blank what I am to do."

"Do you think for one moment if I did, you would obey me, Elinor?"

"Oh, I don't know what I might do in that case, for it will never happen. You will never take
that responsibility. For my part, if you locked me up in my room and kept me on bread and water
I should think that reasonable; but not this kind of letting I dare not wait upon I would,
saying I am to exercise my own faculties, and then hesitating and finding fault."

"I daresay, my dear," said Mrs. Dennistoun, with great tolerance, "that this may be provoking
to your impatient mind: but you must put yourself in my place a little, as I try to put myself
in yours. I have never seen Mr. Compton. It is probable, or at least quite possible, that if
I knew him I might look upon him with your eyes----"

"Probable! Possible! What words to use! when all my happiness, all my life, everything I care
for is in it: and my own mother thinks it just possible that she might be able to tolerate
the man that--the man who----"

She flung herself down on her seat again, panting and excited. "Did you wear out Adelaide like
that," she cried, "before she married, papa and you----"

"Adelaide was very different, Elinor. She married salon les règles a man whom we all knew.
There was no trouble about it. Your father was the one who was impatient then. He thought it
too well arranged, too commonplace and satisfactory. You may believe he did not object to that
in words, but he laughed at them and it worried him. It has done very well on the whole," said
Mrs. Dennistoun, with a faint sigh.

"You say that--and then you sigh. There is always a little reserve. You are never wholly satisfied."

"One seldom is in this world," said Mrs. Dennistoun, this time with a soft laugh. "This world
is not very satisfactory. One makes the best one can of it."

"And that is just what I hate to hear," said Elinor, "what I have always heard. Oh, yes, when
you don't say it you mean it, mamma. One can read it in the turn of your head. You put up with
things. You think perhaps they might have been worse. In every way that's your philosophy.
And it's killing, killing to all life! I would rather far you said out, 'Adelaide's husband
is a prig and I hate him.'"

"There is only one drawback, that it would not be true. I don't in the least hate him. I am
glad I was not called upon to marry him myself, I don't think I should have liked it. But he
makes Adelaide a very good husband, and she is quite happy with him--as far as I know."

"The same thing again--never more. I wonder, I wonder after I have been married a dozen years
what you will say of me?"

"I wonder, too: if we could but know that it would solve the question," the mother said. Elinor
looked at her with a provoked and impatient air, which softened off after a moment--partly
because she heard the door of the dining-room open--into a smile.

"I try you in every way," she said, half laughing. "I do everything to beguile you into a pleasanter
speech. I thought you must at least have said then that you hoped you would have nothing to
say but happiness. No! you are not to be caught, however one tries, mamma."

John came in at this moment, not without a whiff about him of the cigarette over which he had
lingered so. It relieved him to see the two ladies seated opposite each other in the bow window,
and to hear something like a laugh in the air. Perhaps they were discussing other things, and
not this momentous marriage question, in which certainly no laughter was.

"You have your usual fire," he said, "but the wind has quite gone down, and I am sure it is
not wanted to-night."

"It looks cheerful always, John."

"Which is the reason, I suppose, why you carefully place yourself out of sight of it--one of
the prejudices of English life."

And then he came forward into the recess of the window, which was partly separated from the
room by a table with flowers on it, and a great bush in a pot, of delicate maiden-hair fern.
It was perhaps significant, though he did not mean it for any demonstration of partisanship,
that he sat down on Elinor's side. Both the ladies felt it so instinctively, although, on the
contrary, had the truth been known, all John's real agreement was with the mother; but in such
a conjuncture it is not truth but personal sympathy that carries the day. "You are almost in
the dark here," he said.

"Neither of us is doing anything. One is lazy on a summer night."

"There is a great deal more in it than that," said Elinor, in a voice which faltered a little.
"You talk about summer nights, and the weather, and all manner of indifferent things, but you
know all the time there is but one real subject to talk of, and that we are all thinking of that."

"That is my line, aunt," said John. "Elinor is right. We might sit and make conversation, but
of course this is the only subject we are thinking of. It's very kind of you to take me into
the consultation. Of course I am in a kind of way the nearest in relation, and the only man
in the family--except my father--and I know a little about law, and all that. Now let me hear
formally, as if I knew nothing about it (and, in fact, I know very little), what the question
is. Elinor has met someone who--who has proposed to her--not to put too fine a point upon it,"
said John, with a smile that was somewhat ghastly--"and she has accepted him. Congratulations
are understood, but here there arises a hitch."

"There arises no hitch. Mamma is dissatisfied (which mamma generally is) chiefly because she
does not know Mr. Compton; and some wretched old woman, who doesn't know him either, has written
to her--to her and also to me--telling us a pack of lies," said Elinor, indignantly, "to which
I do not give the least credence for a moment--not for a moment!"

"That's all very well for you," said John, "it's quite simple; but for us, Elinor--that is,
for your mother and me, as you are good enough to allow me to have a say in the matter--it's
not so simple. We feel, you know, that, like Cæsar's wife, our Elinor's--husband"--he could
not help making a grimace as he said that word, but no one saw or suspected it--"should be
above suspicion."

"That is exactly what I feel, John."

"Well, we must do something about it, don't you see? Probably it will be as easy as possible
for him to clear himself." (The dis-Honourable Phil! Good heavens! to think it was a man branded
with such a name that was to marry Elinor! For a moment he was silenced by the thought, as
if some one had given him a blow.)

"To clear himself!" said Elinor. "And do you think I will permit him to be asked to clear himself?
Do you think I will allow him to believe for a moment that I believed anything against him?
Do you think I will take the word of a spiteful old woman?"

"Old women are not always spiteful, and they are sometimes right." John put out his hand to
prevent Mrs. Dennistoun from speaking, which, indeed, she had no intention of doing. "I don't
mean so, of course, in Mr. Compton's case--and I don't know what has been said."

"Things that are very uncomfortable--very inconsistent with a happy life and a comfortable
establishment," said Mrs. Dennistoun.

"Oh, if you could only hear yourself, mamma! You are not generally a Philistine, I must say
that for you; but if you only heard the tone in which you said 'comfortable establishment!'
the most conventional match-making in existence could not have done it better; and as for what
has been said, there has nothing been said but what is said about everybody--what, probably,
would be said of you yourself, John, for you play whist sometimes, I hear, and often billiards,
at the club."

A half-audible "God forbid!" had come from John's lips when she said, "What would probably
be said of yourself"--audible that is to Elinor, not to the mother. She sprang up as this murmur
came to her ear: "Oh, if you are going to prejudge the case, there is nothing for me to say!"

"I should be very sorry to prejudge the case, or to judge it all," said John. "I am too closely
interested to be judicial. Let somebody who knows nothing about it be your judge. Let the accusations
be submitted--to your Rector, say; he's a sensible man enough, and knows the world. He won't
be scared by a rubber at the club, or that sort of thing. Let him inquire, and then your mind
will be at rest."

"There is only one difficulty, John," said Mrs. Dennistoun. "Mr. Hudson would be the best man
in the world, only for one thing--that it is from his sister and his wife that the warning came."

"Oh!" said John. This fact seemed to take him aback in the most ludicrous way. "Nothing! nothing!--Darling,
who's ill? I saw the old doctor on the road home, and he threw me a word as he passed about
having been here--looked quite jolly over it. What's wrong--one of the servants?"

Letty put down her work upon her knee and her hands upon it.

She grew red and pale; then she turned away from him, pressing her face into the back of her
chair.

He flew to her, and she murmured in his ear.

* * * * *

What she said was by no means all sweetness. There was mingled with it much terror and some anger.
Letty was not one of the women who take maternity as a matter of
course.

But emotion and natural feeling had their way. George was dissolved
in joy.

He threw himself at her feet, resting his head against her knee.

"If he doesn't have your eyes and hair I'll disinherit him," he said, with a gaiety which seemed
to have effaced all his fatigue.

"I don't want him," was her pettish reply; "but if she has your chin, I'll put her out to nurse.
Oh! how I hate the thought of it!" and she shuddered.

He caught her hand, comforting her. Then, putting up both his own, he drew her down to him.

"After all, little woman, it hasn't turned out so badly?" he said in her ear, with sad appeal.
Their lips met, trembling. Suddenly Letty broke into passionate weeping. George sprang up,
gathered her upon his knee, and they sat for long, in silence, clinging to each other.

At last Letty drew back from him, pushing a hand against his shoulder.

"You know--you didn't care a bit for me--when you married me," she
said, half bitter, half crying.

"Didn't I? And you?" he asked, raising his eyebrows.

"Oh! I don't remember!" she said hurriedly, and dropped her face on his coat again.

"Well, we are going to care for each other," he said in a low voice, after a pause. "That's what
matters now, isn't it?"

She made no reply, but she put up a hand, and touched his face.

He turned his lips to the hand and kissed it tenderly. There was a sore, sad spot in each heart;
and neither dared to look forward. But tonight there was a sense of belonging to each other in a new
and sacred way, of being drawn apart, separated from the world, husband and wife, together.
Through George's mind there wandered half-astonished thoughts about this strange compelling power
of marriage,--the deep grip it makes on life--the almost mechanical way in which it bears down
resistance, provided only that certain compunctions, certain scruples still remain for it
to work on.

George slept lightly, being over-tired. All through the night the vision of the beaten men going
down sullenly to their first shift seemed to hold him as though in a nightmare.

Between seven and eight o'clock a sound startled him. He found himself standing by his bed, struggling
to wake and collect himself.

A sound that had shaken the house, passing like a dull thud through the valley? A horror seized
him. He looked at Letty, who was fast asleep; then he walked noiselessly into his dressing-room,
and began to hurry on his clothes.

Five minutes later he was running down the hill at his full speed. It was bitterly cold and still;
the first snow lay on the grass, and a raw grey veil hung over the hills. As he came in sight
of the distant pit-bank he saw a crowd of women swarming up it; a confused and hideous sound of
crying and shrieking came to his ears; and at the same moment a boy, panting and dead-white,
ran through the lodge-gates to meet him.

"Where is it, Sprowston?"

"Oh, sir, it's No. 2 pit. The damp's comin up the upcast, and the cage is blown to pieces. But
the down shaft's all right, and Mr. Madan and Mr. Macgregor were starting down as I come away.
There was eighty-six men and boys went down first shift."

George groaned, and rushed on.

CHAPTER XXIV

England knows these scenes too well!

When Tressady, out of breath with running, reached the top of the bank, and threw a hurried look in front
of him, his feeling was that he had seen everything before--the wintry dawn, the crowds of pale
men and weeping women ranged on either hand, the police keeping the ground round the shafts
clear for the mine officials--even the set white face of his manager,
who, with Macgregor the fireman and two hewers, had just emerged from
the cage that was waiting at the mouth of the downcast shaft.

As soon as Madan saw Tressady rounding the corner of the engine-house he hurried towards his
employer.

"Have you been down yet?" Tressady cried to him.

"Just come up, sir. We got about fifty yards--air fairly good--then
we found falls along the main intake.

We got over three or four, till the damp rose on us too bad--we had a rough bit getting back.
I thought you'd be here by now. Macgregor thinks from the direction in which things were lying
that the blast had come from Holford's Heading or thereabouts."

And the manager hastily opened a map of the colliery he was carrying
in his hand against the wall of the engine-house, and pointed to the
spot.

"How many men there?"

"About thirty-two in the workings round about--as near as I can reckon it."

"Any sign of the rest? How many went down?"

"Eighty-six. A cageful of men and lads--just them from the shaft-bottom--got up immediately after
the explosion. Since then, not a sound from anyone! The uptake shaft is chock-full of damp. Mitchell,
in the fan-room, had to run for it at first, it was coming up so fast."

"Good God!" said George, under his breath; and the two men eyed each other painfully.

"Have you sent for the inspector?" said Tressady, after a moment.

"He ought to be here in five minutes now, sir."

"Got some baulks together?"

"The men are piling them by the shaft at this moment."

"Fan uninjured?"

"Yes, sir--and speed increased."

Followed by Madan, Tressady walked up to the shaft, and himself questioned Macgregor and the
two hewers.

Then he beckoned to Madan, and the two walked in close converse towards the lamphouse, discussing
a plan of action. As they passed slowly along the bank the eyes of the miserable terror-stricken
throng to either side followed every movement.

But there was not a sound from anyone. Once Tressady looked up and caught the faces of some men
near him--dark faces, charged with a meaning that seemed instantly to stiffen his own nerve for
what he had to do.

"I give Dixon three more minutes," he said, impatiently looking at his watch; "then we go down
without him."

Dixon was the inspector. He was well known throughout the district, a plucky, wiry fellow, who
was generally at the pit's mouth immediately after an accident, ready and keen to go with any
rescue party on any errand, however dangerous--purely, as he himself declared, for professional
and scientific reasons.

In this case, he lived only a mile away, on the further side of the village, so that Madan's messenger
had not far to go.

As he spoke, George felt his arm clutched from behind. He turned, and saw Mary Batchelor, who
had come forward from a group of women.

"Sir George! Listen 'ere, Sir George." Her lined face and tear-blurred eyes worked with a passion
of entreaty. "The boy went down at five with the rest. Don't yer bear 'im no malice. Ee's a
poor sickly creetur, an the Lord an't give 'im the full use of his wits."

George smiled at the poor thing's madness, and touched her kindly on the shoulder.

"Don't you trouble yourself, Mary; all that can be done will be done--for everybody. We are only
giving Mr. Dixon another minute; then we go down. Look here"--he drew her inside the door of
the lamproom, which happened to be close by, for an open-mouthed group, eager to hear whatever
he might be saying, had begun to press about them. "Can you take this message from me up to
the house? There'll be no news here, you know, for a long time, and I left Lady Tressady asleep."

He
tore a half-sheet from the letter in his pocket, scribbled a few words upon it, and put it into
Mary's hand.

The woman, with her shawl over her head, ran past the lamphouse towards the entrance-gate as
fast as her age would let her, while George rejoined Madan.

"Ah, there he is!"

For the small, lean figure of the inspector was already passing the gate.

Tressady hurried to meet him.

By the time the first questions and answers were over, Tressady, looking round for Madan, saw
that the manager was speaking angrily to a tall man in a rough coat and corduroy trousers who had
entered the pit premises in the wake of Mr. Dixon.

"You take yourself off, Mr. Burrows! You're not wanted here."

"Madan!" called Tressady, "attend to Mr. Dixon, please. I'll see to that man."

And he walked up to Burrows, while the men standing near crowded over the line they had been
told to keep.

"What do you want?" he said, as he reached the newcomer.

"I have come to offer myself for the rescue party. I've been a working miner for years. I've had
special experience in accidents before. I can beat anybody here in physical strength."

As he spoke the great heavily built fellow looked round him, and a murmur of assenting applause
came from the bystanders.

Tressady studied him.

"Are you fit?" he said shortly.

Burrows flushed. Tressady's penetrating look forced his own to meet it.

"As fit as you are," was his haughty reply.

"Well"--said Tressady, slowly, "we don't want to be refusing strong
men.

If Madan'll have you, you shall come. Mind, we're all under his orders."

He went to the manager, and said a word in his ear. Madan, in response, vouchsafed neither look
nor remark to the man, whom he hated apparently more bitterly than
his employer did.

But he made no further objection to his joining the search party.

Presently all preparations were made.

Picked bands of firemen and timbermen descended first, with Madan
at their head.

Then George, Mr. Dixon, a couple of local doctors who had hurried up to offer their services,
and Burrows.

As they shot down into the darkness George was conscious of a strange exhilaration. Working on the
indications given him by the first exploring party, his mind was alive with conjectures as to
the cause of the accident, and with plans for dealing with the various obstacles that might occur.
Never during these weeks of struggle and noise and objurgation had
he felt so fit, so strenuous.

At the bottom of the shaft he had even to remind himself, with a shudder, of the dead men who
must be waiting for them in these blank depths.

For some little distance from the shaft nothing was to be seen that spoke of an explosion. Some
lamps in the porch of the shaft and along the main roadway were burning as usual, and the "journey"
of trucks, from which the "hookers-on" and engine-men had escaped at the first sign of danger,
was standing laden in the entrance of the mine. The door of the under-manager's cabin, near
the base of the shaft, was open. Madan looked into the little den, where the lamp was still burning
on the wall, and groaned. The young fellow who was generally to be found there was a great
friend of his, and they attended the same chapel together.

A little farther an open cupboard was noticed with a wisp of spun yarn hanging out from it--inflammable
stuff, quite untouched.

But about thirty yards farther they came upon the first signs of mischief. A heavy fall of roof
had to be scrambled over, and beyond it afterdamp was clearly perceptible.

Here there was an exclamation from Burrows, who was to the front, and the first victim showed out of
the dark in the pale glow-worm light of the lamps turned upon him. A man lay on his side, close
against the wall, with an unlocked lamp in his hands, which were badly burnt. But no other
part of him was burnt, and it was clear that he had died of afterdamp in trying to escape.
He had evidently come from one of the nearer work-places, and fallen
within a few yards of safety.

The inspector pounced upon the lamp at once, while the doctors knelt by the body. But in itself
the lamp told little.

If it were the illegal unlocking of a lamp that caused the disaster, neither this lamp nor
this man could be at fault; for he had died clearly on the verge of the explosion area, and from the
after-effects of the calamity. But the inspector, who had barely looked at the dead man, turned
the lamp round in his hands, dissatisfied.

"Bad pattern! bad pattern! If I had my way I'd fine every manager whose lamps could be unlocked,"
he said to himself, but quite audibly.

"The fireman may have unlocked it, sir, to re-light his own or someone else's," said Madan, stiffly,
put at once on his defence.

"Oh! I know you're within your legal right, Mr. Madan," said the inspector,
briskly.

"I haven't the making of the laws."

And he sat down on the floor, taking the lamp to pieces, and bending his shrewd, black-eyed face
over it, all the time that the doctors were examining its owner. He was, perhaps, one of the
most humane men in his profession, but a long experience had led him to the conclusion that
in these emergencies the fragments of a lamp, or a "tamping," or a "shot," matter more to
the community than dead men.

Meanwhile George crouched beside the doctors, watching them. The owner of the lamp was a strong,
fair-haired young man, without a mark on him except for the burning of the hands, the eyes
quietly shut, the face at peace. One of the colliers in the search party had burst out crying when
he saw him. The lad was his nephew, and had been a favourite in the pit, partly because of his
prowess as a football player.

But the young life had gone out irrevocably. The doctor shook his head as he lifted himself, and
they left him there, in order not to waste any chance of getting out the living first.

Twenty yards farther on three more bodies were found, two oldish men
and a boy, very little burnt.

They also had been killed in escaping, dragged down by the inexorable afterdamp.

A little beyond this group a fall of mingled stone and coal from the roof blocked the way so
heavily that the hewers and timbermen had to be set to work to open out and shore up before a passage
could be made.

Meanwhile the air in the haulage road was clearing fast, and George
could sit on a lump of stone and watch the dim light playing on the
figures of the men at work. The blows struck echoed from floor to
roof; the work of the bare arms and backs, as they swayed and jerked,
woke a clamour in the mine. Were there any ears still to listen for
them beyond that mass? He could scarcely keep a limb quiet, as he
sat looking on, for impatience and excitement. Burrows meanwhile was
wielding a pick with the rest, and George envied him the bodily skill
and strength that, in spite of his irregular ways of life, were still
left to him.

To restore the ventilation-current was their first object,
and the foremost pick had no sooner gained the roadway on the other
side than a strong movement of the air was perceptible. Madan's face
cleared. The ventilation circuit between the downcast and upcast shafts
must be already in some sort re-established. Let them only get a few
more "stoppings" and brattices put temporarily to rights, and the
fan, working at its increased speed, would soon drive the renewed
air-currents forward again, and make it possible to get all over the
mine. The hole made was quickly enlarged, and the rescuers scrambled
through.

But still fall after fall on the further side delayed their
progress, and the work of repairing the blown-out stoppings by such
wood brattice as could be got at, was long and tedious. The rescuers
toiled and sweated, pausing every now and then to draw upon the food
and drink sent up from behind; and the hours flew unheeded. At last,
upon the further side of one of the worst of these falls--a loose
mingled mass of rock and coal--they came on indications that showed
them they had reached the centre and heart of the disaster. A door
leading on the right to one of the side-roads of the pit known as
Holford's Heading was blown outwards, and some trucks from the heading
had been dashed across the main intake, and piled up in a huddled
and broken mass against the farther wall. Just inside that door lay
victim after victim, mostly on their faces, poor fellows! as they
had come running out from their stalls at the noise of the explosion,
only to meet the fiery blast that killed them. Two or three had been
flung violently against the sides of the heading, and were left torn,
with still bleeding wounds, as well as charred and blackened by the
flame. Of sixteen men and boys that lay in this place of death, not
one had survived to hear the stifled words--half groans, half sobs,
of the comrades who had found them.

"But, thank God! no torture,
no thought," said George to himself as he went from face to face;
"an instant--a flash--then nothingness."

Many of the men were well
known to him. He had seen them last hanging about the village street,
pale with famine--the hatred in their eyes pursuing him.

He knelt
down an instant beside an elderly man whom he could remember since
he was quite a boy--a weak-eyed, sallow fellow, much given to preaching--much
given, too, it was said, to beating his wife and children, as the
waves of excitement took him. Anyway, a fellow who could feel, whose
nerves stung and tormented him, even in the courses of ordinary life.
He lay with his eyes half open, the face terribly scorched, the hands
clenched, as though he still fought with the death that had overcome
him.

George covered the man's face with a handkerchief as the doctor
left the body. "He suffered," he said, under his breath. The doctor
heard him, and nodded sadly.

Hark! What was that? A cry--a faint
cry!

"They're some of them alive in the end workings," cried Madan,
with a sob of joy. "Come on, my lads! come on!"

And the party--all
but Mr. Dixon--leaving the dead, pushed on through the foul atmosphere,
over heaps of fallen stone and coal, in quest of the living.

"Leave
me a man," said Mr. Dixon, detaining the manager a moment. "I stay
here. You have enough with you. If I judge right, it all began here."

A
collier stayed with him, unwillingly, panting all the time under the
emotion of the rescue the man imagined but was not to see.

For while
the inspector measured and sketched, far up the heading, in some disused
workings off a side-dip or roadway, Burrows was the first to come
upon twenty-five men, eighteen of whom were conscious and uninjured.
Two of them had strength enough, as they heard the footsteps and shouts
approaching, to stagger out into the heading to meet their rescuers.
One, a long, thin lad, came forward with leaps and gambols, in spite
of his weakness, and fell almost at Tressady's feet. As he recognised
the tall man standing above him, his bloodless mouth twitched into
a broad grin.

"I say, give us a chance. Take me out--won't you?"

It
was Mary Batchelor's grandson. In retribution for the assault on Letty
the lad had been sentenced to three weeks' imprisonment, and George
had not seen him since. He stooped now, and poured some brandy down
the boy's throat. "We'll get you out directly," he said, "as soon
as we've looked to the others."

"There's some on 'em not worth takin
out," said the boy, clinging to George's leg. "They're dead. Take
me out first." Then, with another grin, as George disengaged himself,
"Some on em's prayin."

Indeed, the first sight of that little group
was a strange and touching one. About a dozen men sat huddled round
one of their number, a Wesleyan class-leader, who had been praying
with them and reciting passages from St. John. All of them, young
or old, were dazed and bent from the effects of afterdamp, and scarcely
one of them had strength to rise till they were helped to their feet.
Nevertheless, the cry which had been heard by their rescuers had not
been a cry for help, but the voices of the little prayer-meeting raised
feebly through the darkness in the Old Hundredth.

A little distance
from the prayer-meeting, the sceptics of the party leant against the
wall or lay along the floor, unheeding; while seven men were unconscious,
and possibly dying. Two or three young fellows meanwhile, who had
been least touched by the afterdamp, had "amused themselves," as they
said, by riding up and down the neighbouring level on the "jummer"
or coal-truck of one of them.

"Weren't you afraid?" Tressady asked
one of these, turning a curious look at him, while the doctors were
examining the worst cases, and rough men were sobbing and shaking
each other's hands off.

"Noa," said the young hewer, his face, like
something cut out in yellowish wax, returning the light from Tressady's
lamp. "Noa, theer was cumpany. Old Moses, there--ee saved us."

Old
Moses was the leader of the prayer-meeting. He was a fireman besides,
who had been for twenty-six years in the mine. At the time of the
explosion, it appeared, he had been in a working close to that door
on the heading where death had done so ghastly and complete a work.
But the flame in its caprice had passed him by, and he and another
man had been able to struggle through the afterdamp back along the
heading, just in time to stem the rush of men and boys from the workings
at the farther end. These men were at the moment in a madness of terror,
and ready even to plunge into the white death-mist advancing to meet
them, obeying only the instinct of the trapped animal to "get out."
But Moses was able to control them, to draw them back by degrees along
the heading till, in the distant workings where they were found, the
air was more tolerable, and they could wait for rescue.

George was
the first to help the old fireman to his feet. But instead of listening
to any praises of his own conduct, he was no sooner clinging to Tressady's
arm than he called to Madan:

"Mr. Madan, sir!"

"Aye, Moses."

"Have
ye heard aught of them in the West Heading yet?"

"No, Moses; we must
get these fellows out first. We'll go there next."

"I left thirty
men and boys there this morning at half-past six. It was fair thronged
up with them." The old man's voice shook.

Meanwhile Madan and the
doctors were busy with the transport of the seven unconscious men,
some of whom were already dying. Each of them had to be carried on
his back by two men, and as soon as the sick procession was organised
it was seen that only three of the search party were left free--Tressady,
Burrows, and the Scotch fireman, Macgregor.

Up the level and along
the heading, past the point where Dixon was still at work, over the
minor falls that everywhere attested the range of the explosion, and
through the pools of water that here and there gathered the drippings
of the mine, the seven men were tenderly dragged or carried, till
at last the party regained the main intake or roadway.

George turned
to Madan.

"You will have your hands full with these poor fellows.
Macgregor and I--Mr. Burrows, if he likes--will push on to the West
Heading."

Madan looked uneasy.

"You'd better go up, Sir George,"
he said, in a low voice, "and let me go on. You don't know the signs
of the roof as I do. Oh, not Nelly--Nelly is for you only. I would never let him
call me that. But they are all for short names, one syllable--he is Phil, and Mariamne, well
at home they call her Jew--horrible, isn't it?--because she was called after some Jewess; but
somehow it seems queer when you see her, so fair and frizzy, like anything but a Jew."

"So I have got one letter to myself," said John. "I don't know that I think that worth very
much, however. And so far as I can see, you seem to think everything very fine--the bets, perhaps,
and the rows and all."

"Well they are, you know," said Elinor, with a laugh, "to a little country mouse like me that
has never seen anything. There is always something going on, and their slang way of speaking
is certainly very amusing if it is not at all dignified, and they have such droll ways of looking
at things. All so entirely different! Don't you know, John, sometimes in one's life one longs
for something to be quite different. A complete change, anything new."

"If that is what you long for, no doubt you will get it, Elinor."

"Well!" she cried, "I have had the other for three-and-twenty years, long enough to have exhausted
it, don't you think? but I don't mean to throw it over, oh, no! Coming back to mamma makes
the arrangement perfect. Probably in the end it is the old life, the life I was brought up
in that I shall like best in the long run. That is one thing of being well brought up. Phil
will laugh till he cries when I tell him of your description of me as a well-brought-up girl."

John set his teeth as he walked or rather stumbled along by her side, catching in the roots
of the trees as he had never done before, and swearing under his breath. Her flutter of talk
running on, delighted, full of laughter and softness, as if he had fully declared his satisfaction
and was interested in every detail, kept John in a state of suppressed fury which made his
countenance dark, and almost took the sight from his eyes. He did not know how to escape from
that false position, nor did she give him time, she had so much to say. Mrs. Dennistoun looked
anxiously at the pair as they came up through the copse to the level of the cottage. There
were no enclosures in that primitive place. From the copse you came straight into the garden
with its banks of flowers. She was seated near the cottage door in a corner sheltered from
the sun, with a number of books about her. But I don't think she had read anything except some
portions of the lessons in the morning service. She had been sitting with her eyes vaguely
fixed upon the horizon and her hands clasped in her lap, and a heavy shadow like an overhanging
cloud upon her mind. But when she heard Elinor's voice approaching so gay and tuneful her heart
rose a little. John evidently could have had nothing very bad to say. Elinor had been satisfied
with the morning. Mrs. Dennistoun had expected to see them come back estranged and silent.
The conclusion she drew was entirely satisfactory. After all John must have been moved solely
by general disapproval, which is so very different from the dreadful hints and warnings that
might mean any criminality. Elinor was talking to him as freely as she had done before this
spectre rose. It must, Mrs. Dennistoun concluded, be all right.

It was not till he was going away that she had an opportunity of talking with him alone. Her
satisfaction, it must be allowed, had been a little subdued by John's demeanour during the
afternoon and evening. But Mrs. Dennistoun had said to herself that there might be other ways
of accounting for this. She had long had a fancy that John was more interested in Elinor than
he had confessed himself to be. It had been her conviction that as soon as he felt it warrantable,
as soon as he was sufficiently well-established, and his practice secured, he would probably
declare himself, with, she feared, no particular issue so far as Elinor was concerned. And
perhaps he was disappointed, poor fellow, which was a very natural explanation of his glum
looks. But at breakfast on Monday Elinor announced her intention of driving her cousin to the
station, and went out to see that the pony was harnessed, an operation which took some time,
for the pony was out in the field and had to be caught, and the man of all work, who had a
hundred affairs to look after, had to be caught too to perform this duty; which sometimes,
however, Elinor performed herself, but always with some expenditure of time. Mrs. Dennistoun
seized the opportunity, plunging at once into the all-important subject.

"You seemed to get on all right together yesterday, John, so I suppose you found that after
all there was not very much to say."

"I was not allowed to say----anything. You mean----"

"Oh, John, John, do you mean to tell me after all----"

"Aunt Ellen," he said, "stop it if you can; if there is any means in the world by which you
can stop it, do so. I can't bring accusations against the man, for I couldn't prove them. I
only know what everybody knows. He is not a man fit for Elinor to marry. He is not fit to touch
the tie of her shoe."

"Oh, don't trouble me with your superlatives, John. Elinor is a good girl and a clever girl,
but not a lady of romance. Is there anything really against him? Tell me, for goodness' sake!
Even with these few words you have made me very unhappy," Mrs. Dennistoun said, in a half resentful
tone.

"I can't help it," said the unfortunate man, "I can't bring accusations, as I tell you. He
is simply a scamp--that is all I know."

"A scamp!" said Mrs. Dennistoun, with a look of alarm. "But then that is a word that has so
many meanings. A scamp may be only a careless fellow, nice in his way. That is not enough to
break off a marriage for. And, John, as you have said so much, you must say more."

"I have no more to say, that's all I know. Inquire what the Hudsons have heard. Stop it if
you can."

"Oh, dear, dear, here is Elinor back already," Mrs. Dennistoun said.

CHAPTER V.

The next time that John's presence was required at the cottage was for the signing of the very
simple settlements; which, as there was nothing or next to nothing in the power of the man
to settle upon his wife, were easy enough. He met Mr. Lynch, who was Mrs. Dennistoun's "man
of business," and a sharp London solicitor, who was for the husband. Elinor's fortune was five
thousand pounds, no more, not counting her expectations from him, which were left out of the
question. It was a very small matter altogether, and one which the smart solicitor who was
in Mr. Compton's interest spoke of with a certain contempt, as who should say he was not in
the habit of being disturbed and brought to the country for any such trifle. It was now August--not
a time when any man was supposed to be available for matters like these. Mr. Lynch was just
about starting for his annual holiday, but came, at no small personal inconvenience, to do
his duty by the poor girl whom he had known all his life. John and he travelled to the cottage
together, and their aspect was not cheerful. "Did you ever hear," said Mr. Lynch, "such a piece
of folly as this--a man with no character at all? This is what it is to leave a girl in the
sole care of her mother. What does a woman know about such things?"

"I don't think it was her mother's fault," said John, anxious to do justice all round. "Elinor
is very head-strong, and when she has made up her mind to a thing----"

"A bit of a girl!" said Mr. Lynch, contemptuously. He was an old bachelor and knew nothing
about the subject, as the reader will perceive. "Her mother ought never to have permitted it
for a moment. She should have put down her foot: and then Miss Elinor would soon have come
to reason. What I wonder is the ruffian's own motives? for it can't be a little bit of money
like that. Five thousand's a mere mouthful to such a man as he is. He'll get rid of it all
in a week."

"It must be tied up as tight as possible," said John.

Here Mr. Lynch faltered a little. "She has got an idea into her head, with the intention, I
don't doubt, of defrauding herself if she can. He has got some investment for it, it appears.
He is on the board of some company--a pretty board to take in such a fellow? But the Honourable
is always something, I suppose."

John did not say the dis-Honourable, though it trembled on the edge of his tongue. "But you
will not permit that?" he said.

"No, no; we will not permit it," said Mr. Lynch, with an emphasis on the negative which sounded
like failing resolution.

"That would be giving the lamb to the wolf with a vengeance."

"Exactly what I said; exactly what I said. I am very glad, Mr. Tatham, that you take the same
view."

"There is but one view to be taken," said John. "He must not have the slightest power over
her money. It must be tied up as tight as the law can do it; not that I think it of the least
consequence," he added. "Of course, he will get it all from her one way or another. Law's but
a poor barrier against a determined man."

"I'm glad you see that too," said Mr. Lynch, "and you might say a determined woman: for she
has set her mind on this, and we'll have a nice business with her, I can see."

"A bit of a girl!" said John, with a laugh, echoing the previous sentiment.

"That's very true," said the old lawyer; "and still I think her mother--but I don't put any
great confidence in my own power to resist Elinor. Poor little thing, I've known her since
she was that high; indeed, I may say I knew her before she was born. And you are a relation,
Mr. Tatham?"

"Third or fourth cousin."

"But still, more intimate than a person unconnected with them, and able to speak your mind
more freely. I wonder now that you never said anything. But in family matters sometimes one
is very reluctant to interfere."

"I said everything I could say, not to offend them mortally; but I could only tell them the
common talk of society. I told my aunt he was a scamp: but after the first shock I am not sure
that she thought that was any such bad thing. It depended upon the sense you put upon the word,
she said."

"Oh, women, women!" said Mr. Lynch. "That's their way--a reformed rake makes the best husband.
It's an old-fashioned sentiment, but it's in the background of their minds, a sort of tradition
that they can't shake off--or else the poor fellow has had so many disadvantages, and they
think they can make it all right. It's partly ignorance and partly vanity. But they are all
the same, and their ways in the matter of marriage are not to be made out."

"You have a great deal of experience."

"Experience--oh, don't speak of it!" said the old gentleman. "A man has a certain idea of the
value of money, however great a fool he may be, but the women----"

"And yet they are said to stick to money, and to be respectful of it beyond anything but a
miser. I have myself remarked----"

"In small matters," said Mr. Lynch, "in detail--sixpences to railway porters and that sort
of thing--so people say at least. But a sum of money on paper has no effect on a woman, she
will sign it away with a wave of her hand. It doesn't touch their imagination. Five pounds
in her pocket is far more than five thousand on paper, to Elinor, for instance. I wish," cried
the old gentleman, with a little spitefulness, "that this Married Women's Property Bill would
push on and get itself made law. It would save us a great deal of trouble, and perhaps convince
the world at the last how little able they are to be trusted with property. A nice mess they
will make of it, and plenty of employment for young solicitors," he said, rubbing his hands.

For this was before that important bill was passed, which has not had (like so many other bills)
the disastrous consequences which Mr. Lynch foresaw.

They were met at the station by the pony carriage, and at the door by Elinor herself, who came
flying out to meet them. She seized Mr. Lynch by both arms, for he was a little old man, and
she was bigger than he was.

"Now you will remember what I said," she cried in his ear, yet not so low but that John heard
it too.

"You are a little witch; you mustn't insist upon anything so foolish. Leave all that to me,
my dear," said Mr. Lynch. "What do you know about business? You must leave it to me and the
other gentleman, who I suppose is here, or coming."

"He is here, but I don't care for him. I care only for you. There are such advantages: and
I do know a great deal about business; and," she said, with her mouth close to the old lawyer's
ear, "it will please Phil so much if I show my confidence in him, and in the things with which
he has to do."

"It will not please him so much if the thing bursts, and you are left without a penny, my dear."

Elinor laughed. "I don't suppose he will mind a bit: he cares nothing for money. But I do,"
she said. "You know you always say women love acquisition. I want good interest, and of course
with Phil on it, it must be safe for me."

"Oh, that makes it like the Bank of England, you think! but I don't share your confidence,
my pretty Elinor. I'm an old fellow. No Phil in the world has any charm for me. You must trust
me to do what I feel is best for you. And Mr. Tatham here is quite of my opinion."

"Oh, John! he is sure to be against me," said Elinor, with an angry glimmer in her eyes. She
had not as yet taken any notice of him while she welcomed with such warmth his old companion.
And John had stood by offering no greeting, with his bag in his hand. But when she said this
the quick feeling girl was seized with compunction. She turned from Mr. Lynch and held out
both her hands to her cousin. "John, I didn't mean that; it is only that I am excited and cross.
And don't, oh, don't go against me," she cried.

"I never did, and never will, Elinor," he said gravely. Then he asked, after a moment, "Is
Mr. Compton here?"

"No; how could he be here? Three gentlemen in the cottage is enough to overwhelm us already.
Mr. Sharp, fortunately, can't stay," she added, lowering her voice; "he has to be driven back
to the station to catch the last express. And it is August," she said with a laugh; "you forget
the 15th. Now, could Phil be anywhere but where there is grouse? You shall have some to dinner
to-night that fell by his gun. That should mollify you, for I am sure you never got grouse
at the cottage before in August. Mamma would as soon think of buying manna for you to eat."

"I think it would have been more respectful, Elinor, if he had been here. What is grouse to you?"

"Then I don't think anything of the kind," cried Elinor. "He is much better away. And I assure
you, John, I never mean to put myself in competition with the grouse."

The old lawyer had gone into the drawing-room, where Mrs. Dennistoun was holding parley with
Mr. Sharp. Elinor and John were standing alone in the half light of the summer evening, the
sun down, the depths of the combe below falling into faint mist, but the sunset-tinted clouds
still floating like a vapour made of roses upon the clearness of the blue above. "Come and
take a turn through the copse," said John. "They don't want either of us indoors."

She went with a momentary reluctance and a glance back at the bow-window of the drawing-room,
from which the sound of voices issued. "Don't you think I should be there to keep them up to
the mark?" she said, half laughing. And then, "Well, yes--as you are going to Switzerland too.
I think you might have stayed and seen me married after all, and made acquaintance with Phil."

"I thought I should have met him here to-day, Elinor."

"Now, how could you? You know the accommodation of the cottage just as well as I do. We have
two spare rooms, and no more."

"You could have sent me out somewhere to sleep. That has been done before now."

"Oh, John, how persistent you are, and worrying! When I tell you that Phil is shooting, as
everybody of his kind is--do you think I want him to give up all the habits of his life? He
is not like us: we adapt ourselves: but these people parcel out their time as if they were
in a trade, don't you know? So long in London, so long abroad, and in the Highlands for the
grouse, and somewhere else for the partridges, or they would die."

"I think he might have departed from that routine once in a way, Elinor, for you."

"I tell you again, John, I shall never put myself in competition"--Elinor stopped abruptly,
with perhaps, he thought, a little glimmer of indignation in her eyes. "I hate women who do
that sort of thing," she cried. "'Give up your cigar--or me,' as I've heard girls say. Such
an unworthy thing! When one accepts a man one accepts him as he stands, with all his habits.
What should I think of him if he said, 'Give up your tea--or me!' I should laugh in his face
and throw him overboard without a pause."

"You would never look at tea again as long as you lived if he did not like it; I suppose that
is what you mean, Elinor?"

"Perhaps if I found that out, afterwards; but to be given the choice beforehand, never! After
all, you don't half know me, John."

"Perhaps not," he said, gravely. They had left the garden behind in its blaze of flowers, and
strayed off into the subdued twilight of the copse, where everything was in a half tone of
greenness and shadow and waning light. "There are always new lights arising on a many-sided
creature like you--and that makes one think. Do you know you are not at all the person to take
a great disappointment quietly, if that should happen to come to you in your life?"

"A great disappointment?" she said, looking up at him with a wondering glance. Then he thought
the colour paled a little in her face. "No," she said, "I don't suppose I should take it quietly.
Who does?"

"Oh, many people--people with less determination and more patience than you. You are not very
patient by nature, Elinor."

"I never said I was."

"And though no one would give up more generously, as a voluntary matter, you could not bear
being made a nonentity of, or put in a secondary place."

"I should not like it, I suppose."

"You would give everything, flinging it away; but to have all your sacrifices taken for granted,
your tastes made of no account----"

There was no doubt now that she had grown pale. "May I ask what all these investigations into
my character mean? I never was so anatomized before."

"It was only to say that you are not a good subject for this kind of experiment, Elinor. I
don't see you putting up with things, making the best of everything, submitting to have your
sense of right and wrong outraged perhaps. Some women would not be much disturbed by that.
They would put off the responsibility and feel it their duty to accept whatever was put before
them. But you--it would be a different matter with you."

"I should hope so, if I was ever exposed to such dangers. But now may I know what you are driving
at, John, for you have some meaning in what you say!"

He took her hand and drew it through his arm. He was in more moved than he wished to show.
"Only this, Elinor,"--he said.

"Oh, John, will you never call me Nelly any more?"

"Only this, Nelly, my little Nelly, never mine again--and that never was mine, except in my
silly thought. Only this: that if you have the least doubt, the smallest flutter of an uncertainty,
just enough to make you hold your breath for a moment, oh, my dear girl, stop! Don't go on
with it; pause until you can make sure."

"John!" she forced her arm from his with an indignant movement. "Oh, how do you dare to say
it?" she said. "Doubt of Mr. Compton! Uncertainty about Phil!" She laughed out, and the echo
seemed to ring into all the recesses of the trees. "I would be much more ready to doubt myself,"
she said.

"Doubt yourself; that is what I mean. Think if you are not deceiving yourself. I don't think
you are so very sure as you believe you are, Nelly. You don't feel so certain----"

"Do you know that you are insulting me, John? You say as much as that I am a fool carried away
by a momentary enthusiasm, with no real love, no true feeling in me, tempted, perhaps, as Mrs.
Hudson thinks, by the Honourable!" Her lip quivered, and the fading colour came back in a rush
to her face. "It is hard enough to have a woman like that think it, who ought to know better,
who has always known me--but you, John!"

"You may be sure, Elinor, that I did not put it on that ground."

"No, perhaps: but on ground not much more respectful to me--perhaps that I have been fascinated
by a handsome man, which is not considered derogatory. Oh, John, a girl does not give herself
away on an argument like that. I may be hasty and self-willed and impatient, as you say; but
when you--love!" Her face flushed like a rose, so that even in the grey of the evening it shone
out like one of the clouds full of sunset that still lingered on the sky. A few quick tears
followed, the natural consequence of her emotion. And then she turned to him with the ineffable
condescension of one farther advanced in life stooping sweetly to his ignorance. "You have
not yet come to the moment in your experience when you can understand that, dear John."

Oh, the insight and the ignorance, the knowledge and the absence of all perception! He, too,
laughed out, as she had done, with a sense of the intolerable ridicule and folly and mistake.
"Perhaps that's how it is," he said.

Elinor looked at him gravely, in an elder-sisterly, profoundly-investigating way, and then
she took his arm quietly and turned towards home. "I shall forget what you have said, and you
will forget that you ever said it; and now we will go home, John, and be just the same dear
friends as before."

"Will you promise me," he said, "that whatever happens, without pride, or recollection of what
I've been so foolish as to say, in any need or emergency, or whenever you want anything, or
if you should be in trouble--trouble comes to everybody in this life--you will remember what
you have said just now, and send for your cousin John?"

Her whole face beamed out in one smile, she clasped her other hand round his arm; "I should
have done it without being asked, without ever doubting for a moment, because it was the most
natural thing in the world. Whom should I turn to else if not to my dear old---- But call me
Nelly, John."

"Dear little Nelly!" he said with faltering voice, "then that is a bargain."

She held up her cheek to him, and he kissed it solemnly in the shadow of the little young oak
that fluttered its leaves wistfully in the breeze that was getting up--and then very soberly,
saying little, they walked back to the cottage. He was going abroad for his vacation, not saying
to himself even that he preferred not to be present at the wedding, but resigning himself to
the necessity, for it was not to be till the middle of September, and it would be breaking
up his holiday had he to come back at that time. So this little interview was a leave-taking
as well as a solemn engagement for all the risks and dangers of life. The pain in it, after
that very sharp moment in the copse, was softened down into a sadness not unsweet, as they
came silently together from out of the shadow into the quiet hemisphere of sky and space, which
was over the little centre of the cottage with its human glimmer of fire and lights. The sky
was unusually clear, and among those soft, rose-tinted clouds of the sunset, which were no
clouds at all, had risen a young crescent of a moon, just about to disappear, too, in the short
course of one of her earliest nights. They lingered for a moment before they went indoors.
The depth of the combe was filled with the growing darkness, but the ridges above were still
light and softly edged with the silver of the moon, and the distant road, like a long, white
line, came conspicuously into sight, winding for a little way along the hill-top unsheltered,
before it plunged into the shadow of the trees--the road that led into the world, by which
they should both depart presently to stray into such different ways.

CHAPTER VI.

The drawing-room after dinner always looked cheerful. Perhaps the fact that it was a sort of
little oasis in the desert, and that the light from those windows shone into three counties,
made the interior more cosy and bright. (There are houses now upon every knoll, and the wind
cannot blow on Windyhill for the quantity of obstructions it meets with.) There was the usual
log burning on the hearth, and the party in general kept away from it, for the night was warm.
Only Mr. Sharp, the London lawyer, was equal to bearing the heat. He stood with his back to
it, and his long legs showing against the glow behind, a sharp-nosed, long man in black, who
had immediately suggested Mephistopheles to Elinor, even though he was on the Compton side.
He had taken his coffee after dinner, and now he stood over the fire slowly sipping a cup of
tea. There was a look of acquisitiveness about him which suggested an inclination to appropriate
anything from the unnecessary heat of the fire to the equally unnecessary tea. But Mr. Sharp
had been on the winning side. He had demonstrated the superior sense of making the money--which
was not large enough sum to settle--of real use to the young pair by an investment which would
increase Mr. Compton's importance in his company, besides producing very good dividends--much
better dividends than would be possible if it were treated in the old-fashioned way by trustees.
This was how the bride wished it, which was the most telling of arguments: and surely, to insure
good interest and an increase of capital to her, through her husband's hands, was better than
to secure some beggarly hundred and fifty pounds a year for her portion, though without any
risks at all.

Mr. Sharp had also taken great pains to point out that there were only three brothers--one
an invalid and the other two soldiers--between Mr. Phil and the title, and that even to be
the Honourable Mrs. Compton was something for a young lady, who was, if he might venture to
say so, nobody--not to say a word against her charms. Lord St. Serf was hourly getting an old
man, and the chances that his client might step over a hecatomb of dead relations to the height
of fortune was a thing quite worth taking into account. It was a much better argument, however,
to return to the analogy of other poor young people, where the bride's little fortune would
be put into the husband's business, and thus their joint advantage considered. Mr. Sharp, at
the same time, did not hesitate to express politely his opinion that to call him down to the
country for a discussion which could have been carried on much better in one or other of their
respective offices was a most uncalled for proceeding, especially as even now the other side
was wavering, and would not consent to conclude matters, and make the signatures that were
necessary at once. Mr. Lynch, it must be allowed, was of the same opinion too.

"Your country is a little bleak at night," said Mr. Sharp, partially mollified by a good dinner,
but beginning to remember unpleasantly the cold drive in a rattletrap of a little rustic pony
carriage over the hills and hollows. "Do you really remain here all the year? How wonderful!
Not even a glimpse of the world in summer, or a little escape from the chills in winter? How
brave of you! What patience and powers of endurance must be cultivated in that way!"

"One would think Windyhill was Siberia at least," said Mrs. Dennistoun, laughing; "we do not
give ourselves credit for all these fine qualities."

"Some people are heroes--or heroines--without knowing it," said Mr. Sharp, with a bow.

"And yet," said the mother, with a little indignation, "there was some talk of Mr. Compton
doing me the honour to share my hermitage for a part of the year."

"Mr. Compton! my dear lady! Mr. Compton would die of it in a week," said Mr. Sharp.

"I am quite well aware of it," said Mrs. Dennistoun; and she added, after a pause, "so should I."

"What a change it will be for your daughter," said Mr. Sharp. "She will see everything that
is worth seeing. More in a month than she would see here in a dozen years. Trust Mr. Compton
for knowing all that's worth going after. They have all an instinct for life that is quite
remarkable. There's Lady Mariamne, who has society at her feet, and the old lord is a most
remarkable old gentleman. Your daughter, Mrs. Dennistoun, is a very fortunate young lady. She
has my best congratulations, I am sure."

"Sharp," said Mr. Lynch from the background, "you had better be thinking of starting, if you
want to catch that train."

"I'll see if the pony is there," said John.

Mr. Sharp put down his teacup with precipitation. "Is it as late as that?" he cried.

"It is the last train," said Mrs. Dennistoun, with great satisfaction. "And I am afraid, if
you missed it, as the house is full, there would be nothing but a bed at the public-house to
offer----"

"Oh, not another word," the lawyer said: and fortunately he never knew how near that rising
young man at the bar, John Tatham, who had every object in conciliating a solicitor, was to
a charge of manslaughter, if killing an attorney can thus be called. But the feelings of the
party were expressed only in actions of the greatest kindness. They helped him on with his
coat, and covered him with rugs as he got in, shivering, to the little pony carriage. It was
a beautiful night, but the wind is always a thing to be considered on Windyhill.

"Well, that's a good thing over," said Mr. Lynch, going to the fire as he came in from the
night air at the door and rubbing his hands.

"It would have been a relief to one's feeling to have kicked that fellow all the way down and
up the other side of the combe, and kept him warm," said John, with a laugh of wrath.

"It is a pity a man should have so little taste," said Mrs. Dennistoun.

Elinor still stood where she had been standing, with every feeling in her breast in commotion.
She had not taken any part in the insidious kindnesses of speeding the parting guest; and now
she remembered that he was her Phil's representative: whatever she might herself think of the
man, how could she join in abuse of one who represented Phil?

"He is no worse, I suppose, than others," she said. "He was bound to stand up for those in
whose interest he was. Mr. Lynch would have made himself quite as disagreeable for me."

"Not I," said the old gentleman; "for what is the good of standing up for you? You would throw
me over on the first opportunity. You have taken all the force out of my sword-arm, my dear,
as it is. How can I make myself disagreeable for those who won't stand up for themselves? I
suppose you must have it your own way."

"Yes, I suppose it will be the best," said Mrs. Dennistoun, in subdued tones.

"It would come to about the same thing, however you settled it," said John.

Elinor looked from one to another with eyes that began to glow. "You are a cheerful company,"
she said. "You speak as if you were arranging my funeral. On the whole I think I like Mr. Sharp
best; for if he was contemptuous of me and my little bit of money, he was at all events cheerful
about the future, and that is always something; whereas you all----"

There was a little pause, no one responding. There was no pleasant jest, no bright augury for
Elinor. The girl's heart rose against this gloom that surrounded her. "I think," she said,
with an angry laugh, "that I had better run after Mr. Sharp and bring him back, for he had
at least a little sympathy with me!"

"Don't be too sure of that," said Mr. Lynch, "for if we think you are throwing yourself away,
Elinor, so does he on his side. He thinks the Honourable Mr. Compton is going dreadfully cheap
for five thousand pounds."

"Elinor need not take any of us au pied de la lettre--of course we are all firm for our own
side," said John.

Elinor turned her head from one to another, growing pale and red by turns. There was a certain
surprise in her look, as she found herself thus at bay. The triumph of having got the better
of their opposition was lost in the sense of isolation with which the girl, so long the first
object of everybody about her, felt herself thus placed alone. And the tears were very ready
to start, but were kept back by jealous pride which rose to her help. Well! if they put her
outside the circle she would remain so; if they talked to her as one no longer of them, but
belonging to another life, so be it! Elinor determined that she would make no further appeal.
She would not even show how much it hurt her. After that pale look round upon them all, she
went into the corner of the room where the piano stood, and where there was little light. She
was too proud to go out of the room, lest they should think she was going to cry. She went
with a sudden, quick movement to the piano instead, where perhaps she might cry too, but where
nobody should see. Poor Elinor! they had made her feel alone by their words, and she made herself
more alone by this little instinctive withdrawal. She began to play softly one thing after
another. She was not a great performer. Her little "tunes" were of the simplest--no better
indeed than tunes, things that every musician despises: they made a little atmosphere round
her, a voluntary hermitage which separated her as if she had been a hundred miles away.

"I wish you could have stayed for the marriage," Mrs. Dennistoun said.

"My dear lady, it would spoil my holiday--the middle of September. You'll have nobody except,
of course, the people you have always. To tell the truth," John added. "I don't care tuppence
for my holiday. I'd have come--like a shot: but I don't think I could stand it. She has always
been such a pet of mine. I don't think I could bear it, to tell the truth."

"I shall have to bear it, though she is more than a pet of mine," said Mrs. Dennistoun.

"I know, I know! the relatives cannot be let off--especially the mother, who must put up with
everything. I trust," said Mr. Lynch, with a sigh, "that it may all turn out a great deal better
than we hope. Where are they going after the marriage?"

"Some one has lent them a place--a very pretty place--on the Thames, where they can have boating
and all that--Lord Sudbury, I think. And later they are going on a round of visits, to his
father, Lord St. Serf, and to Lady Mariamne, and to his aunt, who is Countess of--something
or other." Mrs. Dennistoun's voice was not untouched by a certain vague pleasure in these fine
names.

"Ah," said the old lawyer, nodding his head at each, "all among the aristocracy, I see. Well,
my dear lady, I hope you will be able to find some satisfaction in that; it is better than
to fall among--nobodies at least."

"I hope so," said Mrs. Dennistoun, with a sigh.

They were speaking low, and fondly hoped that they were not heard; but Elinor's ears and every
faculty were quickened and almost every word reached her. But she was too proud to take any
notice. And perhaps these dreary anticipations, on the whole, did her good, for her heart rose
against them, and any little possible doubts in her own mind were put to sudden flight by the
opposition and determination which flooded her heart. This made her playing a little more unsteady
than usual, and she broke down several times in the middle of a "tune;" but nobody remarked
this: they were all fully occupied with their own thoughts.

All, at least, except John, who wandered uneasily about the room, now studying the names of
the books on the bookshelves--which he knew by heart, now pulling the curtain aside to look
out at the moonlight, now pulling at the fronds of the great maidenhair in his distraction
till the table round was scattered with little broken leaves. He wanted to keep out of that
atmosphere of emotion which surrounded Elinor at the piano. But it attracted him, all the same,
as the light attracts a moth. To get away from that, to make the severance which so soon must
be a perfect severance, was the only true policy he knew; for what was he to her, and what
could she be to him? He had already said everything which a man in his position ought to say.
He took out a book at last, and sat down doggedly by the table to read, thus making another
circle of atmosphere, so to speak, another globe of isolated being in the little room, while
the two elder people talked low in the centre, conventionally inaudible to the girl who was
playing and the young man who was reading. But John might as well have tried to solve some
tremendous problem as to read that book. He too heard every word the elders were saying. He
heard them with his own ears, and also he heard them through the ears of Elinor, gauging the
effect which every word would have upon her. At last he could bear it no longer. He was driven
to her side to bear a part of her burden, even to prevent her from hearing, which would be
something. He resisted the impulse to throw down his book, and only placed it very quietly
on the table, and even in a deliberate way, that there might be no appearance of feeling about
him--and made his way by degrees, pausing now and then to look at a picture, though he knew
them all by heart. Thus he arrived at last at the piano, in what he flattered himself was an
accidental way.

"Elinor, the stars are so bright over the combe, do come out. It is not often they are so clear."

"No," she said, more with the movement of her lips than with any sound.

"Why not? You can't want to play those old pieces just at this moment. You will have plenty
of time to play them to-morrow."

She said "No" again, with a little impatient movement of her hands on the keys and a look towards
the others.

"You are listening to what they are saying? Why should you? They don't want you to hear. Come
along, Elinor. It's far better for you not to listen to what is not intended----"

"Oh, go away, John."

"I must say no in my turn. Leave the tunes till to-morrow, and come out with me."

"I thought," she said, roused a little, "that you were fond of music, John."

This brought John up suddenly in an unexpected way. "Oh, as for that,"--he said, in a dubious
tone. Poor Elinor's tunes were not music in his sense, as she very well knew.

She laughed in a forlorn way. "I know what you mean; but this is quite good enough for what
I shall want. I am going down, you know, to a different level altogether. Oh, you can hear
for yourself what mamma and Mr. Lynch are saying."

"Going up you mean, Elinor. I thought them both very complaisant over all those titles."

"Ah," she said, "they say that mocking. They think I am going down; so do you, too, to the
land of mere fast people, people with no sense. Well; there is nothing but the trial will teach
any of us. We shall see."

"It is rather a dreadful risk to run, if it's only a trial, Elinor."

"A trial--for you, not for me--I am not the one that thinks so, except so far as the tunes
are concerned," she said with a laugh. "I confess so far as that Lady Mariamne is fond of a
comic song. I don't think she goes any further. I shall be good enough for them in the way
of music."

"I should be content never to hear another note of music all my life, Elinor, if----"

"Ah, there you begin again. Not you, John, not you! I can't bear any more. Neither stars, nor
walks, nor listening; no more! This rather," and she brought down her hands with a great crash
upon the piano, making every one start. Then Elinor rose, having produced her effect. "I think
it must be time to go to bed, mamma. John is talking of the stars, which means that he wants
his cigar, and Mr. Lynch must want just to look at the tray in the dining-room. And you are
tired by all this fuss, all this unnatural fuss about me, that am not worth---- Come, mother,
to bed."

CHAPTER VII.

The days in the cottage were full of excitement and of occupation during the blazing August
weather, not so much indeed as is common in many houses in which the expectant bridegroom is
always coming and going; though perhaps the place of that exhilarating commotion was more or
less filled by the ever-present diversity of opinion, the excitement of a subdued but never-ended
conflict in which one was always on the defensive, and the other covertly or openly attacking,
or at least believed to be so doing, the distant and unseen object to which all their thoughts
turned. Mrs. Dennistoun, indeed, was not always aggressive, her opposition was but in fits
and starts. Often her feelings of pain and alarm were quiescent in that unfeigned and salutary
interest in clothes and necessities of preparation which is almost always a resource to a woman's
mind. It is wrong to undervalue this possibility which compensates a woman in a small degree
for some of her special troubles. When the mother's heart was very heavy, it was often diverted
a little by the discussion of a dinner dress, or made to forget itself for the moment in a
question about the cut of a sleeve, or which would be most becoming to Elinor of two colours
for a ball gown. But though Mrs. Dennistoun forgot often, Elinor never forgot. The dresses
and "things" generally occupied her a great deal, but not in the form of the anodyne which
they supplied to her mother. Her mind was always on the alert, looking out for those flying
arrows of warfare which your true fighter lets fly in the most innocent conversation at the
most unexpected moments. Elinor thus flung her shield in her mother's face a hundred times
when that poor lady was thinking no evil, when she was altogether occupied by the question
of frills and laces, or whether tucks or flounces were best, and she was startled many times
by that unnecessary rattle of Elinor's arms. "I was not thinking of Mr. Compton," she would
sometimes be driven to say; "he was not in my head at all. I was thinking of nothing more important
than that walking dress, and what you had best wear in the afternoon when you are on those
grand visits."

There was one thing which occasioned a little discussion between them, and that was the necessary
civility of asking the neighbours to inspect these "things" when they were finally ready. It
was only the argument that these neighbours would be Mrs. Dennistoun's sole resource when she
was left alone that made Elinor assent at last. Perhaps, however, as she walked quickly along
towards the moorland Rectory, a certain satisfaction in showing them how little their hints
had been taken, mingled with the reluctance to admit those people who had breathed a doubt
upon the sacred name of Phil, to such a sign of intimacy.

"I have been watching you along the side of the combe, and wondering if it was you such a threatening
day," said Alice Hudson, coming to the door to meet her. "How nice of you to come, Elinor,
when you must be so busy, and you have not been here since--I don't know how long ago!"

"No, I have not been here," said Elinor with a gravity worthy the bride of a maligned man.
"But the time is so near when I shall not be able to come at all that I thought it was best.
Mamma wishes you to come over to-morrow, if you will, to see my things."

"Oh!" the three ladies said together; and Mrs. Hudson came forward and gave Elinor a kiss.
"My dear," she said, "I take it very kind you coming yourself to ask us. Many would not have
done it after what we felt it our duty---- But you always had a beautiful spirit, Elinor, bearing
no malice, and I hope with all my heart that it will have its reward."

"Well, mother," said Alice, "I don't see how Elinor could do anything less, seeing we have
been such friends all our lives as girls, she and I, and I am sure I have always been ready
to give her patterns, or to show her how a thing was done. I should have been very much disappointed
if she had not asked me to see her things."

Mary Dale, who was Mrs. Hudson's sister, said nothing at all, but accepted the visit as in
the course of nature. Mary was the one who really knew something about Phil Compton: but she
had been against the remonstrance which Mrs. Hudson thought it her duty to make. What was the
good? Miss Dale had said; and she had refrained from telling two or three stories about the
Comptons which would have made the hair stand upright on the heads of the Rector and the Rectoress.
She did not even now say that it was kind, but met Elinor in silence, as, in her position as
the not important member of the family, it was quite becoming for her to do.

Then the Rector came in and took her by both hands, and gave her the most friendly greeting.
"I heard Elinor's voice, and I stopped in the middle of my sermon," he said. "You will remark
in church on Sunday a jerky piece, which shows how I stopped to reflect whether it could be
you--and then went on for another sentence, and then decided that it must be you. There is
a big Elinor written across my sermon paper." He laughed, but he was a little moved, to see,
after the "coolness," the little girl whom he had christened come back to her old friends again.

"She has come to ask us to go and see her things, papa," said Mrs. Hudson, twinkling an eye
to get rid of a suspicion of a tear.

"Am I to come, too?" said the Rector; and thus the little incident of the reconciliation was
got over, to the great content of all.

Elinor reflected to herself that they were really kind people, as she went out again into the
grey afternoon where everything was getting up for rain. She made up her mind she would just
have time to run into the Hills', at the Hurst, and leave her message, and so get home before
the storm began. The clouds lay low like a dark grey hood over the fir-trees and moorland shaggy
tops of the downs all round. There was not a break anywhere in the consistent grey, and the
air, always so brisk, had fallen still with that ominous lull that comes over everything before
a convulsion of nature. Some birds were still hurrying home into the depths of the copses with
a frightened straightness of flight, as if they were afraid they would not get back in time,
and all the insects that are so gay with their humming and booming had disappeared under leaves
and stones and grasses. Elinor saw a bee burrowing deep in the waxen trumpet of a foxglove,
as if taking shelter, as she walked quickly past. The Hills--there were two middle-aged sisters
of them, with an old mother, too old for such diversion as the inspection of wedding-clothes,
in the background--would scarcely let Elinor go out again after they had accepted her invitation
with rapture. "I was just wondering where I should see the new fashions," said Miss Hill, "for
though we are not going to be married we must begin to think about our winter things----" "And
this will be such an opportunity," said Miss Susan, "and so good of you to come yourself to
ask us."

"What has she come to ask you to," said old Mrs. Hill; "the wedding? I told you girls, I was
sure you would not be left out. Why, I knew her mother before she was married. I have known
them all, man and boy, for nearer sixty than fifty years--before her mother was born! To have
left you out would have been ridiculous. Yes, yes, Elinor, my dear; tell your mother they will
come--delighted! They have been thinking for the last fortnight what bonnets they would wear----"

"Oh, mother!" and "Oh, Elinor!" said the "girls," "you must not mind what mother says. We know
very well that you must have worlds of people to ask. Don't think, among all your new connections,
of such little country mice as us. We shall always just take the same interest in you, dear
child, whether you find you can ask us or not."

"But of course you are asked," said Elinor, in gaieté de coeur, not reflecting that her mother
had begun to be in despair about the number of people who could be entertained in the cottage
dining-room, "and you must not talk about my new grand connections, for nobody will ever be
like my old friends."

"Dear child!" they said, and "I always knew that dear Elinor's heart was in the right place."
But it was all that Elinor could do to get free of their eager affection and alarm lest she
should be caught in the rain. Both of the ladies produced waterproofs, and one a large pair
of goloshes to fortify her, when it was found that she would go; and they stood in the porch
watching her as she went along into the darkening afternoon, without any of their covers and
shelters. The Miss Hills were apt to cling together, after the manner of those pairs of sweet
sisters in the "Books of Beauty" which had been the delight of their youth; they stood, with
arms intertwined, in their porch, watching Elinor as she hurried home, with her light half-flying
step, like the belated birds. "Did you hear what she said about old friends, poor little thing?"
"I wonder if she is finding out already that her new grand connections are but vanity!" they
said, shaking their heads. The middle-aged sisters looked out of the sheltered home, which
perhaps they had not chosen for themselves, with a sort of wistful feeling, half pity, perhaps
half envy, upon the "poor little thing" who was running out so light-hearted into the storm.
They had long ago retired into waterproofs and goloshes, and had much unwillingness to wet
their feet--which things are a parable. They went back and closed the door, only when the first
flash of lightning dazzled them, and they remembered that an open door is dangerous during
a thunderstorm.

Elinor quickened her pace as the storm began and got home breathless with running, shaking
off the first big drops of thunder-rain from her dress. But she did not think of any danger,
and sat out in the porch watching how the darkness came down on the combe; how it was met with
the jagged gleam of the great white flash, and how the thunderous explosion shook the earth.
The combe, with its hill-tops on either side, became like the scene of a battle, great armies,
invisible in the sharp torrents of rain, meeting each other with a fierce shock and recoil,
with now and then a trumpet-blast, and now the gleam that lit up tree and copse, and anon the
tremendous artillery. When the lightning came she caught a glimpse of the winding line of the
white road leading away out of all this--leading into the world where she was going--and for
a moment escaped by it, even amid the roar of all the elements: then came back, alighting again
with a start in the familiar porch, amid all the surroundings of the familiar life, to feel
her mother's hand upon her shoulder, and her mother's voice saying, "Have you got wet, my darling?
Did you get much of it? Come in, come in from the storm!"

"It is so glorious, mamma!" Mrs. Dennistoun stood for a few minutes looking at it, then, with
a shudder, withdrew into the drawing-room. "I think I have seen too many storms to like it,"
she said. But Elinor had not seen too many storms. She sat and watched it, now rolling away
towards the south, and bursting again as though one army or the other had got reinforcements;
while the flash of the explosions and the roar of the guns, and the white blast of the rain,
falling like a sheet from the leaden skies, wrapped everything in mystery. The only thing that
was to be identified from time to time was that bit of road leading out of it--leading her
thoughts away, as it should one day lead her eager feet, from all the storm and turmoil out
into the bright and shining world. Elinor never asked herself, as she sat there, a spectator
of this great conflict of nature, whether that one human thing, by which her swift thoughts
traversed the storm, carried any other suggestion as of coming back.

Perhaps it is betraying feminine counsels too much to the modest public to narrate how Elinor's
things were all laid out for the inspection of the ladies of the parish, the dresses in one
room, the "under things" in another, and in the dining-room the presents, which everybody was
doubly curious to see, to compare their own offerings with those of other people, or else to
note with anxious eye what was wanting, in order, if their present had not yet been procured,
to supply the gap. How to get something that would look well among the others, and yet not
be too expensive, was a problem which the country neighbours had much and painfully considered.
The Hudsons had given Elinor a little tea-kettle upon a stand, which they were painfully conscious
was only plated, and sadly afraid would not look well among all the gorgeous articles with
which no doubt her grand new connections had loaded her. The Rector came himself, with his
ladies to see how the kettle looked, with a great line of anxiety between his brows; but when
they saw that the revolving dishes beside it, which were the gift of the wealthy Lady Mariamne,
were plated too, and not nearly such a pretty design, their hearts went up in instant exhilaration,
followed a moment after by such indignation as they could scarcely restrain. "That rich sister,
the woman who married the Jew" (which was their very natural explanation of the lady's nickname),
"a woman who is rolling in wealth, and who actually made up the match!" This was crescendo,
a height of scorn impossible to describe upon a mere printed page. "One would have thought
she would have given a diamond necklace or something of consequence," said Mrs. Hudson in her
husband's ear. "Or, at least silver," said the Rector. "These fashionable people, though they
give themselves every luxury, have sometimes not very much money to spend; but silver, at least,
she might have been expected to give silver." "It is simply disgraceful," said the Rector's
wife. "I am glad, at all events, my dear," said he, "that our little thing looks just as well
as any." "It is one of the prettiest things she has got," said Mrs. Hudson, with a proud heart.
Lord St. Serf sent an old-fashioned little ring in a much worn velvet case, and the elder brother,
Lord Lomond, an album for photographs. The Rector's wife indicated these gifts to her husband
with little shrugs of her shoulders. "If that's all the family can do!" she said: "why Alice's
cushion, which was worked with floss silks upon satin, was a more creditable present than that."
The Miss Hills, who as yet had not had an opportunity, as they said, of giving their present,
roamed about, curious, inspecting everything. "What is the child to do with a kettle, a thing
so difficult to pack, and requiring spirit for the lamp, and all that--and only plated!" the
Hills said to each other. "Now, that little teapot of ours," said Jane to Susan, "if mother
would only consent to it, is no use to us, and would look very handsome here." "Real silver,
and old silver, which is so much the rage, and a thing she could use every day when she has
her visitors for afternoon tea," said Susan to Jane. "It is rather small," said Miss Hill,
doubtfully. "But quite enough for two people," said the other, forgetting that she had just
declared that the teapot would be serviceable when Elinor had visitors. But that was a small
matter. Elinor, however, had other things better than these--a necklace, worth half a year's
income, from John Tatham, which he had pinched himself to get for her that she might hold up
her head among those great friends; and almost all that her mother possessed in the way of
jewellery, which was enough to make a show among these simple people. "Her own family at least
have done Elinor justice," said the Rector, going again to have a look at the kettle, which
was the chief of the display to him. Thus the visitors made their remarks. The Hills did nothing
but stand apart and discuss their teapot and the means by which "mother" could be got to assent.

The Rector took his cup of tea, always with a side glance at the kettle, and cut his cake,
and made his gentle jest. "If Alick and I come over in the night and carry them all off you
must not be surprised," he said; "such valuable things as these in a little poor parish are
a dreadful temptation, and I don't suppose you have much in the way of bolts and bars. Alick
is as nimble as a cat, he can get in at any crevice, and I'll bring over the box for the collections
to carry off the little things." This harmless wit pleased the good clergyman much, and he
repeated it to all the ladies. "I am coming over with Alick one of these dark nights to make
a sweep of everything," he said. Mr. Hudson retired in the gentle laughter that followed this,
feeling that he had acquitted himself as a man ought who is the only gentleman present, as
well as the Rector of the parish. "I am afraid I would not be a good judge of the 'things,'"
he said, "and for anything I know there may be mysteries not intended for men's eyes. I like
to see your pretty dresses when you are wearing them, but I can't judge of their effect in
the gross." He was a man who had a pleasant wit. The ladies all agreed that the Rector was
sure to make you laugh whatever was the occasion, and he walked home very briskly, pleased
with the effect of the kettle, and saying to himself that from the moment he saw it in Mappin's
window he had felt sure it was the very thing.

The other ladies were sufficiently impressed with the number and splendour of Elinor's gowns.
Mrs. Dennistoun explained, with a humility which was not, I fear, untinctured by pride, that
both number and variety were rendered necessary by the fact that Elinor was going upon a series
of visits among her future husband's great relations, and would have to be much in society
and among fine people who dressed very much, and would expect a great deal from a bride. "Of
course, in ordinary circumstances the half of them would have been enough: for I don't approve
of too many dresses."

"They get old-fashioned," said Mrs. Hudson, gravely, "before they are half worn out."

"And to do them up again is quite as expensive as getting new ones, and not so satisfactory,"
said the Miss Hills.

The proud mother allowed both of these drawbacks, "But what could I do?" she said. "I cannot
have my child go away into such a different sphere unprovided. It is a sacrifice, but we had
to make it. I wish," she said, looking round to see that Elinor was out of hearing, "it was
the only sacrifice that had to be made."

"Let us hope," said the Rector's wife, solemnly, "that it will all turn out for the best."

"It will do that however it turns out," said Miss Dale, who was even more serious than it was
incumbent on a member of a clerical household to be, "for we all know that troubles are sent
for our advantage as well as blessings, and poor dear Elinor may require much discipline----"

"Oh, goodness, don't talk as if the poor child was going to be executed," said Susan Hill.

"I am not at all alarmed," said Mrs. Dennistoun. It was unwise of her to have left an opening
for any such remark. "My Elinor has always been surrounded by love wherever she has been. Her
future husband's family are already very fond of her. I am not at all alarmed on Elinor's account."

She laid the covering wrapper over the dresses with an air of pride and confidence which was
remembered long afterwards--as the pride that goeth before a fall by some, but by others with
more sympathy, who guessed the secret workings of the mother's heart.

CHAPTER VIII.

Time went on quickly enough amid all these preparations and the little attendant excitements
of letters, congratulations, and presents which came in on every side. Elinor complained mildly
of the fuss, but it was a new and far from unpleasant experience. She liked to have the packets
brought in by the post, or the bigger boxes that arrived from the station, and to open them
and produce out of the wadding or the saw-dust one pretty thing after another. At first it
was altogether fresh and amusing, this new kind of existence, though after a while she grew
blasée, as may be supposed. Lady Mariamne's present she was a little ashamed of: not that she
cared much, but because of the look on her mother's face when those inferior articles were
unpacked; and at the ring which old Lord St. Serf sent her she laughed freely.

"I will put it with my own little old baby rings in this little silver tray, and they will
all look as if they were antiques, or something worth looking at," said Elinor. Happily there
were other people who endowed her more richly with rings fit for a bride to wear. The relations
at a distance were more or less pleased with Elinor's prospects. A few, indeed, from different
parts of the world wrote in the vein of Elinor's home-advisers, hoping that it was not the
Mr. Compton who was so well known as a betting man whom she was going to marry; but the fact
that she was marrying into a noble family, and would henceforward be known as the Honourable
Mrs. Compton, mollified even these critics. Only three brothers--one a great invalid, and two
soldiers--between him and the title. Elinor's relations promptly inaugurated in their imaginations
a great war, in which two noble regiments were cut to pieces, to dispose of the two Captains
Compton; and as for the invalid, that he would obligingly die off was a contingency which nobody
doubted--and behold Elinor Dennistoun Lady St. Serf! This greatly calmed criticism among her
relations, who were all at a distance, and whose approval or disapproval did not much affect
her spirits anyhow. John Tatham's father, Mrs. Dennistoun's cousin, was of more consequence,
chiefly as being John's father, but also a little for himself, and it was remarked that he
said not a word against the marriage, but sent a very handsome present, and many congratulations--chiefly
inspired (but this Elinor did not divine) by an unfeigned satisfaction that it was not his
son who was the bridegroom. Mr. Tatham, senr., did not approve of early marriages for young
men pushing their way at the bar, unless the bride was, so to speak, in the profession and
could be of use to her husband. Even in such cases, the young man was better off without a
wife, he was of opinion. How could he get up his cases properly if he had to drag about in
society at the tail of a gay young woman? Therefore he sent Elinor a very nice present in gratitude
to her and providence. She was a danger removed out of his boy's way.

All this kept a cheerful little commotion about the house, and often kept the mother and daughter
from thinking more than was good for them. These extraneous matters did not indeed preserve
Elinor altogether from the consciousness that her fiancé's letters were very short and a little
uncertain in their arrival, sometimes missing several days together, and generally written
in a hurry to catch the post. But they kept Mrs. Dennistoun from remarking that fact, as otherwise
she would have been sure to do. If any chill of disappointment was in Elinor's mind, she said
to herself that men were generally bad correspondents, not like girls, who had nothing else
to do, and other consolations of this kind, which to begin with beg the question, and show
the beginning of that disenchantment which ought to be reserved at least for a later period.
Elinor had already given up a good deal of her own ideal. She would not, as she said, put herself
in competition with the grouse, she would not give him the choice between her and a cigar;
but already the consciousness that he preferred the grouse, and even a cigar, to her society,
had come an unwilling intruder into Elinor's mind. She would not allow to herself that she
felt it in either case. She said to herself that she was proud of it, that it showed the freedom
and strength of a man, and that love was only one of many things which occupied his life. She
rebelled against the other deduction that "'tis woman's sole existence," protesting loudly
(to herself) that she too had a hundred things to do, and did not want him always at her apron-strings
like a tame curate. But as a matter of fact, no doubt the girl would have been flattered and
happy had he been more with her. The time was coming very quickly in which they should be together
always, even when there was grouse in hand, when his wife would be invited with him, and all
things would be in common between them; so what did it matter for a few days? The marriage
was fixed for the 16th of September, and that great date was now scarcely a fortnight off.
The excitement quickened as everything grew towards this central point. Arrangements had to
be made about the wedding breakfast and where the guests were to be placed. The Hudsons had
put their spare rooms at the disposition of the Cottage, and so had the Hills. The bridegroom
was to stay at the Rectory. Lady Mariamne must of course, Mrs. Dennistoun felt, be put up at
the Cottage, where the two rooms on the ground floor--what were called the gentlemen's rooms--had
to be prepared to receive her. It was with a little awe indeed that the ladies of the Cottage
endeavoured, by the aid of Elinor's recollections, to come to an understanding of what a fine
lady would want even for a single night. Mrs. Dennistoun's experiences were all old-fashioned,
and of a period when even great ladies were less luxurious than now; and it made her a little
angry to think how much more was required for her daughter's future sister-in-law than had
been necessary to herself. But after all, what had herself to do with it? The thing was to
do Elinor credit, and make the future sister-in-law perceive that the Cottage was no rustic
establishment, but one in which it was known what was what, and all the requirements of the
most refined life. Elinor's bridesmaid, Mary Tatham, was to have the spare room up-stairs,
and some other cousins, who were what Mrs. Dennistoun called "quiet people," were to receive
the hospitalities of the Hills, whose house was roomy and old-fashioned. Thus the arrangements
of the crisis were more or less settled and everything made smooth.

Elinor and her mother were seated together in the drawing-room on one of those evenings of
which Mrs. Dennistoun desired to make the most, as they would be the last, but which, as they
actually passed, were--if not occupied with discussions of how everything was to be arranged,
which they went over again and again by instinct as a safe subject--heavy, almost dull, and
dragged sadly over the poor ladies whose hearts were so full, but to whom to be separated,
though it would be bitter, would also at the same time almost be a relief. They had been silent
for some time, not because they had not plenty to say, but because it was so difficult to say
it without awaking too much feeling. How could they talk of the future in which one of them
would be away in strange places, exposed to the risks and vicissitudes of a new life, and one
of them be left alone in the unbroken silence, sitting over the fire, with nothing but that
blaze to give her any comfort? It was too much to think of, much more to talk about, though
it need not be said that it was in the minds of both--with a difference, for Elinor's imagination
was most employed upon the brilliant canvas where she herself held necessarily the first place,
with a sketch of her mother's lonely life, giving her heart a pang, in the distance; while
Mrs. Dennistoun could not help but see the lonely figure in her own foreground, against the
brightness of all the entertainments in which Elinor should appear as a queen. They were sitting
thus, the mother employed at some fine needlework for the daughter, the daughter doing little,
as is usual nowadays. They had been talking over Lady Mariamne and her requirements again,
and had come to an end of that subject. What a pity that it was so hard to open the door of
their two hearts, which were so close together, so that each might see all the tenderness and
compunction in the other; the shame and sorrow of the mother to grudge her child's happiness,
the remorse and trouble of the child to be leaving that mother out in all her calculations
for the future! How were they to do it on either side? They could not talk, these poor loving
women, so they were mostly silent, saying a word or two at intervals about Mrs. Dennistoun's
work (which of course, was for Elinor), or of Elinor's village class for sewing, which was
to be transferred to her mother, skirting the edges of the great separation which could neither
be dismissed nor ignored.

Suddenly Elinor looked up, holding up her finger. "What was that?" she said. "A step upon the
gravel?"

"Nonsense, child. If we were to listen to all these noises of the night there would always
be a step upon---- Oh! I think I did hear something."

"It is someone coming to the door," said Elinor, rising up with that sudden prevision of trouble
which is so seldom deceived.

"Don't go, Elinor; don't go. It might be a tramp; wait at least till they knock at the door."

"I don't think it can be a tramp, mamma. It may be a telegram. It is coming straight up to
the door."

"It will be the parcel porter from the station. He is always coming and going, though I never
knew him so late. Pearson is in the house, you know. There is not any cause to be alarmed."

"Alarmed!" said Elinor, with a laugh of excitement; "but I put more confidence in myself than
in Pearson, whoever it may be."

She stood listening with a face full of expectation, and Mrs. Dennistoun put down her work
and listened too. The step advanced lightly, scattering the gravel, and then there was a pause
as if the stranger had stopped to reconnoitre. Then came a knock at the window, which could
only have been done by a tall man, and the hearts of the ladies jumped up, and then seemed
to stop beating. To be sure, there were bolts and bars, but Pearson was not much good, and
the house was full of valuables and very lonely. Mrs. Dennistoun rose up, trembling a little,
and went forward to the window, bidding Elinor go back and keep quite quiet. But here they
were interrupted by a voice which called from without, with another knock on the window, "Nell!
Nell!"

"It is Phil," said Elinor, flying to the door.

Mrs. Dennistoun sat down again and said nothing. Her heart sank in her breast. She did not
know what she feared; perhaps that he had come to break off the marriage, perhaps to hurry
it and carry her child away. There was a pause as was natural at the door, a murmur of voices,
a fond confusion of words, which made it clear that no breach was likely, and presently after
that interval, Elinor came back beaming, leading her lover. "Here is Phil," she said, in such
liquid tones of happiness as filled her mother with mingled pleasure, gratitude, and despite.
"He has found he had a day or two to spare, and he has rushed down here, fancy, with an apology
for not letting us know!"

"She thinks everyone is like herself, Mrs. Dennistoun, but I am aware that I am not such a
popular personage as she thinks me, and you have least reason of all to approve of the man
who is coming to carry her away."

"I am glad to see you, Mr. Compton," she said, gravely, giving him her hand.

The Hon. Philip Compton was a very tall man, with very black hair. He had fine but rather hawk-like
features, a large nose, a complexion too white to be agreeable, though it added to his romantic
appearance. There was a furtive look in his big dark eyes, which had a way of surveying the
country, so to speak, before making a reply to any question, like a man whose response depended
upon what he saw. He surveyed Mrs. Dennistoun in this way while she spoke; but then he took
her hand, stooped his head over it, and kissed it, not without grace. "Thank you very much
for that," he said, as if there had been some doubt on his mind about his reception. "I was
glad enough to get the opportunity, I can tell you. I've brought you some birds, Mrs. Dennistoun,
and I hope you'll give me some supper, for I'm as hungry as a hawk. And now, Nell, let's have
a look at you," the lover said. He was troubled by no false modesty. As soon as he had paid
the required toll of courtesy to the mother, who naturally ought to have at once proceeded
to give orders about his supper, he held Elinor at arm's length before the lamp, then, having
fully inspected her appearance, and expressed by a "Charming, by Jove!" his opinion of it,
proceeded to demonstrations which the presence of the mother standing by did not moderate.
There are few mothers to whom it would be agreeable to see their child engulfed in the arms
of a large and strong man, and covered with his bold kisses. Mrs. Dennistoun was more fastidious
even than most mothers, and to her this embrace was a sort of profanation. The Elinor who had
been guarded like a flower from every contact--to see her gripped in his arms by this stranger,
made her mother glow with an indignation which she knew was out of the question, yet felt to
the bottom of her soul. Elinor was abashed before her mother, but she was not angry. She forced
herself from his embrace, but her blushing countenance was full of happiness. What a revolution
had thus taken place in a few minutes! They had been so dull sitting there alone; alone, though
each with the other who had filled her life for more than twenty years; and now all was lightened,
palpitating with life. "Be good, sir," said Elinor, pushing him into a chair as if he had been
a great dog, "and quiet and well-behaved; and then you shall have some supper. But tell us
first where you have come from, and what put it into your head to come here."

"I came up direct from my brother Lomond's shooting-box. Reply No. 1. What put it into my head
to come? Love, I suppose, and the bright eyes of a certain little witch called Nell. I ought
to have been in Ireland for a sort of a farewell visit there; but when I found I could steal
two days, you may imagine I knew very well what to do with them. Eh? Oh, it's mamma that frightens
you, I see."

"It is kind of you to give Elinor two days when you have so many other engagements," said Mrs.
Dennistoun, turning away.

But he was not in the least abashed. "Yes isn't it?" he said; "my last few days of freedom.
I consider I deserve the prize for virtue--to cut short my very last rampage; and she will
not as much as give me a kiss! I think she is ashamed before you, Mrs. Dennistoun."

"It would not be surprising if she were," said Mrs. Dennistoun, gravely. "I am old-fashioned,
as you may perceive."

"Oh, you don't need to tell me that," said he; "one can see it with half an eye. Come here,
Nell, you little coquette: or I shall tell the Jew you were afraid of mamma, and you will never
hear an end of it as long as you live."

"Elinor, I think you had better see, perhaps, what there is to make up as good a meal as possible
for Mr. Compton," said her mother, sitting down opposite to the stranger, whose long limbs
were stretched over half the floor, with the intention of tripping up Elinor, it seemed; but
she glided past him and went on her way--not offended, oh, not at all--waving her hand to him
as she avoided the very choice joke of his stretched-out foot.

"Mr. Compton," said Mrs. Dennistoun, "you will be Elinor's husband in less than a fortnight."

"I hope so," he said, displaying the large cavern of a yawn under his black moustache as he
looked her in the face.

"And after that I will have no right to interfere; but, in the meantime, this is my house,
and I hope you will remember that these ways are not mine, and that I am too old-fashioned
to like them. I prefer a little more respect to your betrothed."

"Oh, respect," he said. "I have never found that girls like too much respect. But as you please.
Well, look here, Nell," he said, catching her by the arm as she came back and swinging her
towards him, "your mother thinks I'm too rough with you, my little dear."

"Do you, mamma?" said Elinor, faltering a little; but she had the sweetest rose-flush on her
cheeks and the moisture of joy in her eyes. In all her twenty-three years she had never looked
as she looked now. Her life had been a happy one, but not like this. She had been always beloved,
and never had known for a day what it was to be neglected; yet love had never appeared to her
as it did now, so sweet, nor life so beautiful. What strange delusion! what a wonderful incomprehensible
mistake! or so at least the mother thought, looking at her beautiful girl with a pang at her heart.

"It is only his bad manners," said Elinor, in a voice which sounded like a caress. "He knows
very well how to behave. He can be as nice as any one, and as pretty spoken, and careful not
to offend. It is only arriving so suddenly, and not being expected--or that he has forgotten
his nice manners to-night. Phil, do you hear what I say?"

Phil made himself into the semblance of a dog, and sat up and begged for pardon. It was a trick
which made people "shriek with laughing;" but Mrs. Dennistoun's gravity remained unbroken.
Perhaps her extreme seriousness had something in it that was rather ridiculous too. It was
a relief when he went off to his supper, attended by Elinor, and Mrs. Dennistoun was left alone
over her fire. She had a slight sense that she had been absurd, as well as that Philip Compton
had lacked breeding, which did not make her more comfortable. Was it possible that she would
be glad when it was all over, and her child gone--her child gone, and with that man! Her child,
her little delicately bred, finely nurtured girl, who had been wrapped in all the refinements
of life from her cradle, and had never heard a rough word, never been allowed to know anything
that would disturb her virginal calm!--yet now in a moment passed away beyond her mother to
the unceremonious wooer who had no reverence for her, none of the worship her mother expected.
How strange it was! Yet a thing that happened every day. Mrs. Dennistoun sat over the fire,
though it was not cold, and listened to the voices and laughter in the next room. How happy
they were to be together! She did not, however, dwell upon the fact that she was alone and
deserted, as many women would have done. She knew that she would have plenty of time to dwell
on this in the lonely days to come. What occupied her was the want of more than manners, of
any delicate feeling in the lover who had seized with rude caresses upon Elinor in her mother's
presence, and the fact that Elinor did not object, nor dislike that it should be so. That she
should feel forlorn was no wonderful thing; that did not disturb her mind. It was the other
matter about Elinor that pained and horrified her, she could not tell why; which, perhaps,
was fantastic, which, indeed, she felt sure must be so.

They were so long in the dining-room, where Compton had his supper, that when that was over
it was time to go to bed. Still talking and laughing as if they could never exhaust either
the fountain of talk or the mirth, which was probably much more sheer pleasure in their meeting
than genuine laughter produced by any wit or bon mot, they came out into the passage, and stood
by Mrs. Dennistoun and the housemaid, who had brought her the keys and was now fastening the
hall door. A little calendar hung on the wall beneath the lamp, and Phil Compton walked up
to it and with a laugh read out the date. "Sixth September," he said, and turned round to Elinor.
"Only ten days more, Nell." The housemaid stooping down over the bolt blushed and laughed too
under her breath in sympathy; but Mrs. Dennistoun turning suddenly round caught Compton's eye.
Why had he given that keen glance about him? There was nothing to call for his usual survey
of the company in that sentiment. He might have known well enough what were the feelings he
was likely to call forth. A keen suspicion shot through her mind. Suspicion of what? She could
not tell. There was nothing that was not most natural in his sudden arrival, the delightful
surprise of his coming, his certainty of a good reception. The wonder was that he had come
so little, not that he should come now.

The next morning the visitor made himself very agreeable: his raptures were a little calmed.
He talked over all the arrangements, and entered into everything with the interest of a man
to whom that great day approaching was indeed the greatest day in his life. And it turned out
that he had something to tell which was of practical importance. "I may relieve your mind about
Nell's money," he said, "for I believe my company is going to be wound up. We'll look out for
another investment which will pay as well and be less risky. It has been found not to be doing
quite so well as was thought, so we're going to wind up."

"I hope you have not lost anything," said Mrs. Dennistoun.

"Oh, nothing to speak of," he said, carelessly.

"I am not fond of speculative companies. I am glad you are done with it," Mrs. Dennistoun said.

"And I'm glad to be done with it. I shall look out for something permanent and decline joint-stock
companies. I thought you would like to know. But that is the last word I shall say about business.
Come, Nell, I have only one day; let's spend it in the woods."

Elinor, who felt that the day in the woods was far more important than any business, hurried
to get her hat and follow him to the door. It chanced to her to glance at the calendar as she
passed hastily out to where he stood awaiting her in the porch. Why that should have happened
to anyone in the Cottage twice in the twenty-four hours is a coincidence which I cannot explain,
but so it was. Her eye caught the little white plaque in passing, and perceived with surprise
that it had moved up two numbers, and that it was the figure 8 which was marked upon it now.

"We cannot have slept through a day and night," she said, laughing as she joined him. "The
calendar says the eighth September now."

"But I arrived on the sixth," he said. "Mind that, Nell, whatever happens. You saw it with
your own eyes. It may be of consequence to remember."

"Of what consequence could it be?" said Elinor, wondering.

"One can never tell. The only thing is I arrived on the sixth--that you know. And, Nell, my
darling, supposing any fellow should inquire too closely into my movements, you'll back me
up, won't you, and agree in everything I say?"

"Who should inquire into your movements? There is no one here who would be so impertinent, Phil."

"Oh," he said, "there is never any telling how impertinent people may be."

"And what is there in your movements that any one dare inquire about? I hope you are not ashamed
of coming to see me."

"That is just what is the saving of me, Nell. I can't explain what I mean now, but I will later
on. Only mind you don't contradict me if we should meet any inquisitive person. I arrived on
the sixth, and you'll back me like my true love in everything I say."

"As far as--as I know, Phil."

"Oh, we must have no conditions. You must stand by me in everything I say."

CHAPTER IX.

This day in the copse was one that Elinor never forgot. At the moment it seemed to her the
most blissful period of all her life. There had been times in which she had longed that Phil
knew more and cared more for the objects which had always been most familiar, and told for
most in her own existence--although it is true that at first his very ignorance, real or assumed,
his careless way of treating all intellectual subjects, his indifference to books and pictures,
and even nature, had amused and pleased her, giving a piquancy to the physical strength and
enjoying manhood, the perpetual activity and state of doing something in which he was. It was
not a kind of life which she had ever known before, and it dazzled her with its apparent freedom
and fulness, the variety in it, the constant movement, the crowd of occupations and people.
To her who had been used to finding a great deal of her amusement in reading, in sketching
(not very well), in playing (tunes), and generally practising with very moderate success arts
for which she had no individual enthusiasm, it had seemed like a new life to be plunged into
the society of horses and dogs, into the active world which was made up of a round of amusements,
race meetings, days on the river, follies of every conceivable kind, exercise, and air, and
movement. The ignorance of all these people dazzled her as if it had been a new science. It
had seemed something wonderful and piquant to Elinor to find people who knew so much of subjects
she had never heard of, and nothing at all of those she had been trained to know. And then
there had come a moment when she had begun to sigh under her breath, as it were, and wish that
Phil would sometimes open a book, that when he took up the newspaper he would look at something
more than the sporting news and the bits of gossip, that he would talk now and then of something
different from the racings and the startings, and the odds, and the scrapes other men got into,
and the astonishing "frocks" of the Jew--those things, so wonderful at first, like a new language,
absurd, yet amusing, came to be a little tiresome, especially when scraps of them made up the
bulk of the very brief letters which Phil scribbled to his betrothed. But during this day,
after his unexpected arrival, the joy of seeing him suddenly, the pleasure of feeling that
he had broken through all his engagements to come to her, and the fervour of his satisfaction
in being with her again (that very fervour which shocked her mother), Elinor's first glow of
delight in her love came fully back. And as they wandered through the pleasant paths of the
copse, his very talk seemed somehow changed, and to have gained just that little mingling of
perception of her tastes and wishes which she had desired. There was a little autumnal mist
about the softening haze which was not decay, but only the "mellow fruitfulness" of the poet;
and the day, notwithstanding this, was as warm as June, the sky blue, with only a little white
puff of cloud here and there. Phil paused to look down the combe, with all the folds of the
downs that wrapped it about, going off in blue outlines into the distance, and said it was
"a jolly view"--which amused Elinor more than if he had used the finest language, and showed
that he was beginning (she thought) to care a little for the things which pleased her. "And
I suppose you could see a man coming by that bit of road."

"Yes," said Elinor, "you could see a man coming--or going: but, unless you were to make believe
very strong, like the Marchioness, you could not make out who the man was."

"What Marchioness?" said Phil. "I didn't know you had anybody with a title about here. I say,
Nell, it's a very jolly view, but hideously dull for you, my pet, to have lived so long here."

"I never found it in the least dull," she said.

"Why, there is nothing to do! I suppose you read books, eh? That's what you call amusing yourself.
You ought to have made the old lady take you about a deal, abroad, and all over the place:
but I expect you have never stood up for yourself a bit, Nell."

"Don't call mamma the old lady, Phil. She is not old, and far prettier than most people I know."

"Well, she should have done it for herself. Might have picked up a good match, eh? a father-in-law
that would have left you a pot of money. You don't mean to say you wouldn't have liked that?"

"Oh, Phil, Phil! I wish you could understand."

"Well, well, I'll let the old girl alone." And then came the point at which Phil improved so
much. "Tell me what you've been reading last," he said. "I should like to know what you are
thinking about, even if I don't understand it myself. I say, Nell, who do you think that can
be dashing so fast along the road?"

"It is the people at Reddown," she said. "I know their white horses. They always dash along
as if they were in the greatest hurry. Do you really want to know what I have been reading,
Phil? though it is very little, I fear, because of the dressmakers and--all the other things."

"You see," he said, "when you have lots to do you can't keep up with your books: which is the
reason why I never pretend to read--I have no time."

"You might find a little time. I have seen you look very much bored, and complain that there
was nothing to do."

"Never when you were there, Nell, that I'll answer for--but of course there are times when
a fellow isn't doing anything much. What would you have me read? There's always the Sporting
and Dramatic, you know, the Pink 'un, and a few more."

"Oh, Phil! you don't call them literature, I hope."

"I don't know much about what you call literature. There's Ruff, and Hoyle, and--I say, Nell,
there's a dog-cart going a pace! Who can that be, do you suppose?"

"I don't know all the dog-carts about. I should think it was some one coming from the station."

"Oh!" he said, and made a long pause. "Driving like that, if they don't break their necks,
they should be here in ten minutes or so."

"Oh, not for twice that time--the road makes such a round--but there is no reason to suppose
that any dog-cart from the station should be coming here."

"Well, to return to the literature, as you call it. I suppose I shall have to get a lot of
books for you to keep you amused--eh, Nell? even in the honeymoon."

"We shall not have time to read very much if we are moving about all the time."

"Not me, but you. I know what you'll do. You'll go and leave me planted, and run up-stairs
to read your book. I've seen the Jew do it with some of her confounded novels that she's always
wanting to turn over to me."

"But there are some novels that you would like to read, Phil."

"Not a bit. Why, Nell, I know far better stories of fellows in our own set than any novel these
writing men ever can put on paper: fellows, and women, too--stories that would make your hair
stand on end, and that would make you die with laughing. You can't think what lots I know.
That cart would have been here by this time if it had been coming here, eh?"

"Oh, no, not yet--the road makes such a long round. Do you expect any one, Phil?"

"I don't quite know; there's something on at that confounded office of ours; everything, you
know, has gone to smash. I didn't think it well to say too much to the old lady last night.
There's been a regular row, and the manager's absconded, and all turns on whether they can
find some books. I shouldn't wonder if one of the fellows came down here, if they find out
where I am. I say, Nell, mind you back me up whatever I say."

"But I can't possibly know anything about it," said Elinor, astonished.

"Never mind--about dates and that--if you don't stand by me, there may be a fuss, and the wedding
delayed. Remember that, my pet, the wedding delayed--that's what I want to avoid. Now, come,
Nell, let's have another go about the books. All English, mind you. I won't buy you any of
the French rot. They're too spicy for a little girl like you."

"I don't know what you mean, Phil. I hope you don't think that I read nothing but novels,"
Elinor said.

"Nothing but novels! Oh, if you go in for mathematics and that sort of thing, Nell! the novels
are too deep for me. Don't say poetry, if you love me. I could stand most things from you,
Nell, you little darling--but, Nell, if you come spouting verses all the time----"

His look of horror made Elinor laugh. "You need not be afraid. I never spout verses," she said.

"Come along this way a little, where we can see the road. All women seem to like poetry. There's
a few fellows I don't mind myself. Ingoldsby, now that's something fine. We had him at school,
and perhaps it was the contrast from one's lessons. Do you know Ingoldsby, Nell?"

"A--little--I have read some----"

"Ah, you like the sentimental best. There's Whyte Melville, then, there's always something
melancholy about him--'When the old horse died,' and that sort of thing--makes you cry, don't
you know. You all like that. Certainly, if that dog-cart had been coming here it must have
come by this time."

"Yes, it must have come," Elinor admitted, with a little wonder at the importance which he
gave to this possible incident. "But there is another train at two if you are very anxious
to see this man."

"Oh, I'm not anxious to see him," said Mr. Compton, with a laugh, "but probably he will want
to see me. No, Nell, you will not expect me to read poetry to you while we're away. There's
quite a library at Lomond's place. You can amuse yourself there when I'm shooting; not that
I shall shoot much, or anything that takes me away from my Nell. But you must come out with
us. There is no such fun as stumping over the moors--the Jew has got all the turn-out for that
sort of thing--short frocks and knickerbockers, and a duck of a little breech-loader. She thinks
she's a great shot, poor thing, and men are civil and let her imagine that she's knocked over
a pheasant or a hare, now and then. As for the partridges, she lets fly, of course, but to
say she hits anything----"

"I should not want to hit anything," said Elinor. "Oh, please Phil! I will try anything else
you like, but don't make me shoot."

"You little humbug! See what you'll say when you get quite clear of the old lady. But I don't
want you to shoot, Nell. If you don't get tired sitting at home, with all of us out on the
hill, I like to come in for my part and find a little duck all tidy, not blowzy and blown about
by the wind, like the Jew with her ridiculous bag, that all the fellows snigger at behind her
back."

"You should not let any fellow laugh at your sister, Phil----"

"Oh, as for that! they are all as thick with her as I am, and why should I interfere? But I
promise you nobody shall cut a joke upon my Nell."

"I should hope not, indeed," said Elinor, indignant; "but as for your 'fellows,' Phil, as you
call them, you mustn't be angry with me, but I don't much like those gentlemen; they are a
little rude and rough. They shall not call me by my Christian name, or anything but my own
formal----"

"Mrs. Compton," he said, seizing her in his arms, "you little duck! they'll be as frightened
of you as if you were fifty. But you mustn't spoil good company, Nell. I shall like you to
keep them at a distance, but you mustn't go too far; and, above all, my pet, you mustn't put
out the Jew. I calculate on being a lot there; they have a nice house and a good table, and
all that, and Prestwich is glad of somebody to help about his horses. You mustn't set up any
of your airs with the Jew."

"I don't know what you mean by my airs, Phil."

"Oh, but I do, and they're delicious, Nell: half like a little girl and half like a queen:
but it will never do to make the Jew feel small in her own set. Hallo! there's some one tumbling
alone over the stones on that precious road of yours. I believe it's that cart from the station
after all."

"No," said Elinor, "it is only one of the tradespeople. You certainly are anxious about those
carts from the station, Phil."

"Not a bit!" he said, and then, after a moment, he added, "Yes, on the whole, I'd much rather
the man came, if he's coming while I'm here, and while you are with me, Nell; for I want you
to stick to me, and back me up. They might think I ought to go after that manager fellow and
spoil the wedding. Therefore mind you back me up."

"I can't think, dear Phil, what there is for me to do. I know nothing about the business nor
what has happened. You never told me anything, and how can I back you up about things I don't
know?"

"Oh, yes, you can," he said, "you'll soon see if the fellow comes; just you stand by me, whatever
I say. You mayn't know--or even I may seem to make a mistake; but you know me if you don't
know the circumstances, and I hope you can trust me, Nell, that it will be all right."

"But----" said Elinor, confused.

"Don't go on with your buts; there's a darling, don't contradict me. There is nothing looks
so silly to strangers as a woman contradicting every word a fellow says. I only want you to
stand by me, don't you know, that's all; and I'll tell you everything about it after, when
there's time."

"Tell me about it now," said Elinor; "you may be sure I shall be interested; there's plenty
of time now."

"Talk about business to you! when I've only a single day, and not half time enough, you little
duck, to tell you what a darling you are, and how I count every hour till I can have you all
to myself. Ah, Nell, Nell, if that day were only here----"

And then Phil turned to those subjects and those methods which cast so much confusion into
the mind of Mrs. Dennistoun, when practised under her sedate and middle-aged eyes. But Elinor,
as has been said, did not take exactly the same view.

Presently they went to luncheon, and Phil secured himself a place at table commanding the road.
"I never knew before how jolly it was," he said, "though everything is jolly here. And that
peep of the road must give you warning when any invasion is coming."

"It is too far off for that," said Mrs. Dennistoun.

"Oh, no, not for sharp eyes. Nell there told me who several people were--those white horses--the
people at--where did you say, Nell?"

"Reddown, mamma--the Philistines, as you call them, that are always dashing about the country--nouveaux
riches, with the finest horses in the county."

"I like the nouveaux riches for that," said Phil (he did not go wrong in his French, which
was a great consolation to Elinor), "they like to have the best of everything. Your poor swell
has to take what he can get, but the parvenu's the man in these days; and then there was a
dog-cart, which she pronounced to be from the station, but which turned out to be the butcher,
or the baker, or the candle-stick maker----"

"It is really too far off to make sure of anything, except white horses."

"Ah, there's no mistaking them. I see something sweeping along, but that's a country wagon,
I suppose. It gives me a great deal of diversion to see the people on the road--which perhaps
you will think a vulgar amusement."

"Not at all," said Mrs. Dennistoun, politely, but she thought within herself how empty the
brain must be which sought diversion from the distant carriages passing two miles off: to be
sure across the combe, as the crow flies, it was not a quarter part so far as that.

"Phil thinks some one may possibly come to him on business--to explain things," said Elinor,
anxious on her part to make it clear that it was not out of mere vacancy that her lover had
watched so closely the carriages on the road.

"Unfortunately, there is something like a smash," he said; "they'll keep it out of the papers
if they can, but you may see it in the papers; the manager has run away, and there's a question
about some books. I don't suppose you would understand--they may come to me here about it,
or they may wait till I go back to town."

"I thought you were going to Ireland, Phil."

"So I shall, probably, just for three days--to fill up the time. One wants to be doing something
to keep one's self down. You can't keep quiet and behave yourself when you are going to be
married in a week: unless you're a little chit of a girl without any feelings," he said with
a laugh. And Elinor laughed too; while Mrs. Dennistoun sat as grave as a judge at the head
of the table. But Phil was not daunted by her serious face: so long as the road was quite clear
he had all the appearance of a perfectly easy mind.

"We have been talking about literature," he said. "I am a stupid fellow, as perhaps you know,
for that sort of thing. But Nell is to indoctrinate me. We mean to take a big box of books,
and I'm to be made to read poetry and all sorts of fine things in my honeymoon."

"That is a new idea," said Mrs. Dennistoun. "I thought Elinor meant to give up reading, on
the other hand, to make things square."

There was a little breath of a protest from Elinor. "Oh, mamma!" but she left the talk (he
could do it so much better) in Compton's hand.

"I expect to figure as a sort of prodigy in my family," he said; "we're not bookish. The Jew
goes in for French novels, but I don't intend to let Nell touch them, so you may be easy in
your mind."

"I have no doubt Lady Mariamne makes a good selection," said Mrs. Dennistoun.

"Not she! she reads whatever comes, and the more salt the better. The Jew is quite an emancipated
person. Don't you think she'll bore you rather in this little house? She carries bales of rubbish
with her wherever she goes, and her maid, and her dog, and I don't know what. If I were you
I'd write, or better wire, and tell her there's a capital train from Victoria will bring her
here in time for the wedding, and that it's a thousand pities she should disturb herself to
come for the night."

"If your sister can put up with my small accommodation, I shall of course be happy to have
her, whatever she brings with her," Mrs. Dennistoun said.

"Oh! it's not a question of putting up--she'd be delighted, I'm sure: but I think you'll find
her a great bore. She is exceedingly fussy when she has not all her things about her. However,
you must judge for yourself. But if you think better of it, wire a few words, and it'll be
all right. I'm to go to the old Rectory, Nell says."

"It is not a particularly old Rectory; it is a very nice, pleasant house. I think you will
find yourself quite comfortable--you and the gentleman----"

"Dick Bolsover, who is going to see me through it: and I daresay I should not sleep much, if
I were in the most luxurious bed in the world. They say a man who is going to be hanged sleeps
like a top, but I don't think I shall; what do you say, Nell?"

"Elinor, I should think, could have no opinion on the subject," said Mrs. Dennistoun, pale
with anger. "You will all dine here, of course. Some other friends are coming, and a cousin,
Mr. Tatham, of Tatham's Cross."

"Is that," said Phil, "the Cousin John?"

"John, I am sorry to say, is abroad; the long vacation is the worst time. It is his father
who is coming, and his sister, Mary Tatham, who is Elinor's bridesmaid--she and Miss Hudson
at the Rectory."

"Only two; and very sensible, instead of the train one sees, all thinking how best to show
themselves off. Dick Bolsover is man enough to tackle them both. He expects some fun, I can
tell you. What is there to be after we are gone, Nell?" He stopped and looked round with a
laugh. "Rather close quarters for a ball," he said.

"There will be no ball. You forget that when you take Elinor away I shall be alone. A solitary
woman living in a cottage, as you remark, does not give balls. I am much afraid that there
will be very little fun for your friend."

"Oh, he'll amuse himself well enough; he's the sort of fellow who always makes himself at home.
A Rectory will be great fun for him; I don't suppose he was ever in one before, unless perhaps
when he was a boy at school. Yes, as you say--what a lot of trouble it will be for you to be
sure: not as if Nell had a sister to enjoy the fun after. It's a thousand pities you did not
decide to bring her up to town, and get us shuffled off there. You might have got a little
house for next to nothing at this time of the year, and saved all the row, turning everything
upside down in this nice little place, and troubling yourself with visitors and so forth. But
one always thinks of that sort of thing too late."

"I should not have adopted such an expedient in any case. Elinor must be married among her
own people, wherever her lot may be cast afterwards. Everybody here has known her ever since
she was born."

"Ah, that's a thing ladies think of, I suppose," said Compton. He had stuck his glass into
his eye and was gazing out of the window. "Very jolly view," he continued. "And what's that,
Nell, raising clouds of dust? I haven't such quick eyes as you."

"I should think it must be a circus or a menagerie, or something, mamma."

"Very likely," said Mrs. Dennistoun. "They sometimes come this way on the road to Portsmouth,
and give little representations in all the villages, to the great excitement of the country folk."

"We are the country folk, and I feel quite excited," said Phil, dropping his glass. "Nell,
if there's a representation, you and I will go to-night."

"Oh, Phil, what----" Elinor was about to say folly: but she paused, seeing a look in his eye
which she had already learned to know, and added "fun," in a voice which sounded almost like
an echo of his own.

"There is nothing like being out in the wilderness like this to make one relish a little fun,
eh? I daresay you always go. The Jew is the one for every village fair within ten miles when
she is in the country. She says they're better than any play. Hallo! what is that?"

"It is some one coming round the gravel path."

A more simple statement could not be, but it made Compton strangely uneasy. He rose up hastily
from the table. "It is, perhaps, the man I am looking for. If you'll permit me, I'll go and see."

He went out of the room, calling Elinor by a look and slight movement of his head, but when
he came out into the hall was met by a trim clerical figure and genial countenance, the benign
yet self-assured looks of the Rector of the Parish: none other could this smiling yet important
personage be.

CHAPTER X.

The Rector came in with his smiling and rosy face. He was, as many of his parishioners thought,
a picture of a country clergyman. Such a healthy colour, as clear as a girl's, limpid blue
eyes, with very light eyelashes and eyebrows; a nice round face, "beautifully modelled," according
to Miss Sarah Hill, who did a little in that way herself, and knew how to approve of a Higher
Sculptor's work. And then the neatest and blackest of coats, and the whitest and stiffest of
collars. Mr. Hudson, I need scarcely say, was not so left to himself as to permit his clerical
character to be divined by means of a white tie. He came in, as was natural among country neighbours,
without thinking of any bell or knocker on the easily opened door, and was about to peep into
the drawing-room with "Anybody in?" upon his smiling lips, when he saw a gentleman approaching,
picking up his hat as he advanced. Mr. Hudson paused a moment in uncertainty. "Mr. Compton,
I am sure," he said, holding out both of his plump pink hands. "Ah, Elinor too! I was sure
I could not be mistaken. And I am exceedingly glad to make your acquaintance." He shook Phil's
hand up and down in a sort of see-saw. "Very glad to make your acquaintance! though you are
the worst enemy Windyhill has had for many a day--carrying off the finest lamb in all the fold."

"Yes, I'm a wolf, I suppose," said Phil. He went to the door and took a long look out while
Elinor led the Rector into the drawing-room. Then Mr. Compton lounged in after them, with his
hands in his pockets, and placed himself in the bow-window, where he could still see the white
line across the combe of the distant road.

"They'll think I have stolen a march upon them all, Elinor," said the Rector, "chancing upon
Mr. Compton like this, a quite unexpected pleasure. I shall keep them on the tenterhooks, asking
them whom they suppose I have met? and they will give everybody but the right person. What
a thing for me to have been the first person to see your intended, my dear! and I congratulate
you, Elinor," said the Rector, dropping his voice; "a fine handsome fellow, and such an air!
You are a lucky girl--" he paused a little and said, with a slight hesitation, in a whisper,
"so far as meets the eye."

"Oh, Mr. Hudson, don't spoil everything," said Elinor, in the same tone.

"Well, I cannot tell, can I, my dear?--the first peep I have had." He cleaved his throat and
raised his voice. "I believe we are to have the pleasure of entertaining you, Mr. Compton,
on a certain joyful occasion (joyful to you, not to us). I need not say how pleased my wife
and I and the other members of the family will be. There are not very many of us--we are only
five in number--my son, and my daughter, and Miss Dale, my wife's sister, but much younger
than Mrs. Hudson--who has done us the pleasure of staying with us for part of the year. I think
she has met you somewhere, or knows some of your family, or--something. She is a great authority
on noble families. I don't know whether it is because she has been a good deal in society,
or whether it is out of Debrett----"

"Nell, come and tell me what this is," Compton said.

"Oh, Phil! it is nothing, it is a carriage. I don't know what it is. Be civil to the Rector,
please."

"So I am, perfectly civil."

"You have not answered a single word, and he has been talking to you for ten minutes."

"Well, but he hasn't said anything that I can answer. He says Miss Something or other knows
my family. Perhaps she does. Well, much good may it do her! but what can I say to that? I am
sure I don't know hers. I didn't come here to be talked to by the Rector. Could we slip out
and leave him with your mother? That would suit his book a great deal better. Come, let's go."

"Oh! he is speaking to you, Phil."

Compton turned round and eyed the Rector. "Yes?" he said in so marked an interrogative that
Mr. Hudson stopped short and flushed. He had been talking for some time.

"Oh! I was not precisely asking a question," he said, in his quiet tones. "I was saying that
we believe and hope that another gentleman is coming with you--for the occasion."

"Dick Bolsover," said Compton, "a son of Lord Freshfield's; perhaps Miss ----, the lady you
were talking of, may know his family too. His brother got a little talked of in that affair
about Fille d'Or, don't you know, at Newmarket. But Dick is a rattling good fellow, doesn't
race, and has no vices. He is coming to stand by me and see that all's right."

"We shall be happy to see Mr. Bolsover, I am sure." The Rector rubbed his hands and said to
himself with pleasure that two Honourables in his quiet house was something to think of, and
that he hoped it would not turn the heads of the ladies, and make Alice expect--one couldn't
tell what. And then he said, by way of changing yet continuing the subject, "I suppose you've
been looking at the presents. Elinor must have shown you her presents."

"By Jove, I never thought of the presents. Have you got a lot, Nell?"

"She has got, if I may be allowed to answer for her, having known her all her life, a great
many pretty things, Mr. Compton. We are not rich, to be sure, her old friends here. We have
to content ourselves with but a small token of a great deal of affection; but still there are
a number of pretty things. Elinor, what were you thinking of, my dear, not to show Mr. Compton
the little set out which you showed us? Come, I should myself like to look them over again."

Phil gave another long look at the distant road, and then he thrust his arm into Elinor's and
said, "To be sure, come along, Nell. It will be something to do." He did not wait for the Rector
to pass first, which Elinor thought would have been better manners, but thrust her before him
quite regardless of the older people. "Let's see the trumpery," he said.

"Don't use such a word, Phil: the Rector will be so hurt."

"Oh, will he? did he work you an--antimacassar or something?"

"Phil, speak low at least. No, but his daughter did; and they gave me----"

"I know: a cardcase or a button-hook, or something. And how many biscuit-boxes have you got,
and clocks, and that sort of thing? I advise you to have an auction as soon as we get away.
Hallo! that's a nice little thing; look pretty on your pretty white neck I should say, Nell.
Who gave you that?" He took John's necklace out of its box where it had lain undisturbed until
now, and pulled it through his fingers. "Cost a pretty bit of money that, I should say. You
can raise the wind on it when we're down on our luck, Nell."

"My cousin John, whom you have heard me speak of, gave me that, Phil," said Elinor, with great
gravity. She thought it necessary, she could scarcely tell why, to make a stand for her cousin
John.

"Ah, I thought it was one of the disappointed ones," said Phil, flinging it back carelessly
onto the bed of white velvet where it had been fitted so exactly. "That's how they show their
spite; for of course I can't give you anything half as good as that."

"There was no disappointment in the matter," said Elinor, almost angry with the misconceptions
of her lover.

"You are a nice one," said Compton, taking her by the chin, "to tell me! as if I didn't know
the world a long sight better than you do, my little Nell."

The Rector, who was following slowly, for he did not like to go up-stairs in a hurry, saw this
attitude and drew back, a little scandalized. "Perhaps we were indiscreet to--to follow them
too closely," he said, disconcerted. "Please to go in first, Mrs. Dennistoun--the young couple
will not mind you."

Mr. Hudson was prim; but he was rather pleased to see that "the young couple" were, as he said,
so fond of each other. He went into the room under the protection of the mother--blushing a
little. It reminded him, as he said afterwards, of his own young days; but it was only natural
that he should walk up direct to the place where his kettle stood conspicuous, waiting only
the spark of a match to begin to boil the water for the first conjugal tea. It appeared to
him a beautiful idea as he put his head on one side and looked at it. It was like the inauguration
of the true British fireside, the cosy privacy in which, after the man had done his work, the
lady awaited him at home, with the tea-kettle steaming. A generation before Mr. Hudson there
would have been a pair of slippers airing beside the fire. But neither of these preparations
supply the ideal of perfect happiness now.

"I say, where did you get these hideous things?" said Compton, approaching the table on which
"the silver" was laid out. By a special dispensation it was Lady Mariamne's dishes which caught
Phil's attention. "Some old grandmother, I suppose, that had 'em in the house. Hallo! if it
isn't the Jew! Nell, you don't mean to tell me you got these horrors from the Jew?"

"They are supposed to be--quite handsome," said Elinor, with a suppressed laugh. "We must not
criticise. It is very kind of people to send presents at all. We all know it is a very severe
tax--to those who have a great many friends----"

"The stingy old miser," said Compton. "Rolling in money, and to send you these! By Jove! there's
a neat little thing now that looks what it is; probably one of your nice country friends, Nell----"
(It was the kettle, as a kind Providence decreed; and both the ladies breathed an internal
thanksgiving.) "Shows like a little gem beside that old, thundering, mean-spirited Jew!"

"That," said the Rector, bridling a little and pink with pleasure, "is our little offering:
and I'm delighted to think that it should please so good a judge. It was chosen with great
care. I saw it first myself, and the idea flashed upon me--quite an inspiration--that it was
the very thing for Elinor; and when I went home I told my wife--the very thing--for her boudoir,
should she not be seeing company--or just for your little teas when you are by yourselves.
I could at once imagine the dear girl looking so pretty in one of those wonderful white garments
that are in the next room."

"Hallo!" said Compton, with a laugh, "do you show off your things in this abandoned way, Nell,
to the killingest old cov----"

She put her hand up to his mouth with a cry of dismay and laughter, but the Rector, with a
smile and another little blush, discreetly turned his back. He was truly glad to see that they
were so fond of each other, and thought it was pretty and innocent that they should not mind
showing it--but it was a little embarrassing for an old and prim clergyman to look on.

"What a pleasure it must be to you, my dear lady," he said when the young couple had gone:
which took place very soon, for Phil soon grew tired of the presents, and he was ill at ease
when there was no window from which he could watch the road--"what a pleasure to see them so
much attached! Of course, family advantage and position is always of importance--but when you
get devoted affection, too----"

"I hope there is devoted affection," said Mrs. Dennistoun; "at all events, there is what we
are all united in calling 'love,' for the present. He is in love with Elinor--I don't think
there can be much doubt of that."

"I did not of course know that he was here," said the Rector, with some hesitation. "I came
with the intention of speaking--I am very sorry to see in the papers to-day something about
that Joint-Stock Company of which Mr. Compton was a director. It's rather a mysterious paragraph:
but it's something about the manager having absconded, and that some of the directors are said
to be involved."

"Do you mean my future son-in-law?" she said, turning quickly upon him.

"Good heavens, no! I wouldn't for the world insinuate---- It was only that one felt a desire
to know. Just upon the eve of a marriage it's--it's alarming to hear of a business the bridegroom
is involved in being--what you may call broken up."

"That was one of the things Mr. Compton came to tell us about," said Mrs. Dennistoun. "He said
he hoped it might be kept out of the papers, but that some of the books have got lost or destroyed.
I am afraid I know very little about business. But he has lost very little--nothing to speak
of--which was all that concerned me."

"To be sure," said the Rector, but in a tone not so assured as his words. "It is not perhaps
quite a nice thing to be director of a company that--that collapses in this way. I fear some
poor people will lose their money. I fear there will be things in the papers."

"On what ground?" she said. "Oh, I don't deny there may be some one to blame; but Mr. Compton
was, I suspect, only on the board for the sake of his name. He is not a business man. He did
it, as so many do, for the sake of a pretence of being in something. And then, I believe, the
directors got a little by it; they had a few hundreds a year."

"To be sure," said Mr. Hudson, but still doubtfully; and then he brightened up. "For my part,
I don't believe there is a word of truth in it. Since I have seen him, indeed, I have quite
changed my opinion--a fine figure of a man, looking an aristocrat every inch of him. Such a
contrast and complement to our dear Elinor--and so fond of her. A man like that would never
have a hand in any sham concern. If it was really a bogus company, as people say, he must be
one of the sufferers. That is quite my decided opinion; only the ladies, you know--the ladies
who have not seen him, and who are so much more suspicious by nature (I don't know that you
are, my dear Mrs. Dennistoun), would give me no rest. They thought it was my duty to interfere.
But I am sure they are quite wrong."

To think that it was the ladies of the Rector's family who were interfering made Mrs. Dennistoun
very wroth. "Next time they have anything to say, you should make them come themselves," she said.

"Oh, they would not do that. They say it is the clergyman's business, not theirs. Besides,
you know, I have not time to read all the papers. We get the Times, and Mary Dale has the Morning
Post, and another thing that is all about stocks and shares. She has such a head for business--far
more than I can pretend to. She thought----"

"Mr. Hudson, I fear I do not wish to know what was thought by Miss Dale."

"Well, you are, perhaps, right, Mrs. Dennistoun. She is only a woman, of course, and she may
make mistakes. It is astonishing, though, how often she is right. She has a head for business
that might do for a Chancellor of the Exchequer. She made me sell out my shares in that Red
Gulch--those American investments have most horrible names--just a week before the smash came,
all from what she had read in the papers. She knows how to put things together, you see. So
I have reason to be grateful to her, for my part."

"And what persuaded you, here at Windyhill, a quiet clergyman, to put money in any Red Gulch?
It is a horrible name!"

"Oh, it was Mary, I suppose," said Mr. Hudson. "She is always looking out for new investments.
She said we should all make our fortunes. We did not, unfortunately. But she is so clever,
she got us out of it with only a very small loss indeed."

"No doubt she is very clever. I wish, though, that she would let us know definitely on what
ground----"

"Oh, there is no ground," cried the Rector. "Now that I have seen Mr. Compton I am certain
of it. I said to her before I left the Rectory, 'Now, my dear Mary, I am going like a lamb
to the slaughter. I have no reason to give if Mrs. Dennistoun should ask me, and you have no
reason to give. And she will probably put me to the door.' If I said that before I started,
you may fancy how much more I feel it now, when I have made Mr. Compton's acquaintance. A fine
aristocratic face, and all the ease of high breeding. There are only three lives--and those
not very good ones--between him and the title, I believe?"

"Two robust brothers, and an invalid who will probably outlive them all; that is, I believe,
the state of the case."

"Dear me, what a pity!" said the Rector, "for our little Elinor would have made a sweet little
Countess. She would grow a noble lady, like the one in Mr. Tennyson's poem. Well, now I must
be going, and I am extremely glad to have been so lucky as to come in just in time. It has
been the greatest pleasure to me to see them together--such a loving couple. Dear me, like
what one reads about, or remembers in old days, not like the commonplace pairs one has to do
with now."

Mrs. Dennistoun accompanied the Rector to the garden gate. She was half inclined to laugh and
half to be angry, and in neither mood did Mr. Hudson's insinuations which he made so innocently
have much effect upon her mind. But when she took leave of him at the gate and came slowly
back among her brilliant flower-beds, pausing here and there mechanically to pick off a withered
leaf or prop up the too heavy head of a late rose; her mind began to take another turn. She
had always been conscious of an instinctive suspicion in respect to her daughter's lover. Probably
only, she said to herself, because he was her daughter's lover, and she was jealous of the
new devotion that withdrew from her so completely the young creature who had been so fully
her own. That is a hard trial for a woman to undergo. It is only to be borne when she, too,
is fascinated by her future son-in-law, as happens in some fortunate cases. Otherwise, a woman
with an only child is an alarming critic to encounter. She was not fascinated at all by Phil.
She was disappointed in Elinor, and almost thought her child not so perfect as she had believed,
when it proved that she could be fascinated by this man. She disliked almost everything about
him--his looks, the very air which the Rector thought so aristocratic, his fondness for Elinor,
which was not reverential enough to please the mother, and his indifference, nay, contempt,
for herself, which was not calculated to please any woman. She had been roused into defence
of him in anger at the interference, and at the insinuation which had no proof; but as that
anger died away, other thoughts came into her mind. She began to put the broken facts together
which already had roused her to suspicion: his sudden arrival, so unexpected; walking from
the station--a long, very long walk--carrying his own bag, which was a thing John Tatham did,
but not like Phil Compton. And then she remembered, suddenly, his anxiety about the carriage
on the distant road, his care to place himself where he could see it. She had thought with
a little scorn that this was a proof of his frivolity, of the necessity of seeing people, whoever
these people might be. But now there began to be in it something that could have a deeper meaning.
For whom was he looking? Who might be coming? Stories she had heard of fugitives from justice,
of swindlers taking refuge in the innocence of their families, came up into her mind. Could
it be possible that Elinor's pure name could be entangled in such a guilty web as this?

CHAPTER XI.

"Funny old poop!" said Compton. "And that is your Rector, Nell. I shall tell Dick there's rare
fun to be had in that house: but not for me. I know what I shall be thinking of all the time
I'm there. Odious little Nell! to interfere like this with a fellow's fun. But I say, who's
that woman who knows me or my family?--much good may it do her, as I said before. Tell me,
Nell, did she speak ill of me?"

"Oh, Phil, how could you ask? or what would it matter if she spoke ever so ill?"

"She did then," he said with a graver face. "Somebody was bound to do it. And what did she say?"

"Oh, what does it matter, Phil? I don't remember; nothing of any consequence. We paid no attention,
of course, neither mamma nor I."

"That was plucky of the old girl," said Compton. "I didn't suppose you would give ear, my Nell.
Ain't so sure about her. If I'd been your father, my pet, I should never have given you to
Phil Compton. And that's the fact: I wonder if the old lady would like to reconsider the situation
now."

"Phil!" said Elinor, clinging to his arm.

"Perhaps it would be best for you if you were to do so, Nell, or if she were to insist upon
it. Eh! You don't know me, my darling, that's the fact. You're too good to understand us. We're
all the same, from the old governor downwards--a bad lot. I feel a kind of remorseful over
you, child, to-day. That rosy old bloke, though he's a snob, makes a man think of innocence
somehow. I do believe you oughtn't to marry me, Nell."

"Oh, Phil! what do you mean? You cannot mean what you say."

"I suppose I don't, or I shouldn't say it, Nell. I shouldn't certainly, if I thought you were
likely to take my advice. It's a kind of luxury to tell you we're a bad lot, and bid you throw
me over, when I know all along you won't."

"I should think not indeed," she said, clinging to him and looking up in his face. "Do you
know what my cous--I mean a friend, said to me on that subject?"

"You mean your cousin John, whom you are always quoting. Let's hear what the fellow said."

"He said--that I wasn't a girl to put up with much, Phil. That I wasn't one of the patient
kind, that I would not bear---- I don't know what it was I would not bear; but you see you
must consider my defects, which you can understand well enough, whether I can understand yours
or not."

"That you could not put up with--that you could not bear? that meant me, Nell. He had been
talking to you on the same subject, me and my faults. Why didn't you listen to him? I suppose
he wanted you to have him instead of me."

"Phil! how dare you even think of such a thing? It is not true."

"Wasn't it? Then he is a greater fool than I took him for, and his opinion's no good. So you're
a spitfire, are you? Can't put up with anything that doesn't suit you? I don't know that I
should have found that out."

"I am afraid though that it is true," she said, half-laughingly looking up at him. "Perhaps
you will want to reconsider too."

"If you don't want it any more than I want it, Nell---- What's that?" he cried hastily, changing
his expression and attitude in a moment. "Is that one of your neighbours at the gate?"

Elinor looked round, starting away a little from his side, and saw some one--a man she had
never seen before--approaching along the path. She was just about to say she did not know who
it was when Phil, to her astonishment, stepped past her, advancing to meet the newcomer. But
as he did so he put out his hand and caught her as he passed, leading her along with him.

"Mind what I said, and stick to me," he said, in a whisper; then--

"Stanfield!" he cried with an air of perfect ease and cordiality, yet astonishment. "I thought
it looked like you, but I could not believe my eyes."

"Mr. Compton!" said the other. "So you are here. I have been hunting after you all over the
place. I heard only this morning this was a likely spot."

"A very likely spot!" said Phil. "I suppose you know the good reason I have for being in these
parts. Elinor, this is Mr. Stanfield, who has to do with our company, don't you know. But I
say, Stanfield, what's all this row in the papers? Is it true that Brown's bolted? I should
have taken the first train to see if I could help; but my private affairs are most urgent just
at this moment, as I suppose you know."

"I wish you had come," said the other; "it would have looked well, and pleased the rest of
the directors. There has been some queer business--some of the books abstracted or destroyed,
we can't tell which, and no means of knowing how we stand."

"Good Heavens!" said Phil, "to cover that fellow's retreat."

"It you mean Brown, it was not he. They were all there safe enough after he was gone; somebody
must have got in by night and made off with them, some one that knew all about the place; the
watchman saw a light, but that's all. It's supposed there must have been something compromising
others besides Brown. He could not have cheated the company to such an extent by himself."

"Good Heavens!" cried Phil again in natural horror; "I wish I had followed my impulse and gone
up to town straight: but it was very vague what was in the papers; I hoped it might not have
been our place at all. And I say, Stanfield--who's the fellow they suspect?" Elinor had disengaged
herself from Compton's arm; she perceived vaguely that the stranger paused before he replied,
and that Phil, facing him with a certain square attitude of opposition which affected her imagination
vaguely, though she did not understand why--was waiting with keen attention for his reply.
She said, a little oppressed by the situation, "Phil, perhaps I had better go."

"Don't go," he said; "there's nothing secret to say. If there's anyone suspected it must very
soon be known."

"It's difficult to say who is suspected," said the stranger, confused. "I don't know that there's
much evidence. You've been in Scotland?"

"Yes, till the other day, when I came down here to see----" He paused and turned upon Elinor
a look which gave the girl the most curious incomprehensible pang. It was a look of love; but,
oh! heaven, was it a look called up that the other man might see? He took her hand in his,
and said lightly yet tenderly, "Let's see, what day was it? the sixth, wasn't it the sixth, Nell?"

A flood of conflicting thoughts poured through Elinor's mind. What did it mean? It was yesterday,
she was about to say, but something stopped her, something in Phil's eye--in the touch of his
hand. There was something warning, almost threatening, in his eye. Stand by me; mind you don't
contradict me; say what I say. All these things which he had repeated again and again were
said once more in the look he gave her. "Yes," she said timidly, with a hesitation very unlike
Elinor, "it was the sixth." She seemed to see suddenly as she said the words that calendar
with the date hanging in the hall: the big 6 seemed to hang suspended in the air. It was true,
though she could not tell how it could be so.

"Oh," said Stanfield, in a tone which betrayed a little surprise, and something like disappointment,
"the sixth? I knew you had left Scotland, but we did not know where you had gone."

"That's not to be wondered at," said Phil, with a laugh, "for I should have gone to Ireland,
to tell the truth; I ought to have been there now. I'm going to-morrow, ain't I, Nell? I had
not a bit of business to be here. Winding up affairs in the bachelor line, don't you know;
but I had to come on my way west to see this young lady first. It plays the deuce and all with
one's plans when there's such a temptation in the way."

"You could have gone from Scotland to Ireland," said Stanfield, gravely, "without coming to
town at all."

"Very true, old man. You speak like a book. But, as you perceive, I have not gone to Ireland
at all; I am here. Depends upon your motive, I suppose, which way you go."

"It is a good way roundabout," said the other, without relaxing the intent look on his face.

"Well," said Phil, "that's as one feels. I go by Holyhead wherever I may be--even if I had
nowhere else to go to on the way."

"And Mr. Compton got here on the sixth?--this is the eighth," said the stranger, pointedly.
He turned to Elinor, and it seemed to the girl that his eyes, though they were not remarkable
eyes, went through and through her. He spoke very slowly, with a curious meaning. "But it was
on the sixth, you say, that he got here?"

That big 6 on the calendar stood out before her eyes; it seemed to cover all the man's figure
that stood before her. Elinor's heart and mind went through the strangest convulsion. Was it
false--was it true? What was she saying? What did it all mean? She repeated mechanically, "It
was on the sixth," and then she recovered a kind of desperate courage, and throwing off the
strange spell that seemed to be upon her, "Is there any reason," she asked, suddenly, with
a little burst of impatience, looking from one to another, "why it should not be the sixth,
that you repeat it so?"

"I beg your pardon," said the stranger, visibly startled. "I did not mean to imply--only thought----Pray,
Mr. Compton, tell the lady I had no intention of offending. I never supposed----"

Phil's laugh, loud and clear, rang through the stillness of the afternoon. "He's so used to
fibs, he thinks everybody's in a tale," said Phil, "but I can assure you he is a very good
fellow, and a great friend of mine, and he means no harm, Nell."

Elinor made Mr. Stanfield an extremely dignified bow. "I ought to have gone away at once, and
left you to talk over your business," she said, turning away, and Phil did not attempt to detain
her. Then the natural rural sense of hospitality came over Elinor. She turned back to find
the two men looking after her, standing where she had left them. "I am sure," she said, "that
mamma would wish me to ask the gentleman if he would stay to dinner--or at least come in with
you, Phil, to tea."

Mr. Stanfield took off his hat with anxious politeness, and exclaimed hastily that he must
go back to town by the next train, and that the cab from the station was waiting to take him.
And then she left them, and walked quietly away. She was almost out of hearing before they
resumed their conversation; that is, she was beyond the sound, not of their voices, but of
what they said. The murmur of the voices was still audible when she got to her favourite seat
on the side of the copse looking down the combe. It was a very retired and silent place, not
visible from either the cottage or the garden. And there Elinor took refuge in the quiet and
hush of the declining day. She was in a great tremor of agitation and excitement as she sat
down upon the rustic seat--so great a tremor that she had scarcely been able to walk steadily
down the roughly-made steps--a tremor which had grown with every step she took. She did not
in the least understand the transaction in which she had been engaged. It was something altogether
strange to her experiences, without any precedent in her life. What was it she had been called
upon to do? What had she said, and why had she been made to say it? Her heart beat so that
she put her two hands upon it crossed over her breast to keep it down, lest it should burst
away. She had the sensation of having been brought before some tribunal, put suddenly to the
last shift, made to say--what, what? She was so bewildered that she could not tell. Was it
the truth, said with the intention to deceive--was it----? She could not tell. There was that
great numeral wavering in the air, stalking along with her like a ghost. 6--. She had read
it in all innocence, they had all read it, and nobody had said it was wrong. No one was very
careful about the date in the cottage. If it was right, if it was wrong, Elinor could not tell.
But yet somehow she was conscious that the man to whom she had spoken had been deceived. And
Phil! and Phil! what had he meant, adjuring her to stick to him, to stand by him, not to contradict
him? Elinor's mind was in such a wild commotion that she could not answer these inquiries.
She could not feel that she had one solid step of ground to place herself upon in the whirlwind
which swept her about and about. Had she--lied? And why had he asked her to lie? And what,
oh, what did it all mean?

One thing that at last appeared to her in the chaos which seemed like something solid that
she could grasp at was that Phil had never changed in his aspect. The other man had been very
serious, staring at her as if to intimidate her, like a man who had something to find out;
but Phil had been as careless, as indifferent, as he appeared always to be. He had not changed
his expression. It is true there was that look in which there was at once an entreaty and a
command--but only she had seen that, and perhaps it was merely the emotion, the excitement,
the strange feeling of having to face the world for him, and say----what, what? Was it simply,
the truth, nothing but the truth, or was it---- Again Elinor's mind began to whirl. It was
the truth: she could see now that big 6 on the calendar distinct as the sunshine. And yet it
was only yesterday--and there was 8 this morning. Had she gone through an intervening dream
for a whole day without knowing it; or had she, Elinor--she who would not have done it to save
her life--told--a lie for Phil? And why should he want her to tell a lie?

Elinor got up from her seat, and stood uncertain, with a cold dew on her forehead, and her
hands clasping and holding each other. Should she go back to them and say there must be some
mistake--that though she had said the truth it was not true, that there was some mistake, some
dreadful mistake! There was no longer any sound of voices where she was. The whole incident
seemed to have died out. The sudden commotion of Phil's visit and everything connected with
it had passed away. She was alone in the afternoon, in the hush of nature, looking over the
combe, listening to the rustle of the trees, hearing the bees drone homeward. Had Phil ever
been here at all? Had he watched the distant road winding over the slopes for some one whom
he had expected to come after him all the time? Had he ever told her to stand by him? to say
what he said, to back him up? Had there ever been another man standing with that big 6 wavering
between her and him like a ghost? Had all that been at all, or was it merely a foolish dream?
And ought she to go back now, and find the man before he disappeared, and tell him it was all
true, yet somehow a dreadful, dreadful mistake?

Elinor sat down again abruptly on her seat, and put her handkerchief to her forehead and pushed
back the damp clusters of her hair, turning her face to the wind to get a little refreshment
and calm, if that were possible. She heard in the sunny distance behind her, where the garden
and the peaceful house lay in the light, the clang of the gate, a sound which could not be
mistaken. The man then had gone--if there was anything to rectify in what she said it certainly
could not be rectified now--he was gone. The certainty came to her with a feeling of relief.
It had been horrible to think of standing before the two men again and saying--what could she
have said? She remembered now that it was not her assertion alone, but that it all hung together,
a whole structure of incidents, which would be put wrong if she had said it was a mistake--a
whole account of Phil's time, how it had been passed--which was quite true, which he had told
them on his arrival; how he had been going to Ireland, and had stopped, longing for a glimpse
of her, his bride, feeling that he must have her by him, see her once again before he came
for her to fetch her away. He had told the ladies at the cottage the very same, and of course
it was true. Had he not come straight from Scotland with his big bundle of game, the grouse
and partridges which had already been shared with all the friends about? Was he not going off
to Ireland to-morrow to fulfil his first intention? It was all quite right, quite true, hanging
perfectly together--except that curious falling out of a day. And then again Elinor's brain
swam round and round. Had he been two days at the cottage instead of one, as he said? Was it
there that the mistake lay? Had she been in such a fool's paradise having him there, that she
had not marked the passage of time--had it all been one hour of happiness flying like the wind?
A blush, partly of sweet shame to think that this was possible, that she might have been such
a happy fool as to ignore the divisions of night and day, and partly of stimulating hope that
such might be the case, a wild snatch at justification of herself and him flushed over her
from head to foot, wrapping her in warmth and delight; and then this all faded away again and
left her as in ashes--black and cold. No! everything, she saw, now depended upon what she had
been impelled to say; the whole construction, Phil's account of his time, his story of his
doings--all would have fallen to pieces had she said otherwise. Body and soul, Elinor felt
herself become like a machine full of clanging wheels and beating pistons, her heart, her pulses,
her breath, all panting, beating, bursting. What did it mean? What did it mean? And then everything
stood still in a horrible suspense and pause.

She began to hear voices again in the distance and raised her head, which she had buried in
her hands--voices that sounded so calmly in the westering sunshine, one answering another,
everything softened in the golden outdoor light. At first as she raised herself up she thought
with horror that it was the man, the visitor whom she had supposed to be gone, returning with
Phil to give her the opportunity of contradicting herself, of bringing back that whirlwind
of doubt and possibility. But presently her excited senses perceived that it was her mother
who was walking calmly through the garden talking with Phil. There was not a tone of excitement
in the quiet voices that came gradually nearer and nearer, till she could hear what they were
saying. It was Phil who was speaking, while her mother now and then put in a word. Elinor did
not wish on ordinary occasions for too many private talks between her mother and Phil. They
rubbed each other the wrong way, they did not understand each other, words seemed to mean different
things in their comprehension of them. She knew that her lover would laugh at "the old girl,"
which was a phrase which offended Elinor deeply, and Mrs. Dennistoun would become stiffer and
stiffer, declaring that the very language of the younger generation had become unintelligible
to her. But to hear them now together was a kind of anodyne to Elinor, it stayed and calmed
her. The cold moisture dried from her forehead. She smoothed her hair instinctively with her
hand, and put herself straight in mind as she did with that involuntary action in outward appearance,
feeling that no sign of agitation, no trouble of demeanour must meet her mother's eye. And
then the voices came so near that she could hear what they were saying. They were coming amicably
together to her favourite retreat.

"It's a very queer thing," said Phil, "if it is as they think, that somebody went there the
night before last and cleared off the books. Well, not all the books, some that are supposed
to contain the secret transactions. Deucedly cleverly done it must have been, if it was done
at all, for nobody saw the fellow, or fellows, if there were more than one----"

"Why do you doubt?" said Mrs. Dennistoun. "Is there any way of accounting for it otherwise?"

"Oh, a very good way--that Brown, the manager, simply took them with him, as he would naturally
do, if he wasn't a fool. Why should he go off and leave papers that would convict him, for
the pleasure of involving other fellows, and ruining them too?"

"Are there others, then, involved with him?" Oh, how calm, how inconceivably calm, was Mrs.
Dennistoun's voice! Had she been asking the gardener about the slugs that eat the young plants
it would have been more disturbed.

"Well, Stanfield seemed to think so. He's a sort of head clerk, a fellow enormously trusted.
I shouldn't wonder if he was at the bottom of it himself, they're so sure of him," said Phil,
with a laugh. "He says there's a kind of suspicion of two or three. Clumsy wretches they must
be if they let themselves be found out like that. But I don't believe it. I believe Brown's
alone in it, and that it's him that's taken everything away. I believe it's far the safest
way in those kind of dodges to be alone. You get all the swag, and you're in no danger of being
rounded on, don't you know--till you find things are getting too hot, and you cut away."

"I don't understand the words you use, but I think I know what you mean," said Mrs. Dennistoun.
"How dreadful it is to think that in business, where honesty is the very first principle, there
should be such terrible plots and plans as those!"

"'Tis awful, isn't it?" said Phil, with a laugh that seemed to ring all down the combe, and
came back in echoes from the opposite slope, where in the distance the cab from the station
was seen hastening back towards the railway in a cloud of dust. The laugh was like a trumpet
of triumph flung across the distance at the discomfited enemy thus going off drooping in the
hurry of defeat. He added, "But you may imagine, even if I had known anything, he wouldn't
have got much out of me. I didn't know anything, however, I'm very glad to say."

"That is always the best," said Mrs. Dennistoun, with a certain grave didactic tone. "And here
is Elinor, as I thought. When one cannot find her anywhere else she's sure to be found here."

CHAPTER XII.

"Well," said Compton, placing himself beside her, "here you are, Nell; kind of the old lady
to bring me, wasn't it? I should never have found you out by myself."

"Has he gone, Phil?" Elinor raised her scared face from her hands, and gave him a piteous look.

"Why, Nell! you are trembling like a leaf. Was it frightened, my pretty pet, for Stanny? Stanny's
gone off with his tail between his legs. Not a bit of starch left in him. As limp a lawyer
as ever you saw."

"Was he a lawyer?" she said, not knowing why she said it, for it mattered nothing at all to
Elinor what the man was.

"Not exactly; and yet, I suppose, something of the kind. He is the one that knows about law
points, and such things. But now he's as quiet as a lamb, thanks to you."

"Phil," she cried, "what did you make me say? I don't know what I have done. I have done something
dreadful--deceived the man, as good as told him a lie."

"You told him the truth," said Phil, with a laugh, "in the most judgmatical way. You stuck
to it like a--woman. There's nothing like a woman for sticking to a text. You didn't say a
word too much. And I say, Nell, that little defiant bit of yours--'Was there any reason why
it shouldn't be the sixth?' was grand. That was quite magnificent, my pet. I never thought
you had such spirit in you."

"Oh, Phil," she cried, "why did you make me say it? What was it I said? I don't know; I don't
understand a bit. Whatever it was, I know that it was wrong. I deceived the man."

"That's not so great a sin," he said. "I've known worse things done. Put an old reynard off
the scent to save his prey. I don't see what's wrong in that, especially as the innocent chicken
to be saved was your own poor old Phil."

"Phil, Phil," she cried, "what could that man have done to you? What had put you in his power?
You have made me lose all my innocence. I have got horrible things in my head. What could he
have done to you that you made me tell a lie?"

"What lie did I make you tell? be reasonable; I did arrive on the sixth, you know that just
as well as I do. Don't you really remember the calendar in the hall? You saw it, Nell, as well
as I."

"I know, I know," she cried, putting her hands up to her eyes, "I see it everywhere staring
at me, that big, dreadful 6. But how is it the 8th now? There is something in it--something
I don't understand."

He laughed loudly and long: one of those boisterous laughs which always jarred upon Elinor.
"I don't in the least mind how it was," he said. "It was, and that's quite enough for me; and
let it be for you too, Nell. I hope you're not going to search into the origin of things like
this; we've quite enough to do in this world to take things as they come."

"Oh, Phil! if at least I could understand--I don't understand: or if I had not been made to
say what is so mysterious--what must be false."

"Hush, Nell; how could it be false when you saw with your own eyes it was true? Now let us
be done with this, my darling. The incident is terminated, as the French say. I came here as
fast as I could come to have a good laugh with you over it, and lo! you're nearer crying. Why
should you have Stanny on your conscience, Nell? a fellow that would like no better than to
hang me if he could get the chance."

"But Phil, Phil--oh, tell me, what could this man have done to you? Why are you afraid of him?
Why, why have you made me tell him----"

"Now, Nell, no exaggerated expression. It was a fact you told him, according to the best of
evidence; and what he could have done to me is just this--he might have given me a deal of
trouble, and put off our marriage. I should have had to go back to town, and my time would
have been taken up with finding out about those books, and our marriage would have been put
off; that's what he could have done."

"Is that all?" cried Elinor, "was that all?"

"All!" he said, with that loud laugh again; "you don't mind a bit how you hurt a fellow's pride,
and his affections, and all that. Do you mean to say, you hard-hearted little coquette, that
you wouldn't mind? I don't believe you would mind! Here am I counting the hours, and you, you
little cold puss, you aggravating little----"

"Oh, Phil, don't talk such nonsense. If we were to be separated, for a week or a month, what
could that matter, in comparison with saying what wasn't----"

"Hush," he said, putting his hand to her mouth. "It's not nice of you to take it so easily,
Nell. I'd tell as many what-d'ye-call-'ems as you like, rather than put it off an hour. Why,
feeling apart (and I don't think you've any feeling, you little piece of ice), think how inconvenient
it would have been; the people all arriving; the breakfast all ready; the Rector with his surplice
on; and no wedding! Fancy the Jew with all her fallals, on the old lady's hands, and your cousin
John----"

"I have told you already, Phil, my cousin John will not be there."

"So much the better," he said, with a laugh, "I don't want him to be there--shows his sense,
when his nose is put out of joint, to keep out of the way."

"I wish you would understand," she said, with a little vexation, "that John is not put out
of joint, as you say in that odious way. He has never been anything more to me, nor I to him,
than we are now--like brother and sister."

"The more fool he," said Compton, "to have the chance of a nice girl like you, Nell, and not
to go in for it. But I don't believe a bit in the brother and sister dodge."

"We will be just the same all our lives," cried Elinor.

"Not if I know it," said Phil. "I'm an easy-going fellow in most ways, but you'll find I'm
an old Turk about you, my little duck of a Nell. No amateur brother for me. If you can't get
along with your old Phil, without other adorers----"

"Phil! as if I should ever think or care whether there was another man in the world!"

"Oh, that's going too far," he said, laughing. "I shan't mind a little flirtation. You may
have a man or two in your train to fetch and carry, get your shawl for you, and call your carriage,
and so forth; but no serious old hand, Nell--nothing to remind you that there was a time when
you didn't know Phil Compton." His laugh died away at this point, and for a moment his face
assumed that grave look which changed its character so much. "If you don't come to repent before
then that you ever saw that fellow's ugly face, Nell----"

"Phil, how could I ever repent? Nobody but you should dare to say such a thing to me!"

"I believe that," he said. "If that old John of yours tried it on---- Well, my pet, he is your
old John. You can't change facts, even if you do throw the poor fellow over. Now, here's a
new chance for all of them, Nell. I shouldn't wonder a bit if you had another crop of letters
bidding you look before you leap. That Rectory woman, what's her name? that knows my family.
You'll see she'll have some new story before we're clear of her. They'll never stop blackguarding
me, I know, until you're Phil Compton yourself, my beauty. I wish that day was come. I'm afraid
to go off again and leave you, Nell. They'll be putting something into your head, or the old
lady's. Let's get it over to-morrow morning, and come to Ireland with me; you've never been there."

"Phil, what nonsense! mamma would go out of her senses."

"My pet, what does it matter? She'd come back to them again as soon as we were gone, and think
what a botheration spared her! All the row of receiving people, turning the house upside down.
And here I am on the spot. And what do you want with bridesmaids and so forth? You've got all
your things. Suppose we walk out to church to-morrow before breakfast, Nell----"

"Phil, you are mad, I think; and why should we do such a thing, scandalizing everybody? But
of course you don't mean it. You are excited after seeing that man."

"Excited about Stanny!--not such a fool; Stanny is all square, thanks to---- But what I want
is just to take you up in my arms, like this, and run off with you, Nell. Why we should call
the whole world to watch us while we take that swing off--into space."

"Phil!"

"So it is, for you, Nell. You don't know a bit what's going to happen. You don't know where
I'm going to take you, and what I'm going to do with you, you little innocent lamb in the wolf's
grip. I want to eat you up, straight off. I shall be afraid up to the last moment that you'll
escape me, Nell."

"I did not know that you were so fond of innocence," said Elinor, half afraid of her lover's
vehemence, and trying to dispel his gravity with a laugh. "You used to say you did not believe
in the ingénue."

"I believe in you," he said, with an almost fierce pressure of her arm; then, after a pause,
"No, I don't believe in women at all, Nell, only you. They're rather worse than men, which
is saying a good deal. What would the Jew care if we were all drawn and quartered; so long
as she had all her paraphernalia about her and got everything she wanted? For right-down selfishness
commend me to a woman. A fellow may have gleams of something better about him, like me, warning
you against myself."

"It is a droll way of warning me against yourself to want to carry me off to-morrow."

"It's all the same thing," he said. "I've warned you that those old hags are right, and I'm
not good enough for you, not fit to come near you, Nell. But if the sacrifice is to be, let's
get it over at once, don't let us stand and think of it. I'm capable of jilting you," he said,
"leaving you planté là, all out of remorse of conscience; or else just catching you up in my
arms, like this, and carrying you off, never to be seen more."

"You are very alarming," said Elinor. "I don't know what you mean. You can be off with your
bargain if you please, Phil; but you had better make up your mind at once, so that mamma may
countermand her invitations, and stop Gunter from sending the cake."

(It was Gunter who was the man in those days. I believe people go to Buszard now.)

He gave her again a vehement hug, and burst into a laugh. "I might jilt you, Nell; such a thing
is on the cards. I might leave you in the lurch at the church door; but when you talk of countermanding
the cake, I can't face that situation. Society would naturally be up in arms about that. So
you must take your chance like the other innocents. I'll eat you up as gently as I can, and
hide my tusks as long as it's possible. Come on, Nell, don't let us sit here and get the mopes,
and think of our consciences. Come and see if that show is in the village. Life's better than
thinking, old girl."

"Do you call the show in the village, life?" she said, half pleased to rouse him, half sorry
to be thus carried away.

"Every show is life," said Phil, "and everywhere that people meet is better than anywhere where
you're alone. Mind you take in that axiom, Nell. It's our rule of life, you know, among the
set you're marrying into. That's how the Jew gets on. That's how we all get on. By this time
next year you'll be well inured into it like all the rest. That's what your Rector never taught
you, I'll be bound; but you'll see the old fellow practises it whenever he has a chance. Why,
there they begin, tootle-te-too. Come on, Nell, and don't let us lose the fun."

He drew her along hastily, hurrying while the flute and the drum began to perform their parts.
Sound spreads far in that tranquil country, where no railway was visible, and where the winds
for the moment were still. It was Pan's pipes that were being played, attracting a few stragglers
from the scattered houses. Within a hundred yards from the church, at the corner of four roads,
stood the Bull's Head, with a cottage or two linked on to its long straggling front. And this
was all that did duty for a village at Windyhill. The Rectory stood back in its own copse,
surrounded by a growth of young birches and oak near the church. The Hills dwelt intermediate
between the Bull's Head and the ecclesiastical establishment. The school and schoolmaster's
house were behind the Bull. The show was surrounded by the children of the place, who looked
on silent with ecstasy, while a burly showman piped his pipes and beat his drum. A couple of
ostlers, with their shirt-sleeves rolled up to their shoulders, and one of them with a pail
in his hand, stood arrested in their work. And in the front of the spectators was Alick Hudson,
a sleepy-looking youth of twenty, who started and took his hands out of his pockets at sight
of Elinor. Mr. Hudson himself came walking briskly round the corner, swinging his cane with
the air of a man who was afraid of being too late.

"Didn't I tell you?" said Compton, pressing Elinor's arm.

As the tootle-te-too went on, other spectators appeared--the two Miss Hills, one putting on
her hat, the other hastily buttoning her jacket as they hurried up. "Oh, you here, Elinor!
What fun! We all run as if we were six years old. I'm going to engage the man to come round
and do it opposite Rosebank to amuse mother. She likes it as much as any of us, though she
doesn't see very well, poor dear, nor hear either. But we must always consider that the old
have not many amusements," said the elder Miss Hill.

"Though mother amuses herself wonderfully with her knitting," said Miss Sarah. "There's a sofa-cover
on the stocks for you, Elinor."

It appeared to be only at this moment that the sisters became aware of the presence of "the
gentleman" by whom Elinor stood. They had been too busy with their uncompleted toilettes to
observe him at first. But now that Miss Hill's hat was settled to her satisfaction, and the
blue veil tied over her face as she liked it to be, and Miss Sarah had at last succeeded, after
two false starts, in buttoning her jacket straight, their attention was released for other
details. They both gave a glance over Elinor at the tall figure on the other side, and then
looked at each other with a mutual little "Oh!" and nod of recognition. Then Miss Hill took
the initiative as became her dignity. "I hope you are going to introduce us to your companion,
Elinor," she said. "Oh, Mr. Compton, how do you do? We are delighted to make your acquaintance,
I am sure. It is charming to have an opportunity of seeing a person of so much importance to
us all, our dear Elinor's intended. I hope you know what a prize you are getting. You might
have sought the whole country over and you wouldn't have found a girl like her. I don't know
how we shall endure your name when you carry her away."

"Except, indeed," said Miss Sarah, "that it will be Elinor's name too."

"So here we all are again," said the Rector, gazing down tranquilly upon his flock, "not able
to resist a little histrionic exhibition--and Mr. Compton too, fresh from the great world.
I daresay our good friend Mrs. Basset would hand us out some chairs. No Englishman can resist
Punch. Alick, my boy, you ought to be at your work. It will not do to neglect your lessons
when you are so near your exam."

"No Englishman, father, can resist Punch," said the lad: at which the two ostlers and the landlord
of the Bull's Head, who was standing with his hands in his pockets in his own doorway, laughed
loud.

"Had the old fellow there," said Compton, which was the first observation he had made. The
ladies looked at him with some horror, and Alick a little flustered, half pleased, half horrified,
by this support, while the Rector laughed, but stiffly au bout des lèvres. He was not accustomed
to be called an old fellow in his own parish.

"The old fellows, as you elegantly say, Mr. Compton, have always the worst of it in a popular
assembly. Elinor, here is a chair for you, my love. Another one please, Mrs. Basset, for I
see Miss Dale coming up this way."

"By Jove," said Compton, under his breath. "Elinor, here's the one that knows society. I hope
she isn't such an old guy as the rest."

"Oh, Phil, be good!" said Elinor, "or let us go away, which would be the best."

"Not a bit," he said. "Let's see the show. I say, old man, where are you from last?"

"Down from Guildford ways, guv'nor--awful bad trade; not taken a bob, s' help me, not for three
days, and bed and board to get off o' that, me and my mate."

"Well, here is a nice little party for you, my man," said the Rector, "it is not often you
have such an audience--nor would I encourage it, indeed, if it were not so purely English an
exhibition."

"Master," said the showman, "worst of it is, nobody pays till we've done the show, and then
they goes away, and they've got it, don't you see, and we can't have it back once it's in their
insides, and there ain't nothink then, neither for my mate nor me."

"Here's for you, old fellow," said Phil. He took a sovereign from his waistcoat pocket and
chucked it with his thumbnail into the man's hand, who looked at it with astonished delight,
tossed it into the air with a grin, a "thank'ee, gentleman!" and a call to his "mate" who immediately
began the ever-exciting, ever-amusing drama. The thrill of sensation which ran through the
little assembly at this incident was wonderful. The children all turned from Punch to regard
with large open eyes and mouths the gentleman who had given a gold sovereign to the showman.
Alick Hudson looked at him with a grin of pleasure, a blush of envy on his face; the Rector,
with an expression of horror, slightly shaking his head; the Miss Hills with admiration yet
dismay. "Goodness, Sarah, they'll never come now and do it for a shilling to amuse mother!"
the elder of the sisters said.

Miss Dale came hurrying up while still the sensation lasted. "Here is a chair for you, Mary,"
said her brother-in-law, "and the play is just going to begin. I can't help shaking my head
when I think of it, but still you must hear what has just happened. Mr. Compton, let me present
you to my sister-in-law, Miss Dale. Mr. Compton has made the widow's heart, nay, not the widow's,
but the showman's heart to sing. He has presented our friend with a----"

"Mind you," said Phil, from behind Elinor's shoulders, "I've paid the fellow only for two."

At which the showman turned and winked at the Rector. To think that such a piece of audacity
could be! A dingy fellow in a velveteen coat, with a spotted handkerchief round his neck, and
a battered hat on his unkempt locks, with Pan's pipes at his mouth and a drum tied round his
waist--winked at the Rector! Mr. Hudson fell back a step, and his very lips were livid with
the indignity. He had to support himself on the back of the chair he had just given to Miss Dale.

"I think we are all forgetting our different positions in this world," he said.

"I ain't," said the showman, "not taking no advantage through the gentleman's noble ways. He's
a lord, he is, I don't make no doubt. And we're paid. Take the good of it, Guv'nor, and welcome;
all them as is here is welcome. My mate and I are too well paid. A gentleman like that good
gentleman, as is sweet upon a pretty young lady, and an open 'eart a-cause of her, I just wish
we could find one at every station; don't you, Joe?"

Joe assented, in the person of Mr. Punch, with a horrible squeak from within the tent.

The sensations of Elinor during this episode were peculiar and full of mingled emotion. It
is impossible to deny that she was proud of the effect produced by her lover. The sovereign
chucked into the showman's hand was a cheap way of purchasing a little success, and yet it
dazzled Elinor, and made her eyelids droop and her cheek light up with the glow of pleasure.
Amid all the people who would search for pennies, or perhaps painfully and not without reluctance
produce a sixpence to reward the humble artists, there was something in the careless familiarity
and indifference which tossed a gold coin at them which was calculated to charm the youthful
observer. Elinor felt the same mixture of pleasure and envy which had moved Alick Hudson; yet
it was not envy, for was not he her own who did this thing which she would have liked to have
done herself, overwhelming the poor tramps with delight? Elinor knew, as Alick also did, that
it would never have occurred to her to do it. She would have been glad to be kind to the poor
men, to give them a good meal, to speak to Basset at the Bull's Head in their favour that they
might be taken in for the night and made comfortable, but to open her purse and take a real
sovereign from it, a whole potential pound, would not have come into her head. Had such a thing
been done, for instance, by the united subscriptions of the party, in case of some peculiarly
touching situation, the illness of a wife, the loss of a child, it would have been done solemnly,
the Rector calling the men up, making a little speech to them, telling them how all the ladies
and gentlemen had united to make up this, and how they must be careful not to spend it unworthily.
Elinor thought she could see the little scene, and the Rector improving the occasion. Whereas
Phil spun the money through the air into the man's ready hand as if it had been a joke, a trick
of agility. Elinor saw that everybody was much impressed with the incident, and her heart went
forth upon a flood of satisfaction and content. And it was no premeditated triumph. It was
so noble, so accidental, so entirely out of his good heart!

When he hurried her home at the end of the performance, that Mrs. Dennistoun might not be kept
waiting, the previous events of the afternoon, and all that happened in the copse and garden,
had faded out of Elinor's mind. She forgot Stanfield and the 6th and everything about it. Her
embarrassment and trouble were gone. She went in gayly and told her mother all about this wonderful
incident. "The Rector was trying for a sixpence. But, mamma, Phil must not be so ready with
his sovereigns, must he? We shall have nothing to live upon if he goes chucking sovereigns
at every Punch and Judy he may meet."

CHAPTER XIII.

Phil Compton went off next morning by an early train, having in the meanwhile improved the
impression of him left upon the family in general, and specially upon Mrs. Dennistoun, to whom
he had talked with enthusiasm about Elinor, expressed indeed in terms unusual to her ears,
but perhaps only more piquant on that account, which greatly conciliated the mother. "Don't
you think," said the Honourable Phil, "because I speak a little free and am not one for tall
talk, that I don't know what she is. I've got no poetry in me, but for the freest goer and
the highest spirit, without a bit of vice in her, there never was one like Nell. The girls
of my set, they're not worthy to tie her shoes--thing I most regret is taking her among a lot
that are not half good enough for her. But you can't help your relations, can you? and you
have to stick to them for dozens of reasons. There's the Jew, when you know her she's not such
a bad sort--not generous, as you may see from what she's given Nell, the old screw: but yet
in her own way she stands by a fellow, and we'll need it, not having just the Bank of England
behind us. Her husband, old Prestwich, isn't bad for a man that has made his own money, and
they've got a jolly house, always something going on."

"But I hope," said Mrs. Dennistoun, "that as soon as these autumn visits are over you will
have a house of your own."

"Oh, that!" said Compton, with a wave of his hand, which left it in some doubt whether he was
simply throwing off the suggestion, or treating it as a foregone conclusion of which there
could be no doubt. "Nell," he went on, "gets on with the Jew like a house on fire--you see
they don't clash. Nell ain't one of the mannish sort, and she doesn't flirt--at least not as
far as I've seen----"

"I should hope not, indeed," said Mrs. Dennistoun.

"Oh, I'm not one of your curmudgeons. Where's the harm? But she don't, and there's an end of
it. She keeps herself to herself, and lets the Jew go ahead, and think she's the attraction.
And she'll please the old lord down to the ground. For he's an old-fashioned old coon, and
likes what he calls tenue, don't you know: but the end is, there ain't one of them that can
hold a candle to Nell. And I should not wonder a bit if she made a change in the lot of us.
Conversion of a family by the influence of a pious wife, don't you know. Sort of thing that
they make tracts out of. Capital thing, it would be," said Phil, philosophically, "for some
of us have been going a pace----"

"Mr. Compton," said Mrs. Dennistoun, solemnly, "I don't understand very well what you mean
by these phrases. They may be much more innocent than they seem to a country lady's ears. But
I implore you to keep my Elinor clear of anything that you call going the pace. It must mean
something very unlike her, whatever it means. She has been used to a very quiet, orderly life.
Don't hurry her off into a whirl of society, or among noisy gay people. Indeed I can assure
you that the more you have her to herself the more you will be happy in her. She is the brightest
companion, the most entertaining---- Oh, Mr. Compton!"

"I think it's about time, now, mater, to call me Phil."

She smiled, with the tears in her eyes, and held out her hand. "Philip, then," she said, "to
make a little difference. Now remember what I say. It is only in the sacredness of her home
that you will know what is in Elinor. One is never dull with her. She has her own opinions--her
bright way of looking at things--as you know. It is, perhaps, a strange thing for a mother
to say, but she will amuse you, Philip; she is such company. You will never be dull with Elinor:
she has so much in her, which will come out in society, it is true, but never so brightly as
between you two alone."

This did not seem to have quite the effect upon the almost-bridegroom which the mother intended.
"Perhaps" (she said to herself), "he was a little affected by the thought" (which she kept
so completely out of the conversation) "of the loss she herself was about to undergo." At all
events, his face was not so bright as in the vision of that sweet prospect held before him
it ought to have been.

"The fact is," he said, "she knows a great deal more than I do, or ever will. It's she that
will be the one to look blue when she finds herself alone with a fool of a follow that doesn't
know a book from a brick. That's the thing I'm most afraid---- As for society, she can have
her pick of that," he added, brightening up, "I'll not bind her down."

"You may be sure she'll prefer you to all the world."

He shrugged his shoulders a little.

"They say it's always a leap in the dark," he said, "for how's she to know the sort of fellow
I am with what she sees of me here? But I promise you I'll do my best to take her in, and keep
her in that delusion, for her good--making believe to be all that's virtuous: and perhaps not
a bad way--some of it may stick. Come, mater, don't look so horrified. I'm not of the Cousin
John sort, but there may be something decent in me after all."

"I am sure," said Mrs. Dennistoun, "that you will try to make her happy, Philip." She was crying
by this time, which was a thing very odious to Phil. He took her by both hands and gave her
a hearty kiss, which was a thing for which she was not at all prepared.

"I'll do by her----" he said, with a murmur which sounded like an oath, "as well as I know how."

Perhaps this was not the very greatest comfort to her mother, but it was the best she was at
all likely to get from a man so entirely different in all ways from her own species. She had
her cry out quietly while he went off to get his bag. The pony carriage was at the door in
which Elinor was to drive him to the station, and a minute after Mrs. Dennistoun heard his
voice in the hall calling to his Nell, his old girl, in terms which went against all the mother's
prejudices of soft and reverent speech. To have her carefully-trained child, her Elinor, whom
every one had praised and honoured, her maiden-princess so high apart from all such familiarity,
addressed so, gave the old-fashioned lady a pang. It meant nothing but love and kindness, she
said to herself. He reverenced Elinor as much as it was in such a man to do. He meant with
all his heart to do by her as well as he knew how. It was as fantastic to object to his natural
language as it would be to object to a Frenchman speaking French. That was his tongue, the
only utterance he knew---- She dried her eyes and went out to the door to see them start. The
sun was blazing over all the brilliant autumnal colours Of the garden, though it was still
full and brilliant summer in the September morning, and only the asters and dahlias replacing
the roses betrayed the turn of the season. And nothing could be more bright than the face of
Elinor as she sat in the homely little carriage, with the reins gathered up in her hand. He
was going away, indeed, but in a week he was coming back. Philip, as Mrs. Dennistoun now called
him with dignity, yet a little beginning of affection, packed up his long limbs as well as
he could in the small space. "I believe she'll spill us on the road," he said, "or bring back
the shandrydan with a hole in it."

"There is too much of you, Phil," said Elinor, giving the staid pony a quiet touch.

"I should like some of those fellows to see me," he said, "joggled off to market like a basket
of eggs; but don't smash me, Nell, on the way."

Mrs. Dennistoun stood on the steps looking after them, or rather, listening after them, for
they had soon turned the corner of the house and were gone. She heard them jogging over the
stony road, and the sound of their voices in the air for a long time after they were out of
sight--the air was so still and so close, nothing in it to break the sound. The atmosphere
was all sunshine, not a cloud upon the sky, scarcely a breath stirring over those hill-tops,
which had almost the effect of a mountainous landscape, being the highest ground in all the
visible space. Along the other side of the combe, where the road became visible, there were
gleams of heather brilliant under the dark foliage of the firs. She sat down in the porch and
waited to see them pass; there was a sorrowful background to her thoughts, but for the moment
she was not actually sad, if perhaps a little forlorn. They had gone away leaving her alone,
but yet in an hour or two Elinor was coming back. Time enough to think of the final parting.
Next week Elinor would go and would not return. Mrs. Dennistoun held on by both hands to to-day
and would not think of that future, near as it was. She waited in a hush of feeling, so near
to great commotions of the heart and mind, but holding them at a distance in a suspense of
all thought, till the shandrydan appeared in the opening of the road. They were thinking of
her, for she saw a gleam of white, the waving of a handkerchief, as the little carriage trundled
along the road, and for a moment the tears again blinded her eyes. But Mrs. Dennistoun was
very reasonable. She got up from the cottage porch after the pony carriage had passed in the
distance, with that determination to make the best of it, which is the inspiration of so many
women's lives.

And what a drive the others had through the sunshine--or at least Elinor! You can never tell
by what shadows a man's thoughts may be haunted, who is a man of the world, and has had many
other things to occupy him besides this vision of love. But the girl had no shadows. The parting
which was before her was not near enough to harm as yet, and she was still able to think, in
her ignorance of the world, that even parting was much more in appearance than in reality,
and that she would always be running home, always going upon long visits brightening everything,
instead of saddening. But even had she been going to the end of the world with her husband
next week, Elinor would still have been happy to-day. The sunshine itself was enough to go
to any one's head, and the pony stepped out so that Phil had the grace to be ashamed of his
reflections upon "the old girl." They got to the station too early for the train, and had half
an hour's stroll together, with all the railway porters looking on admiring. They all knew
Miss Dennistoun from her childhood, and they were interested in her "young man."

"And to think you will be in Ireland to-morrow," said Elinor, "over the sea, with the Channel
between us--in another island!"

"I don't see much that's wonderful in that," said Phil, "the boat goes every day."

"Oh, there's nothing wonderful about the boat. Hundreds might go, and I shouldn't mind, but
you---- It's strange to think of your going off into a world I don't know at all--and then
coming back."

"To take you off to that world you don't know, Nell; and then the time will come when you will
know it as well as I do, and more, too; and be able to set me down in my proper place."

"What is your proper place? Your place will always be the same. Phil, you've been so good to
me this time; you've made everybody like you so. Mamma--that's the best of all. She was a little--I
can't say jealous, that is not the right word, but uncertain and frightened--which just means
that she did not know you, Phil; now you've condescended to let yourself be known."

"Have I, Nell? I've had more luck than meaning if that's so."

"'Tis that you've condescended to let yourself be known. A man has such odious pride. He likes
to show himself all on the wrong side, to brave people's opinions--as if it was better to be
liked for the badness in you than for the goodness in you!"

"What's the goodness in me, Nell? I'd like to know, and then I can have it ready in other emergencies
and serve it out as it is wanted."

"Oh, Phil! the goodness in you is--yourself. You can't help being nice when you throw off those
society airs. When you are talking with Mariamne and all that set of people----"

"Why can't you call her Jew? life is too short to say all those syllables."

"I don't like you to call her Jew. It's unkind. I don't think she deserves it. It's a sort
of an insult."

"Shut up, Nell. It's her name and that's enough. Mar-ry-am-ne! It's a beast of a name to begin
with. And do you think any of us has got time to say as much as that for one woman? Oh, I suppose
I'm fond of her--as men are of their sisters. She is not a bad sort--mean as her name, and
never fond of parting with her money--but stands by a fellow in a kind of a way all the same."

"I'll never call her Jew," said Elinor; "and, Phil, all this wonderful amount of things you
have to do is simply--nothing. What do you ever do? It is the people who do things that have
time to spare. I know one----"

"Don't come down on me, Nell, again with that eternal Cousin John."

"Phil! I never think of him till you put him into my head. I was thinking of a gentleman who
writes----"

"Rubbish, Nell! What have I to do with men that write, or you either? We are none of us of
that sort. I do what my set do, and more--for there was this director business; and I should
never mind a bit of work that was well paid, like attending Board meetings and so forth, or
signing my name to papers."

"What, without reading them, Phil?"

"Don't come over a fellow with your cleverness, Nell! I am not a reader; but I should take
good care I knew what was in the papers before I signed them, I can tell you. Eh! you'd like
me to slave, to get you luxuries, you little exacting Nell."

"Yes, Phil," she said, "I'd like to think you were working for our living. I should indeed.
It seems somehow so much finer--so real a life. And I should work at home."

"A great deal you would work," he said, laughing, "with those scraps of fingers! Let's hear
what you would do--bits of little pictures, or impossible things in pincushions, or so forth--and
walk out in your most becoming bonnet to force them down some poor shop-keeper's throat?"

"Phil!" she said, "how contemptuous you are of my efforts. But I never thought of either sketches
or pincushions. I should work at home to keep the house nice--to look after the servants, and
guide the cook, and see that you had nice dinners."

"And warm my slippers by the parlour fire," said Phil. "That's too domestic, Nell, for you and me."

"But we are going to be very domestic, Phil."

"Are we? Not if I knows it; yawn our heads off, and get to hate one another. Not for me, Nell.
You'll find yourself up to the eyes in engagements before you know where you are. No, no, old
girl, you may do a deal with me, but you don't make a domestic man of Phil Compton. Time enough
for that when we've had our fling."

"I don't want any fling, Phil," she said, clinging a little closer to his arm.

"But I do, my pet, in the person of Benedick the married man. Don't you think I want to show
all the fellows what a stunning little wife I've got? and all the women I used to flirt with----"

"Did you use to flirt much with them, Phil?"

"You didn't think I flirted with the men, did you? like you did," said Phil, who was not particular
about his grammar. "I want to show you off a bit. Nell. When we go down to the governor's,
there you can be as domestic as you like. That's the line to take with him, and pays too if
you do it well."

"Oh, don't talk as if you were always calculating for your advantage," she said, "for you are
not, Phil. You are not a prudent person, but a horrid, extravagant spendthrift; if you go on
chucking sovereigns about as you did yesterday."

"Well," he said, laughing, "wasn't it well spent? Didn't I make your Rector open his old eyes,
and stop the mouths of the old maids? I don't throw away sovereigns in a general way, Nell,
only when there's a purpose in it. But I think I did them all finely that time--had them on
toast, eh?"

"You made an impression, if that is what you mean; but I confess I thought you did it out of
kindness, Phil."

"To the Punch and Judy? catch me! Sovereigns ain't plentiful enough for that. You little exacting
thing, ain't you pleased, when I did it to please you, and get you credit among your friends?"

"It was very kind of you, I'm sure, Phil," she said, very soberly, "but I should so much rather
you had not thought of that. A shilling would have done just as well and they would have got
a bed at the Bull's Head, and been quite kindly treated. Is this your train coming? It's a
little too soon, I think."

"Thanks for the compliment, Nell. It is really late," he said, looking at his watch, "but the
time flies, don't it, pet, when you and I are together? Here, you fellow, put my bag in a smoking
carriage. And now, you darling, we've got to part; only for a little time, Nell."

"Only for a week," she said, with a smile and a tear.

"Not so long--a rush along the rail, a blow on the sea, and then back again; I shall only be
a day over there, and then--bless you, Nell. Good-bye--take care of yourself, my little duck:
take care of yourself for me."

"Good-bye," said Elinor, with a little quiver of her lip. A parting at a roadside station is
a very abrupt affair. The train stops, the passenger is shoved in, there is a clanging of the
doors, and in a moment it is gone. She had scarcely realized that the hour had come before
he was whirled off from her, and the swinging line of carriages disappeared round the next
curve. She stood looking vaguely after it till the old porter came up, who had known her ever
since she was a child.

"Beg your pardon, miss, but the pony is a-waiting," he said. And then he uttered his sympathy
in the form of a question:--"Coming back very soon, miss, ain't the gentleman?" he said.

"Oh, yes; very soon," she said, rousing herself up.

"And if I may make bold to say it, miss," said the porter, "an open-hearted gentleman as ever
I see. There's many as gives us a threepenny for more than I've done for 'im. And look at what
he's give me," he said, showing the half-crown in his hand.

Did he do that from calculation to please her, ungracious girl as she was, who was so hard
to please? But he never could have known that she would see it. She walked through the little
station to the pony carriage, feeling that all the eyes of the people about were upon her.
They were all sympathetic, all equally aware that she had just parted with her lover: all ready
to cheer her, if she had given them an opportunity, by reminding her of his early return. The
old porter followed her out, and assisted at her ascent into the pony carriage. He said, solemnly,
"And an 'andsome gentleman, miss, as ever I see," as he fastened the apron over her feet. She
gave him a friendly nod as she drove away.

How dreadful it is to be so sensitive, to receive a wound so easily! Elinor was vexed more
than she could say by her lover's denial of the reckless generosity with which she had credited
him. To think that he had done it in order to produce the effect which had given her so distinct
a sensation of pleasure changed that effect into absolute pain. And yet in the fantastic susceptibility
of her nature, there was something in old Judkin's half-crown which soothed her again. A shilling
would have been generous, Elinor said to herself, with a feminine appreciation of the difference
of small things as well as great, whereas half-a-crown was lavish--ergo, he gave the sovereign
also out of natural prodigality, as she had hoped, not out of calculation as he said. She drove
soberly home, thinking over all these things in a mood very different from that triumphant
happiness with which she started from the cottage with Phil by her side. The sunshine was still
as bright, but it had taken an air of routine and commonplace to Elinor. It had come to be
only the common day, not the glory and freshness of the morning. She felt herself, as she had
never done before, on the edge of a world unknown, where everything would be new to her, where--it
was possible--that which awaited her might not be unmixed happiness, might even be the reverse.
It is seldom that a girl on the eve of marriage either thinks this or acknowledges to herself
that she thinks it. Elinor did so involuntarily, without thinking upon her thought. Perhaps
it would not be unmixed happiness. Strange clouds seemed to hang upon the horizon, ready to
roll up in tragic darkness and gloom. Oh, no, not tragic, only commonplace, she said to herself;
opaqueness, not blackness. But yet it was ominous and lowering, that distant sky.

CHAPTER XIV.

The days of the last week hurried along like the grains of sand out of an hour-glass when they
are nearly gone. It is true that almost everything was done--a few little bits of stitching,
a few things still to be "got up" alone remaining, a handkerchief to mark with Elinor's name,
a bit of lace to arrange, just enough to keep up a possibility of something to do for Mrs.
Dennistoun in the blank of all other possibilities--for to interest herself or to occupy herself
about anything that should be wanted beyond that awful limit of the wedding-day was of course
out of the question. Life seemed to stop there for the mother, as it was virtually to begin
for the child; though indeed to Elinor also, notwithstanding her love, it was visible more
in the light of a point at which all the known and certain ended, and where the unknown and
almost inconceivable began. The curious thing was that this barrier which was placed across
life for them both, got somehow between them in those last days which should have been the
most tender climax of their intercourse. They had a thousand things to say to each other, but
they said very little. In the evening after dinner, whether they went out into the garden together
to watch the setting of the young moon, or whether they sat together in that room which had
witnessed all Elinor's commencements of life, free to talk as no one else in the world could
ever talk to either of them, they said very little to each other, and what they said was of
the most commonplace kind. "It is a lovely night; how clear one can see the road on the other
side of the combe!" "And what a bright star that is close to the moon! I wish I knew a little
more about the stars." "They are just as beautiful," Mrs. Dennistoun would say, "as if you
knew everything about them, Elinor." "Are you cold, mamma? I am sure I can see you shiver.
Shall I run and get you a shawl?" "It is a little chilly: but perhaps it will be as well to
go in now," the mother said. And then indoors: "Do you think you will like this lace made up
as a jabot, Elinor?" "You are giving me all your pretty things, though you know you understand
lace much better than I do." "Oh, that doesn't matter," Mrs. Dennistoun said hurriedly; "that
is a taste which comes with time. You will like it as well as I do when you are as old as I
am." "You are not so dreadfully old, mamma." "No, that's the worst of it," Mrs. Dennistoun
would say, and then break out into a laugh. "Look at the shadow that handkerchief makes--how
fantastic it is!" she cried. She neither cared for the moon, nor for the quaintness of the
shadows, nor for the lace which she was pulling into dainty folds to show its delicate pattern--for
none of all these things, but for her only child, who was going from her, and to whom she had
a hundred, and yet a hundred, things to say: but none of them ever came from her lips.

"Mary Dale has not seen your things, Elinor: she asked if she might come to-morrow."

"I think we might have had to-morrow to ourselves, mamma--the last day all by ourselves before
those people begin to arrive."

"Yes, I think so too; but it is difficult to say no, and as she was not here when the others
came---- She is the greatest critic in the parish. She will have so much to say."

"I daresay it may be fun," said Elinor, brightening up a little, "and of course anyhow Alice
must have come to talk about her dress. I am tired of those bride's-maids' dresses; they are
really of so little consequence." Elinor was not vain, to speak of, but she thought it improbable
that when she was there any one would look much at the bride's-maids' dresses. For one thing,
to be sure, the bride is always the central figure, and there were but two bride's-maids, which
diminished the interest; and then--well, it had to be allowed at the end of all, that, though
her closest friends, neither Alice Hudson nor Mary Tatham were, to look at, very interesting girls.

"They are of great consequence to them," said Mrs. Dennistoun, with the faintest smile.

"I didn't mean that, of course," said Elinor, with a blush; "only I never should have worried
about my own dress, which after all is the most important, as Alice does about hers."

"Which nobody will look at," Mrs. Dennistoun said.

"I did not say that: but to tell the truth, it is a pity for the girls that the men will not
quite be, just of their world, you know. Oh, mamma, you know it is not that I think anything
of that, but I am sorry for Alice and Mary. Mr. Bolsover and the other gentlemen will not take
that trouble which country neighbours, or--or John's friends from the Temple might have done."

"Why do you speak of John's friends from the Temple, Elinor?"

"Mamma! for no reason at all. Why should I? They were the only other men I could think of."

"Elinor, did John ever give you any reason to think----"

"Mamma," cried Elinor again, with double vehemence, her countenance all ablaze, "of course
he never did! how could you think such foolish things?"

"Well, my dear," said her mother, "I am very glad he did not; it will prevent any embarrassment
between him and you--for I must always believe----"

"Don't, please, oh, don't! it would make me miserable; it would take all my happiness away."

Mrs. Dennistoun said nothing, but she sighed--a very small, infinitesimal sigh--and there was
a moment's silence, during which perhaps that sigh pervaded the atmosphere with a sort of breath
of what might have been. After a moment she spoke again:

"I hope you have not packed up your ornaments yet, Elinor. You must leave them to the very
last, for Mary would like to see that beautiful necklace. What do you think you shall wear
on the day?"

"Nothing," said Elinor, promptly. She was about to add, "I have nothing good enough," but paused
in time.

"Not my little star? It would look very well, my darling, to fix your veil on. The diamonds
are very good, though perhaps a little old-fashioned; you might get them reset. But--your father
gave it me like that."

"I would not change it a bit, mamma, for anything in the world."

"Thanks, my dearest. I thought that was how you would feel about it. It is not very big, of
course, but it really is very good."

"Then I will wear it, mamma, if it will please you, but nothing else."

"It would please me: it would be like having something from your father. I think we had less
idea of ornaments in my day. I cannot tell you how proud I was of my diamond star. I should
like to put it in for you myself, Elinor."

"Oh, mamma!" This was the nearest point they had come to that outburst of two full hearts which
both of them would have called breaking down. Mrs. Dennistoun saw it and was frightened. She
thought it would be betraying to Elinor what she wished her never to know, the unspeakable
desolation to which she was looking forward when her child was taken from her. Elinor's exclamation,
too, was a protest against the imminent breaking down. They both came back with a hurry, with
a panting breath, to safer ground.

"Yes, that's what I regret," she said. "Mr. Bolsover and Harry Compton will laugh a little
at the Rectory. They will not be so--nice as young men of their own kind."

"The Rectory people are just as well born as any of us, Elinor."

"Oh, precisely, mamma: I know that; but we too---- It is what they call a different monde.
I don't think it is half so nice a monde," said the girl, feeling that she had gone further
than she intended to do; "but you know, mamma----"

"I know, Elinor: but I scarcely expected from you----"

"Oh," cried Elinor again, in exasperation, "if you think that I share that feeling! I think
it odious, I think their monde is vulgar, nasty, miserable! I think----"

"Don't go too far the other way, Elinor. Your husband will be of it, and you must learn to
like it. You think, perhaps, all that is new to me?"

"No," said Elinor, her bright eyes, all the brighter for tears, falling before her mother's
look. "I know, of course, that you have seen--all kinds----"

But she faltered a little, for she did not believe that her mother was acquainted with Phil's
circle and their wonderful ways.

"They will be civil enough," she went on, hurriedly, "and as everybody chaffs so much nowadays
they will, perhaps, never be found out. But I don't like it for my friends."

"They will chaff me also, no doubt," Mrs. Dennistoun said.

"Oh, you, mamma! they are not such fools as that," cried poor Elinor; but in her own mind she
did not feel confident that there was any such limitation to their folly. Mrs. Dennistoun laughed
a little to herself, which was, perhaps, more alarming than that other moment when she was
almost ready to cry.

"You had better wear Lord St. Serf's ring," she said, after a moment, with a tone of faint
derision which Elinor knew.

"You might as well tell me," cried the bride, "to wear Lady Mariamne's revolving dishes. No,
I will wear nothing, nothing but your star."

"You have got nothing half so nice," said the mother. Oh yes, it was a little revenge upon
those people who were taking her daughter from her, and who thought themselves at liberty to
jeer at all her friends: but as was perhaps inevitable it touched Elinor a little too. She
restrained herself from some retort with a sense of extreme and almost indignant self-control:
though what retort Elinor could have made I cannot tell. It was much "nicer" than anything
else she had. None of Phil Compton's great friends, who were not of the same monde as the people
at Windyhill, had offered his bride anything to compare with the diamonds which her father
had given to her mother before she was born. And Elinor was quite aware of the truth of what
her mother said. But she would have liked to make a retort--to say something smart and piquant
and witty in return.

And thus the evening was lost, the evening in which there was so much to say, one of the three
only, no more, that were left.

Miss Dale came next day to see "the things," and was very amiable: but the only thing in this
visit which affected Elinor's mind was a curious little unexpected assault this lady made upon
her when she was going away. Elinor had gone out with her to the porch, according to the courteous
usage of the house. But when they had reached that shady place, from which the green combe
and the blue distance were visible, stretching far into the soft autumnal mists of the evening,
Mary Dale turned upon her and asked her suddenly, "What night was it that Mr. Compton came here?"

Elinor was much startled, but she did not lose her self-possession. All the trouble about that
date had disappeared out of her mind in the stress and urgency of other things. She cast back
her mind with an effort and asked herself what the conflict and uncertainty of which she was
dimly conscious, had been? It came back to her dimly without any of the pain that had been
in it. "It was on the sixth," she said quietly, without excitement. She could scarcely recall
to her mind what it was that had moved her so much in respect to this date only a little time ago.

"Oh, you must be mistaken, Elinor, I saw him coming up from the station. It was later than
that. It was, if I were to give my life for it, Thursday night."

This was four or five nights before and a haze of uncertainty had fallen on all things so remote.
But Elinor cast her eyes upon the calendar in the hall and calm possessed her breast. "It was
the sixth," she said with composed tones, as certain as of anything she had ever known in the
course of her life.

"Well, I suppose you must know," said Mary Dale.

CHAPTER XV.

"Look at that, Elinor," said Mrs. Dennistoun, next day, when she had read, twice over, a letter,
large and emblazoned with a very big monogram, which Elinor, well perceiving from whom it came,
had furtively watched the effect of from behind an exceeding small letter of her own. Phil
was not remarkable as a correspondent: his style was that of the primitive mind which hopes
its correspondent is well, "as this leaves me." He had never much more to say.

"From Mariamne, mamma?"

"She takes great pains to make us certain of that fact at least," Mrs. Dennistoun said; which
indeed was very true, for the name of the writer was sprawled in gilt letters half over the
sheet. And this was how it ran:--

"DEAR MRS. DENNISTOUN,--

"I have been thinking what a great pity it would be to bore you with me, and my maid, and all
my belongings. I am so silly that I can never be happy without dragging a lot of things about
with me--dogs, and people, and so forth. Going to town in September is dreadful, but it is
rather chic to do a thing that is quite out of the way, and one may perhaps pick up a little
fun in the evening. So if you don't mind, instead of inflicting Fifine and Bijou and Leocadie,
not to mention some people that might be with me, upon you, and putting your house all out
of order, as these odious little dogs do when people are not used to them--I will come down
by the train, which I hope arrives quite punctually, in time to see poor Phil turned off. I
am sure you will be so kind as to send a carriage for me to the railway. We shall be probably
a party of four, and I hear from Phil you are so hospitable and kind that I need not hesitate
to bring my friends to breakfast after it's all over. I hope Phil will go through it like a
man, and I wouldn't for worlds deprive him of the support of his family. Love to Nell. I am,

"Yours truly, "MARIAMNE PRESTWICH."

"The first name very big and the second very small," said Mrs. Dennistoun, as she received
the letter back.

"I am sure we are much obliged to her for not coming, mamma!"

"Perhaps--but not for this announcement of her not coming. I don't wish to say anything against
your new relations, Elinor----"

"You need not put any restraint upon yourself in consideration of my feelings," said Elinor,
with a flush of annoyance.

And this made Mrs. Dennistoun pause. They ate their breakfast, which was a very light meal,
in silence. It was the day before the wedding. The rooms down-stairs had been carefully prepared
for Phil's sister. Though Mrs. Dennistoun was too proud to say anything about it, she had taken
great pains to make these pretty rooms as much like a fine lady's chamber as had been possible.
She had put up new curtains, and a Persian carpet, and looked out of her stores all the pretty
things she could find to decorate the two rooms of the little apartment. She had gone in on
the way down-stairs to take a final survey, and it seemed to her that they were very pretty.
No picture could have been more beautiful than the view from the long low lattice window, in
which, as in a frame, was set the foreground of the copse with its glimpses of ruddy heather
and the long sweep of the heights beyond, which stretched away into the infinite. That at least
could not be surpassed anywhere; and the Persian carpet was like moss under foot, and the chairs
luxurious--and there was a collection of old china in some open shelves which would have made
the mouth of an amateur water. Well! it was Lady Mariamne's own loss if she preferred the chance
of picking up a little fun in the evening, to spending the night decorously in that pretty
apartment, and making further acquaintance with her new sister. It was entirely, Mrs. Dennistoun
said to herself, a matter for her own choice. But she was much affronted all the same.

"It will be very inconvenient indeed sending a carriage for her, Elinor. Except the carriage
that is to take you to church there is none good enough for this fine lady. I had concluded
she would go in your uncle Tatham's carriage. It may be very fine to have a Lady Mariamne in
one's party, but it is a great nuisance to have to change all one's arrangements at the last
moment."

"If you were to send the wagonette from the Bull's Head, as rough as possible, with two of
the farm horses, she would think it genre, if not chic----"

"I cannot put up with all this nonsense!" cried Mrs. Dennistoun, with a flush on her cheek.
"You are just as bad as they are, Elinor, to suggest such a thing! I have held my own place
in society wherever I have been, and I don't choose to be condescended to or laughed at, in
fact, by any visitor in the world!"

"Mamma! do you think any one would ever compare you with Mariamne--the Jew?"

"Don't exasperate me with those abominable nicknames. They will give you one next. She is an
exceedingly ill-bred and ill-mannered woman. Picking up a little fun in the evening! What does
she mean by picking up a little fun----"

"They will perhaps go to the theatre--a number of them; and as nobody is in town they will
laugh very much at the kind of people, and perhaps the kind of play--and it will be a great
joke ever after among themselves--for of course there will be a number of them together," said
Elinor, disclosing her acquaintance with the habits of her new family with downcast eyes.

"How can well-born people be so vulgar and ill-bred?" cried Mrs. Dennistoun. "I must say for
Philip that though he is careless and not nearly so particular as I should like, still he is
not like that. He has something of the politeness of the heart."

Elinor did not raise her downcast eyes. Phil had been on his very good behaviour on the occasion
of his last hurried visit, but she did not feel that she could answer even for Phil. "I am
very glad anyhow, that she is not coming, mamma: at least we shall have the last night and
the last morning to ourselves."

Mrs. Dennistoun shook her head. "The Tathams will be here," she said; "and everybody, to dinner--all
the party. We must go now and see how we can enlarge the table. To-night's party will be the
largest we have ever had in the cottage." She sighed a little and paused, restraining herself.
"We shall have no quiet evening--nor morning either--again; it will be a bustle and a rush.
You and I will never have any more quiet evenings, Elinor: for when you come back it will be
another thing."

"Oh, mother!" cried Elinor, throwing herself into her mother's arms: and for a moment they
stood closely clasped, feeling as if their hearts would burst, yet very well aware, too, underneath,
that any number of quiet evenings would be as the last, when, with hearts full of a thousand
things to say to each other, they said almost nothing--which in some respects was worse than
having no quiet evenings evermore.

In the afternoon Phil arrived, having returned from Ireland that morning, and paused only to
refresh himself in the chambers which he still retained in town. He had met all his hunting
friends during the three days he had been away; and though he retained a gallant appearance,
and looked, as Alice Hudson thought, "very aristocratic," Mrs. Dennistoun caught with anxiety
a worn-out look--the look of excitement, of nights without sleep, much smoke, and, perhaps,
much wine, in his eyes. What a woman feels who has to hand over her spotless child, the most
dear and pure thing upon earth, to a man fresh from those indulgences and dissipations which
never seem harmless, and always are repellent to a woman, is not to be described. Fortunately
the bride herself, in invincible ignorance and unconsciousness, seldom feels in that way. To
Elinor her lover looked tired about the eyes, which was very well explained by his night journey,
and by the agitation of the moment. And, indeed, she did not see very much of Phil, who had
his friends with him--his aide-de-camp, Bolsover, and his brother Harry. These three gentlemen
carried an atmosphere of smoke and other scents with them into the lavender of the Rectory,
which was too amazing in that hemisphere for words, and talked their own talk in the midst
of the fringe of rustics who were their hosts, with a calm which was extraordinary, breaking
into the midst of the Rector's long-winded, amiable sentences, and talking to each other over
Mrs. Hudson's head. "I say, Dick, don't you remember?" "By Jove, Phil, you are too bad!" sounded,
with many other such expressions and reminders, over the Rectory party, strictly silent round
their own table, trying to make a courteous remark now and then, but confounded, in their simple
country good manners, by the fine gentlemen. And then there was the dinner-party at the cottage
in the evening, to which Mr. and Mrs. Hudson were invited. Such a dinner-party! Old Mr. Tatham,
who was a country gentleman from Dorsetshire, with his nice daughter, Mary Tatham, a quiet
country young lady, accustomed, when she went into the world at all, to the serious young men
of the Temple, and John's much-occupied friends, who had their own asides about cases, and
what So-and-So had said in court, but were much too well-bred before ladies to fall into "shop;"
and Mr. and Mrs. Hudson, who were such as we know them; and the bride's mother, a little anxious,
but always debonair; and Elinor herself, in all the haze and sweet confusion of the great era
which approached so closely. The three men made the strangest addition that can be conceived
to the quiet guests; but things went better under the discipline of the dinner, especially
as Sir John Huntingtower, who was a Master of the hounds and an old friend of the Dennistouns,
was of the party, and Lady Huntingtower, who was an impressive person, and knew the world.
This lady was very warm in her congratulations to Mrs. Dennistoun after dinner on the absence
of Lady Mariamne. "I think you are the luckiest woman that ever was to have got clear of that
dreadful creature," she said. "Oh, there is nothing wrong about her that I know. She goes everywhere
with her dogs and her cavaliers servantes. There's safety in numbers, my dear. She has always
two of them at least hanging about her to fetch and carry, and she thinks a great deal more
of her dogs; but I can't think what you could have done with her here."

"And what will my Elinor do in such a sphere?" the troubled mother permitted herself to say.

"Oh, if that were all," said Lady Huntingtower, lifting up her fat hands--she was one of those
who had protested against the marriage, but now that it had come to this point, and could not
be broken off, the judicious woman thought it right to make the best of it--"Elinor need not
be any the worse," she said. "Thank heaven, you are not obliged to be mixed up with your husband's
sister. Elinor must take a line of her own. You should come to town yourself her first season,
and help her on. You used to know plenty of people."

"But they say," said Mrs. Dennistoun, "that it is so much better to leave a young couple to
themselves, and that a mother is always in the way."

"If I were you I would not pay the least attention to what they say. If you hold back too much
they will say, 'There was her own mother, knowing numbers of nice people, that never took the
trouble to lend her a hand.'"

"I hope," said Mrs. Dennistoun, turning round immediately to this other aspect of affairs,
"that it never will be necessary for the world to interest itself at all in my child's affairs."

"Well, of course, that is the best," Lady Huntingtower allowed, "if she just goes softly for
a year or two till she feels her way."

"But then she is so young, and so little accustomed to act for herself," said the mother, with
another change of flank.

"Oh, Elinor has a great deal of spirit. She must just make a stand against the Compton set
and take her own line."

Mrs. Hudson and Alice and Miss Tatham were at the other end of the room exchanging a few criticisms
under their breath, and disposed to think that they were neglected by their hostess for the
greater personage with whom she was in such close conversation. And Lady Mariamne's defection
was a great disappointment to them all. "I should like to have seen a fine lady quite close,"
said Mary (it was not, I think, usual to speak of "smart" people in those days), "one there
could be no doubt about, a little fast and all that. I have seen them in town at a distance,
but all the people we know are sure country people."

"My dear," said Mrs. Hudson, primly, "I don't like to hear you talk of any other kind. An English
lady, I hope, whatever is her rank, can only be of one kind."

"Oh, mamma, you know very well Lady Mariamne is as different from Lady Huntingtower as----"

"Don't mention names, my dear; it is not well-bred. The one is young, and naturally fond of
gayety; the other--well, is not quite so young, and stout, and all that."

"Oh, that is all very well," said Alice; "but Aunt Mary says----"

Miss Dale was coming in the evening, and the Miss Hills, and the curate, and the doctor, and
various other people, who could not be asked to dinner, to whom it had been carefully explained
(which, indeed, was a fact they knew) that to dine twelve people in the little dining-room
of the cottage was a feat which was accomplished with difficulty, and that more was impossible.
Society at Windyhill was very tolerant and understanding on this point, for all the dining-rooms
were small, except, indeed, when you come to talk of such places as Huntingtower--and they
were very glad to be permitted to have a peep at the bridegroom on these terms, or rather,
if truth were told, of the bride, and how she was bearing herself so near the crisis of her
fate. The bridegroom is seldom very interesting on such occasions. On the present occasion
he was more interesting than usual, because he was the Honourable Philip, and because he had
a reputation of which most people had heard something. There was a mixture of alarm and suspicion
in respect to him which increased the excitement; and many remarks of varied kinds were made.
"I think the fellow's face quite bears out his character," said the doctor to the Rector. "What
a man to trust a nice girl to!" Mr. Hudson felt that as the bridegroom was living under his
roof he was partially responsible, and discouraged this pessimistic view. "Mr. Compton has
not, perhaps, had all the advantages one tries to secure for one's own son," he said, "but
I have reason to believe that the things that have been said of him are much exaggerated."
"Oh, advantages!" said the doctor, thinking of Alick, of whom it was his strongly expressed
opinion that the fellow should be turned out to rough it, and not coddled up and spoiled at
home. But while these remarks were going on, Miss Hill had been expressing to the curate an
entirely different view. "I think he has a beautiful face," she said with the emphasis some
ladies use; "a little worn, perhaps, with being too much in the world, and I wish he had a
better colour. To me he looks delicate: but what delightful features, Mr. Whitebands, and what
an aristocratic air!"

"He looks tremendously up to everything," the curate said, with a faint tone of envy in his voice.

"Don't he just?" cried Alick Hudson. "I should think there wasn't a thing he couldn't do--of
things that men do do, don't you know," cried that carefully trained boy, whose style was confused,
though his meaning was good. But probably there were almost as many opinions about Phil as
there were people in the room. His two backers-up stood in a corner--half intimidated, half
contemptuous of the country people. "Queer lot for Phil to fall among," said Dick Bolsover.
"Que diable allait-il faire dans cette galère?" said Harry Compton, who had been about the
world. "Oh, bosh with your French, that nobody understands," said the best man.

But in the meantime Phil was not there at all to be seen of men. He had stolen out into the
garden, where there was a white vision awaiting him in the milky moonlight. The autumn haze
had come early this season, and the moon was misty, veiled with white amid a jumble of soft
floating vapours in the sky. Elinor stood among the flowers, which showed some strange subdued
tints of colours in the flooding of the white light, like a bit of consolidated moonlight in
her white dress. She had a white shawl covering her from head to foot, with a corner thrown
over her hair. What had they to say to each other that last night? Not much; nothing at all
that had any information in it--whispers inaudible almost to each other. There was something
in being together for this stolen moment, just on the eve of their being together for always,
which had a charm of its own. After to-night, no stealing away, no escape to the garden, no
little conspiracy to attain a meeting--the last of all those delightful schemings and devices.
They started when they heard a sound from the house, and sped along the paths into the shadow
like the conspirators they were--but never to conspire more after this last enthralling time.

"You're not frightened, Nell?"

"No--except a little. There is one thing----"

"What is it, my pet? If it's to the half of my kingdom, it shall be done."

"Phil, we are going to be very good when we are together? don't laugh--to help each other?"

He did laugh low, not to be heard, but long. "I shall have no temptation," he said, "to be
anything but good, you little goose of a Nell," taking it for a warning of possible jealousy
to come.

"Oh, but I mean both of us--to help each other."

"Why, Nell, I know you'll never go wrong----"

She gave him a little impatient shake. "You will not understand me, Phil. We will try to be
better than we've ever been. To be good--don't you know what that means?--in every way, before
God."

Her voice dropped very low, and he was for a moment overawed. "You mean going to church, Nell?"

"I mean--yes, that for one thing; and many other things."

"That's dropping rather strong upon a fellow," he said, "just at this moment, don't you think,
when I must say yes to everything you say."

"Oh, I don't mean it in that way; and I was not thinking of church particularly; but to be
good, very good, true and kind, in our hearts."

"You are all that already, Nell."

"Oh, no, not what I mean. When there are two of us instead of one we can do so much more."

"Well, my pet, it's for you to make out the much more. I'm quite content with you as you are;
it's me that you want to improve, and heaven knows there's plenty of room for that."

"No, Phil, not you more than me," she said.

"We'll choose a place where the sermon's short, and we'll see about it. You mean little minx,
to bind a man down to go to church, the night before his wedding day!"

And then there was a sound of movement indoors, and after a little while the bride appeared
among the guests with a little more colour than usual, and an anxiously explanatory description
of something she had been obliged to do; and the confused hour flew on with much sound of talking
and very little understanding of what was said. And then all the visitors streamed away group
after group into the moonlight, disappearing like ghosts under the shadow of the trees. Finally,
the Rectory party went too, the three mild ladies surrounded by an exciting circle of cigars;
for Alick, of course, had broken all bonds, and even the Rector accepted that rare indulgence.
Alice Hudson half deplored, half exulted for years after in the scent that would cling round
one particular evening dress. Five gentlemen, all with cigars, and papa as bad as any of them!
There had never been such an extraordinary experience in her life.

And then the Tathams, too, withdrew, and the mother and daughter stood alone on their own hearth.
Oh, so much, so much as there was to say! but how were they to say it?--the last moment, which
was so precious and so intolerable--the moment that would never come again.

"You were a long time with Philip, Elinor, in the garden. I think all your old friends ----
the last night."

"I wanted to say something to him, mamma, that I had never had the courage to say."

Mrs. Dennistoun had been looking dully into the dim mirror over the mantelpiece. She turned
half round to her daughter with an inquiring look.

"Oh, mamma, I wanted to say to him that we must be good! We're so happy. God is so kind to
us; and you--if you suppose I don't think of you! It was to say to him--building our house
upon all this, God's mercy and your loss, and all--that we are doubly, doubly bound to serve--and
to love--and to be good people before God; and like you, mother, like you!"

"My darling!" Mrs. Dennistoun said. And that was all. She asked no questions as to how it was
to be done, or what he replied. Elinor had broken down hysterically, and sobbed out the words
one at a time, as they would come through the choking in her throat. Needless to say that she
ended in her mother's arms, her head upon the bosom which had nursed her, her slight weight
dependent upon the supporter and protector of all her life.

That was the last evening. There remained the last morning to come; and after that--what? The
great sea of an unknown life, a new pilot, and a ship untried.

CHAPTER XVI.

And now the last morning had come.

The morning of a wedding-day is a flying and precarious moment which seems at once as if it
never would end, and as if it were a hurried preliminary interval in which the necessary preparations
never could be done. Elinor was not allowed to come down-stairs to help, as she felt it would
be natural to do. It was Mary Tatham who arranged the flowers on the table, and helped Dennistoun
to superintend everything. All the women in the house, though they were so busy, were devoted
at every spare moment to the service of Elinor. They brought her simple breakfast up-stairs,
one maid carrying the tray and another the teapot, that each might have their share. The cook,
though she was overwhelmed with work, had made some cakes for breakfast, such us Elinor liked.
"Most like as we'll never have her no more--to mind," she said. The gardener sent up an untidy
bundle of white flowers. And Mrs. Dennistoun came herself to pour out the tea. "As if I had
been ill, or had turned into a baby again," Elinor said. But there was not much said. Mary
Tatham was there for one thing, and for another and the most important they had said all they
had to say; the rest which remained could not be said. The wedding was to be at a quarter to
twelve, in order to give Lady Mariamne time to come from town. It was not the fashion then
to delay marriages to the afternoon, which no doubt would have been much more convenient for
her ladyship; but the best that could be done was done. Mr. Tatham's carriage, which he had
brought with him to grace the ceremony, was despatched to the station to meet Lady Mariamne,
while he, good man, had to get to church as he could in one of the flys. And then came the
important moment, when the dressing of the bride had to be begun. The wedding-breakfast was
not yet all set out in perfect order, and there were many things to do. Yet every woman in
the house had a little share in the dressing of the bride. They all came to see how it fitted
when the wedding-dress was put on. It fitted like a glove! The long glossy folds of the satin
were a wonder to see. Cook stood just within the door in a white apron, and wept, and could
not say a word to Miss Elinor; but the younger maids sent forth a murmur of admiration. And
the Missis they thought was almost as beautiful as the bride, though her satin was grey. Mrs.
Dennistoun herself threw the veil over her child's head, and put in the diamond star, the old-fashioned
ornament, which had been her husband's present to herself. And then again she had meant to
say something to Elinor--a last word--but the word would not come. They were both of them glad
that somebody should be there all the time, that they should not be left alone. And after that
the strange, hurried, everlasting morning was over, and the carriage was at the door.

Then again it was a relief that old Mr. Tatham had missed his proper place in the fly, and
had to go on the front seat with the bride and her mother. It was far better so. If they had
been left even for ten minutes alone, who could have answered that one or the other would not
have cried, and discomposed the bouquet and the veil? It seemed a great danger and responsibility
over when they arrived at last safely at the church door. Lady Mariamne was just then arriving
from the station. She drew up before them in poor Mr. Tatham's carriage, keeping them back.
Harry Compton and Mr. Bolsover sprang to the carriage window to talk to her, and there was
a loud explosion of mirth and laughter in the midst of the village people, and the children
with their baskets of flowers who were already gathered. Lady Mariamne's voice burst out so
shrill that it overmastered the church bells. "Here I am," she cried, "out in the wilderness.
And Algy has come with me to take care of me. And how are you, dear boys; and how is poor Phil?"
"Phil is all ready to be turned off, with the halter round his neck," said Dick Bolsover; and
Harry Compton said, "Hurry up, hurry up, Jew, the bride is behind you, waiting to get out."
"She must wait, then," said Lady Mariamne, and there came leisurely out of the carriage, first,
her ladyship's companion, by name, Algy, a tall person with an eye-glass, then a little pug,
which was carefully handed into his arms, and then lightly jumping down to the ground, a little
figure in black--in black of all things in the world! a sight that curdled the blood of the
village people, and of Mrs. Hudson, who had walked across from the Rectory in a gown of pigeon's-breast
silk which scattered prismatic reflections as she walked. In black! Mrs. Hudson bethought herself
that she had a white China crape shawl in her cupboard, and wondered if she could offer it
to conceal this ill omened gown. But if Lady Mariamne's dress was dark, she herself was fair
enough, with an endless fluff of light hair under her little black lace bonnet. Her gloves
were off, and her hands were white and glistening with rings. "Give me my puggy darling," she
said in her loud, shrill tone. "I can go nowhere, can I, pet, without my little pug!"

"A Jew and a pug, both in church. It is enough," said her brother, "to get the poor parson
into trouble with his bishop."

"Oh, the bishop's a great friend of mine," said the lady; "he will say nothing to me, not if
I put Pug in a surplice and make him lead the choir." At this speech there was a great laugh
of the assembled party, which stood in the centre of the path, while Mr. Tatham's carriage
edged away, and the others made efforts to get forward. The noise of their talk disturbed the
curious abstraction in which Elinor had been going through the morning hours. Mariamne's jarring
voice seemed louder than the bells. Was this the first voice sent out to greet her by the new
life which was about to begin? She glanced at her mother, and then at old Uncle Tatham, who
sat immovable, prevented by decorum from apostrophising the coachman who was not his own, but
fuming inwardly at the interruption. Mrs. Dennistoun did not move at all, but her daughter
knew very well what was meant by that look straight before her, in which her mother seemed
to ignore all obstacles in the way.

"I got here very well," Lady Mariamne went on; "we started in the middle of the night, of course,
before the lamps were out. Wasn't it good of Algy to get himself out of bed at such an unearthly
hour! But he snapped at Puggy as we came down, which was a sign he felt it. Why aren't you
with the poor victim at the altar, you boys?"

"Phil will be in blue funk," said Harry; "go in and stand by your man, Dick: the Jew has enough
with two fellows to see her into her place."

The bride's carriage by this time pushed forward, making Lady Mariamne start in confusion.
"Oh! look here; they have splashed my pretty toilette, and upset my nerves," she cried, springing
back into her supporter's arms.

That gentleman regarded the stain of the damp gravel on the lady's skirt through his eye-glass
with deep but helpless anxiety. "It's a pity for the pretty frock!" he said with much seriousness.
And the group gathered round and gazed in dismay, as if they expected it to disappear of itself--until
Mrs. Hudson bustled up. "It will rub off; it will not make any mark. If one of you gentlemen
will lend me a handkerchief," she said. And Algy and Harry and Dick Bolsover, not to speak
of Lady Mariamne herself, watched with great gravity while the gravel was swept off. "I make
no doubt," said the Rector's wife, "that I have the pleasure of speaking to Lady Mariamne:
and I don't doubt that black is the fashion and your dress is beautiful: but if you would just
throw on a white shawl for the sake of the wedding--it's so unlucky to come in black----"

"A white shawl!" said Lady Mariamne in dismay.

"The Jew in a white shawl!" echoed the others with a burst of laughter which rang into the
church itself and made Phil before the altar, alone and very anxious, ask himself what was up.

"It's China crape, I assure you, and very nice," Mrs. Hudson said.

Lady Mariamne gave the good Samaritan a stony stare, and took Algy's arm and sailed into the
church before the Rector's wife, without a word said; while all the women from the village
looked at each other and said, "Well, I never!" under their breath.

"Let me give you my arm, Mrs. Hudson," said Harry Compton, "and please pardon me that I did
not introduce my sister to you. She is dreadfully shy, don't you know, and never does speak
to anyone when she has not been introduced."

"My observation was a very simple one," said Mrs. Hudson, very angry, yet pleased to lean upon
an Honourable arm.

"My dear lady!" cried the good-natured Harry, "the Jew never wore a shawl in her life----"

And all this time the organ had been pealing, the white vision passing up the aisle, the simple
villagers chanting forth their song about the breath that breathed o'er Eden. Alas! Eden had
not much to do with it, except perhaps in the trembling heart of the white maiden roused out
of her virginal dream by the jarring voices of the new life. The laughter outside was a dreadful
offence to all the people, great and small, who had collected to see Elinor married.

"What could you expect? It's that woman whom they call the Jew," whispered Lady Huntingtower
to her next neighbour.

"She should be put into the stocks," said Sir John, scarcely under his breath, which, to be
sure, was also an interruption to the decorum of the place.

And then there ensued a pause broken by the voice, a little lugubrious in tone, of the Rector
within the altar rails, and the tremulous answers of the pair outside. The audience held its
breath to hear Elinor make her responses, and faltered off into suppressed weeping as the low
tones ceased. Sir John Huntingtower, who was very tall and big, and stood out like a pillar
among the ladies round, kept nodding his head all the time she spoke, nodding as you might
do in forced assent to any dreadful vow. Poor little thing, poor little thing, he was saying
in his heart. His face was more like the face of a man at a funeral than a man at a wedding.
"Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord"--he might have been nodding assent to that instead
of to Elinor's low-spoken vow. Phil Compton's voice, to tell the truth, was even more tremulous
than Elinor's. To investigate the thoughts of a bridegroom would be too much curiosity at such
a moment. But I think if the secrets of the hearts could be revealed, Phil for a moment was
sorry for poor little Elinor too.

And then the solemnity was all over in a moment, and the flutter of voices and congratulations
began.

I do not mean to follow the proceedings through all the routine of the wedding-day. Attempts
were made on the part of the bridegroom's party to get Lady Mariamne dismissed by the next
train, an endeavour into which Harry Compton threw himself--for he was always a good-hearted
fellow--with his whole soul. But the Jew declared that she was dying of hunger, and whatever
sort of place it was, must have something to eat; a remark which naturally endeared her still
more to Mrs. Dennistoun, who was waiting by the door of Mr. Tatham's carriage, which that anxious
old gentleman had managed to recover control of, till her ladyship had taken her place. Her
ladyship stared with undisguised amazement when she was followed into the carriage by the bride's
mother, and when the neat little old gentleman took his seat opposite. "But where is Algy?
I want Algy," she cried, in dismay. "Absolutely I can't go without Algy, who came to take care
of me."

"You will be perfectly safe, my dear lady, with Mrs. Dennistoun and me. The gentlemen will
walk," said Mr. Tatham, waving his hand to the coachman.

And thus it was that the forlorn lady found herself without her cavalier and without her pug,
absolutely stranded among savages, notwithstanding her strong protest almost carried the length
of tears. She was thus carried off in a state of consternation to the cottage over the rough
road, where the wheels went with a din and lurch over the stones, and dug deep into the sand,
eliciting a succession of little shrieks from her oppressed bosom. "I shall be shaken all to
bits," she said, grasping the arm of the old gentleman to steady herself. Mr. Tatham was not
displeased to be the champion of a lady of title. He assured her in dulcet tones that his springs
were very good and his horses very sure--"though it is not a very nice road."

"Oh, it is a dreadful road!" said Lady Mariamne.

But in due time they did arrive at the cottage, where her ladyship could not wait for the gathering
of the company, but demanded at once something to eat. "I can't really go another moment without
food. I must have something or I shall die. Phil, come here this instant and get me something.
They have brought me off at the risk of my life, and there's nobody to attend to me. Don't
stand spooning there," cried Lady Mariamne, "but do what I tell you. Do you think I should
ever have put myself into this position but for you?"

"You would never have been asked here if they had consulted me. I knew what a nuisance you'd
be. Here, get this lady something to eat, old man," said the bridegroom, tapping Mr. Tatham
on the back, who did, indeed, look rather like a waiter from that point of view.

"I shall have to help myself," said the lady in despair. And she sat down at the elaborate
table in the bride's place and began to hack at the chicken. The gentlemen coming in at the
moment roared again with laughter over the Jew's impatience; but it was not regarded with the
same admiration by the rest of the guests.

These little incidents, perhaps, helped to wile away the weary hours until it was time for
the bridal pair to depart. Mrs. Dennistoun was so angry that it kept up a little fire, so to
speak, in her heart when the light of her house was extinguished. Lady Mariamne, standing in
the porch with a bag full of rice to throw, kept up the spirit of the mistress of the house,
which otherwise might, perhaps, have failed her altogether at that inconceivable moment; for
though she had been looking forward to it for months it was inconceivable when it came, as
death is inconceivable. Elinor going away!--not on a visit, or to be back in a week, or a month,
or a year--going away for ever! ending, as might be said, when she put her foot on the step
of the carriage. Her mother stood by and looked on with that cruel conviction that overtakes
all at the last. Up to this moment had it not seemed as if the course of affairs was unreal,
as if something must happen to prevent it? Perhaps the world will end to-night, as the lover
says in the "Last Ride." But now here was the end: nothing had happened, the world was swinging
on in space in its old careless way, and Elinor was going--going away for ever and ever. Oh,
to come back, perhaps--there was nothing against that--but never the same Elinor. The mother
stood looking, with her hand over her eyes to shield them from the sun. Those eyes were quite
dry, and she stood firm and upright by the carriage door. She was not "breaking down" or "giving
way," as everybody feared. She was "bearing up," as everybody was relieved to see. And in a
moment it was all over, and there was nothing before her eyes--no carriage, no Elinor. She
was so dazed that she stood still, looking with that strange kind of smile for a full minute
after there was nothing to smile at, only the vacant air and the prospect of the combe, coming
in in a sickly haze which existed only in her eyes.

But, by good luck, there was Lady Mariamne behind, and the fire of indignation giving a red
flicker upon the desolate hearth.

"I caught Phil on the nose," said that lady, in great triumph; "spoilt his beauty for him for
to-day. But let's hope she won't mind. She thinks him beautiful, the little goose. Oh, my Puggy-wuggy,
did that cruel Algy pull your little, dear tail, you darling? Come to oos own mammy, now those
silly wedding people are away."

"Your little dog, I presume, is of a very rare sort," said Mr. Tatham, to be civil. He had
proposed the bride and bridegroom's health in a most appropriate speech, and he felt that he
had deserved well of his kind, which made him more amiable even than usual. "Your ladyship's
little dog," he added, after a moment, as she did not take any notice, "I presume, is of a
rare kind?"

Lady Mariamne gave him a look, or rather a stare. "Is Puggy of a rare sort?" she said over
her shoulder, to one of the attendant tribe.

"Don't be such a duffer, Jew! You know as well as any one what breed he's of," Harry Compton said.

"Oh, I forgot," said the fine lady. She was standing full in front of the entrance, keeping
Mrs. Dennistoun in the full sun outside. "I hope there's a train very soon," she said. "Did
you look, Algy, as I told you? If it hadn't been that Phil would have killed me I should have
gone now. It would have been such fun to have spied upon the turtle doves!"

The men thought it would have been rare fun with obedient delight, but that Phil would have
cut up rough, and made a scene. At this Lady Mariamne held up her finger, and made a portentous
face.

"Oh, you naughty, naughty boy," she cried, "telling tales out of school."

"Perhaps, my dear lady," said Mr. Tatham, quietly, "you would let Mrs. Dennistoun pass."

"Oh!" said Lady Mariamne, and stared at him again for half a minute; then she turned and stared
at the tall lady in grey satin. "Anybody can pass," she said: "I'm not so very big."

"That is quite true--quite true. There is plenty of room," said the little gentleman, holding
out his hand to his cousin.

"My dear John," said Mrs. Dennistoun, "I am sure you will be kind enough to lend your carriage
again to Lady Mariamne, who is in a hurry to get away. There is another train, which stops
at Downforth station, in half an hour, and there will just be time to get there, if you will
order it at once. I told your man to be in readiness: and it would be a thousand pities to
lose this train, for there is not another for an hour."

"By Jove, Jew! there's a slap in the face for you," said, in an audible whisper, one of the
train, who had been standing in front of all the friends, blocking out the view. As for Lady
Mariamne, she stared more straight than ever into Mrs. Dennistoun's eyes, but for the moment
did not seem to find anything to say. She was left in the hall with her band while the mistress
of the house went into the drawing-room, followed by all the country ladies, who had not lost
a word, and who were already whispering to each other over that terrible betrayal about the
temper of Phil.

"Cut up rough! Oh! poor little Elinor, poor little Elinor!" the ladies said to each other under
their breath.

"I am not at all surprised. It is not any news to me. You could see it in his eyes," said Miss
Mary Dale. And then they all were silent to listen to the renewed laughter that came bursting
from the hall. Mrs. Hudson questioned her husband afterwards as to what it was that made everybody
laugh, but the Rector had not much to say. "I really could not tell you, my dear," he said.
"I don't remember anything that was said--but it seemed funny somehow, and as they all laughed
one had to laugh too."

The great lady came in, however, dragged by her brother to say good-by. "It has all gone off
very well, I am sure, and Nell looked very nice, and did you great credit," she said, putting
out her hand. "And it's very kind of you to take so much trouble to get us off by the first train."

"Oh, it is no trouble," Mrs. Dennistoun said.

"Shouldn't you like to say good-by to Puggy-muggy?" said Lady Mariamne, touching the little
black nose upon her arm. "He enjoyed that pâté so much. He really never has foie gras at home:
but he doesn't at all mind if you would like to give him a little kiss just here."

"Good-by, Lady Mariamne," said Mrs. Dennistoun, with one of the curtseys of the old school.
But there was another gust of laughter as Lady Mariamne was placed in the carriage, and a shrill
little trumpet gave forth the satisfaction of the departing guest at having "got a rise out
of the old girl." The gentlemen heaped themselves into Mr. Tatham's carriage, and swept off
along with her, all but civil Harry, who waited to make their apologies, and to put up along
with his own Dick Bolsover's "things." And thus the bridegroom's party, the new associates
of Elinor, the great family into which the Honourable Mrs. Phil Compton had been so lucky as
to marry, to the great excitement of all the country round, departed and was seen no more.
Harry, who was civil, walked home with the Hudsons when all was over, and said the best he
could for the Jew and her friends. "You see, she has been regularly spoiled: and then when
a girl's so dreadful shy, as often as not it sounds like impudence." "Dear me, I should never
have thought Lady Mariamne was shy," the gentle Rector said. "That's just how it is," said
Harry. He went over again in the darkening to take his leave of Mrs. Dennistoun. After I had surveyed
the salt-works and the glassworks, I turned my horse's head toward Mexico by the road along
the eastern shore, so that I made the complete circuit of Lake Tezcuco.

Thus far my visit to the royal city of Tezcuco had been perfectly successful, except in the
attempts made to convince the young Englishman that I was not a dead-shot with the rifle; and
I started home with a slight shade upon my veracity for denying my ability to pierce the centre
of the bull's-eye. But otherwise it was a disagreeable parting to all of us. As I returned
by the east side of the lake, the splendid high farming-lands that
extend from the shore to the foot of the mountain were strikingly
in contrast with the flatness and barrenness of the plain on the water-side,
which is so slightly elevated above the level of the salt water that
a few inches of rise in the laguna spreads out an immense sheet of
saline water, and yet there is not a solitary evaporating vat where
there is an unlimited demand for the evaporated article at fourteen
shillings the aroba.

Cortéz speaks of the fine fields of corn on the east side of the lake. But they could not have
been finer in his day than they are at present, though they furnished
him with the supplies that supported his army.

I reached the head of Tezcuco at noontide, where the heavy water of the salt lake was driving
up toward the fresh water, as described by Cortéz, but it was under
the pressure of a strong north wind.

THE AZTEC CAUSEWAYS.

Now that I am on the new causeway, broad and spacious like all the others, it may be well to conclude
the discussion of the physical condition of this valley by determining the size of the old
Aztec causeways.

An island embosomed in a marsh has always formed a favorite retreat for an Indian tribe, whether
among the everglades of Florida, or the wild-rice swamps of north-western Canada. Such a retreat is
still more desirable when, in addition to the security it affords from an enemy, it is likewise
a resort for wild ducks, as was and is the case with the laguna of the Mexican valley. Hence,
probably, the Aztecs selected this place as the site of their village; and to reach it, it
was necessary to make one or more footpaths across the marsh. As the Aztecs had no beasts
of burden, this must have been a task of no little magnitude. To have made it thirty feet wide
would not only have been a work of immense difficulty, but would have destroyed the defensive
character of their position. Still, we can, upon this occasion, afford to be a little liberal with
the statements of Cortéz, as we have had to cut his hundreds of thousands of warriors down to
a few thousand of miserably-armed Indians, and reduce his magnificent cities to small Indian
villages. In order to make the island of Mexico at all inhabitable, we have had to reduce his
lakes from navigable basins of twelve feet or more in depth to mere evaporating ponds. His floating
islands have been transformed into garden-beds built upon the mud; and his canals have sunk
to mere ditches. Now I propose to be liberal to the old Conquistador in the matter of his famous
causeways, and will therefore admit that they might have been twelve feet in width--as broad
as the tow-path of the Erie Canal.

CHAPTER XIX.

As I rode along the street to the gate and causeway of Tacuba, over which Cortéz retreated on the
"sorrowful night" (triste noche), I naturally fell into reflections upon the righteous retribution
that overtook a portion of the Spanish robbers on that night, and upon the mysterious ways of
Providence in allowing Cortéz and a remnant to escape being burned alive by the Indians after
the infamous lives which, by their own admissions, they had been
leading in the city.

The Indians had made a feeble resistance when Alvarado murdered their chiefs, and had cringed
into submission when Cortéz returned. But now their wrongs had reached that point where even
Aztecs could endure no more. Their cup of iniquity seemed full, when Cortéz, who had left a wife
in Cuba, sent to the little village of Tacuba, called by Diaz Tlacupa, to fetch thence some "women
of his household, among whom was the daughter of Montezuma [he had already one daughter of Montezuma
in his power] whom he had given in charge of the King of Tlacupa, her relative, when he marched
against Narvaez."[36] The women being rescued, Cortéz afterward sent Ordaz, with four hundred
men, which brought on hostilities that ended in this night retreat.

THE HOUSEHOLD OF CORTÉZ.

Cortéz was worse than the Mormon governor of Utah, who is said to have thirty-six wives in his household.
But they are, at least, voluntary inmates of his harem, while the "household" of Cortéz had been taken
by violence. It is one of the prominent traits of Indian character that, while they are inhuman
to their female captives, they guard with the utmost jealousy the virtue of their wives. Even
among the debased Indians of California, female infidelity is punished with death; and I have
seen the whole population of an Indian village on the Upper Sacramento thrown into the utmost
confusion--the women howling, and the men brandishing their weapons--because a base Indian had
sold his wife to a still baser white man. "Such a thing was never," they said, "done in the
tribe before." And here we have Cortéz, in contempt of even Indian notions of virtue, sending
to bring to his harem, by violence, another daughter of Montezuma.

As Bernal Diaz goes more into detail than Cortéz, he now and then drops an expression that furnishes
a clew to many an enigma otherwise unexplainable. In speaking of the avarice of the officers,
he lets fall the following confession of his own infamy:

"This was a good hint to us in future, so that afterward, when we had captured any beautiful
Indian females, we concealed them, and gave out that they had escaped. As soon as it was come
to the marking day, or, if any one of us stood in favor with Cortéz, he got them secretly marked
[viz., branded with a red-hot iron] during the night-time, and paid a fifth of their value to him.
In a short time we possessed a great number of such slaves."[37]

Never was there a band of Anglo-Saxon outlaws, cut-throats, pirates, or buccaneers that reached
that point of human depravity that they could brand, as cattle are branded, with a red-hot iron,
swarms of women taken by violence, in order that they might not make
any mistakes in recognizing their numberless wives!

None but Spanish heroes of a "holy war" ever exhibited such a picture of total depravity.

When the Aztecs were thus roused to action by the brutal lust of Cortéz, they assailed him with
phrensy rather than with courage, until his quarters in the city became untenable, and then
this night retreat was undertaken, in which all the gold, if there really was any, and all
other treasures, and two sons and one daughter of Montezuma, were lost in the confused rush
of such a multitude over this foot-path. The Indian story is that Cortéz slew the children of
Montezuma when he found himself unable to carry them off. Perhaps he did, but the probability
is that they perished by chance, or, rather, it seems to have been by chance that Cortéz or
any of his gang escaped and came safe to Tacuba.

We must now give up history to talk of things by the road-side.

The "hard water" from the springs on the south side of Chapultepec is carried over stone arches
upon the causeway of Tacubaya to the gate of Belin.

But at Santa Fé, several leagues distant from the city, is a stream of soft water, which is
brought to the powder-mill (Molina del Rey), where it turns a wheel. Thence the aqueduct, passing
by the north side of Chapultepec, is carried along the highway to the causeway of San Cosmo.
It passes the gate of San Cosmo, enters the city, and terminates in the street of Tacuba.
By these two gates, and by the side of these two parallel aqueducts, the American army entered
the city of Mexico.

The objects of interest by the road-side, after I had passed the city gate, were, first, the
French Academy, which is well worthy of a visit for its pretty grounds, if nothing more. When
we had got farther on, the land rose a little above the water-level of the swamp. Here a branch-road
and the aqueduct turned off to Chapultepec, and in the angle thus formed by the two roads is the English
burying-ground or cemetery. In this resting-place of the dead there is not a spot that can not
be irrigated at all seasons of the year, while the art of man has been busy in improving the
advantages that nature has so lavishly bestowed.

Just before my first arrival in Mexico, public attention had been particularly directed to this
quiet spot, from its having been chosen as the place for depositing the ashes of the last President
of Mexico, at whose burial no holy water had been wasted and no candles had been burned, and
for the repose of whose soul no masses had ever been said, or other religious rites performed,
and yet he slept as quietly as those who had gone to their burial with the pomp and circumstance
of a state funeral. No priest had shrived his soul, his lips had not been touched with the
anointing oil, nor was incense burned at his funeral; yet he died in peace, declaring in his
last hours that he had made his confession to God, and trusted in him for the pardon of his sins,
and refused all the proffered aid of priests in facilitating his journey to heaven. Thus died,
and here was privately buried, the first and last Protestant President of Mexico, the only really
good man that ever occupied that exalted station, and probably the only native Mexican who
ever had the moral courage to denounce the religion of his fathers
upon his dying bed.

THE AMERICAN CEMETERY.

Adjoining the English cemetery on the south side is the American burying-ground,
which has been established since the war, where have been collected
the remains of 750 Americans, that died or were killed at Mexico,
and a neat monument has been erected over them.

Here Americans that die henceforth in that city can be buried. An appropriation of $500 a year
would make this more attractive than the English cemetery, but the
place has been wholly neglected by Congress since that worthy man,
the Rev. G. G. Goss, completed his labors.

There is a pleasure in observing the natural affinities which, in
foreign countries, draw close together these two branches of the Anglo-Saxon
family.

A common language and a common religion overmaster political differences,
and the English and American dead are laid side by side to rest until
the judgment.

At the south of the American cemetery is a vacant lot, which the
King of Prussia should purchase, so that the Germans may no longer
be dependent on Americans for a burying-place, and that the three
great Protestant powers of the world may here, as they every where
should, be drawn close together.

Tacuba is a very small village, and is not in any wise noted except
for an immense cypress-tree, that must have been a wonder even in
the time of Cortéz.

Tacuba has the historical notoriety of being the place where hostilities
first broke out between the Aztecs and the Spaniards, and the spot
where the night retreat of the latter terminated.

Here the land is quite fertile, and a little way from the village are several water-mills,
where the grain raised in this part of the valley is ground into flour.

THE VIRGIN OF REMEDIES.

A little way beyond Tacuba is the hill and temple of the Virgin of Remedies. It was upon this hill,
within the inclosure of an Indian mound, that the retreating party
of Cortéz made their first bivouac, and built fires and dressed their
wounds.

Hence they gave to the hill the name of Remedios, and the church afterward erected was dedicated
to our Lady of Remedies. Diaz tells us that it became very celebrated in his time. The story
about Cortéz finding a broken-nosed image in the knapsack of one of his soldiers is not mentioned
either by himself or Bernal Diaz, and must therefore be an afterthought, to give plausibility to
a subsequent imposition. From this point Cortéz and his party, without their women or treasures,
trudged along to the foot of the hills to Tepeac, or Guadalupe, and thence around the foot of
Tezcuco to the plains of Otumba.

The story is, that while Cortéz and his men were resting here, a soldier took from his knapsack
an image, with nose broken and an eye wanting, which Cortéz made the patron saint of the expedition,
and held it up to their adoration, and that this little incident so encouraged the men that they
started off with renewed vigor. The whole of this story is probably a very silly modern invention.
The bulk of the forces of Cortéz was most probably composed of that
class of reprobates that to this day can be found about almost any
of the West India sea-ports, ready for any enterprise, however hazardous.

They have no religion; they are not even superstitious, but yield a nominal acquiescence to the
forms of the Catholic religion. Cortéz speaks often of his efforts to effect the conversion
of the Indians, but it is in such a business sort of way as to lead to the impression, that
it was all done to make an impression at home, but was really a matter that he did not care
much about. The famous image, according to the current story, disappeared soon after the Conquest,
but was found about 150 years afterward in a maguey plant, and was as much dilapidated as if
it had been exposed to the weather for the whole of that century and a half.

Such, in substance, is the tradition of the Virgin of Remedies, who for a century divided with
the Virgin of Guadalupe the adoration of the people in the most amicable manner. But when the
insurrection of 1810 broke out, these two virgins parted company. "Viva the Virgin of Guadalupe!"
became the war-cry of the unsuccessful rebels, while "Viva the Lady of Remedies!" was shouted
back by the conquering forces of the king.

The Lady of Guadalupe became suspected of insurrectionary propensities, while all honors were
lavished upon the Lady of Remedies by those who wished to make protestations of their loyalty. Pearls,
money, and jewels were bestowed upon her by the nobility and the Spanish merchants; and as
one insurrectionary leader after another was totally defeated, the conquering generals returned
to lay their trophies at the feet of the Lady of Remedies, to whose
interposition the victory was ascribed.

They carried her in triumphant procession through the streets of
Mexico, singing a laudamus.

Then it was that the Lady of Remedies was at the zenith of her glory. Her person was refulgent
with a blaze of jewels, and her temple was like that of Diana of Ephesus, and all about the hill
on which it stood bore marks of the greatest prosperity.

RISE AND FALL OF THE VIRGIN.

Her healing powers were then unrivaled, and the list of cures which she is claimed to have effected
surpasses that of all the patent medicines of our day. She was an infallible healer, alike of the
diseases of the mind and of the body. A glimpse of her broken nose and battered face instantaneously
cured men of democracy and unbelief. Heretics stood confounded in her presence, while the halt,
the lame, and the leprous hung up their crutches, their bandages, and their filthy rags, as
trophies of her healing power, among the flags and other trophies of her victories over the
rebels. Nothing was beyond her skill; from mending a leaky boat to securing a prize in the lottery;
from giving eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, mending a broken or a paralyzed limb, or
a broken heart, to putting the baby to sleep. Her votaries esteemed her omnipotent, and carried
her in procession in times of drought, as the goddess of rain; and when pestilence raged in
the city, she was borne through the infected streets. Such was she in the times of her glory.

Now all is changed. She is still a goddess, but her glory is eclipsed. She, like many a virgin
in social life, neglected to make her market while all knees were bowing to her, and now, in
the sear and yellow leaf, she is a virgin still. Her temple is dilapidated, her garlands are
faded, her gilding is tarnished, the buildings about her Court are falling to decay, while the
bleak hill which her temple crowns looks tenfold more uninviting than if it never had been
occupied.

When I entered this neglected temple of a neglected image, an old, superannuated priest was saying
mass, and three or four old crones were kneeling before her altar.

Such are the effects that followed the revolution of Iguala. Not only was her hated rival
of Guadalupe elevated from her long obscurity to be the national saint, but the animosity against
this dilapidated image of Remedies was carried to that extreme of cruelty that, when the Spaniards
were expelled from Mexico, the passports of the "Lady of Remedios"
were made out, and she was ordered to leave the country.

Poor thing!

The porter's eye glistened at the now unwonted sight of a silver dollar, and he soon had me
through the most secret recesses of the sanctuary.

The only things I saw worthy of admiration were some pictures, made
from down or the feathers of the humming-bird, by which a richness
of color was imparted to the pictures that could not be obtained from
paints.

At last we came to the back of the great altar, and the curtain of damask silk being drawn up
by a little string, we saw sitting in a metallic maguey plant a bright new Paris doll, dressed
in the gaudy odds and ends of silk that make such a thing an attractive
Christmas present for the nursery.

Paste supplied the place of jewels, and a constellation of false pearls were at the back of her
shoulders. The man kept his gravity, and did reverence to the poor doll, while I burned with
indignation at being imposed upon by a counterfeit "universal remedy for all diseases." I
had often read in the apothecaries' advertisements cautions against counterfeits, and rewards
for their detection, and I always noticed, from these printed evidences, that the counterfeits
were exactly in proportion to the worthlessness of the genuine article, and that medicine which
was utterly valueless itself suffered most from the abundance of counterfeits. So it was with
the Lady of Remedios; after she had fallen below the dignity of a
humbug, and no man was found so poor as to do her reverence, she was
spirited away to the Cathedral of the city of Mexico, in order to
save her three jeweled petticoats from being stolen, and a child's
doll, covered with paste jewels, now personified the great patron
saint of the vice-kingdom of New Spain.

AZTEC AND ROMISH IMAGES.

I again mounted my horse, angry at being cheated. Though the day was a most lovely one, I rode
home in fit humor to contrast the system of paganism which Cortéz
introduced with the more poetical system which preceded it, and to
compare these cast-off child's dolls with the allegorical images of
the Aztecs.

My landlord had two boxes of such images, collected when they were cleaning out one of the
old city canals. By way of parlor ornaments, we had an Aztec god of baked earth. He was sitting
in a chair; around his navel was coiled a serpent; his right hand rested upon the head of another
serpent.

This, according to the laws of interpreting allegories, we should
understand to signify that the god had been renowned for his wisdom;
that with the wisdom of the serpent he had executed judgment; and
that his meditations were the profundity of wisdom.

And yet this allegorical worship, defective as it may have been, was forcibly superseded by the adoration
of a child's doll--one that had very possibly been worn out and thrown from a nursery, and perhaps
picked up by some passing monk, was made the goddess of New Spain, and clothed with three petticoats,
one adorned with pearls, one with rubies, and one with diamonds,
at an estimated cost of $3,000,000. Which was the least objectionable
superstition?

We have been taught to look upon the worship of the
Aztecs as monstrous; but the witnesses against them were themselves
monsters, who were seeking for a pretense to excuse their own brutality
in reducing the Indians to the most debasing slavery, while they appropriated
to their own use the best looking of the squaws, and kept such swarms
of supernumerary wives that each Spaniard had to brand them with a
red-hot iron in order to know his own family. The fathers of the present
mixed-breed population of Mexico tell us that the Aztecs offered human
sacrifices, and feasted upon human flesh. They hope, by dwelling upon
the enormities of the Indians, to excuse their own still more detestable
crimes. For three centuries their stories were uncontradicted, and
they have been received as historical verities. But the character
of the witnesses warrants us in receiving their statements with some
incredulity.

me unhappy to know, yet that if let alone might come all right. Tell me, John, what should I do?"

And they sat debating thus till far on in the night.

CHAPTER XVIII.

Mrs. Dennistoun did not go up to town. There are some women who would have done so, seeing
the other side of the subject--at all hazards; and perhaps they would have been right--who
can tell? She did not--denying herself, keeping herself by main force in her solitude, not
to interfere with the life of her child, which was drawn on lines so different from any of
hers--and perhaps she was wrong. Who knows, except by the event, which is the best or the worst
way in any of our human movements, which are so short-sighted? And twice during the season
Elinor found means to come to the cottage for a night as she had done at first. These were
occasions of great happiness, it need not be said--but of many thoughts and wonderings too.
She had always an excuse for Phil. He had meant until the last moment to come with her--some
one had turned up, quite unexpectedly, who had prevented him. It was a fatality; especially
when she came down in July did she insist upon this. He had been invited quite suddenly to
a political dinner to meet one of the Ministers from whom he had hopes of an appointment. "For
we find that we can't go on enjoying ourselves for ever," she said gayly, "and Phil has made
up his mind he must get something to do."

"It is always the best way," said Mrs. Dennistoun.

"I am not so very sure, mamma, when you have never been used to it. Of course, some people
would be wretched without work. Fancy John with nothing to do! How he would torment his wife--if
he had one. But Phil never does that. He is very easy to live with. He is always after something,
and leaves me as free as if he had a day's work in an office."

This slipped out, with a smile: but evidently after it was said Elinor regretted she had said
it, and thought that more might be drawn from the admission than she intended. She added quietly,
"Of course a settled occupation would interfere with many things. We could not go out together
continually as we do now."

Was there any way of reconciling these two statements? Mrs. Dennistoun tried and tried in vain
to make them fit into each other: and yet no doubt there was some way.

"And perhaps another season, mother, if Phil was in a public office--it seems so strange to
think of Phil having an office--you might come up, don't you think, to town for a time? Would
it be a dreadful bore to you to leave the country just when it is at its best? I'm afraid it
would be a dreadful bore: but we could run about together in the mornings when he was busy,
and go to see the pictures and things. How pleasant it would be!"

"It would be delightful for me, Elinor. I shouldn't mind giving up the country, if it wouldn't
interfere with your engagements, my dear."

"Oh, my engagements! Much I should care for them if Phil was occupied. I like, of course, to
be with him."

"Of course," said Mrs. Dennistoun.

"And it is good for him, too, I think." This was another of the little admissions that Elinor
regretted the moment they were made. "I mean it's a pity, isn't it, when a man likes to have
his wife with him that she shouldn't always be there, ready to go?"

"A great pity," said Mrs. Dennistoun, and then she changed the subject. "I thought it required
all sorts of examinations and things for a man to get into a public office now."

"So it does for the ordinary grades, which would be far, far too much routine for Phil. But
they say a minister always has things in his power. There are still posts----"

"Sinecures, Elinor?"

"I did not mean exactly sinecures," she said, with an embarrassed laugh, "though I think those
must have been fine things; but posts where it is not merely routine, where a man may have
a chance of acting for himself and distinguishing himself, perhaps. And to be in the service
of the country is always better, safer, than that dreadful city. Don't you think so?"

"I have never thought the city dreadful, Elinor. I have had many friends connected with the city."

"Ah, but not in those horrid companies, mamma. Do you know that company which we just escaped,
which Phil saved my money out of, when it was all but invested--I believe that has ruined people
right and left. He got out of it, fortunately, just before the smash; that is, of course, he
never had very much to do with it, he was only on the Board."

"And where is your money now?"

"Oh, I can answer that question this time," said Elinor, gayly. "He had just time to get it
into another company which pays--beautifully! The Jew is in it, too, and the whole lot of them.
Oh! I beg your pardon, mamma. I tried hard to call her by her proper name, but when one never
hears any other, one can't help getting into it!"

"I hope," said Mrs. Dennistoun, "that Philip was not much mixed up with this company if other
people have been ruined, and he has escaped?"

"How could that be?" said Elinor, with a sort of tremulous dignity. "You don't suppose for
a moment that he----. But of course you don't," she added with a heightened colour and a momentary
cloud over her eyes, "of course you don't. There was a dreadful manager who destroyed the books
and then fled, so that there never could be a right winding up of the affairs."

"I hope Philip will take great care never to have to do with anything of the kind again."

"Oh, no, he has promised me he will not. I will not have it. He has a kind of ornamental directorship
on this new company, just for the sake of his name: but he has promised me he will have nothing
more to do with it for my peace of mind."

"I wonder that they should care in the city for so small a matter as a peer's younger son."

"Oh, do you think it a small matter, mamma? I don't mean that I care, but people give a good
deal of weight to it, you know."

"I meant only in the city, Elinor."

"Oh!" Elinor said. She was half offended with her mother's indifference. She had found that
to be the Hon. Mrs. Compton was something, or so at least she supposed: and she began timidly
to give her mother a list of her engagements, which were indeed many in number, and there were
some dazzling names among a great many with which Mrs. Dennistoun was unacquainted. But how
could she know who were the fashionable people nowadays, a woman living so completely out of
the world?

John Tatham, for his part, went through his engagements that year with a constant expectation
of seeing Elinor, which preoccupied him more than a rising young barrister going everywhere
ought to have been preoccupied. He thought he went everywhere, and so did his family at home,
especially his sister, Mary Tatham, who was his father's nurse and attendant, and never had
any chance of sharing these delights. She made all the more, as was natural, of John's privileges
and social success from the fact of her own seclusion, and was in the habit of saying that
she believed there was scarcely a party in London to which John was not invited--three or four
in a night. But it would seem with all this that there were many parties to which he was not
invited, for the Phil Comptons (how strange and on the whole disgusting to think that this
now meant Elinor!) also went everywhere, and yet they very seldom met. It was true that John
could not expect to meet them at dinner at a Judge's or in the legal society in high places
which was his especial sphere, and nothing could be more foolish than the tremor of expectation
with which this very steady-going man would set out to every house in which the fashionable
world met with the professional, always thinking that perhaps----But it was rarely, very rarely,
that this perhaps came to pass. When it did it was amid the crowd of some prodigious reception
to which people "looked in" for half an hour, and where on one occasion he found Elinor alone,
with that curious dignity about her, a little tragical, which comes of neglect. He agreed with
her mother, that he had never imagined Elinor's youthful prettiness could have come to anything
so near beauty. There was a strained, wide open look in her eyes, which was half done by looking
out for some one, and half by defying any one to think that she felt herself alone, or was
pursuing that search with any anxiety. She stood exceedingly erect, silent, observing everything,
yet endeavouring to appear as if she did not observe, altogether a singular and very striking
figure among the fashionable crowd, in which it seemed everybody was chattering, smiling, gay
or making believe to be gay, except herself. When she saw John a sudden gleam of pleasure,
followed by a cloud of embarrassment, came over her face: but poor Elinor could not help being
glad to see some one she knew, some one who more or less belonged to her; although it appeared
she had the best of reasons for being alone. "I was to meet Phil here," she said, "but somehow
I must have missed him." "Let us walk about a little, and we'll be sure to find him," said
John. She was so glad to take his arm, almost to cling to him, to find herself with a friend.
"I don't know many people here," she confided to John, leaning on his arm, with the familiar
sisterly dependence of old, "and I am so stupid about coming out by myself. It is because I
have never been used to it. There has always been mamma, and then Phil; but I suppose he has
been detained somewhere to-night. I think I never felt so lost before, among all these strange
people. He knows everybody, of course."

"But you have a lot of friends, Elinor."

"Oh, yes," she said, brightly enough; "in our own set: but this is what Phil calls more serious
than our set. I should not wonder in the least if he had shirked it at the last, knowing I
would be sure to come."

"That is just the reason why I should have thought he would not shirk it," said John.

"Ah, that's because you're not married," said Elinor, but with a laugh in which there was no
bitterness. "Don't you know one good of a wife is to do the man's social duties for him, to
appear at the dull places and save his credit? Oh, I don't object at all; it is quite a legitimate
division of labour. I shall get into it in time: but I am so stupid about coming into a room
alone, and instead of looking about to see what people I really do know, I just stiffen into
a sort of shell. I should never have known you if you had not come up to me, John."

"You see I was looking out for you, and you were not looking out for me, that makes all the
difference."

"You were looking out for us!"

"Ever since the season began I have been looking out for you, everywhere," said John, with
a rather fierce emphasis on the pronoun, which, however, as everybody knows, is plural, and
means two as much as one, though it was the reverse of this that John Tatham meant to show.

"Ah!" said Elinor. "But then I am afraid our set is different, John. There will always be some
places--like this, for instance--where I hope we shall meet; but our set perhaps is a little
frivolous, and your set a little--serious, don't you see? You are professional and political,
and all that; and Phil is--well, I don't know exactly what Phil is--more fashionable and frivolous,
as I said. A race-going, ball-going, always in motion set."

"Most people," said John, "go more or less to races and balls."

"More or less, that makes the whole difference. We go to them all. Now you see the distinction,
John. You go to Ascot perhaps on the cup day; we go all the days and all the other days, at
the other places."

"How knowing you have become!"

"Haven't I?" she said, with a smile that was half a sigh.

"But I shouldn't have thought that would have suited you, Elinor."

"Oh, yes, it does," she said, and then she eyed him with something of the defiance that had
been in her look when she was standing alone. She did not avoid his look as a less brave woman
might have done. "I like the fun of it," she said.

And then there was a pause, for he did not know what to reply.

"We have been through all the rooms," she said at last, "and we have not seen a ghost of Phil.
He cannot be coming now. What o'clock is it? Oh, just the time he will be due at---- I'm sure
he can't come now. Do you think you could get my carriage for me? It's only a brougham that
we hire," she said, with a smile, "but the man is such a nice, kind man. If he had been an
old family coachman he couldn't take more care of me."

"That looks as if he had to take care of you often, Elinor."

"Well," she said, looking him full in the face again, "you don't suppose my husband goes out
with me in the morning shopping? I hope he has something better to do."

"Shouldn't you like to have your mother with you for the shopping, etc.?"

"Ah, dearly!" then with a little quick change of manner, "another time--not this season, but
next, if I can persuade her to come; for next year I hope we shall be more settled, perhaps
in a house of our own, if Phil gets the appointment he is after."

"Oh, he is after an appointment?"

"Yes, John; Phil is not so lucky as to have a profession like you."

This was a new way of looking at the matter, and John Tatham found nothing to say. It seemed
to him, who had worked very hard for it, a little droll to describe his possession of a profession
as luck. But he made no remark. He took Elinor down-stairs and found her brougham for her,
and the kind old coachman on the box, who was well used to taking care of her, though only
hired from the livery stables for the season--John thought the old man looked suspiciously
at him, and would have stopped him from accompanying her, had he designed any such proceeding.
Poor little Nelly, to be watched over by the paternal fly-man on the box! she who might have
had---- but he stopped himself there, though his heart felt as heavy as a stone to see her
go away thus, alone from the smart party where she had been doing duty for her husband. John
could not take upon himself to finish his sentence--she who might have had love and care of
a very different kind. No, he had never offered her that love and care. Had Phil Compton never
come in her way it is possible that John Tatham might never have offered it to her--not, at
least, for a long time. He could never have had any right to be a dog in the manger, neither
would he venture to pretend now that it was her own fault if she had chosen the wrong man;
was it his fault then, who had never put a better man within her choice? but John, who was
no coxcomb, blushed in the dark to himself as this question flitted through his mind. He had
no reason to suppose that Elinor would have been willing to change the brotherly tie between
them into any other. Thank heaven for that brotherly tie! He would always be able to befriend
her, to stand by her, to help her as much as any one could help a woman who was married, and
thus outside of all ordinary succour. And as for that blackguard, that dis-Honourable Phil----
But here John, who was a man of just mind, paused again. For a man to let his wife go to a
party by herself was not after all so dreadful a thing. Many men did so, and the women did
not complain; to be sure they were generally older, more accustomed to manage for themselves
than Elinor: but still, a man need not be a blackguard because he did that. So John stopped
his own ready judgment, but still I am afraid in his heart pronounced Phil Compton's sentence
all the same. He did not say a word about this encounter to Mrs. Dennistoun; at least, he did
tell her that he had met Elinor at the So-and-So's, which, as it was one of the best houses
in London, was pleasing to a mother to hear.

"And how was she looking?" Mrs. Dennistoun cried.

"She was looking--beautiful----" said John. "I don't flatter, and I never thought her so in
the old times--but it is the only word I can use----"

"Didn't I tell you so?" said the mother, pleased. "She is quite embellished and improved--therefore
she must be happy."

"It is certainly the very best evidence----"

"Isn't it? But it so often happens otherwise, even in happy marriages. A girl feels strange,
awkward, out of it, in her new life. Elinor must have entirely accustomed herself, adapted
herself to it, and to them, or she would not look so well. That is the greatest comfort I can
have."

And John kept his own counsel about Elinor's majestic solitude and the watchful old coachman
in the hired brougham. Her husband might still be full of love and tenderness all the same.
It was a great effort of the natural integrity of his character to pronounce like this; but
he did it in the interests of justice, and for Elinor's sake and her mother's said nothing
of the circumstances at all.

It may be supposed that when Elinor paid the last of her sudden visits at the cottage it was
a heavy moment both for mother and daughter. It was the time when fashionable people finish
the season by going to Goodwood--and to Goodwood Elinor was going with a party, Lady Mariamne
and a number of the "set." She told her mother, to amuse her, of the new dresses she had got
for this important occasion. "Phil says one may go in sackcloth and ashes the remainder of
the year, but we must be fine for Goodwood," she said. "I wanted him to believe that I had
too many clothes already, but he was inexorable. It is not often, is it, that one's husband
is more anxious than one's self about one's dress?"

"He wants you to do him credit, Elinor."

"Well, mamma, there is no harm in that. But more than that--he wants me to look nice, for myself.
He thinks me still a little shy--though I never was shy, was I?--and he thinks nothing gives
you courage like feeling yourself well dressed--but he takes the greatest interest in everything
I wear."

"And where do you go after Goodwood, Elinor?"

"Oh, mamma, on such a round of visits!--here and there and everywhere. I don't know," and the
tears sprang into Elinor's eyes, "when I may see you again."

"You are not coming back to London," said the mother, with the heart sinking in her breast.

"Not now--they all say London is insupportable--it is one of the things that everybody says,
and I believe that Phil will not set foot in it again for many months. Perhaps I might get
a moment, when he is shooting, or something, to run back to you; but it is a long way from
Scotland--and he must be there, you know, for the 12th. He would think the world was coming
to an end if he did not get a shot at the grouse on that day."

"But I thought he was looking for an appointment, Elinor?"

A cloud passed over Elinor's face. "The season is over," she said, "and all the opportunities
are exhausted--and we don't speak of that any more."

She gave her mother a very close hug at the railway, and sat with her head partly out of the
window watching her as she stood on the platform, until the train turned round the corner.
No relief on her dear face now, but an anxious strain in her eyes to see her mother as long
as possible. Mrs. Dennistoun, as she walked again slowly up the hills that the pony might not
suffer, said to herself, with a chill at her heart, that she would rather have seen her child
sinking back in the corner, pleased that it was over, as on the first day.

CHAPTER XIX.

The next winter was more dreary still and solitary than the first at Windyhill. The first had
been, though it looked so long and dreary as it passed, full of hope of the coming summer,
which must, it seemed, bring Elinor back. But now Mrs. Dennistoun knew exactly what Elinor's
coming back meant, and the prospect was less cheering. Three days in the whole long season--three
little escapades, giving so very little hope of more sustained intercourse to come. Mrs. Dennistoun,
going over all the circumstances--she had so little else to do but to go over them in her long
solitary evenings--came to the conclusion that whatever might happen, she herself would go
to town when summer came again. She amused herself with thinking how she would find a little
house--quite a small house, as there are so many--in a good situation, where even the most
fashionable need not be ashamed to come, and where there would be room enough for Elinor and
her husband if they chose to establish themselves there. Mrs. Dennistoun was of opinion, already
expressed, that if mothers-in-law are obnoxious to men, sons-in-law are very frequently so
to women, which is a point of view not popularly perceived. And Philip Compton was not sympathetic
to her in any point of view. But still she made up her mind to endure him, and even his family,
for the sake of Elinor. She planned it all out--it gave a little occupation to the vacant time--how
they should have their separate rooms and even meals if that turned out most convenient; how
she would interfere with none of their ways: only to have her Elinor under her roof, to have
her when the husband was occupied--in the evenings, if there were any evenings that she spent
alone; in the mornings, when perhaps Phil got up late, or had engagements of his own; for the
moment's freedom when her child should be free. She made up her mind that she would ask no
questions, would never interfere with any of their habits, or oppose or put herself between
them--only just to have a little of Elinor every day.

"For it will not be the same thing this year," she said to John, apologetically. "They have
quite settled down into each other's ways. Philip must see I have no intention of interfering.
For the most obdurate opponent of mothers-in-law could not think--could he, John?--that I had
any desire to put myself between them, or make myself troublesome now."

"There is no telling," said John, "what such asses might think."

"But Philip is not an ass; and don't you think I have behaved very well, and may give myself
this indulgence the second year?"

"I certainly think you will be quite right to come to town: but I should not have them to live
with you, if I were you."

"Shouldn't you? It might be a risk: but then I shouldn't do it unless there was room enough
to leave them quite free. The thing I am afraid of is that they wouldn't accept."

"Oh, Phil Compton will accept," said John, hurriedly.

"Why are you so sure? I think often you know more about him than you ever say."

"I don't know much about him, but I know that a man of uncertain income and not very delicate
feelings is generally glad enough to have the expenses of the season taken off him: and even
get all the more pleasure out of it when he has his living free."

"That's not a very elevated view to take of the transaction, John."

"My dear aunt, I did not think you expected anything very elevated from the Comptons. They
are not the sort of family from which one expects----"

"And yet it is the family that my Elinor belongs to: she is a Compton."

"I did not think of that," said John, a little disconcerted. Then he added, "There is no very
elevated standard in such matters. Want of money has no law: and of course there are better
things involved, for he might be very glad that Elinor should have her mother to go out with
her, to stand by when--a man might have other engagements."

Mrs. Dennistoun looked at him closely and shook her head. She was not very much reassured by
this view of the case. "At all events I shall try it," she said.

Quite early in the year, when she was expecting no such pleasure, she was rewarded for her
patience by another flying visit from her child, who this time telegraphed to say she was coming,
so that her mother could go and meet her at the station, and thus lose no moment of her visit.
Elinor, however, was not in good spirits on this occasion, nor was she in good looks. She told
her mother hurriedly that Phil had come up upon business; that he was very much engaged with
the new company, getting far more into it than satisfied her. "I am terrified that another
catastrophe may come, and that he might share the blame if things were to go wrong"--which
was by no means a good preface for the mission with which it afterwards appeared Elinor herself
was charged.

"Phil told me to say to you, mamma, that if you were not satisfied with any of your investments,
he could help you to a good six or seven per cent.----"

She said this with her head turned away, gazing out of the window, contemplating the wintry
aspect of the combe with a countenance as cloudy and as little cheerful as itself.

There was an outcry on Mrs. Dennistoun's lips, but fortunately her sympathy with her child
was so strong that she felt Elinor's sentiments almost more forcibly than her own, and she
managed to answer in a quiet, untroubled voice.

"Philip is very kind, my dear: but you know my investments are all settled for me and I have
no will of my own. I get less interest, but then I have less responsibility. Don't you know
I belong to the time in which women were not supposed to be good for anything, and consequently
I am in the hands of my trustees."

"I think he foresaw that, mother," said Elinor, still with her head averted and her eyes far
away; "but he thought you might represent to the trustees that not only would it give you more
money, but it would be better in the end for me. Oh, how I hate to have to say this to you, mamma!"

How steadily Mrs. Dennistoun kept her countenance, though her daughter now flung herself upon
her shoulder with uncontrollable tears!

"My darling, it is quite natural you should say it. You must tell Philip that I fear I am powerless.
I will try, but I don't think anything will come of it. I have been glad to be free of responsibility,
and I have never attempted to interfere."

"Mother, I am so thankful. I oughtn't to go against him, ought I? But I would not have you
take his advice. It is so dreadful not to appear----"

"My dear, you must try to think that he understands better than you do: men generally do: you
are only a girl, and they are trained more or less to business."

"Not Phil! not Phil!"

"Well, he must have some capacity for it, some understanding, or they would not want him on
those boards; and you cannot have, Elinor, for you know nothing about it. To hear you speak
of per cents. makes me laugh." It was a somewhat forlorn kind of laugh, yet the mother executed
it finely: and by and by the subject dropped, and Elinor was turned to talk of other things--other
things of which there was a great deal to say, and over which they cried and laughed together
as nature bade.

In the same evening, the precious evening of which she did not like to waste a moment, Mrs.
Dennistoun unfolded her plan for the season. "I feel that I know exactly the kind of house
I want; it will probably be in some quiet insignificant place, a Chapel Street, or a Queen
Street, or a Park Street somewhere, but in a good situation. You shall have the first floor
all to yourself to receive your visitors, and if you think that Philip would prefer a separate
table----"

"Oh, mamma, mamma!" cried Elinor, clinging to her, kissing passionately her mother's cheek,
which was still as soft as a child's.

"It is not anything you have told me now that has put this into my head, my darling. I had
made it all up in my own mind. Then, you know, when your husband is engaged with those business
affairs--in the city--or with his own friends--you would have your mother to fall back upon,
Elinor. I should have just the moments perdus, don't you see, when you were doing nothing else,
when you were wanted for nothing else. I promise you, my darling, I should never be de trop,
and would never interfere."

"Oh, mamma, mamma!" Elinor cried again as if words failed her; and so they did, for she said
scarcely anything more, and evaded any answer. It went to her mother's heart, yet she made
her usual excuses for it. Poor child, once so ready to decide, accepting or rejecting with
the certainty that no opposition would be made to her will, but now afraid to commit herself,
to say anything that her husband would not approve! Well! Mrs. Dennistoun said to herself,
many a young wife is like that, and yet is happy enough. It depends so much on the man. Many
a man adores his wife and is very good to her, and yet cannot bear that she should seem to
settle anything without consulting his whim. And Philip Compton had never been what might be
called an easy-going man. It was right of Elinor to give no answer till she knew what he would
like. The dreadful thing was that she expressed no pleasure in her mother's proposal, scarcely
looked as if she herself would like it, which was a thing which did give an unquestionable wound.

"Mamma," she said, as they were driving to the station, not in the pony carriage this time,
but in the fly, for the weather was bad, "don't be vexed that I don't say more about your wonderful,
your more than kind offer."

"Kind is scarcely a word to use, Elinor, between you and me."

"I know, I know, mamma--and I as good as refuse it, saying nothing. Oh, if I could tell you
without telling you! I am so frightened--how can I say it?--that you should see things you
would not approve!"

"My dear, I am of one generation and you are of another. I am an old woman, and your husband
is a young man. But what does that matter? We can agree to differ. I will never thrust myself
into his private affairs, and he----"

"Oh, mother, mother darling, it is not that," Elinor said. And she went away without any decision.
But in a few days there came to Mrs. Dennistoun a letter from Philip himself, most nobly expressed,
saying that Elinor had told him of her mother's kind offer, and that he hastened to accept
it with the utmost gratitude and devotion. He had just been wondering, he wrote, how he was
to muster all things necessary for Elinor, with the business engagements which were growing
upon himself. Nobody could understand better than Nell's good mother how necessary it was that
he should neglect no means of securing their position, and he had found that often he would
have to leave his darling by herself: but this magnificent, this magnanimous offer on her part
would make everything right. Need he say how gratefully he accepted it? Nell and he being on
the spot would immediately begin looking out for the house, and when they had a list of three
or four to look at he hoped she would come up to their rooms and select what she liked best.
This response took away Mrs. Dennistoun's breath, for, to tell the truth, she had her own notions
as to the house she wanted and as to the time to be spent in town, and would certainly have
preferred to manage everything herself. But in this she had to yield, with thankfulness that
in the main point she was to have her way.

Did she have her way? It is very much to be doubted whether in such a situation of affairs
it would have been possible. The house that was decided upon was not one which she would have
chosen for herself, neither would she have taken it from Easter to July. She had meant a less
expensive place and a shorter season; but after all, what did that matter for once if it pleased
Elinor? The worst of it was that she could not at all satisfy herself that it pleased Elinor.
It pleased Philip, there was no doubt, but then it had not been intended except in a very secondary
way to please him. And when the racket of the season began Mrs. Dennistoun had a good deal
to bear. Philip, though he was supposed to be a man of business and employed in the city, got
up about noon, which was dreadful to all her orderly country habits; the whole afternoon through
there was a perpetual tumult of visitors, who, when by chance she encountered them in the hall
or on the stairs, looked at her superciliously as if she were the landlady. The man who opened
the door, and brushed Philip Compton's clothes, and was in his service, looked superciliously
at her too, and declined to have anything to say to "the visitors for down-stairs." A noise
of laughter and loud talk was (distinctly) in her ears from noon till late at night. When Philip
came home, always much later than his wife, he was in the habit of bringing men with him, whose
voices rang through the house after everybody was in bed. To be sure, there were compensations.
She had Elinor often for an hour or two in the morning before her husband was up. She had her
in the evenings when they were not going out, but these were few. As for Philip, he never dined
at home. When he had no engagements he dined at his club, leaving Elinor with her mother. He
gave Mrs. Dennistoun very little of his company, and when they did meet there was in his manner
too a sort of reflection of the superciliousness of the "smart" visitors and the "smart" servant.
She was to him, too, in some degree the landlady, the old lady down-stairs. Elinor, as was
natural, redoubled her demonstrations of affection, her excuses and sweet words to make up
for this neglect: but all the time there was in her mother's mind that dreadful doubt which
assails us when we have committed ourselves to one act or another, "Was it wise? Would it not
have been better to have denied herself and stayed away?" So far as self-denial went, it was
more exercised in Curzon Street than it would have been at the Cottage. For she had to see
many things that displeased her and to say no word; to guess at the tears, carefully washed
away from Elinor's eyes, and to ask no questions, and to see what she could not but feel was
the violent career downward, the rush that must lead to a catastrophe, but make no sign. There
was one evening when Elinor, not looking well or feeling well, had stayed at home, Philip having
a whole long list of engagements in hand; men's engagements, his wife explained, a stockbroking
dinner, an adjournment to somebody's chambers, a prolonged sitting, which meant play, and a
great deal of wine, and other attendant circumstances into which she did not enter. Elinor
had no engagement for that night, and was free to be petted and fêted by her mother. She was
put at her ease in a soft and rich dressing-gown, and the prettiest little dinner served, and
the room filled with flowers, and everything done that used to be done when she was recovering
from some little mock illness, some child's malady, just enough to show how dear above everything
was the child to the mother, and with what tender ingenuity the mother could invent new delights
for the child. These delights, alas! did not transport Elinor now as they once had done, and
yet the repose was sweet, and the comfort of this nearest and dearest friend to lean upon something
more than words could say.

On this evening, however, in the quiet of those still hours, poor Elinor's heart was opened,
or rather her mouth, which on most occasions was closed so firmly. She said suddenly, in the
midst of something quite different, "Oh, I wish Phil was not so much engaged with those dreadful
city men."

"My dear!" said Mrs. Dennistoun, who was thinking of far other things; and then she said, "there
surely cannot be much to fear in that respect. He is never in the city--he is never up, my
dear, when the city men are doing their work."

"Ah," said Elinor, "I don't think that matters; he is in with them all the same."

"Well, Elinor, there is no reason that there should be any harm in it. I would much rather
he had some real business in hand than be merely a butterfly of fashion. You must not entertain
that horror of city men."

"The kind he knows are different from the kind you know, mamma."

"I suppose everything is different from what it was in my time: but it need not be any worse
for that----"

"Oh, mother! you are obstinate in thinking well of everything; but sometimes I am so frightened,
I feel as if I must do something dreadful myself--to precipitate the ruin which nothing I can
do will stop----"

"Elinor, Elinor, this is far too strong language----"

"Mamma, he wants me to speak to you again. He wants you to give your money----"

"But I have told you already I cannot give it, Elinor."

"Heaven be praised for that! But he will speak to you himself, he will perhaps try to--bully
you, mamma."

"Elinor!"

"It is horrible, what I say; yes, it is horrible, but I want to warn you. He says things----"

"Nothing that he can say will make me forget that he is your husband, Elinor."

"Ah, but don't think too much of that, mamma. Think that he doesn't know what he is doing--poor
Phil, oh, poor Phil! He is hurried on by these people; and then it will break up, and the poor
people will be ruined, and they will upbraid him, and yet he will not be a whit the better.
He does not get any of the profit. I can see it all as clear---- And there are so many other
things."

Mrs. Dennistoun's heart sank in her breast, for she too knew what were the other things. "We
must have patience," she said; "he is in his hey-day, full of--high spirits, and thinking everything
he touches must go right. He will steady down in time."

"Oh, I am not complaining," cried Elinor, hurriedly dashing her tears away; "if you were not
a dreadfully good mamma, if you would grumble sometimes and find fault, that I might defend
him! It is the sight of you there, seeing everything and not saying a word that is too much
for me."

"Then I will grumble, Elinor. I will even say something to him for our own credit. He should
not come in so late--at least when he comes in he should come in to rest and not bring men
with him to make a noise. You see I can find fault as much as heart could desire. I am dreadfully
selfish. I don't mind when he goes out now and then without you, for then I have you; but he
should not bring noisy men with him to disturb the house in the middle of the night. I think
I will speak to him----"

"No," said Elinor, with a clutch upon her mother's arm; "no, don't do that. He does not like
to be found fault with. Unless in the case--if you were giving him that money, mother."

"Which I cannot do: and Elinor, my darling, which I would not do if I could. It is all you
will have to rely upon, you and----"

"It would have been the only chance," said Elinor. "I don't say it would have been much of
a chance. But he might have listened, if---- Oh, no, dear mother, no. I would not in my sober
senses wish that you should give him a penny. It would do no good, but only harm. And yet if
you had done it, you might have said---- and he might have listened to you for once----"

CHAPTER XX.

A few days after this Philip Compton came in, in the afternoon, to the little room down-stairs
which Mrs. Dennistoun had made into a sitting-room for herself. Elinor had gone out with her
sister-in-law, and her mother was alone. It was a very rare thing indeed for Mrs. Dennistoun's
guest--who, indeed, was to all intents and purposes the master of the house, and had probably
quite forgotten by this time that he was not in reality so--to pay a visit "down-stairs." "Down-stairs"
had a distinct meaning in the Compton vocabulary. It was spoken of with significance, and with
a laugh, as something half hostile, half ridiculous. It meant a sort of absurd criticism and
inspection, as of some old crone sitting vigilant, spying upon everything--a mother-in-law.
Phil's cronies thought it was the most absurd weakness on his part to let such an intruder
get footing in his house. "You will never get rid of her," they said. And Phil, though he was
generally quite civil to his wife's mother (being actually and at his heart more a gentleman
than he had the least idea he was), did not certainly in any way seek her society. He scarcely
ever dined at home, as has been said; when he had not an engagement--and he had a great many
engagements--he found that he was obliged to dine at his club on the evenings when he might
have been free; and as this was the only meal which was supposed to be common, it may be perceived
that Phil had little means of meeting his mother-in-law; and that he should come to see her
of his own free will was unprecedented. Phil Compton had not improved since his marriage. His
nocturnal enjoyments, the noisy parties up-stairs in the middle of the night, had not helped
to dissipate the effect of the anxieties of the city, which his wife so deplored. Mrs. Dennistoun
that very day, when she came down-stairs in the fresh summer morning to her early breakfast,
had seen through an open door the room up-stairs which was appropriated to Phil, with a lamp
still burning in the daylight, cards lying strewn about the floor, and all in that direful
disorder which a room so occupied overnight shows in the clear eye of the day. The aspect of
the room had given her a shock almost more startling than any moral certainty, as was natural
to a woman used to all the decorums and delicacies of a well-ordered life. There is no sin
in going late to bed, or even letting a lamp burn into the day; but the impression that such
a sight makes even upon the careless is always greater than any mere apprehension by the mind
of the midnight sitting, the eager game, the chances of loss and ruin. She had not been able
to get that sight out of her eyes. Though on ordinary occasions she never entered Phil's rooms,
on this she had stolen in to put out the lamp, with the sensation in her mind of destroying
some evidence against him, which someone less interested than she might have used to his disadvantage.
And she had sent up the housemaid to "do" the room, with an admonition. "I cannot have Mr.
Compton's rooms neglected," she said. "The gentlemen is always so late," the housemaid said
in self-defence. "I hears them let themselves out sometimes after we're all up down-stairs."
"I don't want to hear anything about the gentlemen. Do your work at the proper time; that is
all that is asked of you." Phil's servant appeared at the moment pulling on his coat, with
the air of a man who has been up half the night--which, indeed, was the case, for "the gentlemen"
when they came in had various wants that had to be supplied. "What's up now?" he said to the
housemaid, within hearing of her mistress, casting an insolent look at the old lady, who belonged
to "down-stairs." "She've been prying and spying about like they all do----" Mrs. Dennistoun
had retreated within the shelter of her room to escape the end of this sentence, which still
she heard, with the usual quickness of our faculties in such cases. She swallowed her simple
breakfast with what appetite she might, and her stout spirit for the moment broke down before
this insult which was ridiculous, she said to herself, from a saucy servant-man. What did it
matter to her what Johnson did or said? But it was like the lamp burning in the sunshine: it
gave a moral shock more sharp than many a thing of much more importance would have been capable
of doing, and she had not been able to get over it all day.

It may be supposed, therefore, that it was an unfortunate moment for Phil Compton's visit.
Mrs. Dennistoun had scarcely seen them that day, and she was sitting by herself, somewhat sick
at heart, wondering if anything would break the routine into which their life was falling;
or if this was what Elinor must address herself to as its usual tenor. It would be better in
the country, she said to herself. It was only in the bustle of the season, when everybody of
his kind was congregated in town, that it would be like this. In their rounds of visits, or
when the whole day was occupied with sport, such nocturnal sittings would be impossible--and
she comforted herself by thinking that they would not be consistent with any serious business
in the city such as Elinor feared. The one danger must push away the other. He could not gamble
at night in that way, and gamble in the other among the stockbrokers. They were both ruinous,
no doubt, but they could not both be carried on at the same time--or so, at least, this innocent
woman thought. There was enough to be anxious and alarmed about without taking two impossible
dangers into her mind together.

And just then Phil knocked at her door. He came in smiling and gracious, and with that look
of high breeding and savoir faire which had conciliated her before and which she felt the influence
of now, although she was aware how many drawbacks there were, and knew that the respect which
her son-in-law showed was far from genuine. "I never see you to have a chat," he said; "I thought
I would take the opportunity to-day, when Elinor was out. I want you to tell me how you think
she is."

"I think she is wonderfully well," said Mrs. Dennistoun.

"Wonderfully well--you mean considering--that there is too much racket in her life?"

"Partly, I mean that--but, indeed, I meant it without condition; she is wonderfully well. I
am surprised, often----"

"It is rather a racket of a life," said Phil.

"Too much, indeed--it is too much--for a woman who is beginning her serious life--but if you
think that, it is a great thing gained, for you can put a stop to it, or moderate--'the pace'
don't you call it?" she said, with a smile.

"Well, yes. I suppose we could moderate the pace--but that would mean a great deal for me.
You see, when a man's launched it isn't always so easy to stop. Nell, of course, if you thought
she wanted it--might go to the country with you."

Mrs. Dennistoun's heart gave a leap. "Might go to the country with you!" It seemed a glimpse
of Paradise that burst upon her. But then she shook her head. "You know Elinor would not leave
you, Philip."

"Well! she has a ridiculous partiality," he said, with a laugh, "though, of course, I'd make
her--if it was really for her advantage," he added, after a moment; "you don't think I'd let
that stand in her way."

"In the meantime," said Mrs. Dennistoun, with hesitation, "without proceeding to any such stringent
measures--if you could manage to be a little less late at night."

"Oh, you listen for my coming in at night?"

His face took a sombre look, as if a cloud had come over it.

"I do not listen--for happily for me I have been asleep for hours. I generally jump up thinking
the house is on fire at the sound of voices, which make listening quite unnecessary, Philip."

"Ah, yes, the fellows are rather noisy," he said, carelessly, "but Nell sleeps like a top,
and pays no attention--which is the best thing she can do."

"I would not be too sure she slept like a top."

"It's true; women are all hypocrites alike. You never know when you have them," Phil said.

And then there was a pause; for she feared to say anything more lest she should go too far;
and he for once in his life was embarrassed, and did not know how to begin what he had to say.

"Well," he said, quickly, getting up, "I must be going. I have business in the city. And now
that I find you're satisfied about Nell's health---- By the way, you never show in our rooms;
though Nell spends every minute she has to spare here."

"I am a little old perhaps for your friends, Philip, and the room is not too large."

"Well, no," he said, "they are wretched little rooms. Good-by, then; I'm glad you think Nell
is all right."

Was this all he meant to say? There was, however, an uncertainty about his step, and by the
time he had opened the door he came to a pause, half closed it again, and said, "Oh, by the bye!"

"What is it?" said Mrs. Dennistoun.

He closed the door again and came back half a step. "I almost forgot, I meant to tell you:
if you have any money to invest, I could help you to---- The best thing I've heard of for many
a day!"

"You are very kind, Philip; but you know everything I have is in the hands of trustees."

"Oh, bother trustees. The only thing they do is to keep your dividends down to the lowest amount
possible and cut short your income. Come, you're quite old enough to judge for yourself. You
might give them a jog. At your time of life they ought to take a hint from you."

"I have never done it, Philip, and they would pay no attention to me."

"Oh, nonsense, mamma. Why, except you, who has a right to be consulted except Nell? and if
I, her husband, am your adviser----"

"I know they would do nothing but mock at me."

"Rubbish! I'd like to see who would mock at you. Just you send them to me, that is all."

"Philip, will you not believe me when I say that it is impossible? I have never interfered.
They would ask what made me think of such a thing now."

"And you could tell them a jolly good opportunity, as safe as the bank, and paying six or seven
per cent.--none of your fabulous risky ten or twelve businesses, but a solid steady---- How
could it be to my interest to mislead you? It would be Nell who would be the loser. I should
be simply cutting off my own head."

"That is true, no doubt----"

"And," he said, scarcely waiting for her reply, "Nell is really the person who should be consulted:
for if there was loss eventually it would come upon her--and so upon me. I mean taking into
consideration all the chances of the future: for it is perfectly safe for your time, you may
be quite sure of that."

No one, though he might be ninety, likes to have his time limited, and his heir's prospects
dwelt upon as the only things of any importance, and Mrs. Dennistoun was a very long way from
ninety. She would have sacrificed everything she had to make her child happy, but she did not
like, all the same, to be set down as unimportant so far as her own property was concerned.

"I am afraid," she said, with a slight quaver in her voice, "that my trustees would not take
Elinor's wishes into consideration in the first place, nor yours either, Philip. They think
of me, and I suppose that is really their duty. If I had anything of my own----"

"Do you mean to say," he said, bluntly, "that with a good income and living in the country
in a hole, in the most obscure way, you have saved nothing all these years?"

"If I had," said Mrs. Dennistoun, roused by his persistent attack, "I should be very sorry
to fling it away."

"Oh, that is what you think?" he said. "Now we're at the bottom of it. You think that to put
it in my hands would be to throw it away! I thought there must be something at the bottom of
all this pretty ignorance of business and so forth. Good gracious! that may be well enough
for a girl; but when a grandmother pretends not to know, not to interfere, etc., that's too
much. So this is what you meant all the time! To put it into my hands would be throwing it away!"

"I did not mean to say so, Philip--I spoke hastily, but I must remind you that I am not accustomed
to this tone----"

"Oh, no, not at all accustomed to it, you all say that--that's Nell's dodge--never was used
to anything of the kind, never had a rough word said to her, and so forth and so forth."

"Philip--I hope you don't say rough words to my Elinor."

"Oh!" he said, "I have got you there, have I. Your Elinor--no more yours than she is--Johnson's.
She is my Nell, and what's more, she'll cling to me, whatever rough words I may say, or however
you may coax or wheedle. Do you ever think when you refuse to make a sacrifice of one scrap
of your hoards for her, that if I were not a husband in a hundred I might take it out of her
and make her pay?"

"For what?" said Mrs. Dennistoun, standing up and confronting him, her face pale, her head
very erect--"for what would you make her pay?"

He stood staring at her for a moment and then he broke out into a laugh. "We needn't face each
other as if we were going to have a stand-up fight," he said. "And it wouldn't be fair, mamma,
we're not equally matched, the knowing ones would all lay their money on you. So you won't
take my advice about investing your spare cash? Well, if you won't you won't, and there's an
end of it: only stand up fair and don't bother me with nonsense about trustees."

"It is no nonsense," she said.

His eyes flashed, but he controlled himself and turned away, waving his hand. "I'll not beat
Nell for it when I come home to-night," he said.

Once more Phil dined at his club that evening and Elinor with her mother. She was in an eager
and excited state, looking anxiously in Mrs. Dennistoun's eyes, but it was not till late in
the evening that she made any remark. At last, just before they parted for the night, she threw
herself upon her mother with a little cry--"Oh, mamma, I know you are right, I know you are
quite right. But if you could have done it, it would have given you an influence! I don't blame
you--not for a moment--but it might have given you an opening to speak. It might have--given
you a little hold on him."

"My darling, my darling!" said Mrs. Dennistoun.

"No," said Elinor, "there's nothing to pity me about, nothing at all--Phil is always kind and
good to me--but you would have had a standing ground. It might have given you a right to speak--about
those dreadful, dreadful city complications, mamma."

Mrs. Dennistoun went to bed that night a troubled woman, and lay awake watching and expecting
when the usual midnight tumult should arise. But that evening there was none. No sound but
the key in the latch, the shutting of a door or two, and all quiet. Compunctions filled the
mother's heart. What was the wrong if, perhaps, she could satisfy Elinor, perhaps get at the
heart of Phil, who had a heart, though it was getting strangled in all those intricacies of
gambling and wretched business. She turned over and over in her mind all that she had, and
all that she had any power over. And she remembered a small sum she had in a mortgage, which
was after all in her own power. No doubt it would be to throw the money away, which would be
so much gone from the future provision of Elinor--but if by that means she could acquire an
influence as Elinor said--be allowed to speak--to protest or perhaps even insist upon a change
of course? Thinking over such a question for a whole sleepless night, and feeling beneath all
that at least, at worst, this sacrifice would give pleasure to Elinor, which was really the
one and sole motive, the only thing that could give her any warrant for such a proceeding--is
not a process which is likely to strengthen the mind. In the morning, as soon as she knew he
was up, which was not till late enough, she sent to ask if Phil would give her five minutes
before he went out. He appeared after a while, extremely correct and point device, grave but
polite. "I must ask you to excuse me," he said, "if I am hurried, for to-day is one of my Board
days."

"It was only to say, Philip--you spoke to me yesterday of money--to be invested."

"Yes?" he said politely, without moving a muscle.

"I have been thinking it all over, and I remember that there is a thousand pounds or two which
John Tatham placed for me in a mortgage, and which is in my own power."

"Ah!" he said, "a thousand pounds or two," with a shrug of his shoulders; "it is scarcely worth
while, is it, changing an investment for so small a matter as a thousand pounds?"

"If you think so, Philip--it is all I can think of that is in my own power."

"It is really not worth the trouble," he said, "and I am in a hurry." He made a step towards
the door and then turned round again. "Well," he said, "just to show there is no ill-feeling,
I'll find you something, perhaps, to put your tuppenceha'penny in to-day."

And then there was John Tatham to face after that!

CHAPTER XXI.

It cost Mrs. Dennistoun a struggle to yield to her daughter and her daughter's husband, and
with her eyes open and no delusion on the subject to throw away her two thousand pounds. Two
thousand pounds is a big thing to throw away. There are many people much richer than Mrs. Dennistoun
who would have thought it a wicked thing to do, and some who would have quarrelled with both
daughter and son-in-law rather than do so foolish a thing. For it was not merely making a present,
so to speak, of the money, it was throwing it away. To have given it to Elinor would have been
nothing, it would have been a pleasure; but in Phil's investment Mrs. Dennistoun had no confidence.
It was throwing her money after Elinor's money into that hungry sea which swallows up everything
and gives nothing again.

But if that had been difficult for her, it may be imagined with what feelings she contemplated
her necessary meeting with John Tatham. She knew everything he would say--more, she knew what
he would look: his astonishment, his indignation, the amazement with which he would regard
it. John was far from being incapable of a sacrifice. Mrs. Dennistoun, indeed, did him more
than justice in that respect, for she believed that he had himself been on the eve of asking
Elinor to marry him when she was snatched up by, oh, so much less satisfactory a man! which
the reader knows is not quite the case, though perhaps it required quite as much self-denial
on John's part to stand by Elinor and maintain her cause under her altered circumstances as
if it had been the case. But notwithstanding this, she knew that John would be angry with what
she had done or promised to do, and would put every possible impediment in her way: and when
she sent for him, in order that she might carry out her promise, it was with a heart as sick
with fright and as much disturbed by the idea of a scolding as ever child's was.

John had been very little to the house at Curzon Street. He had dined two or three times with
Mrs. Dennistoun alone, and once or twice Elinor had been of the party; but the Comptons had
never any guests at that house, and the fact already mentioned that Philip Compton never dined
at home made it a difficult matter for Mrs. Dennistoun to ask any but her oldest friends to
the curious little divided house, which was neither hers nor theirs. Thus Cousin John had met,
but no more, Elinor's husband, and neither of the gentlemen had shown the least desire to cultivate
the acquaintance. John had not expressed his sentiments on the subject to any one, but Phil,
as was natural, had been more demonstrative. "I don't think much of your relations, Nell,"
he said, "if that's a specimen: a prig if ever there was one--and that old sheep that was at
the wedding, the father of him, I suppose----"

"As they are my relations, Phil, you might speak of them a little more respectfully."

"Oh, respectfully! Bless us all! I have no respect for my own, and why I should have for yours,
my little dear, I confess I can't see. Oh, by the way, this is Cousin John, who I used to think
by your blushing and all that----"

"Phil, I think you are trying to make me angry. Cousin John is the best man in the world; but
I never blushed--how ridiculous! I might as well have blushed to speak of my brother."

"I put no confidence in brothers, unless they're real ones," said Phil; "but I'm glad I've
seen him, Nell. I doubt after all that you're such a fool, when you see us together--eh?" He
laughed that laugh of conscious superiority which, when it is not perfectly well-founded, sounds
so fatuous to the hearer. Elinor did not look at him. She turned her head away and made no reply.

John, on his part, as has been said, made no remark. If he had possessed a wife at home to
whom he could have confided his sentiments, as Phil Compton had, it is possible that he might
have said something not unsimilar. But then had he had a wife at home he would have been more
indifferent to Phil, and might not have cared to criticise him at all.

Mrs. Dennistoun received him when he came in obedience to her call, as a child might do who
had the power of receiving its future corrector. She abased herself before him, servilely choosing
his favourite subjects, talking of what she thought would please him, of former times at the
Cottage, of Elinor, and her great affection for Cousin John, and so forth. I imagine that he
had a suspicion of the cause of all this sweetness. He looked at her suspiciously, though he
allowed himself to be drawn into reminiscences, and to feel a half pleasure, half pain in the
affectionate things that Elinor had said. At length, after some time had passed, he asked,
in a pause of the conversation, "Was this all you wanted with me, aunt, to talk of old times?"

"Wasn't it a good enough pretext for the pleasure of seeing you, John?"

He laughed a little and shook his head.

"An excellent pretext where none was wanted. It is very kind of you to think it a pleasure:
but you had something also to say?"

"It seems there is no deceiving you, John," she said, and with many hesitations and much difficulty,
told him her story. She saw him begin to flame. She saw his eyes light up, and Mrs. Dennistoun
shook in her chair. She was not a woman apt to be afraid, but she was frightened now.

Nevertheless, when she had finished her story, John at first spoke no word: and when he did
find a tongue it was only to say,

"You want to get back the money you have on that mortgage. My dear aunt, why did not you tell
me so at once?"

"But I have just told you, John."

"Well, so be it. You know it will take a little time; there are some formalities that must
be gone through. You cannot make a demand on people in that way to pay you cash at once."

"Oh, I thought it was so easy to get money--on such very good security and paying such a good
adequate rate of interest."

"It is easy," he said, "perfectly easy; but it wants a little time: and people will naturally
wonder, if it is really good security and good interest, why you should be in such a hurry
to get out of it."

"But surely, to say private reasons--family reasons, that will be enough."

"Oh, there is no occasion for giving any reason at all. You wish to do it; that is reason enough."

"Yes," said Mrs. Dennistoun, with diffidence, yet also a little self-assertion, "I think it
is enough."

"Of course, of course." But his eyes were flaming, and Mrs. Dennistoun would not allow herself
to believe that she had got off. "And may I ask--not that I have any right to ask, for of course
you have better advisers--what do you mean to put the money in, when you have got it back?"

"Oh, John," said Mrs. Dennistoun, "you are implacable, though you pretend different. You know
what I want with the money, and you disapprove of it, and so do I. I am going to throw it away.
I know that just as well as you do, and I am ashamed of myself: but I am going to do it all
the same."

"You are going to give it to Elinor? I don't think there is anything to disapprove of in that.
It is the most natural thing in the world."

"If I could be sure that Elinor would get any good by it," she said.

And then his face suddenly blazed up, so that the former flame in his eyes was nothing. He
sat for a moment staring at her, and then he said, "Yes, if--but I suppose you take the risk."
There were a great many things on his lips to say, but he said none of them, except hurriedly,
"You have a motive, I suppose----"

"I have a motive--as futile probably as my act--if I could by that means, or any other, acquire
an influence----"

John was very seldom, if ever, rude--it was not in his way--but at this moment he was so bitterly
exasperated that he forgot his manners altogether. He burst out into a loud laugh, and then
he jumped up to his feet and said, "Forgive me. I really have a dozen engagements. I can't
stay. I'll see to having this business done for you as soon as possible. You would rather old
Lynch had no hand in it? I'll get it done for you at once."

She followed him out to the door as if they had been in the country, and that the flowery cottage
door, with the great world of down and sky outside, instead of Curzon Street: longing to say
something that would still, at the last moment, gain her John's approval, or his understanding
at least. But she could think of nothing to say. He had promised to manage it all for her:
he had not reproached her; and yet not content with that she wanted to extort a favourable
word from him before he should go. But she could not find a word to say. He it was only who
spoke. He asked when she was going to return home, with his hand upon the street door.

"I don't know. I have not made any plans. The house is taken till July."

"And you have enjoyed it?" he said. "It has answered?"

What a cruel, cruel question to put to her! She going so unsuspectingly with him to the very
door! Philip Compton's servant, always about when he was not wanted, spying about to see whom
it was that "down-stairs" was letting out, came strolling into sight. Anyhow, whether that
was the reason or not, she made him no reply. He caught her look--a look that said more than
words--and turned round quickly and held out his hand. "I did not mean to be cruel," he said.

"Oh, no, no, no--you did not mean it--you were not cruel. The reverse--you are always so kind.
Yes, it has answered--I am more glad than I can tell you--that I came."

He it was now that looked at her anxiously, while she smiled that well-worn smile which is
kept for people in trouble. She went in afterwards and sat silent for some time, covering her
face with her hands; in which attitude Elinor found her after her afternoon visitors had gone away.

"What is it, mother? What is it, dear mother? Something has happened to vex you."

"Nothing, nothing, Elinor. John Tatham has been here. He is going to do that little piece of
business for me."

"And he--has been bullying you too? poor mamma!"

"On the contrary, he did not say a word. He considered it--quite natural."

Elinor gave her mother a kiss. She had nothing to say. Neither of them had a word to say to
the other. The thought that passed through both their minds was: "After all it is only two
thousand pounds"--and then, après? was Elinor's thought. And then, never more, never more!
was what passed through Mrs. Dennistoun's mind.

Phil Compton smiled upon her that day she handed him over the money. "It is a great pity you
took the trouble," he said. "It is a pity to change an investment for such a bagatelle as two
thousand pounds. Still, if you insist upon it, mamma. I suppose Nell's been bragging of the
big interest, but you never will feel it on a scrap like this. If you would let me double your
income for you now."

"You know, Philip, I cannot. The trustees would never consent."

"Bother trustees. They are the ruin of women," he said, and as he left the room he turned back
to ask her how long she was going to stay in town.

"How long do you stay?"

"Oh, till Goodwood always," said Phil. "Nell's looking forward to it, and there's generally
some good things just at the end when the heavy people have gone away; but I thought you might
not care to stay so long."

"I came not for town, but for Elinor, Philip."

"Exactly so. But don't you think Elinor has shown herself quite able to take care of herself--not
to say that she has me? It's a thousand pities to keep you from the country which you prefer,
especially as, after all, Nell can be so little with you."

"It would be much better for her at present, Philip, to come with me, and rest at home, while
you go to Goodwood. For the sake of the future you ought to persuade her to do it."

"I daresay. Try yourself to persuade her to leave me. She won't, you know. But why should you
bore yourself to death staying on here? You don't like it, and nobody----"

"Wants me, you mean, Philip."

"I never said anything so dashed straightforward. I am not a chap of that kind. But what I
say is, it's a shame to keep you hanging on, disturbed in your rest and all that sort of thing.
That noisy beggar, Dismar, that came in with us last night must have woke you up with his idiotic
bellowing."

"It doesn't matter for me; but Elinor, Philip. It does matter for your wife. If her rest is
broken it will react upon her in every way. I wish you would consent to forego those visitors
in the middle of the night."

He looked at her with a sort of satirical indifference. "Sorry I can't oblige you," he said.
"When a girl's friends fork out handsomely a man has some reason for paying a little attention.
But when there's nothing, or next to nothing, on her side, why of course he must pick up a
little where he can, as much for her sake as his own."

"Pick up a little!" said Mrs. Dennistoun.

"I wish you wouldn't repeat what I say like that. It makes a fellow nervous. Yes, of course,
a man that knows what he's about does pick up a little. About your movements, however. I advise
you to take my advice and go back to your snug little house. It would kill me in a week, but
I know it suits you. Why hang on for Nell? She's as well as can be, and there's a few things
that it would be good for us to do."

"Which you cannot do while I am here? Is that what you mean, Philip?"

"I never saw any good in being what the French call brutal," he said, "I hate making a woman
cry, or that sort of thing. But you're a woman of sense, and I'm sure you must see that a young
couple like Nell and me, who have our way to make in the world----"

"You know it was for her sake entirely that I came here."

"Yes, oh, yes. To do coddling and that sort of thing--which she doesn't require a bit; but
if I must be brutal you know there's things of much consequence we could do if----"

"If what, Philip?"

"Well," he said, turning on his heel, "if we had the house to ourselves."

This was the influence Mrs. Dennistoun hoped to acquire by the sacrifice of her two thousand
pounds! When he was gone, instead of covering her face as she had done when John left her,
Mrs. Dennistoun stared into the vacant air for a minute and then she burst into a laugh. It
was not a mirthful laugh, it may be supposed, or harmonious, and it startled her as she heard
it pealing into the silence. Whether it was loud enough to wake Elinor up-stairs, or whether
she was already close by and heard it, I cannot tell, but she came in with a little tap at
the door and a smile, a somewhat anxious and forced smile, it is true, upon her face.

"What is the joke?" she said. "I heard you laugh, and I thought I might come in and share the
fun. Somehow, we don't have so much fun as we used to have. What is it, mamma?"

"It is only a witticism of Philip's, who has been in to see me," said Mrs. Dennistoun. "I won't
repeat it, for probably I should lose the point of it--you know I always did spoil a joke in
repeating it. I have been speaking to him," she said, after a little pause, during which both
her laugh and Elinor's smile evaporated in the most curious way, leaving both of them very
grave--"of going away, Elinor."

"Of going away!" Elinor suddenly assumed a startled look; but there is a difference between
doing that and being really startled, which her mother, alas! was quite enlightened enough
to see; and surely once more there was that mingled relief and relaxation in the lines of her
face which Mrs. Dennistoun had seen before.

"Yes, my darling," she said, "it is June, and everything at the Cottage will be in full beauty.
And, perhaps, it would do you more good to come down there for a day or two when there is nothing
doing than to have me here, which, after all, has not been of very much use to you."

"Oh, don't say that, mamma. Use!--it has been of comfort unspeakable. But," Elinor added, hurriedly,
"I see the force of all you say. To remain in London at this time of the year must be a far
greater sacrifice than I have any right to ask of you, mamma."

Oh, the furtive, hurried, unreal words! which were such pain and horror to say with the consciousness
of the true sentiment lying underneath; which made Elinor's heart sink, yet were brought forth
with a sort of hateful fervour, to imitate truth.

Mrs. Dennistoun saw it all. There are times when the understanding of such a woman is almost
equal to those "larger other eyes" with which it is our fond hope those who have left us for
a better country see, if they are permitted to see, our petty doings, knowing, better than
we know ourselves, what excuses, what explanations, they are capable of. "As for the sacrifice,"
she said, "we will say nothing of that, Elinor. It is a vain thing to say that if my life would
do you any pleasure--for you don't want to take my life, and probably the best thing I can
do for you is to go on as long as I can. But in the meantime there's no question at all of
sacrifice--and if you can come down now and then for a day, and sleep in the fresh air----"

"I will, I will, mamma," said Elinor, hiding her face on her mother's shoulder; and they would
have been something more than women if they had not cried together as they held each other
in that embrace--in which there was so much more than met either eye or ear.

CHAPTER XXII.

It was about the 10th of June when Mrs. Dennistoun left London. She had been in town for about
five weeks, which looked like as many months, and it was with a mingled sense of relief, and
of that feeling which is like death in the heart, the sense of nothing further to be done,
of the end of opportunity, the conclusion of all power to help, which sometimes comes over
an anxious mind, without in any respect diminishing the anxiety, giving it indeed a depth and
pang beyond any other feeling that is known to the heart of man. What could she do more for
her child? Nothing. It was her only policy to remain away, not to see, certainly not to remark
anything that was happening, to wait if perhaps the moment might come when she would be of
use, and to hope that perhaps that moment might never need to come, that by some wonderful
turn of affairs all might yet go well. She went back to Windyhill with the promise of a visit
"soon," Philip himself had said--in the pleasure of getting the house, which was her house,
which she had paid for and provisioned, to himself for his own uses. Mrs. Dennistoun could
not help hearing through her maid something of the festivities which were in prospect after
she was gone, the dinners and gay receptions at which she would have been de trop. She did
not wish to hear of them, but these are things that will make themselves known, and Mrs. Dennistoun
had to face the fact that Elinor was more or less consenting to the certainty of her mother
being de trop, which gave her a momentary pang. But after all, what did it matter? It was not
her fault, poor child. I have known a loving daughter in whose mind there was a sentiment almost
of relief amid her deep grief when her tender mother died. Could such a thing be possible?
It was; because after then, however miserable she might be, there was no conflict over her,
no rending of the strained heart both ways. A woman who has known life learns to understand
and forgive a great many things; and Mrs. Dennistoun forgave her Elinor, her only child, for
whose happiness she had lived, in that she was almost glad when her mother went away.

Such things, however, do not make a lonely little house in the country more cheerful, or tend
to make it easier to content one's self with the Rector's family, and the good old, simple-minded,
retired people, with their little complaints, yet general peacefulness, and incompetence to
understand what tragedy was. They thought on the whole their neighbour at the Cottage ought
to be very thankful that she had got her daughter well, or, if not very well, at least fashionably,
married, with good connections and all that, which are always of use in the long run. It was
better than marrying a poor curate, which was almost the only chance a girl had on Windyhill.

It was a little hard upon Mrs. Dennistoun, however, that she lost not only Elinor, but John,
who had been so good about coming down when she was all alone at first. Of course, during the
season, a young rising man, with engagements growing upon him every day, was very unlikely
to have his Saturdays to Mondays free. So many people live out of town nowadays, or, at least,
have a little house somewhere to which they go from Saturday to Monday, taking their friends
with them. This was no doubt the reason why John never came; and yet the poor lady suspected
another reason, and though she no longer laughed as she had done on that occasion when the
Honourable Phil gave her her dismissal, a smile would come over her face sometimes when she
reflected that with her two thousand pounds she had purchased the hostility of both Philip
and John.

John Tatham was indeed exceedingly angry with her for the weakness with which she had yielded
to Phil Compton's arguments, though indeed he knew nothing of Phil Compton's arguments, nor
whether they had been exercised at all on the woman who was first of all Elinor's mother and
ready to sacrifice everything to her comfort. When he found that this foolish step on her part
had been followed by her retirement from London, he was greatly mystified and quite unable
to understand. He met Elinor some time after at one of those assemblies to which "everybody"
goes. It was, I think, the soirée at the Royal Academy--where amid the persistent crowd in
the great room there was a whirling crowd, twisting in and out among the others, bound for
heaven knows how many other places, and pausing here and there on tiptoe to greet an acquaintance,
at the tail of which, carried along by its impetus, was Elinor. She was not looking either
well or happy, but she was responding more or less to the impulse of her set, exchanging greetings
and banal words with dozens of people, and sometimes turning a wistful and weary gaze towards
the pictures on the walls, as if she would gladly escape from the mob of her companions to
them, or anywhere. It was no impulse of taste or artistic feeling, however, it is to be feared,
but solely the weariness of her mind. John watched her for some time before he approached her.
Phil was not of the party, which was nothing extraordinary, for little serious as that assembly
is, it was still of much too serious a kind for Phil; but Lady Mariamne was there, and other
ladies with whom Elinor was in the habit of pursuing that gregarious hunt after pleasure which
carries the train of votaries along at so breakneck a pace, and with so little time to enjoy
the pleasure they are pursuing. When he saw indications that the stream was setting backwards
to the entrance, again to separate and take its various ways to other entertainments, he broke
into the throng and called Elinor's attention to himself. For a moment she smiled with genuine
pleasure at the sight of him, but then changed her aspect almost imperceptibly. "Oh, John!"
she said with that smile: but immediately looked towards Lady Mariamne, as if undecided what to do.

"You need not look--as if I would try to detain you, Elinor."

"Do you think I am afraid of your detaining me? I thought I should be sure to meet you to-night,
and was on the outlook. How is it that we never see you now?"

He refused the natural retort that she had never asked to see him, and only said, with a smile,
"I hear my aunt is gone."

"Do you mean to say that you only came for her? That is an unkind speech. Yes, she has gone.
It was cruel to keep her in town for the best part of the year."

"But she intended to stay till July, Elinor."

"Did she? I think you are mistaken, John. She intended to watch over me--dear mamma, she thinks
too much of me--but when she saw that I was quite well----"

"You don't look to me so extraordinarily well."

"Don't I? I must be a fraud then. Nobody could be stronger. I'm going to a multitude of places
to-night. Wherever my Hebrew leader goes I go," said Elinor, with a laugh. "I have given myself
up for to-night, and she is never satisfied with less than a dozen."

"Ten minutes to each."

"Oh, half an hour at least: and with having our carriage found for us at every place, and the
risk of getting into a queue, and all the delays of coming and going, it cannot be much less
than three-quarters of an hour. This is the third. I think three more will weary even the Jew."

"You are with Lady Mariamne then, Elinor?"

"Yes--oh, you need not make that face. She is as good as the rest, and pretends to nothing,
at least. I have no carriage, you know, and Phil took fright at my dear old fly. He thought
a hired brougham was not good when I was alone."

"That was quite true. Nevertheless, I should like above all things to keep you here a little
longer to look at some of the pictures, and take you home in a hansom after."

She laughed. "Oh, so should I--fancy, I have not seen the pictures, not at all. We came in
a mob to the private view; and then one day I was coming with mamma, but was stopped by something,
and now---- Always people, people--nothing else. 'Did you see So-and-so? There's some one bowing
to you, Nell. Be sure you speak a word to the Thises or the Thats'--while I don't care for
one of them. But I fear the hansom would not do, John."

"It would have done very well in the old days. Your mother would not have been displeased."

"The old days are gone and will never return," she said, half sad, half smiling, shaking her
head. "So far as I can see, nothing ever returns. You have your day, and if you do not make
the best of that----"

She stopped, shaking her head again with a laugh, and there were various ways in which that
speech might be interpreted. John for one knew a sense of it which he believed had never entered
Elinor's head. He too might have had his day and let it slip. "So you are making the most of
yours," he said. "I hear that you are very gay."

Elinor coloured high under his look. "I don't know who can have told you that. We have had
a few little dinners since mamma left us, chiefly Phil's business friends. I would not have
them while she was with us--that is to say, to be honest," cried Elinor, "while we were with
her: which of course was the real state of the case. I myself don't like those people, John,
but they would have been insupportable to mamma. It was for her sake----"

"I understand," he said.

"Oh, but you must not say 'I understand' with that air of knowing a great deal more than there
is to understand," she said, with heat. "Mamma said it would do me much more good to go--home
for a night now and then and sleep in the fresh air than for her to stay; and though I think
she is a little insane on the subject of my health, still it was certainly better than that
she should stay here, making herself wretched, her rest broken, and all that. You know we keep
such late hours."

"I should not have thought she would have minded that."

"But what would you have thought of me if I did not mind it for her? There, John, do you see
they are all going? Ah, the pictures! I wish I could have stayed with you and gone round the
rooms. But it must not be to-night. Come and see me!" she said, turning round to him with a
smile, and holding out her hand.

"I would gladly, Elinor--but should not I find myself in the way of your fine friends like----"

He had not the heart to finish the sentence when he met her eyes brimming full of tears.

"Not my fine friends, but my coarse friends," she said; "not friends at all, our worst enemies,
I am sure."

"Nell!" cried Lady Mariamne, in her shrill voice.

"You will come and see me, John?"

"Yes," he said, "and in the meantime I will take you down-stairs, let your companions think
as they please."

It proved when he did so that John had to escort both ladies to the carriage, which it was
not very easy to find, no other cavalier being at hand for the moment; and that Lady Mariamne
invited him to accompany them to their next stage. "You know the Durfords, of course. You are
going there? What luck for us, Nell! Jump in, Mr. Tatham, we will take you on."

"Unfortunately Lady Durford has not taken the trouble to invite me," said John.

"What does that matter? Jump in, all the same, she'll be delighted to see you, and as for not
asking you, when you are with me and Nell----"

But John turned a deaf ear to this siren's song.

He went to Curzon Street a little while after to call, as he had been invited to do, and went
late to avoid the bustle of the tea-table, and the usual rabble of that no longer intimate
but wildly gregarious house. And he was not without his reward. Perhaps a habit he had lately
formed of passing by Curzon Street in the late afternoon, when he was on his way to his club,
after work was over, had something to do with his choice of this hour. He found Elinor, as
he had hoped, alone. She was sitting so close to the window that her white dress mingled with
the white curtains, so that he did not at first perceive her, and so much abstracted in her
own thoughts that she did not pay any attention to the servant's hurried murmur of his name
at the door. When she felt rather than saw that there was some one in the room, Elinor jumped
up with a shock of alarm that seemed unnecessary in her own drawing-room; then seeing who it
was, was so much and so suddenly moved that she shed a few tears in some sudden revulsion of
feeling as she said, "Oh, it is you, John!"

"Yes," he said, "but I am very sorry to see you so nervous."

"Oh, it's nothing. I was always nervous"--which indeed was the purest invention, for Elinor
Dennistoun had not known what nerves meant. "I mean I was always startled by any sudden entrance--in
this way," she cried, and very gravely asked him to be seated, with a curious assumption of
dignity. Her demeanour altogether was incomprehensible to John.

"I hope," he said, "you were not displeased with me, Elinor, for going off the other night.
I should have been too happy, you know, to go with you anywhere; but Lady Mariamne is more
than I can stand."

"I was very glad you did not come," she said with a sigh; then smiling faintly, "But you were
ungrateful, for Mariamne formed a most favourable opinion of you. She said, 'Why didn't you
tell me, Nell, you had a cousin so presentable as that?'"

"I am deeply obliged, Elinor; but it seems that what was a compliment to me personally involved
something the reverse for your other relations."

"It is one of their jokes," said Elinor, with a voice that faltered a little, "to represent
my relations as--not in a complimentary way. I am supposed not to mind, and it's all a joke,
or so they tell me; but it is not a joke I like," she said, with a flash from her eyes.

"All families have jokes of that description," said John; "but tell me, Nelly, are you really
going down to the cottage, to your mother?"

Her eyes thanked him with a gleam of pleasure for the old familiar name, and then the light
went out of them. "I don't know," she said, abruptly. "Phil was to come; if he will not, I
think I will not either. But I will say nothing till I make sure."

"Of course your first duty is to him," said John; "but a day now or a day then interferes with
nothing, and the country would be good for you, Elinor. Doesn't your husband see it? You are
not looking like yourself."

"Not like myself? I might easily look better than myself. I wish I could. I am not so bigoted
about myself."

"Your friends are, however," he said: "no one who cares for you wants to change you, even for
another Elinor. Come, you are nervous altogether to-night, not like yourself, as I told you.
You always so courageous and bright! This depressed state is not one of your moods. London
is too much for you, my little Nelly."

"Your little Nellie has gone away somewhere John. I doubt if she'll ever come back. Yes, London
is rather too much for me, I think. It's such a racket, as Phil says. But then he's used to
it, you know. He was brought up to it, whereas I--I think I hate a racket, John--and they all
like it so. They prefer never having a moment to themselves. I daresay one would end by being
just the same. It keeps you from thinking, that is one very good thing."

"You used not to think so, Elinor."

"No," she said, "not at the Cottage among the flowers, where nothing ever happened from one
year's end to another. I should die of it now in a week--at least if not I, those who belong
to me. So on the whole perhaps London is the safest--unless Phil will go."

"I can only hope you will be able to persuade him," said John, rising to go away, "for whatever
you may think, you are a country bird, and you want the fresh air."

"Are you going, John? Well, perhaps it is better. Good-by. Don't trouble your mind about me
whether I go or stay."

"Do you mean I am not to come again, Elinor?"

"Oh, why should I mean that?" she said. "You are so hard upon me in your thoughts;" but she
did not say that he was wrong, and John went out from the door saying to himself that he would
not go again. He saw through the open door of the dining-room that the table was prepared sumptuously
for a dinner-party. It was shining with silver and crystal, the silver Mrs. Dennistoun's old
service, which she had brought up with her from Windyhill, and which as a matter of convenience
she had left behind with her daughter. Would it ever, he wondered, see Windyhill again?

He went on to his club, and there some one began to amuse him with an account of Lady Durford's
ball, to which Lady Mariamne had wished to take him. "Are not those Comptons relations of yours,
Tatham?" he said.

"Connections," said John, "by marriage."

"I'm very glad that's all. They are a queer lot. Phil Compton you know--the dis-Honourable
Phil, as he used to be called--but I hear he's turned over a new leaf----"

"What of him?" said John.

"Oh, nothing much: only that he was flirting desperately all the evening with a Mrs. Harris,
an American widow. I believe he came with her--and his own wife there--much younger, much prettier,
a beautiful young creature--looking on with astonishment. You could see her eyes growing bigger
and bigger. If it had not been kind of amusing to a looker-on, it would be the most pitiful
sight in the world."

"I advise you not to let yourself be amused by such trifles," said John Tatham, with a look
of fire and flame.

CHAPTER XXIII.

As a matter of fact, Elinor did not go to the Cottage for the fresh air or anything else. She
made one hurried run in the afternoon to bid her mother good-by, alone, which was not a visit,
but the mere pretence of a visit, hurried and breathless, in which there was no time to talk
of anything. She gave Mrs. Dennistoun an account of the usual lists of visits that her husband
and she were to make in the autumn, which the mother, with the usual instinct of mothers, thought
too much. "You will wear yourself to death, Elinor."

"Oh, no," she said, "it is not that sort of thing that wears one to death. I shall--enjoy it,
I suppose, as other people do----"

"I don't know about enjoyment, Elinor, but I am sure it would be much better for you to come
and stay here quietly with me."

"Oh, don't talk to me of any paradises, mamma. We are in the working-day world, and we must
make out our life as we can."

"But you might let Philip go by himself and come and stay quietly here for a little, for the
sake of your health, Elinor."

"Not for the world, not for the world," she cried. "I cannot leave Phil:" and then with a laugh
that was full of a nervous thrill, "You are always thinking of my health, mamma, when my health
is perfect: better, far better, than almost anybody's. The most of them have headaches and
that sort of thing, and they stay in bed for a day or two constantly, but I never need anything
of the kind."

"My darling, it would not be leaving Philip to take, say, a single week's rest."

"While he went off without me I should not know where," she said, sullenly; then gave her mother
a guilty look and laughed again. "No, no, mamma; he would not like it. A man does not like
his wife to be an incapable, to have to leave him and be nursed up by her mother. Besides,
it is to the country we are going, you know, to Scotland, the finest air; better even, if that
were possible, than Windyhill."

This was all that was said, and there was indeed time for little more; for as the visit was
unexpected the Hudsons, by bad luck, appeared to take tea with Mrs. Dennistoun by way of cheering
her in her loneliness, and were of course enchanted to see Elinor, and to hear, as Mrs. Hudson
said, of all her doings in the great world. "We always look out for your name at all the parties.
It gives one quite an interest in fashionable life," said the Rector's wife, nodding her head,
"and Alice was eager to hear what the last month's novelties were in the fashions, and if Elinor
had any nice new patterns, especially for under-things. But what should you want with new under-things,
with such a trousseau as you had?" she added, regretfully. Elinor in fact was quite taken from
her mother for that hour. Was it not, perhaps, better so? Her mother herself was half inclined
to think that it was, though with an ache in her heart, and there could be no doubt that Elinor
herself was thankful that it so happened. When there are many questions on one side that must
be asked, and very little answer possible on the other, is it a good thing when the foolish
outside world breaks in with its banal interest and prevents this dangerous interchange?

So short time did Elinor stay that she had kept the fly waiting which brought her from the
station: and she took leave of her mother with a sort of determination, not allowing it even
to be suggested that she should accompany her. "I like to bid you good-by here," she said,
"at our own door, where you have always come all my life to see me off, even when I was only
going to tea at the Rectory. Good-by, good-by, mother dear." She drove off waving her hand,
and Mrs. Dennistoun sat out in the garden a long time till she saw the fly go round the turn
of the road, the white line which came suddenly in sight from among the trees and as suddenly
disappeared again round the side of the hill. Elinor waved her handkerchief from the window
and her mother answered--and then she was gone like a dream, and the loneliness closed down
more overwhelming than ever before.

Elinor was at Goodwood, her name in all the society papers, and even a description of one of
her dresses, which delighted and made proud the whole population of Windyhill. The paper which
contained it, and which, I believe, belonged originally to Miss Dale, passed from hand to hand
through almost the entire community; the servants getting it at last, and handing it round
among the humbler friends, who read it, half a dozen women together round a cottage door, wiping
their hands upon their aprons before they would touch the paper, with many an exclamation and
admiring outcry. And then her name appeared among the lists of smart people who were going
to the North--now here, now there--in company with many other fine names. It gave the Windyhill
people a great deal of amusement, and if Mrs. Dennistoun did not quite share this feeling it
was a thing for which her friends blamed her gently. "For only think what a fine thing for
Elinor to go everywhere among the best people, and see life like that!" "My dear friend," said
the Rector, "you know we cannot hope to keep our children always with us. They must go out
into the world while we old birds stay at home; and we must not--we really must not--grudge
them their good times, as the Americans say." It was more wonderful than words could tell to
Mrs. Dennistoun that it should be imagined she was grudging Elinor her "good time!"

The autumn went on, with those occasional public means of following her footsteps which, indeed,
made even John Tatham--who was not in an ordinary way addicted to the Morning Post, being after
his fashion a Liberal in politics and far from aristocratical in his sentiments generally--study
that paper, and also other papers less worthy: and with, of course, many letters from Elinor,
which gave more trustworthy accounts of her proceedings. These letters, however, were far less
long, far less detailed, than they had once been; often written in a hurry, and short, containing
notes of where she was going, and of a continual change of address, rather than of anything
that could be called information about herself. John, I think, went only once to the Cottage
during the interval which followed. He went abroad as usual in the Long Vacation, and then
he had this on his mind--that he had half-surreptitiously obtained a new light upon the position
of Elinor, which he had every desire to keep from her mother; for Mrs. Dennistoun, though she
felt that her child was not happy, attributed that to any reason rather than a failure in her
husband's love. Elinor's hot rejection of the very idea of leaving Phil, her dislike of any
suggestion to that effect, even for a week, even for a day, seemed to her mother a proof that
her husband, at all events, remained as dear to her as ever; and John would rather have cut
his tongue out than betray any chance rumour he heard--and he heard many--to this effect. He
was of opinion, indeed, that in London, and especially at a London club, not only is everything
known that is to be known, but much is known that has never existed, and never will exist if
not blown into being by those whose office it is to invent the grief to come; therefore he
thought it wisest to keep away, lest by any chance something might drop from him which would
awaken a new crowd of disquietudes in Mrs. Dennistoun's heart. Another incident, even more
disquieting than gossip, had indeed occurred to John. It had happened to him to meet Lady Mariamne
at a great omnium gatherum of a country house, where all sorts of people were invited, and
where that lady claimed his acquaintance as one of the least alarming of the grave "set." She
not only claimed his acquaintance, but set up a sort of friendship on the ground of his relationship
to Elinor, and in an unoccupied moment after dinner one day poured a great many confidences
into his ear.

"Isn't it such a pity," she said, "that Phil and she do not get on? Oh, they did at first,
like a house on fire! And if she had only minded her ways they might still have been as thick----
But these little country girls, however they may disguise it at first, they all turn like that.
The horridest little puritan! Phil does no more than a hundred men--than almost all men do:
amuse himself with anything that throws itself in his way, don't you know. And sometimes, perhaps,
he does go rather far. I think myself he sometimes goes a little too far--for good taste you
know, and that sort of thing."

It was more amazing to hear Lady Mariamne talk of good taste than anything that had ever come
in John Tatham's way before, but he was too horribly, desperately interested to see the fun.

"She will go following him about wherever he goes. She oughtn't to do that, don't you know.
She should let him take his swing, and the chances are it will bring him back all right. I've
told her so a dozen times, but she pays no attention to me. You're a great pal of hers. Why
don't you give her a hint? Phil's not the sort of man to be kept in order like that. She ought
to give him his head."

"I'm afraid," said John, "it's not a matter in which I can interfere."

"Well, some of her friends should, anyhow, and teach her a little sense. You're a cautious
man, I see," said Lady Mariamne. "You think it's too delicate to advise a woman who thinks
herself an injured wife. I didn't say to console her, mind you," she said with a shriek of a laugh.

It may be supposed that after this John was still more unwilling to go to the Cottage, to run
the risk of betraying himself. He did write to Elinor, telling her that he had heard of her
from her sister-in-law; but when he tried to take Lady Mariamne's advice and "give her a hint,"
John felt his lips sealed. How could he breathe a word even of such a suspicion to Elinor?
How could he let her know that he thought such a thing possible?--or presume to advise her,
to take her condition for granted? It was impossible. He ended by some aimless wish that he
might meet her at the Cottage for Christmas; "you and Mr. Compton," he said--whom he did not
wish to meet, the last person in the world: and of whom there was no question that he should
go to the Cottage at Christmas or any other time. But what could John do or say? To suggest
to her that he thought her an injured wife was beyond his power.

It was somewhere about Christmas--just before--in that dread moment for the lonely and those
who are in sorrow and distress, when all the rest of the world is preparing for that family
festival, or pretending to prepare, that John Tatham was told one morning in his chambers that
a lady wanted to see him. He was occupied, as it happened, with a client for whom he had stayed
in town longer than he had intended to stay, and he paid little more attention than to direct
his clerk to ask the lady what her business was, or if she could wait. The client was long-winded,
and lingered, but John's mind was not free enough nor his imagination lively enough to rouse
much curiosity in him in respect to the lady who was waiting. It was only when she was ushered
in by his clerk, as the other went away, and putting up her veil showed the pale and anxious
countenance of Mrs. Dennistoun, that the shock as of sudden calamity reached him. "Aunt!" he
cried, springing from his chair.

"Yes, John--I couldn't come anywhere but here--you will feel for me more than any one."

"Elinor?" he said.

Her lips were dry, she spoke with a little difficulty, but she nodded her head and held out
to him a telegram which was in her hand. It was dated from a remote part of Scotland, far in
the north. "Ill--come instantly," was all it said.

"And I cannot get away till night," cried Mrs. Dennistoun, with a burst of subdued sobbing.
"I can't start till night."

"Is this all? What was your last news?"

"Nothing, but that they had gone there--to somebody's shooting-box, which was lent them, I
believe--at the end of the world. I wrote to beg her to come to me. She is--near a moment--of
great anxiety. Oh, John, support me: let me not break down."

"You will not," he said; "you are wanted; you must keep all your wits about you. What were
they doing there at this time of the year?"

"They have been visiting about--they were invited to Dunorban for Christmas, but she persuaded
Philip, so she said, to take this little house. I think he was to join the party while she--I
cannot tell you what was the arrangement. She has written very vaguely for some time. She ought
to have been with me--I told her so--but she has always said she could not leave Philip."

Could not leave Philip! The mother, fortunately, had no idea why this determination was. "I
went so far as to write to Philip," she said, "to ask him if she might not come to me, or,
at least begging him to bring her to town, or somewhere where she could have proper attention.
He answered me very briefly that he wished her to go, but she would not: as he had told me
before I left town--that was all. It seemed to fret him--he must have known that it was not
a fit place for her, in a stranger's house, and so far away. And to think I cannot even get
away till late to-night!"

John had to comfort her as well as he could, to make her eat something, to see that she had
all the comforts possible for her night journey. "You were always like her brother," the poor
lady said, finding at last relief in tears. And then he went with her to the train, and found
her a comfortable carriage, and placed her in it with all the solaces his mind could think
of. A sleeping-carriage on the Scotch lines is not such a ghastly pretence of comfort as those
on the Continent. The solaces John brought her--the quantities of newspapers, the picture papers
and others, rugs and shawls innumerable--all that he possessed in the shape of wraps, besides
those which she had with her. What more could a man do? If she had been young he would have
bought her sugar-plums. All that they meant were the dumb anxieties of his own breast, and
the vague longing to do something, anything that would be a help to her on her desolate way.

"You will send me a word, aunt, as soon as you get there?"

"Oh, at once, John."

"You will tell me how she is--say as much as you can--no three words, like that. I shall not
leave town till I hear."

"Oh, John, why should this keep you from your family? I could telegraph there as easily as here."

He made a gesture almost of anger. "Do you think I am likely to put myself out of the way--not
to be ready if you should want me?"

How should she want him?--a mother summoned to her daughter at such a moment--but she did not
say so to trouble him more: for John had got to that maddening point of anxiety when nothing
but doing something, or at least keeping ready to do something, flattering yourself that there
must be something to do, affords any balm to the soul.

He saw her away by that night train, crowded with people going home--people noisy with gayety,
escaping from their daily cares to the family meeting, the father's house, all the associations
of pleasure and warmth and consolation--cold, but happy, in their third-class compartments--not
wrapped up in every conceivable solace as she was, yet no one, perhaps, so heavy-hearted. He
watched for the last glimpse of her face just as the train plunged into the darkness, and saw
her smile and wave her hand to him; then he, too, plunged into the darkness like the train.
He walked and walked through the solitary streets not knowing where he was going, unable to
rest. Had he ever been, as people say, in love with Elinor? He could not tell--he had never
betrayed it by word or look if he had. He had never taken any step to draw her near him, to
persuade her to be his and not another's; on the contrary, he had avoided everything that could
lead to that. Neither could he say, "She was as my sister," which his relationship might have
warranted him in doing. It was neither the one nor the other--she was not his love nor his
sister--she was simply Elinor; and perhaps she was dying; perhaps the news he would receive
next day would be the worst that the heart can hear. He walked and walked through those dreary,
semi-respectable streets of London, the quiet, the sordid, the dismal, mile after mile, and
street after street, till half the night was over and he was tired out, and might have a hope
of rest.

But for three whole days--days which he could not reckon, which seemed of the length of years--during
which he remained closeted in his chambers, the whole world having, as it seemed, melted away
around him, leaving him alone, he did not have a word. He did not go home, feeling that he
must be on the spot, whatever happened. Finally, when he was almost mad, on the morning of
the third day, he received the following telegram: "Saved--as by a miracle; doing well. Child--a
boy."

"Child--a boy!" Good heavens! what did he want with that? it seemed an insult to him to tell
him. What did he care for the child, if it was a boy or not?--the wretched, undesirable brat
of such parentage, born to perpetuate a name which was dishonoured. Altogether the telegram,
as so many telegrams, but lighted fresh fires of anxiety in his mind. "Saved--as by a miracle!"
Then he had been right in the dreadful fancies that had gone through his mind. He had passed
by Death in the dark; and was it now sure that the miracle would last, that the danger would
have passed away?

CHAPTER XXIV.

It was not till nearly three weeks after this that John received another brief dispatch. "At
home: come and see us." He had indeed got a short letter or two in the interval, saying almost
nothing--a brief report of Elinor's health, and of the baby, against whom he had taken an unreasoning
disgust and repugnance. "Little beast!" he said to himself, passing over that part of the bulletin:
for the letters were scarcely more than bulletins, without a word about the circumstances which
surrounded her. A shooting lodge in Ross-shire in the middle of the winter! What a place for
a delicate woman! John was well enough aware that many elements of comfort were possible even
in such a place; but he shut his eyes, as was natural, to anything that went against his own
point of view.

And now this telegram from Windyhill--"At home: come and see us"--us. Was it a mistake of the
telegraph people?--of course they must make mistakes. They had no doubt taken the me in Mrs.
Dennistoun's angular writing for us--or was it possible---- John had no peace in his mind until
he had so managed matters that he could go and see. There was no very pressing business in
the middle of January, when people had hardly yet recovered the idleness of Christmas. He started
one windy afternoon, when everything was grey, and arrived at Hurrymere station in the dim
twilight, still ruddy with tints of sunset. He was in a very contradictory frame of mind, so
that though his heart jumped to see Mrs. Dennistoun awaiting him on the platform, there mingled
in his satisfaction in seeing her and hearing what she had to tell so much sooner, a perverse
conviction of cold and discomfort in the long drive up in the pony carriage which he felt sure
was before him. He was mistaken, however, on this point, for the first thing she said was,
"I have secured the fly, John. Old Pearson will take your luggage. I have so much to tell you."
There was an air of excitement in her face, but not that air of subdued and silent depression
which comes with solitude. She was evidently full of the report she had to make; but yet the
first thing she did when she was ensconced in the fly with John beside her was to cover her
face with her hands, and subside into her corner in a silent passion of tears.

"For mercy's sake tell me what is the matter. What has happened? Is Elinor ill?"

He had almost asked is Elinor dead?

She uncovered her face, which had suddenly lighted up with a strange gleam of joy underneath
the tears. "John, Elinor is here," she said.

"Here?"

"At home--safe. I have brought her back--and the child."

"Confound the child!" John said in his excitement. "Brought her back! What do you mean?"

"Oh, John, it is a long story. I have a hundred things to tell you, and to ask your advice
upon; but the main thing is that she is here. I have brought her away from him. She will go
back no more."

"She has left her husband?" he said, with a momentary flicker of exultation in his dismay.
But the dismay, to do him justice, was the strongest. He looked at his companion almost sternly.
"Things," he said, "must have been very serious to justify that."

"They were more than serious--they had become impossible," Mrs. Dennistoun said.

And she told him her story, which was a long one. She had arrived to find Elinor alone in the
little solitary lodge in the midst of the wilds, not without attention indeed or comfort, but
alone, her husband absent. She had been very ill, and he had been at the neighbouring castle,
where a great party was assembled, and where, the mother discovered at last, there was--the
woman who had made Elinor's life a burden to her. "I don't know with what truth. I don't know
whether there is what people call any harm in it. It is possible he is only amusing himself.
I can't tell. But it has made Elinor miserable this whole autumn through, that and a multitude
of other things. She would not let me send for him when I got there. It had gone so far as
that. She said that the whole business disgusted him, that he had lost all interest in her,
that to hear it was over might be a relief to him, but nothing more. Her heart has turned altogether
against him, John, in every way. There have been a hundred things. You think I am almost wickedly
glad to have her home. And so I am. I cannot deny it. To have her here even in her trouble
makes all the difference to me. But I am not so careless as you think. I can look beyond to
other things. I shrink as much as you do from such a collapse of her life. I don't want her
to give up her duty, and now that there is the additional bond of the child----"

"Oh, for heaven's sake," said John, "leave the child out of it! I want to hear nothing of the
child!"

"That is one chief point, however, that we want your advice about, John. A man, I suppose,
does not understand it; but her baby is everything to Elinor: and I suppose--unless he can
really be proved as guilty as she thinks--he could take the child away."

John smiled to himself a little bitterly: this was why he was sent for in such a hurry, not
for the sake of his society, or from any affection for him, but that he might tell them what
steps to take to secure them in possession of the child. He said nothing for some time, nor
did Mrs. Dennistoun, whose disappointment in the coldness of his response was considerable,
and who waited in vain for him to speak. At length she said, almost tremblingly, "I am afraid
you disapprove very much of the whole business, John."

"I hope it has not been done rashly," he said. "The husband's mere absence, though heartless
as--as I should have expected of the fellow--would yet not be reason enough to satisfy any--court."

"Any court! You don't think she means to bring him before any court? She wants only to be left
alone. We ask nothing from him, not a penny, not any money--surely, surely no revenge--only
not to be molested. There shall not be a word said on our side, if he will but let her alone."

John shook his head. "It all depends upon the view the man takes of it," he said.

Now this was very cold comfort to Mrs. Dennistoun, who had by this time become very secure
in her position, feeling herself entirely justified in all that she had done. "The man," she
said, "the man is not the sufferer: and surely the woman has some claim to be heard."

"Every claim," said John. "That is not what I was thinking of. It is this: if the man has a
leg to stand upon, he will show fight. If he hasn't--why that will make the whole difference,
and probably Elinor's position will be quite safe. But you yourself say----"

"John, don't throw back upon me what I myself said. I said that perhaps things were not so
bad as she believed. In my experience I have found that folly, and playing with everything
that is right is more common than absolute wrong--and men like Philip Compton are made up of
levity and disregard of everything that is serious."

"In that case," said John, "if you are right, he will not let her go."

"Oh, John! oh, John! don't make me wish that he may be a worse man than I think. He could not
force her to go back to him, feeling as she does."

"Nobody can force a woman to do that; but he could perhaps make her position untenable; he
would, perhaps, take away the child."

"John," said Mrs. Dennistoun, in alarm, "if you tell her that, she will fly off with him to
the end of the world. She will die before she will part with the child."

"I suppose that's how women are made," said John, not yet cured of his personal offence.

"Yes," she said, "that's how women are made."

"I beg your pardon," he said, coming to himself; "but you know, aunt, a man may be pardoned
for not understanding that supreme fascination of the baby who cares no more for one than another,
poor little animal, so long as it gets its food and is warm enough. We must await and see what
the man will do."

"Is that the best?--is there nothing we can do to defend ourselves in the meantime--to make
any sort of barricade against him?"

"We must wait and see what he is going to do," said John; and they went over and over the question,
again and again, as they climbed the hills. It grew quite dark as they drove along, and when
they came out upon the open part of the road, from which the Cottage was visible, they both
looked out across the combe to the lights in the windows with an involuntary movement. The
Cottage was transformed; instead of the one lonely lighted window which had indicated to John
in former visits where Mrs. Dennistoun sat alone, there was now a twinkle from various points,
a glow of firelight, a sensation of warmth, and company. Mrs. Dennistoun looked out upon it
and her face shone. It was not a happy thing that Elinor should have made shipwreck of her
life, should have left her husband and sought refuge in her mother's house. But how could it
be otherwise than happy that Elinor was there--Elinor and the other little creature who was
something more than Elinor, herself and yet another? As for John, he looked at it too, with
an interest which stopped all arguments on the cause of it. She was there--wrong, perhaps,
impatient; too quick to fly as she had been too quick to go--but still Elinor all the same,
whether she was right or wrong.

The cab arrived soberly at the door, where Pearson with the pony carriage, coming by the shorter
way with the luggage, had just arrived also. Mrs. Dennistoun said, hurriedly, "You will find
Elinor in the drawing-room, John," and herself went hastily through the house and up the stairs.
She was going to the baby! John guessed this with a smile of astonishment and half contempt.
How strange it was! There could not be a more sad position than that in which, in their rashness,
these two women had placed themselves; and yet the mother, a woman of experience, who ought
to have known better, got out of the carriage like a girl, without waiting to be helped or
attended to, and went up-stairs like the wind, forgetting everything else for that child--that
child, the inheritor of Phil Compton's name and very likely of his qualities--fated from his
birth (most likely) to bring trouble to everybody connected with him! And yet Elinor was of
less interest to her mother. What strange caprices of nature! what extraordinary freaks of
womankind!

The Cottage down-stairs was warm and bright with firelight and lamplight, and in the great
chair by the fire was reclining, lying back with her book laid on her lap and her face full
of eager attention to the sounds outside, a pale young woman, surrounded by cushions and warm
wraps and everything an invalid could require, who raised to him eyes more large and shining
than he had ever seen before, suffused with a dew of pain and pleasure and eager welcome. Elinor,
was it Elinor? He had never seen her in any way like an invalid before--never knew her to be
ill, or weak, or unable to walk out to the door and meet him or anyone she cared for. The sight
of her ailing, weak, with those large glistening eyes, enlarged by feebleness, went to his
very heart. Fortunately he did not in any way connect this enfeebled state with the phenomenon
up-stairs, which was best for all parties. He hurried up to her, taking her thin hands into
his own.

"Elinor! my poor little Nelly--can this be you!"

The water that was in her eyes rolled over in two great tears; a brief convulsion went over
her face. "Yes, John," she said, almost in a whisper. "Strange as it may seem, this is all
that is left of me."

He sat down beside her and for a moment neither of them spoke. Pity, tenderness, wrath, surged
up together in John's breast; pity, tender compassion, most strong of all. Poor little thing;
this was how she had come back to her home; her heart broken, her wings broken, as it were;
all her soaring and swiftness and energy gone. He could scarcely look upon her for the pity
that overflowed his heart. But underneath lay wrath, not only against the man who had brought
her to such a pass, but against herself too.

"John," she said, after a while, "do you remember saying to me that I was not one to bear,
to put up with things, to take the consequences if I tried a dangerous experiment and failed?"

"Did I ever say anything so silly and so cruel?"

"Oh, no, no; it was neither silly nor unkind, but quite, quite true. I have thought of it so
often. I used to think of it to stir up my pride, to remind myself that I ought to try to be
better than my nature, not to allow you to be a true prophet. But it was so, and I couldn't
change it. You can see you were right, John, for I have not been like a strong woman, able
to endure; I have only been able to run away."

"My poor little Nelly!"

"Don't pity me," she said, the tears running over again. "I am too well off; I am too well
taken care of. A prodigal should not be made so much of as I am."

"Don't call yourself a prodigal, Nelly! Perhaps things may not be as bad as they appear. At
least, it is but the first fall--the greatest athlete gets many before he can stand against
the world."

"I'll never be an athlete, John. Besides, I'm a woman, you know, and a fall of any kind is
fatal to a woman, especially anything of this kind. No, I know very well it's all over; I shall
never hold up my head again. But that's not the question--the question is, to be safe and as
free as can be. Mamma takes me in, you know, just as if nothing had happened. She is quite
willing to take the burden of me on her shoulders--and of baby. She has told you that there
are two of me, now, John--my baby, as well as myself."

John could only nod an assent; he could not speak.

"It's a wonderful thing to come out of a wreck with a treasure in one's arms; everything going
to pieces behind one; the rafters coming down, the walls falling in and yet one's treasure
in one's arms. Oh, I had not the heart or the strength to come out of the tumbling house. My
mother did it all, dragged me out, wrapped me up in love and kindness, carried me away. I don't
want you to think I was good for anything. I should just have lain there and died. One thing,
I did not mind dying at all--I had quite made up my mind. That would not have been so disgraceful
as running away."

"There is nothing that is disgraceful," said John, "for heaven's sake don't say so, Nelly.
It is unfortunate--beyond words--but that is all. Nobody can think that you are in any way
disgraced. And if you are allowed just to stay quietly here in your natural home, I suppose
you desire nothing more."

"What should I desire more, John? You don't suppose I should like to go and live in the world
again, and go into society and all that? I have had about enough of society. Oh, I want nothing
but to be quiet and unmolested, and bring up my baby. They could not take my baby from me, John?"

"I do not think so," he said, with a grave face.

"You do not--think so? Then you are not sure? My mother says dreadful things, but I cannot
believe them. They would never take an infant from its mother to give it to--to give it to--a
man--who could do nothing, nothing for it. What could a man do with a young child? a man always
on the move, who has no settled home, who has no idea what an infant wants? John, I know law
is inhuman, but surely, surely not so inhuman as that."

"My dear Nelly," he said, "the law, you know, which, as you say, is often inhuman, recognizes
the child as belonging to the father. He is responsible for it. For instance, they never could
come upon you for its maintenance or education, or anything of that kind, until it had been
proved that the father----"

"May I ask," said Elinor, with uplifted head, "of what or of whom you are talking when you say it?"

It was all John could do not to burst into a peal of aggrieved and indignant laughter. He who
had been brought from town, from his own comforts such as they were, to be consulted about
this brat, this child which belonged to the dis-Honourable Phil; and Elinor, Elinor, of all
people in the world, threw up her head and confronted him with disdain because he called the
brat it, and not him or her, whichever it was. John recollected well enough that sentence at
which he had been so indignant in the telegram--"child, a boy "--but he affected to himself
not to know what it was for the indulgence of a little contumely: and the reward he had got
was contumely upon his own head. But when he looked at Elinor's pale face, the eyes so much
larger than they ought to be, with tears welling out unawares, dried up for a moment by indignation
or quick hasty temper, the temper which made her sweeter words all the more sweet he had always
thought--then rising again unawares under the heavy lids, the lips so ready to quiver, the
pathetic lines about the mouth: when he looked at all these John's heart smote him. He would
have called the child anything, if there had been a sex superior to him the baby should have
it. And what was there that man could do that he would not do for the deliverance of the mother
and the child?

CHAPTER XXV.

It cannot be said that this evening at the Cottage was an agreeable one. To think that Elinor
should be there, and yet that there should be so little pleasure in the fact that the old party,
which had once been so happy together, should be together again, was bewildering. And yet there
was one member of it who was happy with a shamefaced unacknowledged joy. To think that that
which made her child miserable should make her happy was a dreadful thought to Mrs. Dennistoun,
and yet how could she help it? Elinor was there, and the baby was there, the new unthought-of
creature which had brought with it a new anxiety, a rush of new thoughts and wishes. Already
everything else in the mind of Elinor's mother began to yield to the desire to retain these
two--the new mother and the child. But she did not avow this desire. She was mostly silent,
taking little part in the discussion, which was indeed a very curious discussion, since Elinor,
debating the question how she was to abandon her husband and defend herself against him, never
mentioned his name.

She did not come in to dinner, which Mrs. Dennistoun and John Tatham ate solemnly alone, saying
but little, trying to talk upon indifferent topics, with that very wretched result which is
usual when people at one of the great crises of life have to make conversation for each other
while servants are about and the restraints of common life are around them. Whether it is the
terrible flood of grief which has to be barred and kept within bounds so that the functions
of life may not altogether be swept away, or the sharper but warmer pang of anxiety, that which
cuts like a serpent's tooth, yet is not altogether beyond the reach of hope, what poor pretences
these are at interest in ordinary subjects; what miserable gropings after something that can
furnish a thread of conversation just enough to keep the intercourse of life going! These two
were not more successful than others in this dismal pursuit. Mrs. Dennistoun found a moment
when the meal was over before she left John, poor pretence! to his wine. "Remember that she
will not mention his name; nothing must be said about him," she said. "How can we discuss him
and what he is likely to do without speaking of him?" said John, with a little scorn. "I don't
know," replied the poor lady. "But you will find that she will not have his name mentioned.
You must try and humour her. Poor Elinor! For I know that you are sorry for her, John."

Sorry for her! He sat over his glass of mild claret in the little dining-room that had once
been so bright; even now it was the cosiest little room, the curtains all drawn, shutting out
the cold wind, which in January searches out every crevice, the firelight blazing fitfully,
bringing out all the pretty warm decorations, the gleam of silver on the side-board, the pictures
on the wall, the mirror over the mantelpiece. There was nothing wanted under that roof to make
it the very home of domestic warmth and comfort. And yet--sorry for Elinor! That was not the
word. His heart was sore for her, torn away from all her moorings, drifting back a wreck to
the little youthful home, where all had been so tranquil and so sweet. John had nothing in
him of that petty sentiment which derives satisfaction from a calamity it has foreseen, nor
had he even an old lover's thrill of almost pleasure in the downfall of the clay idol that
has been preferred to his gold. His pain for Elinor, the constriction in his heart at thought
of her position, were unmixed with any baser feeling. Sorry for her! He would have given all
he possessed to restore her happiness--not in his way, but in the way she had chosen, even,
last abnegation of all, to make the man worthy of her who had never been worthy. Even his own
indignation and wrath against that man were subservient in John's honest breast to the desire
of somehow finding that it might be possible to whitewash him, nay to reform him, to make him
as near as possible something which she could tolerate for life. I doubt if a woman, notwithstanding
the much more ready power of sacrifice which women possess, could have so fully desired this
renewal and amendment as John did. It was scarcely too much to say that he hated Phil Compton:
yet he would have given the half of his substance at this moment to make Phil Compton a good
man; nay, even to make him a passable man--to rehabilitate him in his wife's eyes.

John stayed a long time over "his wine," the mild glass of claret (or perhaps it was Burgundy)
which was all that was offered him--partly to think the matter over, but also partly perhaps
because he heard certain faint gurglings, and the passage of certain steps, active and full
of energy, past the door of the room within which he sat, going now to the drawing-room, now
up-stairs, from which he divined that the new inmate of the house was at present in possession
of the drawing-room, and of all attention there. He smiled at himself for his hostility to
the child, which, of course, was entirely innocent of all blame. Here the man was inferior
to the woman in comprehension and sympathy; for he not only could not understand how they could
possibly obtain solace in their trouble from this unconscious little creature, but he was angry
and scornful of them for doing so. Phil Compton's brat, no doubt the germ of a thousand troubles
to come, but besides that a nothing, a being without love or thought, or even consciousness,
a mere little animal feeding and sleeping--and yet the idol and object of all the thoughts
of two intelligent women, capable of so much better things! This irritated John and disgusted
him in the midst of all his anxious thoughts, and his profound compassion and deliberations
how best to help: and it was not till the passage of certain feeble sounds outside his door,
which proceeded audibly up-stairs, little bleatings in which, if they had come from a lamb,
or even a puppy, John would have been interested, assured him that the small enemy had disappeared--that
he finally rose and proceeded to "join the ladies," as if he had been holding a little private
debauch all by himself.

There was a little fragrance and air of the visitor still in the room, a little disturbance
of the usual arrangements, a surreptitious, quite unjustifiable look as of pleasure in Elinor's
eyes, which were less expanded, and if as liquid as ever, more softly bright than before. Something
white actually lay on the sofa, a small garment which Mrs. Dennistoun whisked away. They were
conscious of John's critical eye upon them, and received him with a warmth of conciliatory
welcome which betrayed that consciousness. Mrs. Dennistoun drew a chair for him to the other
side of the fire. She took her own place in the middle at the table with a large piece of white
knitting, to which she gave her whole attention, and thus the deliberation began.

"Elinor wants to know, John, what you think we ought to do--to make quite sure--that there
will be no risk, about the baby."

"I must know more of the details of the question before I can give any advice," said John.

"John," said Elinor, raising herself in her chair, "here are all the details that are necessary.
I have come away. I have come home, finding that life was impossible there. That is the whole
matter. It may be, probably it is, my own fault. It is simply that life became impossible.
You know you said that I was not one to endure, to put up with things. I scoffed at you then,
for I did not expect to have anything to put up with; but you were quite right, and life had
become impossible--that is all there is any need to say."

"To me, yes," said John, "but not enough, Elinor, if it ever has to come within the reach of
the law."

"But why should it come within the reach of the law? You, John, you are a lawyer; you know
the rights of everything. I thought you might have arranged it all. Couldn't you try to make
a kind of a bargain? What bargain? Oh, am I a lawyer, do I know? But you, John, who have it
all at your fingers' ends, who know what can be done and what can't be done, and the rights
that one has and that another has! Dear John! if you were to try, don't you think that you
could settle it all, simply as between people who don't want any exposure, any struggle, but
only to be quiet and to be let alone?"

"Elinor, I don't know what I could do with so little information as I have. To know that you
found your life impossible is enough for me. But you know most people are right in their own
eyes. If we have some one opposed to us who thinks, for instance, that the fault was yours?"

"Well," she cried, eagerly, "I am willing to accept that: say that the fault was mine! You
could confirm it, that it was likely to be mine. You could tell them what an impatient person
I was, and that you said I was not one to try an experiment, for I never, never could put up
with anything. John, you could be a witness as well as an advocate. You could prove that you
always expected--and that I am quite, quite willing to allow that it was I----"

"Elinor, if I could only make you understand what I mean! I am told that I am not to mention
any names?"

"No, no names, no names! What is the good? We both know very well what we mean."

"But I don't know very well what you mean. Don't you see that if it is your fault--if the other
party is innocent--there can be no reason in the world why he should consent to renounce his
rights. It is not a mere matter of feeling. There is right in it one way or another--either
on your side or else on the other side; and if it is on the other side, why should a man give
up what belongs to him, why should he renounce what is--most dear to him?"

"Oh, John, John, John!" she made this appeal and outcry, clasping her hands together with a
mixture of supplication and impatience. Then turning to her mother--"Oh, tell him," she cried,
"tell him!"--always clasping those impatient yet beseeching hands.

"You see, John," said Mrs. Dennistoun, "Elinor knows that the right is on her side: but she
will consent to say nothing about it to any one--to give herself out as the offender rather--that
is to say, as an ill-disciplined person that cannot put up with anything, as you seem to have
said."

John laughed with vexation, yet a kind of amusement. "I never said it nor thought it: still
if it pleases her to think so---- The wiser thing if this separation is final----"

"If it is final!" Elinor cried. She raised herself up again in her chair, and contemplated
the unfortunate John with a sort of tragic superiority. "Do you think that of me," she said,
"that I would take such a step as this and that it should not be final? Is dying final? Could
one do such a thing as this and change?"

"Such things have been done," said John. "Elinor, forgive me. I must say it--it is all your
life that is in the balance, and another life. There is this infant to be struggled over, perhaps
rent in two by those who should have united to take care of him--and it's a boy, I hear. There's
his name and his after-life to think of--a child without a father, perhaps the heir of a family
to which he will not belong. Elinor--tell her, aunt, you understand: is it my wish to hand
her back to--to---- No, I'll speak no names. But you know I disliked it always, opposed it
always. It is not out of any favour to--to the other side. But she ought to take all these
things into account. Her own position, and the position in the future of the child----"

Elinor had crushed her fan with her hands, and Mrs. Dennistoun let the knitting with which
she had gone on in spite of all fall at last in her lap. There was a little pause. John Tatham's
voice itself had began to falter, or rather swelled in sound as when a stream swells in flood.

"I do not go into the question about women and what they ought to put up with," said John,
resuming. "There's many things that law can do nothing for--and nature in many ways makes it
harder for women, I acknowledge. We cannot change that. Think what her position will be--neither
a wife nor with the freedom of a widow; and the boy, bearing the name of one he must almost
be taught to think badly of--for one of them must be in the wrong----"

"He shall never, never hear that name; he shall know nothing, he shall be free of every bond;
his mind shall never be cramped or twisted or troubled by any--man--if I live."

This Elinor said, lifting her pale face from her hands with eyes that flashed and shone with
a blaze of excitement and weakness.

"There already," said John, "is a tremendous condition--if you live! Who can make sure that
they will live? We must all die--some sooner, some later--and you wearing yourself out with
excitement, that never were strong; you exposing your heart, the weakest organ----"

"John," said Mrs. Dennistoun, grasping him by the arm, "you are talking nonsense, you don't
know what you are saying. My darling! she was never weak nor had a feeble heart, nor--anything!
She will live to bring up his children, her baby's children, upon her knees."

"And what would it matter?" said Elinor--looking at him with clear eyes, from which the tears
had disappeared in the shock of this unlooked-for suggestion--"suppose I have no more strength
than that, suppose I were to die? you shall be his guardian, John, bring him up a good man;
and his Heavenly Father will take care of him. I am not afraid."

A man had better not deal with such subjects between two women. What with Mrs. Dennistoun's
indignant protest and Elinor's lofty submission, John was at his wits' end. "I did not mean
to carry things to such a bitter end as that," he said. "You want to force me into a corner
and make me say things I never meant. The question is serious enough without that."

There was again a little pause, and then Elinor, with one of those changes which are so perplexing
to sober-minded people, suddenly turned to him, holding out both her hands.

"John--we'll leave that in God's hands whatever is to happen to me. But in the meantime, while
I am living--and perhaps my life depends upon being quiet and having a little peace and rest.
It is not that I care very much for my life," said Elinor, with that clear, open-eyed look,
like the sky after rain--"I am shipwrecked, John, as you say--but my mother does, and it's
of--some--consequence--to baby; and if it depends upon whether I am left alone, you are too
good a friend to leave me in the lurch. And you said--one night--whatever happened I was to
send for you."

John sprang up from his seat, dropping the hands which he had taken into his own. She was like
Queen Katherine, "about to weep," and her breast strained with the sobbing effort to keep it down.

"For God's sake," he cried, "don't play upon our hearts like this! I will do anything--everything--whatever
you choose to tell me. Aunt, don't let her cry, don't let her go on like that. Why, good heavens!"
he cried, bursting himself into a kind of big sob, "won't it be bad for that little brat of
a baby or something if she keeps going on in this way?"

Thus John Tatham surrendered at discretion. What could he do more? A man cannot be played upon
like an instrument without giving out sounds of which he will, perhaps, be ashamed. And this
woman appealing to him--this girl--looking like the little Elinor he remembered, younger and
softer in her weakness and trouble than she had been in her beauty and pride--was the creature
after all, though she would never know it, whom he loved best in the world. He had wanted to
save her, in the one worldly way of saving her, from open shipwreck, for her own sake, against
every prejudice and prepossession of his mind. But if she would not have that, why it was his
business to save her as she wished, to do for her whatever she wanted; to act as her agent,
her champion, whatever she pleased.

He was sent away presently, and accepted his dismissal with thankfulness, to smoke his cigar.
This is one amusing thing in a feminine household. A man is supposed to want all manner of
little indulgences and not to be able to do without them. He is carefully left alone over "his
wine"--the aforesaid glass of claret; and ways and means are provided for him to smoke his
cigar, whether he wishes it or not. He had often laughed at these regulations of his careful
relatives, but he was rather glad of them to-night. "I am going to get Elinor to bed," said
Mrs. Dennistoun. "It has, perhaps, been a little too much for her: but when you have finished
your cigar, John, if you will come back to the drawing-room for a few minutes you will find
me here."

John did not smoke any cigar. It is all very well to be soothed and consoled by tobacco in
your own room, at your own ease: but when you are put into a lady's dining-room, where everything
is nice, and where the curtains will probably smell of smoke next morning: and when your mind
is exercised beyond even the power of the body to keep still, that is not a time to enjoy such
calm and composing delights. But he walked about the room in which he was shut up like a wild
beast in his cage, sometimes with long strides from wall to wall, sometimes going round, with
that abstract trick of his, staring at the pictures, as if he did not know every picture in
the place by heart. He forgot that he was to go back to the drawing-room again after Elinor
had been taken to bed, and it was only after having waited for him a long time that Mrs. Dennistoun
came, almost timidly, knocking at her own dining-room door, afraid to disturb her visitor in
the evening rites which she believed in so devoutly. She did go in, however, and they stood
together over the fire for a few minutes, he staring down upon the glow at his feet, she contemplating
fitfully, unconsciously, her own pale face and his in the dim mirror on the mantelpiece. They
talked in low tones about Elinor and her health, and her determination which nothing would change.

"Of course I will do it," said John; "anything--whatever she may require of me--there are no
two words about that. There is only one thing: I will not compromise her by taking any initiative.
Let us wait and see what they are going to do----"

"But, John, might it not be better to disarm him by making overtures? anything, I would do
anything if he would but let her remain unmolested--and the baby."

"Do you mean money?" he said.

Mrs. Dennistoun gave him an abashed look, deprecatory and wistful, but did not make any reply.

"Phil Compton is a cad, and a brute, and a scamp of the first water," said John, glad of some
way to get rid of his excitement; "but I do not think that even he would sell his wife and
his child for money. I wouldn't do him so much discredit as that."

"Oh, I beg your pardon, John," Mrs. Dennistoun said.

CHAPTER XXVI.

John left the Cottage next morning with the full conduct of the affairs of the family placed
in his hands. The ladies were both a little doubtful if his plan was the best--they were still
frightened for what might happen, and kept up a watch, as John perceived, fearing every step
that approached, trembling at every shadow. They remembered many stories, such as rush to the
minds of persons in trouble, of similar cases, of the machinations of the bad father whose
only object was to overcome and break down his wife, and who stole his child away to let it
languish and die. There are some circumstances in which people forget all the shades of character,
and take it for granted that a man who can go wrong in one matter will act like a very demon
in all. This was doubly strong in Mrs. Dennistoun, a woman full of toleration and experience;
but the issues were so momentous to her, and the possible results so terrible, that she lost
her accustomed good sense. It was more natural, perhaps, that Elinor, who was weak in health
and still full of the arbitrariness of youth, should entertain this fear--without considering
that Phil was the very last man in the world to burden himself with an infant of the most helpless
age--which seemed to John an almost quite unreasonable one. Almost--for, of course, he too
was compelled to allow, when driven into a corner, that there was nothing that an exasperated
man might not do. Elinor had come down early to see her cousin before he left the house, bringing
with her in her arms the little bundle of muslin and flannel upon the safety of which her very
life seemed to depend. John looked at it, and at the small pink face and unconscious flickering
hands that formed the small centre to all those wrappings, with a curious mixture of pity and
repugnance. It was like any other blind new-born kitten or puppy, he thought, but not so amusing--no,
it was not blind, to be sure. At one moment, without any warning, it suddenly opened a pair
of eyes, which by a lively exercise of fancy might be supposed like Elinor's, and seemed to
look him in the face, which startled him very much, with a curious notification of the fact
that the thing was not a kitten or a puppy. But then a little quiver came over the small countenance,
and the attendant said it was "the wind." Perhaps the opening of the eyes was the wind too,
or some other automatic effect. He would not hold out his finger to be clasped tight by the
little flickering fist, as Elinor would have had him. He would none of those follies; he turned
away from it not to allow himself to be moved by the effect, quite a meretricious one, of the
baby in the young mother's arms. That was all poetry, sentiment, the trick of the painter,
who had found the combination beautiful. Such ideas belonged, indeed, to the conventional-sacred,
and he had never felt any profane resistance of mind against the San Sisto picture or any of
its kind. But Phil Compton's brat was a very different thing. What did it matter what became
of it? If it were not for Elinor's perverse feeling on the subject, and that perfectly imbecile
prostration of her mother, a sensible woman who ought to have known better, before the little
creature, he would himself have been rather grateful to Phil Compton for taking it away. But
when he saw the look of terror upon Elinor's face when an unexpected step came to the door,
when he saw her turn and fly, wrapping the child in her arms, on her very heart as it seemed,
bending over it, covering it so that it disappeared altogether in her embrace, John's heart
was a little touched. It was only a hawking tramp with pins and needles, who came by mistake
to the hall door, but her panic and anguish of alarm were a spectacle which he could not get
out of his eyes.

"You see, she never feels safe for a moment. It will be hard to persuade her that that man,
though I've seen him about the roads for years, is not an emissary--or a spy--to find out if
she is here."

"I am sure it is quite an unnecessary panic," said John. "In the first place, Phil Compton's
the last man to burden himself with a child; in the second, he's not a brute nor a monster."

"You called him a brute last night, John."

"I did not mean in that way. I don't mean to stand by any rash word that may be forced from
me in a moment of irritation. Aunt, get her to give over that. She'll torture herself to death
for nothing. He'll not try to take the child away--not just now, at all events, not while it
is a mere---- Bring her to her senses on that point. You surely can do that?"

"If I was quite sure of being in my own," Mrs. Dennistoun said, with a forlorn smile. "I am
as much frightened as she is, John. And, remember, if there is anything to be done--anything----"

"There is nothing but a little common sense wanted," said John. But as he drove away from the
door, and saw the hawker with the needles still about, the ladies had so infected him that
it was all he could do to restrain an inclination to take the vagrant by the collar and throw
him down the combe.

"Who's that fellow hanging about?" he said to Pearson, who was driving him; "and what does
he want here?"

"Bless you, sir! that's Joe," Pearson said. "He's after no harm. He's honest enough as long
as there ain't nothing much in his way; and he's waiting for the pieces as cook gives him once
a week when he comes his rounds. There's no harm in poor Joe."

"I suppose not, since you say so," said John; "but you know the ladies are rather nervous,
Pearson. You must keep a look-out that no suspicious-looking person hangs about the house."

"Bless us! Mr. John," said Pearson, "what are they nervous about?--the baby? But nobody wants
to steal a baby, bless your soul!"

"I quite agree with you," said John, much relieved (though he considered Pearson an old fool,
in a general way) to have his own opinion confirmed. "But, all the same, I wish you would be
doubly particular not to admit anybody you don't know; and if any man should appear to bother
them send for me on the moment. Do you hear?"

"What do you call any man, sir?" said Pearson, smartly. He had ideas of his own, though he
might be a fool.

"I mean what I say," said John, more sharply still. "Any one that molests or alarms them. Send
me off a telegram at once--'You're wanted!' That will be quite enough. But don't go with it
to the office yourself; send somebody--there's always your boy about the place--and keep about
like a dragon yourself."

"I'll do my best, sir," said Pearson, "though I don't know what a dragon is, except it's the
one in the Bible; and that's not a thing anybody would want about the place."

It was a comfort to John, after all his troubles, to be able to laugh, which he did with a
heartiness which surprised Pearson, who was quite unaware that he had made any joke.

These fears, however, which were imposed upon him by the contagion of the terrors of the others,
soon passed from John's mind. He was convinced that Phil Compton would take no such step; and
that, however much he might wish his wife to return, the possession of the baby was not a thing
which he would struggle over. It cannot be denied, however, that he was anxious, and eagerly
inspected his letters in the morning, and looked out for telegrams during the day. Fortunately,
however, no evil tidings came. Mrs. Dennistoun reported unbroken peace in the Cottage and increasing
strength on the part of Elinor; and, in a parenthesis with a sort of apology, of the baby.
Nobody had come near them to trouble them. Elinor had received no letters. The tie between
her and her husband seemed to be cut as with a knife. "We cannot of course," she said, "expect
this tranquillity to last."

And it came to be a very curious thought with John, as week after week passed, whether it was
to last--whether Phil Compton, who had never been supposed wanting in courage, intended to
let his wife and child drop off from him as if they had never been. This seemed a thing impossible
to conceive: but John said to himself with much internal contempt that he knew nothing of the
workings of the mind of such a man, and that it might for aught he knew be a common incident
in life with the Phil Comptons thus to shake off their belongings when they got tired of them.
The fool! the booby! to get tired of Elinor! That rumour which flies about the world so strangely
and communicates information about everybody to the vacant ear, to be retailed to those whom
it may concern, provided him, as the days went by, with many particulars which he had not been
able to obtain from Elinor. Phil, it appeared, had gone to Glenorban--the great house to which
he had been invited--alone, with an excuse for his wife, whose state of health was not appropriate
to a large party, and had stayed there spending Christmas with a brilliant houseful of guests,
among whom was the American lady who had captivated him. Phil had paid one visit to the lodge
to see Elinor, by her mother's summons, at the crisis of her illness, but had not hesitated
to go away again when informed that the crisis was over. Mrs. Dennistoun never told what had
passed between them on that occasion, but the gossips of the club were credibly informed that
she had bullied and stormed at Phil, after the fashion of mothers-in-law, till she had driven
him away. Upon which he had returned to his party and flirted with Mrs. Harris more than ever.
John discovered also that the party having dispersed some time ago, Phil had gone abroad. Whether
in ignorance of his wife's flight or not he could not discover; but it was almost impossible
to believe that he would have gone to Monte Carlo without finding out something about Elinor--how
and where she was. But whether this was the cause of his utter silence, or whether it was the
habit of men of his class to treat such tremendous incidents in domestic life with levity,
John Tatham could not make out. He was congratulating himself, however, upon keeping perfectly
quiet, and leaving the conduct of the matter to the other party, when the silence was disturbed
in what seemed to him the most curious way.

One afternoon when he returned from the court he was aware, when he entered the outer office
in which his clerk abode, of what he described afterwards as a smell fit to knock you down.
It would have been described more appropriately in a French novel as the special perfume, subtle
and exquisite, by which a beautiful woman may be recognised wherever she goes. It was, indeed,
neither more nor less than the particular scent used by Lady Mariamne, who came forward with
a sweep and rustle of her draperies, and the most ingratiating of her smiles.

"It appears to be fated that I am to wait for you," she said. "How do you do, Mr. Tatham? Take
me out of this horrible dirty place. I am quite sure you have some nice rooms in there." She
pointed as she spoke to the inner door, and moved towards it with the air of a person who knew
where she was going, and was fully purposed to be admitted. John said afterwards, that to think
of this woman's abominable scent being left in his room in which he lived (though he also received
his clients in it) was almost more than he could bear. But, in the meantime, he could do nothing
but open the door to her, and offer her his most comfortable chair.

She seated herself with all those little tricks of movement which are also part of the stock-in-trade
of the pretty woman. Lady Mariamne's prettiness was not of a kind which had the slightest effect
upon John, but still it was a kind which received credit in society, being the product of a
great deal of pains and care and exquisite arrangement and combination. She threw her fur cloak
back a little, arranged the strings of her bonnet under her chin, which threw up the daintiness
and rosiness of a complexion about which there were many questions among her closest friends.
She shook up, with what had often been commented upon as the prettiest gesture, the bracelets
from her wrists. She arranged the veil, which just came over the tip of her delicate nose,
she put out her foot as if searching for a footstool--which John made haste to supply, though
he remained unaffected otherwise by all these pretty preliminaries.

"Sit down, Mr. Tatham," then said Lady Mariamne. "It makes me wretchedly uncomfortable, as
if you were some dreadful man waiting to be paid or something, to see you standing there."

Though John's first impulse was that of wrath to be thus requested to sit down in his own chambers,
the position was amusing as well as disagreeable, and he laughed and drew a chair towards his
writing-table, which was as crowded and untidy as the writing-table of a busy man usually is,
and placed himself in an attitude of attention, though without asking any question.

"Well," said Lady Mariamne, slowly drawing off her glove; "you know, of course, why I have
come, Mr. Tatham--to talk over with you, as a man who knows the world, this deplorable business.
You see it has come about exactly as I said. I knew what would happen: and though I am not
one of those people who always insist upon being proved right, you remember what I said----"

"I remember that you said something--to which, perhaps, had I thought I should have been called
upon to give evidence as to its correctness--I should have paid more attention, Lady Mariamne."

"How rude you are!" she said, with her whole interest concentrated upon the slow removal of
her glove. Then she smoothed a little, softly, the pretty hand which was thus uncovered, and
said, "How red one's hands get in this weather," and then laughed. "You don't mean to tell
me, Mr. Tatham," she said, suddenly raising her eyes to his, "that, considering what a very
particular person we were discussing, you can't remember what I said?"

John was obliged to confess that he remembered more or less the gist of her discourse, and
Lady Mariamne nodded her head many times in acceptance of his confession.

"Well," she said, "you see what it has come to. An open scandal, a separation, and everything
broken up. For one thing, I knew if she did not give him his head a little that's what would
happen. I don't believe he cares a brass farthing for that other woman. She makes fun of everybody,
and that amused him. And it amused him to put Nell in a state--that as much as anything. Why
couldn't she see that and learn to prendre son parti like other people? She was free to say,
'You go your way and I'll go mine:' the most of us do that sooner or later: but to make a vulgar
open rupture, and go off--like this."

"I fail to see the vulgarity in it," said John.

"Oh, of course; everything she does is perfect to you. But just think, if it had been your
own case--followed about and bullied by a jealous woman, in a state of health that of itself
disgusts a man----"

"Lady Mariamne, you must pardon me if I refuse to listen to anything more of this kind," said
John, starting to his feet.

"Oh, I warn you, you'll be compelled to listen to a great deal more if you're her agent as
I hear! Phil will find means of compelling you to hear if you don't like to take your information
from me."

"I should like to know how Mr. Phil Compton will succeed in compelling me--to anything I don't
choose to do."

"You think, perhaps, because there's no duelling in this country he can't do anything. But
there is, all the same. He would shame you into it--he could say you were--sheltering yourself----"

"I am not a man to fight duels," said John, very angry, but smiling, "in any circumstances,
even were such a thing not utterly ridiculous; but even a fighting man might feel that to put
himself on a level with the dis-Hon----"

He stopped himself as he said it. How mean it was--to a woman!--descending to their own methods.
But Lady Mariamne was too quick for him.

"Oh," she said; "so you've heard of that, a nickname that no gentleman----" then she too paused
and looked at him, with a momentary flush. He was going to apologize abjectly, when with a
slight laugh she turned the subject aside.

"Pretty fools we are, both of us, to talk such nonsense. I didn't come here carrying Phil on
my shoulders, to spring at your throat if you expressed your opinion. Look here--tell me, don't
let us go beating about the bush, Mr. Tatham--I suppose you have seen Nell?"

"I know my cousin's mind, at least," he said.

"Well, then, just tell me as between friends--there's no need we should quarrel because they
have done so. Tell me this, is she going to get up a divorce case----"

"A divorce----!"

"Because," said Lady Mariamne, "she'll find it precious difficult to prove anything. I know
she will. She may prove the flirting and so forth--but what's that? You can tell her from me,
it wants somebody far better up to things than she is to prove anything. I warn her as a friend
she'll not get much good by that move."

"I am not aware," said John, "whether Mrs. Compton has made up her mind about the further steps----"

"Then just you advise her not," cried Lady Mariamne. "It doesn't matter to me: I shall be none
the worse whatever she does: but if you are her true friend you will advise her not. She might
tell what she thinks, but that's no proof. Mr. Tatham, I know you have great influence with Nell."

"Not in a matter like this," said John, with great gravity. "Of course she alone can be the judge."

"What nonsense you talk, you men! Of course she is not the least the judge, and of course she
will be guided by you."

"You may be sure she shall have the best advice that I can give," John said with a bow.

"You want me to go, I see," said Lady Mariamne; "you are dreadfully rude, standing up all the
time to show me I had better go." Hereupon she recommenced her little manège, drawing on her
glove, letting her bracelets drop again, fastening the fur round her throat. "Well, Mr. Tatham,"
she said, "I hope you mean to have the civility to see after my carriage. I can't go roaming
about hailing it as if it were a hansom cab--in this queer place."

CHAPTER XXVII.

John went down to Windyhill that evening. His appearance alarmed the little household more
than words could say. As he was admitted at once by the servants, delighted to see him, he
walked in suddenly into the midst of a truly domestic scene. The baby lay on Elinor's knee
in the midst of a mass of white wrappings, kicking out a pair of pink little legs in the front
of the fire. Elinor herself was seated on a very low chair, and illuminated by the cheerful
blaze, which threw a glare upon her countenance, and called out unthought-of lights in her
hair, there was no appearance in her looks of anxiety or trouble. She was altogether given
up to the baby and the joy of its new life. The little kicking limbs, the pleasure of the little
creature in the warmth, the curling of its rosy little toes in the agreeable sensation of the
heat, were more to Elinor and to her mother, who was kneeling beside her on the hearth-rug,
than the most refined and lofty pleasures in the world. The most lofty of us have to come down
to those primitive sources of bliss, if we are happy enough to have them placed in our way.
The greatest poet by her side, the music of the spheres sounding in her ear, would not have
made Elinor forget her troubles like the stretching out towards the fire of those little pink toes.

When the door opened, and the voice and step of a man--dreaded sounds--were audible, a thrill
of terror ran over this little group. Mrs. Dennistoun sprang to her feet and placed herself
between the intruder and the young mother, while Elinor gathered up, covering him all over,
so that he disappeared altogether, her child in her arms.

"It is John," said Mrs. Dennistoun. "God be thanked, it is only John."

But Elinor, quite overcome by the shock, burst suddenly into tears, to which the baby responded
by a vigorous cry, not at all relishing the sudden huddling up among its shawls to which it
had been subjected. It may be supposed what an effect this cloudy side of the happiness, which
he had not been able to deny to himself made a very pretty scene, had upon John. He said, not
without a little offence, "I am sure I beg your pardon humbly. I'll go away."

Elinor turned round her head, smiling through her tears. "It was only that you gave me a fright,"
she said. "I am quite right again; don't, oh, don't go away! unless you object to the sight
of baby, and to hear him cry; but he'll not cry now, any more than his silly mother. Mamma,
make John sit down and tell us--Oh, I am sure he has something to tell us--Perhaps I took comfort
too soon; but the very sight of John is a protection and a strength," she said, holding out
her hand to him. This sudden change of front reduced John, who had been perhaps disposed for
a moment to stand on his dignity, to utter subjection. He neither said nor even thought a word
against the baby, who was presently unfolded again, and turned once more the toes of comfort
towards the fire. He did not approach too near, feeling that he had no particular share in
the scene, and indeed cut an almost absurd figure in the midst of that group, but sat behind,
contemplating it from a little distance against the fire. The evening had grown dark by this
time, but the two women, absorbed by their worship, had wanted no light. It had happened to
John by an extreme piece of luck to catch the express train almost as soon as Lady Mariamne
had left him, and to reach the station at Hurrymere before the February day was done.

"You have something to tell us, John--good news or bad?" Mrs. Dennistoun said.

"Good; or I should not have come like this unannounced," he said. "The post is quick enough
for bad. I think you may be quite at your ease about the child--no claim will be made on the
child. Elinor, I think, will not be disturbed if--she means to take no steps on her side."

"What steps?" said Mrs. Dennistoun. Elinor turned her head to look at him anxiously over the
back of her chair.

"I have had a visit this afternoon," he said.

"From--" Elinor drew a long hurried breath. She said no name, but it was evident that one was
on her lips--a name she never meant to pronounce more, but to which her whole being thrilled
still even when it was unspoken. She looked at him full of eagerness to hear yet with a hand
uplifted, as if to forbid any utterance.

"From Lady Mariamne."

How her countenance fell! She turned round again, and bent over her baby. It was a pang of
acute disappointment, he could not but see, that went through her, though she would not have
allowed him to say that name. Strange inconsistency! it ran over John too with a sense of keen
indignation, as if he had taken from her an electric touch.

"----Whose object in coming to me was to ascertain whether you intended to bring a suit for--divorce."

A cry rang through the room. Elinor turned upon him for a moment a face blazing with hot and
painful colour. The lamp had been brought in, and he saw the fierce blush and look of horror.
Then she turned round and buried it in her hands.

"Divorce!" said Mrs. Dennistoun. "Elinor----! To drag her private affairs before the world.
Oh, John, John, that could not be. You would not wish that to be."

"I!" he cried with a laugh of tuneless mirth. "Is it likely that I would wish to drag Elinor
before the world?"

Elinor did not say anything, but withdrew one hand from her burning cheek and put it into his.
These women treated John as if he were a man of wood. What he might be feeling, or if he were
feeling anything, did not enter their minds.

"It was like her," said Elinor after a time in a low hurried voice, "to think of that. She
is the only one who would think of it. As if I had ever thought or dreamed----"

"It is possible, however," he said, "that it might be reasonable enough. I don't speak to Elinor,"
who had let go his hand hastily, "but to you, aunt. If it is altogether final, as she says,
to be released would perhaps be better, from a bond that was no bond."

"John, John, would you have her add shame to pain?"

"The shame would not be to her, aunt."

"The shame is to every one concerned--to every one! My Elinor's name, her dear name, dragged
through all that mud! She a party, perhaps, to revelations--Oh, never, never! We would bear
anything rather."

"This of course," said John, "is perhaps a still more bitter punishment for the other side."

She looked round at him again. Looking up with a look of pale horror, her eyelids in agonised
curves over her eyes, her mouth quivering. "What did you say, John?"

"I said it might be a more bitter punishment still for--the other side."

Elinor lifted up her baby to her breast, raising herself with a new dignity, with her head
high. "I meant no punishment," she said, "I want none. I have left--what killed me--behind
me; many things, not one only. I have brought my boy away that he may never--never-- But if
it would be better that--another should be free--"

"I will never give my consent to it, Elinor."

"Nor I with my own mind; but if it is vindictive--if it is revenge, mother! I am not alone
to think of myself. If it were better for ---- that he should be free; speak to John about
it and tell me. I cannot, cannot discuss it. I will leave it all to John and you. It will kill
me! but what does that matter?--it is not revenge that I seek."

She turned with the baby pressed to her breast and walked away, her every movement showing
the strain and excitement of her soul.

"Why did you do this, John, without at least consulting me? You have thrown a new trouble into
her mind. She will never, never do this thing--nor would I permit it. There are some things
in which I must take a part. I could not forbid her marriage; God grant that I had had the
strength to do it--but this I will forbid, to expose her to the whole world, when everything
we have done has been with the idea of concealing what had happened. Never, never. I will never
consent to it, John."

"I had no intention of proposing such a step; but the other side--as we are bound to call him--are
frightened about it. And when I saw her look up, so young still, so sweet, with all her life
before her, and thought how she must spend it--alone; with no expanding, no development, in
this cottage or somewhere else, a life shipwrecked, a being so capable, so full of possibilities--lost."

"I have spent my life in this cottage," said Mrs. Dennistoun. "My husband died when I was thirty--my
life was over, and still I was young; but I had Elinor. There were some who pitied me too,
but their pity was uncalled for. Elinor will live like her mother, she has her boy."

"But it is different; you cannot but see the difference."

"Yes, I see it--it is different; but not so different that my Elinor's name should be placarded
about the streets and put in all the newspapers. Oh, never, never, John. If the man suffers,
it is his fault. She will suffer, and it is not her fault; but I will not, to release him,
drag my child before the world."

Mrs. Dennistoun was so much excited that she began to pace about the room, she who was usually
so sober and self restrained. She had borne much, but this she was unable even to contemplate
with calm. For once in her life she had arrived at something which she would not bear. John
felt his own position very strange sitting looking on as a spectator, while this woman, usually
so self-controlled, showed her impatience of circumstances and fate. It was ruefully comic
that this should be, so to speak, his doing, though he was the last in the world to desire
any exposure of Elinor, or to have any sympathy with those who sought justice for themselves
or revenge on others at such a cost.

"I was rash perhaps to speak as I did," he said; "I had no intention of doing it when I came.
It was a mere impulse, seeing Elinor: but you must know that I agree with you perfectly. I
see that Elinor's lot is fixed anyhow. I believe that no decree of a court would make any difference
to her, and she would not change the name that is the child's name. All that I recognise. And
one thing more, that neither you nor Elinor has recognised. They--he is afraid of any proceedings--I
suppose I may mention him to you. It's rather absurd, don't you think, speaking of a fellow
of that sort, or rather, not speaking of him at all, as if his name was sacred? He is afraid
of proceedings--whatever may be the cause."

"John, can't you understand that she cannot bear to speak of him, a man she so fought for,
against us all? And now her eyes are opened, she is undeceived, she knows him all through and
through, more, far more, than we do. She opened her mind to me once, and only once. It was
not that alone; oh, no, no. There are things that rankle more than that, something he did before
they were married, and made her help him to conceal. Something dishon--I can't say the word, John."

"Oh," said John, grimly, "you need not mind me."

"Well, the woman--I blush to have to speak to you even of such a thing--the woman, John, was
not the worst. She almost might, I think, have forgiven that. It was one thing after another,
and that, that first business the worst of all. She found it out somehow, and he had made her
take a part--I can't tell what. She would never open her lips on the subject again. Only that
once it all burst forth. Oh, divorce! What would that do to her, besides the shame? You understand
some things, John," said Mrs. Dennistoun, with a smile, "though you are a man. She would never
do anything to give herself a name different from her child's."

"Yes," said John, with a laugh, "I think I understand a thing or two, though, as you say, my
dear aunt, I am only a man. However, it is just as well I am that imperfect creature, to take
care of you. It understands the tactics of the wicked better than you do. And now you must
persuade Elinor and persuade yourself of what I came here on purpose to tell you--not to disturb
you, as I have been so unfortunate as to do. You are perfectly safe from him. I will not let
the enemy know your sentiments, or how decided you are on the subject. I will perhaps, if you
will let me, crack the whip a little over their heads, and keep them in a pleasing uncertainty.
But as long as he is afraid that she will take proceedings against him, he will take none,
you may be sure, against her. So you may throw aside all your precautions and be happy over
your treasure in your own way."

"Thank God for what you say, John; you take a weight off my heart. But happy--how can you speak
of being happy after such a catastrophe?"

"I thought I came in upon a very happy little scene. It might be only pretence, but it looked
uncommonly like the real thing."

"You mean the baby, John, the dear infant that knows no harm. He does take off our thoughts
a little, and enable us to bear----"

"Oh, aunt, don't be a hypocrite; that was never a fault of yours. Confess that with all your
misery about Elinor you are happy to have her here and her child--notwithstanding everything--happy
as you have not been for many a day."

She sat down by him and gave him her hand. "John, to be a man you have wonderful insight, and
it's I who am a very, very imperfect creature. You don't think worse of me to be glad to have
her, even though it is purchased by such misery and trouble? God knows," cried the poor lady,
drying her eyes, "that I would give her up to-morrow, and with joy, and consent never to see
her again, if that would be for her happiness. John! I've not thrust myself upon them, have
I, nor done anything against him, nor said a word? But now that she is here, and the baby,
and all to myself--which I never hoped--would I not be an ungrateful woman if I did not thank
God for it, John?"

"You are an excellent special pleader, aunt," he said, with a laugh, "as most women whom I
have known are: and I agree with you in everything. You behaved to them, while it was them,
angelically: you effaced yourself, and I fully believe you never said a word against him. Also,
I believe that if circumstances changed, if anything happened to make her see that she could
go back to him----"

Mrs. Dennistoun started in spite of herself, and pressed her hands together, with a half sob
of dismay.

"I don't think it likely, but if it were so, you would sacrifice yourself again--I haven't
a doubt of it. Why, then, set up this piece of humbug to me who know you so well, and pretend
that you are not very happy for the moment? You are, and you have a good right to be: and I
say enjoy it, my dear aunt; take all the good of it, you will have no trouble from him."

"You think so, you really think so, John?"

"I have no doubt of it: and you must persuade Elinor. Don't think I am making light of the
situation: you'll have plenty to trouble you no doubt, when that little shaver grows up----"

"John!"

"Well, he is a little shaver (whatever that may mean I'm sure I don't know), if he were a little
prince. When he grows up you will have your business laid out for you, and I don't envy you
the clearing up----"

"John don't speak as if a time would come when you would not stand by us. I mean stand by Elinor."

"Your first phrase was much the best. I will stand by you both as a matter of course."

"You must consider I shall be an old woman then; and who knows if I may live to see the poor
little darling grow up?"

"The poor little darling may never grow up, and none of us may live to see it. One prediction
is as good as another: but I think better things of you, aunt, than that you would go and die
and desert Elinor, unless 'so be as you couldn't help it,' as Pearson says. But, however, in
the meantime, dying of anybody is not in the question, and I hope both you and she will take
as much pleasure out of the baby and be as happy as circumstances will allow. And I'll tell
Pearson that there is no need for him to act the dragon--either the Bible one, whom he did
not think you would like to have about the house, or any other--for the danger is over. Trust
me at least for that."

"I trust you for everything, John; but," added Mrs. Dennistoun, "I wouldn't say anything to
Pearson. If you've told him to be a dragon, let him be a dragon still. I am sure you are right,
and I will tell Elinor so, and comfort her heart; but we may as well keep a good look out,
and our eyes about us, all the same."

"They are sure I am right, but think it better to go on as if I were wrong," John said to himself
as he went to dress for dinner. And while he went through this ceremony, he had a great many
thoughts--half-impatient, half-tender--of the wonderful ways of women which are so amazing
to men in general, as the ways of men are amazing to women, and will be so, no doubt, as long
as the world goes on. The strange mixture of the wise and the foolish, the altogether heroic,
and the involuntarily fictitious, struck his keen perception with a humourous understanding,
and amusement, and sympathy. That Mrs. Dennistoun should pose a little as a sufferer while
she was unmitigatedly happy in the possession of Elinor and the child, and be abashed when
she was forced to confess how ecstatic was the fearful joy which she snatched in the midst
of danger, was strange enough. But that Elinor, at this dreadful crisis of her life, when every
bond was rent asunder, and all that is ordinarily called happiness wrecked for ever, should
be moved to the kind of rapture he had seen in her face by the reaching out and curling in
of those little pink toes in the warm light of the fire, was inconceivable--a thing that was
not in any philosophy. She had made shipwreck of her life. She had torn the man whom she loved
out of her heart, and fled from his neglect and treachery--a fugitive to her mother's house.
And yet as she sat before the fire with this little infant cooing in the warmth--like a puppy
or a little pig, or any other little animal you can suggest--this was the thought of the irreverent
man--there was a look of almost more than common happiness, of blessedness, in her face. Who
can fathom these things? They were at least beyond the knowledge, though not the sympathy,
of this very rising member of the bar.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

Thus there came a sort of settling down and composure of affairs. Phil Compton and all belonging
to him disappeared from the scene, and Elinor returned to all the habits of her old life--all
the habits, with one extraordinary and incalculable addition which changed all these habits.
The baby--so inconsiderable a little creature, not able to show a feeling, or express a thought,
or make even a tremulous step from one pair of loving arms to another--an altogether helpless
little bundle, but nevertheless one who had already altered the existence of the cottage and
its inhabitants, and made life a totally different thing for them. Can I tell how this was
done? No doubt for the wisest objects, to guard the sacred seed of the race as mere duty could
never guard it, rendering it the one thing most precious in the world to those to whom it is
confided--at least to most of them. When that love fails, then is the deepest abyss of misery
reached. I do not say that Elinor was happy in this dreadful breaking up of her life, or that
her heart did not go back, with those relentings which are the worst part of every disruption,
to the man who had broken her heart and unsettled her nature. The remembrance of him in his
better moments would flash upon her, and bear every resentment away. Dreadful thoughts of how
she might herself have done otherwise, have rendered their mutual life better, would come over
her; and next moment recollections still more terrible of what he had done and said, the scorn
she had borne, the insults, the neglect, and worse of all the complicity he had forced upon
her, by which he had made her guilty when she knew and feared nothing--when these thoughts
overcame her, as they did twenty times in a day, for it is the worst of such troubles that
they will not be settled by one struggle, but come back and back, beginning over again at the
same point, after we have wrestled through them, and have thought that we had come to a close--when
these thoughts, I say, overcame her, she would rush to the room in which the baby held his
throne, and press him to the heart which was beating so hotly, till it grew calm. And in the
midst of all to sit down by the fire with the little atom of humanity in her lap, and see it
spread and stretch its rosy limbs, would suffice to bring again to her face that beatitude
which had filled John Tatham with wonder unspeakable. She took the baby and laid him on her
heart to take the pain away: and so after a minute or two there was no more question of pain,
but of happiness, and delicious play, and the raptures of motherhood. How strange were these
things! She could not understand it herself, and fortunately did not try, but accepted that
solace provided by God. As for Mrs. Dennistoun, she made no longer any pretences to herself,
but allowed herself, as John had advised, to take her blessedness frankly without hypocrisy.
When Elinor's dear face was veiled by misery her mother was sympathetically miserable, but
at all other moments her heart sang for joy. She had her child again, and she had her child's
child, an endless occupation, amusement, and delight. All this might come to an end--who can
tell when?--but for the moment her house was no more lonely, the requirements of her being
were satisfied. She had her Elinor--what more was to be said? And yet there was more to be
said, for in addition there was the boy.

This was very well so far as the interior of the house and of their living was concerned, but
very soon other difficulties arose. It had been Mrs. Dennistoun's desire, when she returned
home, to communicate some modified version of what had happened to the neighbours around. She
had thought it would not only be wise, but easier for themselves, that their position should
be understood in the little parish society which, if it did not know authoritatively, would
certainly inquire and investigate and divine, with the result of perhaps believing more than
the truth, perhaps setting up an entirely fictitious explanation which it would be impossible
to set aside, and very hard to bear. It is the worst of knowing a number of people intimately,
and being known by them from the time your children were in their cradles, that every domestic
incident requires some sort of explanation to this close little circle of spectators. But Elinor,
who had not the experience of her mother in such matters, nor the knowledge of life, made a
strenuous opposition to this. She would not have anything said. It was better, she thought,
to leave it to their imagination, if they chose to interfere with their neighbours' concerns
and imagine anything. "But why should they occupy themselves about us? And they have no imaginations,"
she said, with a contempt of her neighbours which is natural to young people, though very unjustifiable.
"But, my darling," Mrs. Dennistoun would say, "the position is so strange. There are not many
young women who--And there must be some way of accounting for it. Let us just tell them----"

"For heaven's sake, mamma, tell them nothing! I have come to pay you a long visit after my
neglect of you for these two years, which, of course, they know well enough. What more do they
want to know? It is a very good reason: and while baby is so young of course it is far better
for him to be in a settled home, where he can be properly attended to, than moving about. Isn't
that enough?"

"Well, Elinor; at least you will let me say as much as that----"

"Oh, they can surely make it out for themselves. What is the use of always talking a matter
over, to lead to a little more, and a little more, till the appetite for gossip is satisfied?
Surely, in our circumstances, least said is soonest mended," Elinor said, with that air of
superior understanding which almost always resides in persons of the younger generation. Mrs.
Dennistoun said no more to her, but she did take advantage of the explanation thus suggested.
She informed the anxious circle at the Rectory that Elinor had come to her on a long visit,
"partly for me, and partly for the baby," she said, with one of those smiles which are either
the height of duplicity or the most pathetic evidence of self-control, according as you choose
to regard them. "She thinks she has neglected her mother, though I am sure I have never blamed
her; and she thinks--of which there can be no doubt--that to carry an infant of that age moving
about from place to place is the worst thing in the world; and that I am very thankful she
should think so, I need not say."

"It is very nice for you, dear Mrs. Dennistoun," Mrs. Hudson said.

"And a good thing for Elinor," said Alice, "for she is looking very poorly. I have always heard
that fashionable life took a great deal out of you if you are not quite brought up to it. I
am sure I couldn't stand it," the young lady said with fervour, who had never had that painful
delight in her power.

"That is all very well," said the Rector, rubbing his hands, "but what does Mr. Compton say
to it? I don't want to say a word against your arrangements, my dear lady, but you know there
must be some one on the husband's side. Now, I am on the husband's side, and I am sorry for
the poor young man. I hope he is going to join his wife. I hope, excuse me for saying it, that
Elinor--though we are all so delighted to see her--will not forsake him, for too long."

And then Mrs. Dennistoun felt herself compelled to embroider a little upon her theme.

"He has to be a great deal abroad during this year," she said; "he has a great many things
to do. Elinor does not know when he will be--home. That is one reason----"

"To be sure, to be sure," the Rector said, rubbing his hands still more, and coming to her
aid just as she was breaking down. "Something diplomatic, of course. Well, we must not inquire
into the secrets of the State. But what an ease to his mind, my dear lady, to think that his
wife and child will be safe with you while he's away!"

Mary Dale not being present could not of course say anything. She was a person who was always
dreadfully well informed. It was a comfort unspeakable that at this moment she was away!

This explanation made the spring pass quietly enough, but not without many questions that brought
the blood to Elinor's face. When she was asked by some one, for the first time, "When do you
expect Mr. Compton, Elinor?" the sudden wild flush of colour which flooded her countenance
startled the questioner as much as the question did herself. "Oh, I beg your pardon!" said
the injudicious but perfectly innocent seeker for information. I fear that Elinor fell upon
her mother after this, and demanded to know what she had said. But as Mrs. Dennistoun was innocent
of anything but having said that Philip was abroad, there was no satisfaction to be got out
of that. Some time after, one of the Miss Hills congratulated Elinor, having seen in the papers
that Mr. Compton was returning to town for the season. "I suppose, dear Elinor, we shan't have
you with us much longer," this lady said. And then it became known at the Cottage that Mary
Dale was returning to the Rectory. This was the last aggravation, and Elinor, who had now recovered
her strength and energy, and temper along with it, received the news with an outburst of impatience
which frightened her mother. "You may as well go through the parish and ring the bell, and
tell everybody everything," she said. "Mary Dale will have heard all, and a great deal more
than all; she will come with her budget, and pour it out far and wide; she will report scenes
that never took place: and quarrels, and all that--that woman insinuated to John--and she will
be surrounded with people who will shake their heads, and sink their voices when we come in
and say, 'Poor Elinor!' I cannot bear it, I cannot bear it," she cried.

"My darling! that was bound to come sooner or later. We must set our faces like a rock, and
look as if we were unaware of anything----"

"I cannot look as if I were unaware. I cannot meet all their cruel eyes. I can see, now, the
smile on Mary Dale's face, that will say, 'I told you so.' I shall hear her say it even when
I am in my room, with the combe between. I know exactly how she will say it--'If Elinor had
listened to me----'"

"Elinor," said poor Mrs. Dennistoun, "I cannot contradict you, dear. It will be so--but none
of them are cruel, not even Mary Dale. They will make their remarks--who could help it? we
should ourselves if it were some one else's case: but they will not be cruel--don't think so--they
will be full of sympathy----"

"Which is a great deal worse," Elinor said, in her unreason; "the one might be borne, but the
other I will not endure. Sympathy, yes! They will all be sorry for me--they will say they knew
how it would be. Oh, I know I have not profited as I ought by what has happened to me. I am
unsubdued. I am as impatient and as proud as ever. It is quite true, but it cannot be mended.
It is more than I can bear."

"My darling," said her mother, again. "We all say that in our trouble, and yet we know that
we have got to bear it all the same. It is intolerable--one says that a thousand times--and
yet it has to be put up with. All the time that we have been flattering ourselves that nobody
took any notice it has been a delusion, Elinor. How could it be otherwise? We must set our
faces----"

"Not I, mamma!" she said. "Not I! I must go away----"

"Go away? Elinor!"

"Among strangers; where nobody has heard of me before--where nobody can make any remark. To
live like this, among a crowd of people who think they ought to know everything that one is
doing--who are nothing to you, and yet whom you stand in awe of and must explain everything
to!--it is this that is intolerable. I cannot, cannot bear it. Mother, I will take my baby,
and I will go away----"

"Where?" said Mrs. Dennistoun, with all the colour fading out of her face. What panic had taken
her I cannot tell. She grew pale to her lips, and the words were almost inaudible which she
breathed forth. I think she thought for a moment that Elinor's heart had turned, that she was
going back to her husband to find refuge with him from the strife of tongues which she could
not encounter alone. All the blood went back upon the mother's heart--yet she set herself to
suppress all emotion, and if this should be so, not to oppose it--for was it not the thing
of all others to be desired--the thing which everybody would approve, the reuniting of those
whom God had put together? Though it might be death to her, not a word of opposition would she say.

"Where? how can I tell where--anywhere, anywhere out of the world," cried Elinor, in the boiling
tide of her impatience and wretchedness, "where nobody ever heard of us before, where there
will be no one to ask, no one to require a reason, where we should be free to move when we
please and do as we please. Let me go, mother. It seemed too dear, too peaceful to come home,
but now home itself has become intolerable. I will take my baby and I will go--to the farthest
point the railway can take me to--with no servant to betray me, not even an address. Mother,
let me go away and be lost; let me be as if I had never been."

"And me--am I to remain to bear the brunt behind?"

"And you--mamma! Oh, I am the most unworthy creature. I don't deserve to have you, I that am
always giving you pain. Why should I unroot you from your place where you have lived so long--from
your flowers, and your landscape, and your pretty rooms that were always a comfort to think
of in that horrible time when I was away? I always liked to think of you here, happy and quiet,
in the place you had chosen."

"Flowers and landscapes are pretty things," said Mrs. Dennistoun, whose colour had begun to
come again a little, "but they don't make up for one's children. We must not do anything rashly,
Elinor; but if what you mean is really that you will go away to a strange place among strangers----"

"What else could I mean?" Elinor said, and then she in her turn grew pale. "If you thought
I could mean that I would go--back----"

"Oh, my darling, my darling! God knows if we are right or wrong--I not to advise you so, or
you not to take my advice. Elinor, it is my duty, and I will say it though it were to break
my heart. There only could you avoid this strife of tongues. John spoke the truth. He said,
as the boy grew up we should have--many troubles. I have known women endure everything that
their children might grow up in a natural situation, in their proper sphere. Think of this--I
am saying it against my own interest, against my own heart. But think of it, Elinor. Whatever
you might have to bear, you would be in your natural place."

Elinor received this agitated address standing up, holding her head high, her nostrils expanded,
her lips apart. "Have you quite done, mother?" she said.

Mrs. Dennistoun made an appealing movement with her hands, and sank, without any power to add
a word, into a chair.

"I am glad you said it against your heart. Now you must feel that your conscience is clear.
Mother, if I had to wander the world from place to place, without even a spot of ground on
which to rest my foot, I would never, never do what you say. What! take my child to grow up
in that tainted air; give him up to be taught such things as they teach! Never, never, never!
His natural place, did you say? I would rather the slums of London were his natural place.
He would have some chance there! If I could bear it for myself, yet I could not for him--for
him most of all. I will take him up in my arms. Thank God, I am strong now and can carry him--and
go away--among strangers, I don't care where--where there can be no questions and no remarks."

"But not without me, Elinor!"

"Oh, mother, mother! What a child I am to you, to rend your heart as I have done, and now to
tear you out of your house and home!"

"My home is where my children are," Mrs. Dennistoun said: and then she made a little pause.
"But we must think it over, Elinor. Such a step as this must not be taken rashly. We will ask
John to come down and advise us. My dear----"

"No, mother, not John or any one. I will go first if you like and find a place, and you will
join me after. That woman" (it was poor Mary Dale, who was indeed full of information, but
meant no harm) "is coming directly. I will not wait here to see her, or their faces after she
has told them all the lies she will have heard. I am not going to take advice from any one.
Let me alone, mother. I must, I must go away."

"But not by yourself, Elinor," Mrs. Dennistoun said.

This was how it happened that John Tatham, who had meant to go down to the Cottage the very
next Saturday to see how things were going, was driven into a kind of stupefaction one morning
in May by a letter which reached him from the North, a letter conveying news so unexpected
and sudden, so unlike anything that had seemed possible, that he laid it down, when it was
half read, with a gasp of astonishment, unable to believe his eyes.

CHAPTER XXIX.

It was Mrs. Dennistoun whose letter brought John Tatham such dismay. It was dated Lakeside,
Waterdale, Penrith--an address with which he had no associations whatever, and which he gazed
at blankly for a moment before he attempted to read the letter, not knowing how to connect
it with the well-known writing which was as familiar as the common day.

"You will wonder to see this address," she wrote. "You will wonder still more, dear John, when
I tell you we have come here for good. I have left the Cottage in an agent's hands with the
hope of letting it. Windyhill is such a healthy place that I hope somebody will soon be found
to take it. You know Elinor would not let me make any explanation. And the constant questions
and allusions to his movements which people had seen in the papers, and so forth, had got on
her nerves, poor child. You can understand how easily this might come about. At last she got
that she could not bear it longer. Mary Dale, who always lives half the year with her sister
at the Rectory, was coming back. You know it was she who brought the first tale about him,
and she knows, I think, all the gossip that ever was got up about any one. Poor Elinor--though
I don't believe Mary had any bad meaning; and it would, alas! have been for all our good had
we listened to what she said--Elinor cannot bear her; and when she heard she was coming, she
declared she would take her baby and go away. I tried to bring her to reason, but I could not.
Naturally it was she who convinced me--you know the process, John. Indeed, in many things I
can see it is the best thing we could do. I am not supremely attached to Windyhill. The Cottage
had got to be very homelike after living in it so long, but home is where those are whom one
loves. And to live among one set of people for so many years, if it has great advantages, has
at the same time very great disadvantages too. You can't keep anything to yourself. You must
explain every step you take, and everything that happens to you. This is a lovely country,
a little cold as yet, and a little damp perhaps, being so near the lake--but the mountains
are beautiful, and the air delicious. Elinor is out all the day long, and baby grows like a
flower. You must come and see us as soon as ever you can. That is one dreadful drawback, that
we shall not have you running up and down from Saturday to Monday: and I am afraid you will
be vexed with us that we did not take your advice first--you, who have always been our adviser.
But Elinor would not hear a word of any advice. I think she was afraid you would disapprove:
and it would have been worse to fly in your face if you had disapproved than to come away without
consulting you: and you know how impetuous she is. At all events the die is cast. Write kindly
to her; don't say anything to vex her. You can let yourself out, if you are very angry, upon me.

"One thing more. She desires that if you write you should address her as Mrs. Compton only,
no Honourable. That might attract attention, and what we desire is to escape notice altogether,
which I am sure is a thing you will thoroughly understand, now that we have transplanted ourselves
so completely. Dear John, form the most favourable idea you can of this sudden step, and come
and see us as soon as it is possible.

"Yours affectly., "M. D."

To say that John was thunderstruck by this letter is to describe his sensations mildly, for
he was for a time bitterly angry, wounded, disappointed, disturbed to the bottom of his soul;
but perhaps if truth were told it could scarcely be said that he disapproved. He thought it
over, which he naturally did all that day, to the great detriment of his work, first with a
sort of rage against Elinor and her impetuosity, which presently shaded down into understanding
of her feelings, and ended in a sense that he might have known it from the first, and that
really no other conclusion was possible. He came gradually to acquiesce in the step the ladies
had taken. To have to explain everything to the Hudsons, and Hills, and Mary Dales, to open
up your most sacred heart in order that they might be able to form a theory sufficient for
their outside purposes of your motives and methods, or, what was perhaps worse still--to know
that they were on the watch, guessing what you did not tell them, putting things together,
explaining this and that in their own way--would have been intolerable. "That is the good of
having attached friends," John exclaimed to himself, very unjustly: for it is human nature
that is to blame, if there is any blame attaching to an exercise of ingenuity so inevitable.
As a matter of fact, when Miss Dale brought the true or something like the true account to
Windyhill, the warmth of the sympathy for Elinor, the wrath of the whole community with her
unworthy husband, was almost impassioned. Had she been there it would not have been possible
for those good people altogether to conceal from her how sorry and how indignant they were;
even perhaps there might have been some who could not have kept out of their eyes, who must
have betrayed in some word or shake of the head the "I told you so" which is so dear to human
nature. But how was it possible that they could remain uninterested, unaffected by the trouble
in the midst of them, or even appear to be so? John, like Elinor, threw a fiery dart of impatience
at the country neighbours, not allowing that everywhere in the greatest town, in the most cosmopolitan
community, this would have been the same.

"The chattering gossips!" he said, as if a club would not have been a great deal worse, as
if indeed his own club, vaguely conscious of a connection by marriage between him and the dis-Honourable
Phil, had not discussed it all, behind his back, long ago.

But on the whole John was forced not to disapprove. To say that he went the length of approving
would be too much, and to deny that he launched forth a tremendous letter upon Mrs. Dennistoun,
who always bore the brunt, is more than my conscience would permit. He did do this, throwing
out, as the French say, fire and flame, but a few days after followed it up by a much milder
letter (need I say this was addressed to Elinor?), allowing that he understood their motives,
and that perhaps, from their own point of view, they were not so very much to blame. "You will
find it very damp, very cold, very different from Windyhill," he said, with a sort of savage
satisfaction. But as it happened to be unusually good weather among the lakes when his letter
came, this dart did not do much harm. And that John felt the revolution in his habits consequent
upon this move very much, it would be futile to deny. To have nowhere to go to freely when
he pleased from Saturday to Monday (he had at least a score of places, but none like the Cottage)
made a wonderful difference in his life. But perhaps when he came to think of it soberly, as
he did so often in the brilliant Saturday afternoons of early summer, when the sunshine on
the trees made his heart a little sick with the idea that he had, as he said to himself, nowhere
to go to, he was not sure that the difference was not on the whole to his advantage. A man
perhaps should not have it in his power to enjoy, in the most fraternal intimacy, the society
of another man's wife whenever he pleased, even if to her he was, as he knew, of as little
importance (notwithstanding that she was, as she would have said, so fond of John) as the postman,
say, or any other secondary (yet sufficiently interesting) figure in the country neighbourhood.
John knew in his heart of hearts that this was not a good thing nor a wholesome thing for him.
He was not a man, as has been said, who would ever have hurried events, or insisted upon appropriating
a woman, even when he loved her, and securing her as his very own. He would always have been
able to put that off, to subordinate it to the necessity of getting on in the world, and securing
his position: and he was by no means sure when he questioned his own heart (which was a thing
he did seldom, knowing, like a wise man, that that shifty subject often made queer revelations,
and was not at all an easy object to cross-examine), that the intercourse which he had again
dropped into with Elinor was not on the whole as much as he required. There was no doubt that
it kept him alive from one period to another; kept his heart moderately light and his mind
wonderfully contented--as nothing else had ever done. He looked forward to his fortnightly
or monthly visit to the Cottage (sometimes one, and sometimes the other; he never indulged
himself so far as to go every week), and it gave him happiness enough to tide over all the
dull moments between: and if anything came in his way and detained him even from his usual
to a later train, he was ridiculously, absurdly angry. What right had he to feel so in respect
to another man's wife? What right had he to watch the child--the child whom he disliked so
much to begin with--developing its baby faculties with an interest he was half ashamed of,
but which went on increasing? Another man's wife and another man's child. He saw now that it
was not a wholesome thing for him, and he could never have given it up had they remained. It
had become too much a part of his living; should he not be glad therefore that they had taken
it into their own hands, and gone away? When it suddenly occurred to John, however, that this
perhaps had some share in the ladies' hasty decision, that Mrs. Dennistoun perhaps (all that
was objectionable was attributed to this poor lady) had been so abominably clear-sighted, so
odiously presuming as to have suspected this, his sudden blaze of anger was foudroyant. Perhaps
she had settled upon it for his sake, to take temptation out of his way. John could scarcely
contain himself when this view of the case flashed upon him, although he was quite aware for
himself that though it was a bitter wrench, yet it was perhaps good for him that Elinor should
go away.

It was probably this wave of fierce and, as we are aware, quite unreasonable anger rushing
over him that produced the change which everybody saw in John's life about this time. It was
about the beginning of the season when people's enjoyments begin to multiply, and for the first
time in his life John plunged into society like a very novice. He went everywhere. By this
time he had made a great start in life, had been brought into note in one or two important
cases, and was, as everybody knew, a young man very well thought of, and likely to do great
things at the bar; so that he was free of many houses, and had so many invitations for his
Sundays that he could well afford to be indifferent to the loss of such a humble house as the
Cottage at Windyhill. Perhaps he wanted to persuade himself that this was the case, and that
there really was nothing to regret. And it is certain that he did visit a great deal during
that season at one house where there were two or three agreeable daughters; the house, indeed,
of Sir John Gaythorne, who was Solicitor-General at that time, and a man who had always looked
upon John Tatham with a favourable eye. The Gaythornes had a house near Dorking, where they
often went from Saturday to Monday with a few choice convives, and "picknicked," as they themselves
said, but it was a picknicking of a highly comfortable sort. John went down with them the very
Saturday after he received that letter--the Saturday on which he had intended to go to Windyhill.
And the party was very gay. To compare it for a moment with the humdrum family at the Cottage
would have been absurd. The Gaythornes prided themselves on always having pleasant people with
them, and they had several remarkably pleasant people that day, among whom John himself was
welcomed by most persons; and the family themselves were lively and agreeable to a high degree.
A distinguished father, a very nice mother, and three charming girls, up to everything and
who knew everybody; who had read or skimmed all the new books of any importance, and had seen
all the new pictures; who could talk of serious things as well as they could talk nonsense,
and who were good girls to boot, looking after the poor, and visiting at hospitals, in the
intervals of their gaieties, as was then the highest fashion in town. I do not for a moment
mean to imply that the Miss Gaythornes did their good work because it was the fashion: but
the fact that it is the fashion has liberated many girls, and allowed them to carry out their
natural wishes in that way, who otherwise would have been restrained and hampered by parents
and friends, who would have upbraided them with making themselves remarkable, if in a former
generation they had attempted to go to Whitechapel or St. Thomas's with any active intentions.
And Elinor had never done anything of this kind, any more than she had pursued music almost
as a profession, which was what Helena Gaythorne had done; or learned to draw, like Maud (who
once had a little thing in the Royal Academy); or studied the Classics, like Gertrude. John
thought of her little tunes as he listened to Miss Gaythorne's performance, and almost laughed
out at the comparison. He was very fond of music, and Miss Gaythorne's playing was something
which the most cultivated audience might have been glad to listen to. He was ashamed to confess
to himself that he liked the "tunes" best. No, he would not confess it even to himself; but
when he stood behind the performer listening, it occurred to him that he was capable of walking
all the miles of hill and hollow which divided the one place from the other, only for the inane
satisfaction of seeing that baby spread on Elinor's lap, or hearing her play to him one of
her "tunes."

He went with the Gaythornes to their country-place twice in the month of June, and dined at
the house several times, and was invited on other occasions, becoming, in short, one of the
habitués when there was anything going on in the house--till people began to ask, which was
it? It was thought generally that Helena was the attraction, for John was known to be a musical
man, always to be found where specially good music was going. Some friends of the family had
even gone so far as to say among themselves what a good thing it was that dear Helena's lot
was likely to be cast with one who would appreciate her gift. "It generally happens in these
cases that a girl marries somebody who does not know one note from another," they said to each
other. When, all at once, John flagged in his visits; went no more to Dorking; and finally
ceased to be more assiduous or more remarked than the other young men who were on terms of
partial intimacy at the Gaythorne house. He had, indeed, tried very hard to make himself fall
in love with one of Sir John's girls. It would have been an excellent connection, and the man
might think himself fortunate who secured any one of the three for his wife. Proceeding from
his certainty on these points, and also a general liking for their company, John had gone into
it with a settled purpose, determined to fall in love if he could: but he found that the thing
was not to be done. It was a pity; but it could not be helped. He was in a condition now when
it would no longer be rash to marry, and he knew now that there was the makings of a domestic
man in him. He never could have believed that he would take an interest in the sprawling of
the baby upon its mother's knee, and he allowed to himself that it might be sweet to have that
scene taking place in a house of his own. Ah! but the baby would have to be Elinor's. It must
be Elinor who should sit on that low chair with the firelight on her face. And that was impossible.
Helena Gaythorne was an exceedingly nice girl, and he wished her every success in life (which
she attained some time after by marrying Lord Ballinasloe, the eldest son of the Earl of Athenree,
a marriage which everybody approved), but he could not persuade himself to be in love with
her, though with the best will in the world.

During this time he did not correspond much with his relations in the country. He had, indeed,
some letters to answer from his father, in which the interrogatories were very difficult: "Where
has Mary Dennistoun gone? What's become of Elinor and her baby? Has that fashionable fellow
of a husband deserted her? What's the meaning of the move altogether?" And, "Mind you keep
yourself out of it," his father wrote. John had great trouble in wording his replies so as
to convey as little information as possible. "I believe Aunt Mary has got a house somewhere
in the North, probably to suit Elinor, who would be able to be more with her if she were in
that neighbourhood." (It must be confessed that he thought this really clever as a way of getting
over the question.) "As for Compton, I know very little about him. He was never a man much
in my way." Mr. Tatham's household saw nothing remarkable in these replies; upon which, however,
they built an explanation, such as it was, of the other circumstances. They concluded that
it must be in order to be near Elinor that Mrs. Dennistoun had gone to the North, and that
it was a very good thing that Elinor's husband was not a man who was in John's way. "A scamp,
if I ever saw one!" Mr. Tatham said. "But what's that Jack says about Gaythorne? Mary, I remember
Gaythorne years ago; a capital friend for a young man. I'm glad your brother's making such
nice friends for himself; far better than mooning about that wretched little cottage with Mary
Dennistoun and her girl."

CHAPTER XXX.

It happened thus that it was not till the second autumn after the settlement of the ladies
in Waterdale, when all the questions had died out, and there was no more talk of them, except
on occasions when a sudden recollection cropped up among their friends at Windyhill, that John
Tatham paid them his first visit. He had been very conscientious in his proposed bestowal of
himself. Perhaps it is scarcely quite complimentary to a woman when she is made choice of by
a man who is consciously to himself "on the outlook," thinking that he ought to marry, and
investigating all the suitable persons about with an eye to finding one who will answer his
requirements. This sensible way of approaching the subject of matrimony does not somehow commend
itself to our insular notions. It is the right way in every country except our own, but it
has a cold-blooded look to the Anglo-Saxon; and a girl is not flattered (though perhaps she
ought to be) by being the subject of this sensible choice. "As if I were a housekeeper or a
cook!" she is apt to say, and is far better pleased to be fallen in love with in the most rash
and irresponsible way than to be thus selected from the crowd: though that, everybody must
allow, after due comparison and inspection, is by far the greater compliment. John having arrived
at the conclusion that it would be better for him in many ways to marry, and specially in the
way of Elinor, fortifying him for ever from all possible complications, and making it possible
for him to regard her evermore with the placid feelings of a brother, which was, he expected,
to be the consequence--worked at the matter really with great pertinacity and consistency.
He kept his eyes open upon the whole generation of girls whom he met with in society. When
he went abroad during the long vacation (instead of going to Lakeside, as he was invited to
do), he directed his steps rather to the fashionable resorts, where families disport themselves
at the foot of the mountains, than to the Alpine heights where he had generally found a more
robust amusement. And wherever he went he bent his attention on the fairer portion of the creation,
the girls who fill all the hotels with the flutter of their fresh toilettes and the babble
of their pleasant voices. It was very mean and poor of him, seeing he was a mountaineer himself--but
still it must be recorded that the only young ladies he systematically neglected were those
in very short petticoats, with very sunburnt faces and nails in their boots, who ought to have
been most congenial to him as sharing his own tastes. It is said, I don't know with what truth,
that at Ouch, or Interlachen, or some other of the most mundane and banal resorts of the tourists,
he came upon one girl who he thought might make him a suitable wife: and that, though with
much moderation and prudence, he more or less followed her party for some time, meeting them
over and over again, with expressions of astonishment, round the most well-known corners, and
persisting for a considerable time in this quest. But whether he ever came the length of proposing
at all, or whether the young lady was engaged beforehand, or if she thought the prospect of
making a suitable wife not good enough, I cannot say, and I doubt whether any one knows--except,
of course, the parties immediately concerned. It is very clear, at all events, that it came
to nothing. John did not altogether give it up, I fancy, for he went a great deal into society
still, especially in that avant saison, which people who live in London declare to be the most
enjoyable, and when it is supposed you can enjoy the best of company at your ease without the
hurry and rush of the summer crowd. He would have been very glad, thankful, indeed, if he could
have fallen in love. How absurd to think that any silly boy can do it, to whom it is probably
nothing but a disadvantage and the silliest of pastimes, and that he, a reasonable man with
a good income, and arrived at a time of life when it is becoming and rational to marry, could
not do it, let him try as he would! There was something ludicrous in it, when you came to think,
as well as something very depressing. Mothers who wanted a good position for their daughters
divined him, and many of them were exceedingly civil to John, this man in search of a wife;
and many of the young ladies themselves divined him, and with the half indignation, half mockery,
appropriate to the situation, were some of them not unaverse to profit by it, and accordingly
turned to him their worst side in the self-consciousness produced by that knowledge. And thus
the second year turned round towards the wane, and John was farther from success than ever.

He said to himself then that it was clear he was not a marrying man. He liked the society of
ladies well enough, but not in that way. He was not made for falling in love. He might very
well, he was aware, have dispensed with the tradition, and found an excellent wife, who would
not at all have insisted upon it from her side. But he had his prejudices, and could not do
this. Love he insisted upon, and love would not come. Accordingly, when the second season was
over he gave up both the quest and the idea, and resolved to think of marrying no more, which
was a sensible relief to him. For indeed he was exceedingly comfortable as he was; his chambers
were excellent, and he did not think that any street or square in Belgravia would have reconciled
him to giving up the Temple. He had excellent servants, a man and his wife, who took the greatest
care of him. He had settled into a life which was arranged as he liked, with much freedom,
and yet an agreeable routine which John was too wise to despise. He relinquished the idea of
marrying then and there. To be sure there is never any prophesying what may happen. A little
laughing gipsy of a girl may banish such a resolution out of a man's mind in the twinkling
of an eye, at any moment. But short of such accidents as that, and he smiled at the idea of
anything of the kind, he quite made up his mind on this point with a great sensation of relief.

It is curious how determined the mind of the English public at least is on this subject--that
the man or woman who does not marry (especially the woman, by-the-bye) has an unhappy life,
and that a story which does not end in a wedding is no story at all, or at least ends badly,
as people say. It happened to myself on one occasion to put together in a book the story of
some friends of mine, in which this was the case. They were young, they were hopeful, they
had all life before them, but they did not marry. And when the last chapter came to the consciousness
of the publisher he struck, with the courage of a true Briton, not ashamed of his principles,
and refused to pay. He said it was no story at all--so beautiful is marriage in the eyes of
our countrymen. I hope, however, that nobody will think any harm of John Tatham because he
concluded, after considerable and patient trial, that he was not a marrying man. There is no
harm in that. A great number of those Catholic priests whom it was the habit in my youth to
commiserate deeply, as if they were vowed to the worst martyrdom, live very happy lives in
their celibacy and prefer it, as John Tatham did. It will be apparent to the reader that he
really preferred it to Elinor, while Elinor was in his power. And though afterwards it gave
a comfort and grace to his life to think that it was his faithful but subdued love for Elinor
which made him a bachelor all his days, I am by no means certain that this was true. Perhaps
he never would have made up his mind had she remained always within his reach. Certain it is
that he was relieved when he found that to give up the idea of marriage was the best thing
for him. He adopted the conclusion with pleasure. His next brother had already married, though
he was younger than John; but then he was a clergyman, which is a profession naturally tending
to that sort of thing. There was, however, no kind of necessity laid upon him to provide for
the continuance of the race. And he was a happy man.

By what sequence of ideas it was that he considered himself justified, having come to this
conclusion, in immediately paying his long-promised visit to Lakeside, is a question which
I need not enter into, and indeed do not feel entirely able to cope with. It suited him, perhaps,
as he had been so long a time in Switzerland last year: and he had an invitation to the far
north for the grouse, which he thought it would be pleasant to accept. Going to Scotland or
coming from it, Waterdale of course lies full in the way. He took it last on his way home,
which was more convenient, and arrived there in the latter part of September, when the hills
were golden with the yellow bracken. The Cumberland hills are a little cold, in my opinion,
without the heather, which clothes with such a flush of life and brightness our hills in the
north. The greenness is chilly in the frequent rain; one feels how sodden and slippery it is--a
moisture which does not belong to the heather: but when the brackens have all turned, and the
slopes reflect themselves in the tranquil water like hills of gold, then the landscape reaches
its perfect point. Lakeside was a white house standing out on a small projection at the head
of the lake, commanding the group of hills above and part of the winding body of water below,
in which all these golden reflections lay. A little steamer passed across the reflected glory,
and came to a stop not a hundred yards from the gate of the house. It was a scene as unlike
as could be conceived to the Cottage at Windyhill: the trees were all glorious in colour; yellow
birches like trees made of light, oaks all red and fiery, chestnuts and elms and beeches in
a hundred hues. The house was white, with a sort of broad verandah round, supported on pillars,
furnishing a sheltered walk below and a broad balcony above, which gave it a character of more
importance than perhaps its real size warranted. When John approached there ran out to meet
him into the wide gravel drive before the door a little figure upon two sturdy legs, calling
out, in inarticulate shoutings, something that sounded a little like his own name. It was,
"'tle John! 'tle John!" made into a sort of song by the baby, nearly two years old, and "very
forward," as everybody assured the stranger, for his age. Uncle John! his place was thus determined
at once by that little potentate and master of the house. Behind the child came Elinor, no
longer pale and languid as he had seen her last, but matured into vigorous beauty, bright-eyed,
a little sober, as might have become maturer years than hers. Perhaps there was something in
the style of her dress that favoured the idea, not of age indeed, but of matronly years, and
beyond those which Elinor counted. She was dressed in black, of the simplest description, not
of distinctive character like a widow's, yet something like what an ideal widow beyond fashion
or conventionalities of woe might wear. It seemed to give John the key-note of the character
she had assumed in this new sphere.

Mrs. Dennistoun, who had not changed in the least, stood in the open door. They gave him a
welcome such as John had not had, he said to himself, since he had seen them before. They were
unfeignedly glad to see him, not wounded (which, to think of afterwards, wounded him a little)
that he had not come sooner, but delighted that he was here now. Even when he went home it
was not usual to John to be met at the door in this way by all his belongings. His sister might
come running down the stairs when she heard the dog-cart draw up, but that was all. And Mary's
eagerness to see him was generally tempered by the advice she had to give, to say that or not
to say this, because of papa. But in the present case it was the sight of himself which was
delightful to all, and, above all, though the child could have no reason for it, to the little
shouting excited boy. "'Tle John! 'tle John!" What was Uncle John to him? yet his little voice
filled the room with shouts of joy.

"What does he know about me, the little beggar, that he makes such a noise in my honour?" said
John, touched in spite of himself. "But I suppose anything is good enough for a cry at that age."

"Come," said Elinor, "you are not to be contemptuous of my boy any longer. You called him it
when he was a baby."

"And what is he now?" said John, whose heart was affected by strange emotions, he, the man
who had just decided (with relief) that he was not a marrying man. There came over him a curious
wave of sensation which he had no right to. If he had had a right to it, if he had been coming
home to those who belonged to him, not distantly in the way of cousinship, but by a dearer
right, what sensations his would have been! But sitting at the corner of the fire (which is
very necessary in Waterdale in the end of September) a little in the shadow, his face was not
very clearly perceptible: though indeed had it been so the ladies would have thought nothing
but that John's kind heart was touched, as was so natural, by this sight.

"What is he now? Your nephew! Tell Uncle John what you are now," said Elinor, lifting her child
on her lap; at which the child between the kisses which were his encouragement and reward produced,
in a large infant voice, very treble, yet simulating hers, the statement, "Mamma's bhoy."

"Now, Elinor," said Mrs. Dennistoun, "he has played his part beautifully; he has done everything
you taught him. He has told you who he is and who Uncle John is. Let him go to his nursery now."

"Come up-stairs, Pippo. Mother will carry her boy," said Elinor. "They don't want us any more,
these old people. Say good-night to Uncle John, and come to bed."

"Dood-night, 'tle John," said the child; which, however, was not enough, for he tilted himself
out of his mother's arms and put his rosy face and open mouth, sweet but damp, upon John's
face. This kiss was one of the child's accomplishments. He himself was aware that he had been
good, and behaved himself in every way as a child should do, as he was carried off crowing
and jabbering in his mother's arms. He had formed a sort of little human bridge between them
when he made that dive from Elinor's arms upon John's face. Ah, heaven! if it had been the
other way, if the child and the mother had both been his!

"He has grown up very sweet. You may think we are foolish, John; but you can't imagine what
a delight that child is. Hasn't he grown up sweet?"

"If you call that grown up!"

"Oh, yes, I know he is only a baby still; but so forward for his age, such a little man, taking
care of his mother before he is two years old!"

"What did I hear her call him?" John asked, and it seemed to Mrs. Dennistoun that there was
something severe in the sound of his voice.

"He had to be Philip. It is a pretty name, though we may have reason to mourn the day--and
belongs to his family. We must not forget that he belongs to a known family, however he may
have suffered by it."

"Then you intend the child to know about his family? I am glad to hear it," said John, though
his voice perhaps was not so sweet as his words.

"Oh, John, that is quite another thing! to know about his family--at two! He has his mother--and
me to take care of them both, and what does he want more?"

"But he will not always be two," said John, the first moment almost of his arrival, before
he had seen the house, or said a word about the lake, or anything. She was so disappointed
and cast down that she made him no reply.

"I am a wretched croaker," he said, after a moment, "I know. I ought after all this time to
try to make myself more agreeable; but you must pardon me if this was the first thing that
came into my mind. Elinor is looking a great deal better than when I saw her last."

"Isn't she! another creature. I don't say that I am satisfied, John. Who would be satisfied
in such a position of affairs? but while the child is so very young nothing matters very much.
And she is quite happy. I do think she is quite happy. And so well--this country suits them
both perfectly. Though there is a good deal of rain, they are both out every day. And little
Pippo thrives, as you see, like a flower."

"That is a very fantastic name to give the child."

"How critical you are, John! perhaps it is, but what does it matter at his age? any name does
for a baby. Why, you yourself, as grave as you are now----"

"Don't, aunt," said John. "It is a grave matter enough as it appears to me."

"Not for the present; not for the present, John."

"Perhaps not for the present: if you prefer to put off all the difficulties till they grow
up and crush you. Have there been any overtures, all this time, from--the other side?"

"Dear John, don't overwhelm me all in a moment, in the first pleasure of seeing you, both with
the troubles that are behind and the troubles that are in front of us," the poor lady said.

CHAPTER XXXI.

The weather was fine, which was by no means always a certainty at Waterdale, and Elinor had
become a great pedestrian, and was ready to accompany John in his walks, which were long and
varied. It was rather a curious test to which to subject himself after the long time he had
been away, and the other tests through which he had gone. Never had he been so entirely the
companion of Elinor, never before had they spent so many hours together without other society.
At Windyhill, indeed, their interviews had been quite unrestrained, but then Elinor had many
friends and interests in the parish and outside of it, visits to pay and duties to perform.
Now she had her child, which occupied her mornings and evenings, but left her free for hours
of rambling among the hills, for long walks, from which she came back blooming with the fresh
air and breezes which had blown her about, ruffling her hair, and stirring up her spirits and
thoughts. Sometimes when there has been heavy and premature suffering there occurs thus in
the young another spring-time, an almost childhood of natural, it may be said superficial pleasure--the
power of being amused, and of enjoying every simple satisfaction without any arrière pensée
like a child. She had recovered her strength and vigour in the mountain air--and in that freedom
of being unknown, with no look ever directed to her which reminded her of the past, no question
which brought back her troubles, had blossomed out into that fine youthful maturity of twenty-six,
which has already an advantage over the earlier girlhood, the perfection of the woman grown.
Elinor had thought of many things and understood many things, which she had still regarded
with the high assumptions of ignorance three or four years ago. And poor John, who had tried
so hard to find himself a mate that suited him, who had studied so many girls more beautiful,
more accomplished than Elinor, in the hope of goading himself, so to speak, into love, and
had not succeeded--and who had felt so strongly that another man's wife must not occupy so
much of his thoughts, nor another man's child give him an unwilling pleasure which was almost
fatherly--poor John felt himself placed in a position more trying than any he had known before,
more difficult to steer his way through. He had never had so much of her company, and she did
not conceal the pleasure it was to her to have some one to walk with, to talk with, who understood
what she said and what she did not say, and was in that unpurchasable sympathy with herself
which is not to be got by beauty, or by will, or even by love itself, but comes by nature.
Elinor felt this with simple pleasure. Without any complicating suspicion, she said, "What
a brother John is! I always felt him so, but now more than ever." "You have been, so to speak,
brought up together," said Mrs. Dennistoun, whose mind was by no means so easy on the subject.
"That is the reason, I suppose," said Elinor, with happy looks.

But poor John said nothing of this kind. What he felt was that he might have spared himself
the trouble of all those researches of his; that to roam about looking for a young lady whom
he might--not devour, but learn to love, was pains as unnecessary as ever man took. He still
hugged himself, however, over the thought that in no circumstances would he have been a marrying
man; that if Elinor had been free he would have found plenty of reasons why they should remain
on their present terms and go no farther. As it was clear that they must remain on their present
terms, and could go no farther, it was certainly better that he should cherish that thought.

And curiously enough, though they heard so little from the outside world, they had heard just
so much as this, that John's assiduities to the Miss Gaythornes (which the reader may remember
was the first of all his attempts, and quite antiquated in his recollection) had occasioned
remarks, and he had not been many evenings at Lakeside before he was questioned on the subject.
Had it been true, or had he changed his mind or had the lady----? It vexed him that there was
not the least little opposition or despite in their tones, such as a man's female friends often
show towards the objects of his admiration, not from any feeling on their own part, except
that most natural one, which is surprised and almost hurt to find that, "having known me, he
could decline"--a feeling which, in its original expression, was not a woman's sentiment, but
a man's, and therefore is, I suppose, common to both sides. But the ladies at Lakeside did
not even betray this feeling. They desired to know if there had been anything in it--with smiles,
it is true; but Mrs. Dennistoun at the same time expressed her regret warmly.

"We were in great hopes something would come of it, John. Elinor has met the Gaythornes, and
thought them very nice; and if there is a thing in the world that would give me pleasure, it
would be to see you with a nice wife, John."

"I am sure I am much obliged to you, aunt; but there really was nothing in it. That is, I was
seized with various impulses on the subject, and rather agreed with you: but I never mentioned
the matter to any of the Miss Gaythornes. They are charming girls, and I don't suppose would
have looked at me. At the same time, I did not feel it possible to imagine myself in love with
any of them. That's quite a long time since," he added with a laugh.

"Then there have been others since then? Let us put him in the confessional, mother," cried
Elinor with a laugh. "He ought not to have any secrets of that description from you and me."

"Oh, yes, there have been others since," said John. "To tell the truth, I have walked round
a great many nice girls asking myself whether I shouldn't find it very delightful to have one
of them belonging to me. I wasn't worthy the least attractive of them all, I quite knew; but
still I am about the same as other men. However, as I've said, I never mentioned the matter
to any of them."

"Never?" cried Mrs. Dennistoun, feeling a hesitation in his tone.

He laughed a little, shamefaced: "Well, if you like, I will say hardly ever," he said. "There
was one that might, perhaps, have taken pity upon me--but fortunately an old lover of hers,
who was much more enterprising, turned up before anything decisive had been said."

"Fortunately, John?"

"Well, yes, I thought so. You see I am not a marrying man. I tried to screw myself up to the
point, but it was altogether, I am afraid, as a matter of principle. I thought it would be
a good thing, perhaps, to have a wife."

"That was a very cold-blooded idea. No wonder you--it never came to anything. That is not the
way to go about it," said Elinor with the ringing laugh of a child.

And yet her way of going about it had been far from a success. How curious that she did not
remember that!

"Yes," he said, "I am quite aware that I did not go about it in the right way, but then that
was the only way in which it presented itself to me; and when I had made up my mind at last
that it was a failure, I confess it was with a certain sense of relief. I suppose I was born
to live and die an old bachelor."

"Do not be so sure of that," said Elinor. "Some day or other, in the most unlooked-for moment,
the fairy princess will bound upon the scene, and the old bachelor will be lost."

"We'll wait quite contentedly for that day--which I don't believe in," he said.

Mrs. Dennistoun did not take any part in the later portion of this discussion; her smile was
feeble at the places where Elinor laughed. She said seriously after this fireside conference,
when he got up to prepare for dinner, putting her hand tenderly on his shoulder, "I wish you
had found some one you could have loved, John."

"So did I--for a time," he said, lightly. "But you see, it was not to be."

She shook her head, standing against the firelight in the dark room, so that he could not see
her face. "I wish," she said, "I wish--that I saw you with a nice wife, John."

"You might wish--to see me on the woolsack, aunt."

"Well--and it might come to pass. I shall see you high up--if I live long enough; but I wish
I was as sure of the other, John."

"Well," he said with a laugh, "I did my best; but there is no use in struggling against fate."

No, indeed! how very, very little use there was. He had kept away from them for nearly two
years; while he had done his best in the meantime to get a permanent tenant for his heart which
should prevent any wandering tendencies. But he had not succeeded; and now if ever a man could
be put in circumstances of danger it was he. If he did not appear in time for their walk Elinor
would call him. "Aren't you coming, John?" And she overflowed in talk to him of everything--excepting
always of that one dark passage in her life of which she never breathed a word. She asked him
about his work, and about his prospects, insisting upon having everything explained to her--even
politics, to which he had a tendency, not without ideas of their use in reaching the higher
ranks of his profession. Elinor entered into all with zest and almost enthusiasm. She wrapped
him up in her sympathy and interest. There was nothing he did that she did not wish to know
about, did not desire to have a part in. A sister in this respect is, as everybody knows, often
more full of enthusiasm than a wife, and Elinor, who was vacant of all concerns of her own
(except the baby) was delighted to take up these subjects of excitement, and follow John through
them, hastening after him on every line of indication or suggestion which he gave--nay, often
with her lively intelligence hastening before him, making incursions into undiscovered countries
of which he had not yet perceived the importance. They walked over all the country, into woods
which were a little damp, and up hill-sides where the scramble was often difficult enough,
and along the side of the lake--or, for a variety, went rowing across to the other side, or
far down the gleaming water, out of sight, round the wooded corner which, with all its autumnal
colours, blazed like a brilliant sentinel into the air above and the water below. Mrs. Dennistoun
watched them, sometimes with a little trouble on her face. She would not say a word to throw
suspicions or doubts between them. She would not awaken in Elinor's mind the thought that any
such possibilities as arise between two young people free of all bonds could be imagined as
affecting her and any man such as her cousin John. Poor John! if he must be the victim, the
victim he must be. Elinor could not be disturbed that he might go free. And indeed, what good
would it have done to disturb Elinor? It would but have brought consciousness, embarrassment,
and a sense of danger where no such sense was. She was trebly protected, and without a thought
of anything but the calm yet close relations that had existed so long. He---- but he could
take care of himself, Mrs. Dennistoun reflected in despair; he must take care of himself. He
was a man and must understand what his own risks and perils were.

"And do you think this plan is a success?" John asked her one day as they were rowing homeward
up the lake. The time of his visit was drawing to a close; indeed it had drawn to a close several
times, and been lengthened very unadvisedly, yet very irresistibly as he felt.

Her face grew graver than usual, as with a sudden recollection of that shadow upon her life
which Elinor so often seemed to have forgotten. "As much of a success," she said, "as anything
of the kind is likely to be."

"It suits you better than Windyhill?"

"Only in being more out of the world. It is partially out of the world for a great part of
the year; but I suppose no place is so wholly. It seems impossible to keep from making acquaintances."

"Of course," he said, "I have noticed. You know people here already."

"How can we keep from knowing people? Mamma says it is the same thing everywhere. If we lived
up in that little house which they say is the highest in England--at the head of the pass--we
should meet people I suppose even there."

"Most likely," he replied; "but the same difficulties can hardly arise."

"You mean we shall not know people so well as at--at home, and will not be compelled to give
an account of ourselves whatever we do? Heaven knows! There is a vicarage here, and there is
a squire's house: and there are two or three people besides who already begin to inquire if
we are related to So-and-So, if we are the Scotch Dennistouns, or the Irish Comptons, or I
don't know what; and whether we are going to Penrith or any other capital city for the winter."
Elinor ended with a laugh.

"So soon?" John said.

"So soon--very much sooner, the first year: with mamma so friendly as she is and with me so
silly, unable to keep myself from smiling at anybody who smiles at me!"

"Poor Elinor!"

"Oh, you may laugh; but it is a real disadvantage. I am sure there was not very much smile
in me when we came; and yet, notwithstanding, the first pleasant look is enough for me, I cannot
but respond; and I shall always be so, I suppose," she said, with a sigh.

"I hope so, Elinor. It would be an evil day for all of us if you did not respond."

"For how many, John? For my mother and--ah, you are so good, more like my brother than my cousin--for
you, perhaps, a little; but what is it to anybody else in the world whether I smile or sigh?
It does not matter, however," she said, flinging back her head; "there it is, and I can't help
it. If you smile at me I must smile back again--and so we make friends; and already I get a
great deal of advice about little Pippo. If we live here till he grows up, the same thing will
happen as at the Cottage. We will require to account to everybody for what we do with him--for
the school he goes to, and all he does; to explain why he has one kind of training or another;
and, in short, all that I ran away from: the world wherever one goes seems to be so much the same."

"The world is very much the same everywhere; and you cannot get out of it were you to take
refuge in a cave on the hill. The best thing is generally to let it know all that can be known,
and so save the multitude of guesses it always makes."

Elinor looked at him for a moment with her lips pressed tightly together, and a light in her
eyes; then she looked away across the water to the golden hills, and said nothing; but there
was a great deal in that look of eager contradiction, yet forced agreement, of determination
above all, with which right and wrong had nothing to do.

"Elinor," he said, "do you mean that child to grow up here between your mother and you--in
ignorance of all that there is in the world besides you two?"

"That child!" she cried. "John, I think you dislike my boy; for, of course, it is Pippo you mean."

"I wish you would not call him by that absurd name."

"You are hard to please," she said, with an angry laugh. "I think it is a very sweet little name."

"The child will not always be a baby," said John.

"Oh, no: I suppose if we all live long enough he will some time be a--possibly disagreeable
man, and punish us well for all the care we have spent upon him," Elinor said.

"I don't want to make you angry, Elinor----"

"No, I don't suppose you do. You have been very nice to me, John. You have neither scolded
me nor given me good advice. I never expected you would have been so forbearing. But I have
always felt you must mean to give me a good knock at the end."

"You do me great injustice," he said, much wounded. "You know that I think only of what is
best for you--and the child."

They were approaching the shore, and Mrs. Dennistoun's white cap was visible in the waning
light, looking out for them from the door. Elinor said hastily, "And the child? I don't think
that you care much for the child."

"There you are mistaken, Elinor. I did not perhaps at first: but I acknowledge that a little
thing like that does somehow creep into one's heart."

Her face, which had been gloomy, brightened up as if a sunbeam had suddenly burst upon it.
"Oh, bless you, John--Uncle John; how good and how kind, and what a dear friend and brother
you are! And I such a wretch, ready to quarrel with those I love best! But, John, let me keep
quiet, let me keep still, don't make me rake up the past. He is such a baby, such a baby! There
cannot be any question of telling him anything for years and years!"

"I thought you were lost," said Mrs. Dennistoun, calling to them. "I began to think of all
kinds of things that might have happened--of the steamboat running into you, or the boat going
on a rock, or----"

"You need not have had any fear when I was with John," Elinor said, with a smile that made
him warm at once, like the sun. He knew very well, however, that it was only because he had
made that little pleasant speech about her boy.

CHAPTER XXXII.

There passed after this a number of years of which I can make no record. The ladies remained
at Lakeside, seldom moving. When they took a holiday now and then, it was more for the sake
of the little community which, just as in Windyhill, had gathered round them, and which inquired,
concerned, "Are you not going to take a little change? Don't you think, dear Mrs. Dennistoun,
your daughter would be the better for a change? Do you really think that a little sea air and
variety wouldn't be good for the boy?" Forced by these kind speeches they did go away now and
then to unknown seaside places in the north when little Philip was still a child, and to quiet
places abroad when he grew a boy, and it was thought a good thing for him to learn languages,
and to be taught that there were other countries in the world besides England. They were absent
for one whole winter in France and another in Germany with this motive, that Philip should
learn these languages, which he did tant bien que mal with much assistance from his mother,
who taught herself everything that she thought the boy should know, and shared his lessons
in order to push him gently forward. And on the whole, he did very well in this particular
of language, showing much aptitude, though not perhaps much application. I would not assert
that the ladies, with an opinion very common among women, and also among youth in general,
did not rather glory in the thought that he could do almost anything he liked (which was their
opinion, and in some degree while he was very young, the opinion of his masters), with the
appearance of doing nothing at all. But on the whole, his education was the most difficult
matter in which they had yet been engaged. How was he to be educated? His birth and condition
pointed to one of the great public schools, and Mrs. Dennistoun, who had made many economics
in that retirement, was quite able to give the child what they both called the best education.
But how could they send him to Eton or Harrow? A boy who knew nothing about his parentage or
his family, a boy bearing a well-known name, who would be subject to endless questions where
he came from, who he belonged to? a hundred things which neither in Waterdale nor in their
travels had ever been asked of him. What the Waterdale people thought on the subject, or how
much they knew, I should not like to inquire. There are ways of finding out everything, and
people who possess family secrets are often extraordinarily deceived in respect to what is
known and what is not known of those secrets. My own opinion is that there is scarcely such
a thing as a secret in the world. If any moment of great revolution comes in your life you
generally find that your neighbours are not much surprised. They have known it, or they have
suspected it, all along, and it is well if they have not suspected more than the truth. So
it is quite possible that these excellent people knew all about Elinor: but Elinor did not
think so, which was the great thing.

However, there cannot be any question that Philip's education was a very great difficulty.
John Tatham, who paid them a visit soberly from time to time, but did not now come as of old,
never indeed came as on that first occasion when he had been so happy and so undeceived. To
be sure, as Philip grew up it was of course impossible for any one to be like that. From the
time Pippo was five or six he went everywhere with his mother, her sole companion in general,
and when there was a visitor always making a third in the party, a third who was really the
first, for he appealed to his mother on every occasion, directed her attention to everything.
He only learned with the greatest difficulty that it was possible she should find it necessary
to give her attention in a greater degree to any one else. When she said, "You know, Pippo,
I must talk to Uncle John," Pippo opened his great eyes, "Not than to me, mamma?"

"Yes, dearest, more than to you for the moment: for he has come a long way to see us, and he
will soon have to go away again." When this was first explained to him, Pippo inquired particularly
when his Uncle John was going away, and was delighted to hear that it was to be very soon.
However, as he grew older the boy began to take great pleasure in Uncle John, and hung upon
his arm when they went out for their walks, and instead of endeavouring to monopolise his mother,
turned the tables upon her by monopolising this the only man who belonged to him, and to whom
he turned with the instinct of budding manhood. John too was very willing to be thus appropriated,
and it came to pass that now and then Elinor was left out, or left herself out of the calculation,
urging that the walk they were planning was too far for her, or too steep for her, or too something,
so that the boy might have the enjoyment of the man's society all to himself. This changed
the position in many ways, and I am not sure that at first it did not cost Elinor a little
thus to stand aside and put herself out of that first place which had always been by all of
them accorded to her. But if this was so, it was soon lost in the consideration of how good
it was for Pippo to have a man like John to talk to and to influence him in every way. A man
like John! That was the thing; not a common man, not one who might teach him the baseness,
or the frivolity, or the falsehood of the world, but a good man, who was also a distinguished
man, a man of the world in the best sense, knowing life in the best sense, and able to modify
the boy's conception of what he was to find in the world, as women could never do.

"For after all that can be said, we are not good for much on those points, mother," Mrs. Compton
would say.

"I don't know, Elinor; I doubt whether I would exchange my own ideas for John's," the elder
lady replied.

"Ah, perhaps, mother; but for Pippo his experience and his knowledge will do so much. A boy
should not be brought up entirely with women any more than a girl should be with men."

"I have often thought, my dear," said Mrs. Dennistoun, "if in God's providence it had been
a girl instead of a boy----"

"Oh!" said the younger mother, with a flush, "how can you speak--how could you think of any
possible child but Pippo? I would not give him for a score of girls."

"And if he had been a girl you would not have changed him for scores of boys," said Mrs. Dennistoun,
who added after a while, with a curious sense of competition, and a determination to allow
no inferiority, "You forget, Elinor, that my only child is a girl." The elder lady (whom they
began to call the old lady) showed a great deal of spirit in defence of her own.

But Philip was approaching fourteen, and the great question had to be decided now or never;
where was he to be sent to school? It was difficult now to send him to bed to get him out of
the way, he who was used to be the person of first importance in the house--in order that the
others might settle what was to be his fate. And accordingly the two ladies came down-stairs
again after the family had separated in the usual way, in order to have their consultation
with their adviser. There was now a room in the house furnished as a library in order that
Philip might have a place in which to carry on his studies, and where "the gentlemen" might
have their talks by themselves, when there was any one in the house. And here they found John
when they stole in one after the other, soft-footed, that the boy might suspect no complot.
They had their scheme, it need not be doubted, and John had his. He pronounced at once for
one of the great public schools, while the ladies on their part had heard of one in the north,
an old foundation as old as Eton, where there was at the moment a head master who was quite
exceptional, and where boys were winning honours in all directions. There Pippo would be quite
safe. He was not likely to meet with anybody who would put awkward questions, and yet he would
receive an education as good as any one's. "Probably better," said Elinor: "for Mr. Sage will
have few pupils like him, and therefore will give him the more attention."

"That means," said John, "that the boy will not be among his equals, which is of all things
I know the worst for a boy."

"We are not aristocrats, as you are, John. They will be more than his equal in one way, because
many of them will be bigger and stronger than he, and that is what counts most among boys.
Besides, we have no pretensions."

"My dear Elinor," said John Tatham (who was by this time an exceedingly successful lawyer,
member for his native borough, and within sight of a Solicitor-Generalship), "your modesty
is a little out of character, don't you think? There can be no two opinions about what the
boy is: an aristocrat--if you choose to use that word, every inch of him--a little gentleman,
down to his fingers' ends."

"Oh, thank you, John," cried Pippo's inconsistent mother; "that is the thing of all others
that we hoped you would say."

"And yet you are going to send him among the farmers' sons. Fine fellows, I grant you, but
not of his kind. Have you heard," he said, more gravely, "that Reginald Compton died last year?"

"We saw it in the papers," said Mrs. Dennistoun. Elinor said nothing, but turned her head away.

"And neither of the others are married, or likely to marry; one of them is very much broken
down----"

"Oh, John, John, for God's sake don't say anything more!"

"I must, Elinor. There is but one good life, and that in a dangerous climate, and with all
the risks of possible fighting, between the boy and----"

"Don't, don't, John!"

"And he does not know who he is. He is ignorant of everything, even the fact, the great fact,
which you have no right to keep from him----"

"John," she cried, starting to her feet, "the boy is mine: I have a right to deal with him
as I think best. I will not hear a word you have to say."

"It is vain to say anything," said Mrs. Dennistoun; "she will not hear a word."

"That is all very well, so far as she is concerned," said John, "but I have a part of my own
to play. You give me the name of adviser and so forth--a man cannot be your adviser if his
mouth is closed before he speaks. I have a right to speak, being summoned for that purpose.
I tell you, Elinor, that you have no right to conceal from the boy who he is, and that his
father is alive."

She gave a cry as if he had struck her, and shrank away behind her mother, hiding her face
in her hands.

"I am, more or less, of your opinion, John. I have told her the same. While he was a baby it
mattered nothing, now that he is a rational creature with an opinion of his own, like any one
of us----"

"Mother," cried Elinor, "you are unkind. Oh, you are unkind! What did it matter so long as
he was a baby? But now he is just at the age when he would be--if you don't wish to drive me
out of my senses altogether, don't say a word more to me of this kind."

"Elinor," said John, "I have said nothing on the subject for many years, though I have thought
much: and you must for once hear reason. The boy belongs--to his father as much as to you.
I have said it! I cannot take it back. He belongs to the family of which he may one day be
the head. You cannot throw away his birthright. And think, if you let him grow up like this,
not knowing that he has a family or a--unaware whom he belongs to."

"Have you done, John?" asked Elinor, who had made two or three efforts to interrupt, and had
been beating her foot impatiently upon the ground.

"If you ask me in that tone, I suppose I must say yes: though I have a great deal more that
I should like to say."

"Then hear me speak," cried Elinor. "Of us three at least, I am the only one to whom he belongs.
I only have power to decide for him. And I say, No, no: whatever argument there may be, whatever
plea you may bring forward, No and no, and after that No! What! at fourteen, just the age when
anything that was said to him would tell the most; when he would learn a lesson the quickest,
learn what I would die to keep him from! When he would take everything for gospel that was
said to him, when the very charm of--of that unknown name----"

She stopped for a moment to take breath, half choked by her own words.

"And you ought to remember no one has ever laid claim to him. Why should I tell him of one
that never even inquired---- No, John, no, no, no! A baby he might have been told, and it would
have done him no harm. Perhaps you were right, you and mother, and I was wrong. He might have
known it from the first, and thought very little of it, and he may know when he is a man, and
his character is formed and he knows what things mean--but a boy of fourteen! Imagine the glamour
there would be about the very name; how he would feel we must all have been unjust and the--the
other injured. You know from yourself, John, how he clings to you--you who are only a cousin;
he knows that, yet he insists upon Uncle John, the one man who belongs to him, and looks up
to you, and thinks nothing of any of us in comparison. I like it! I like it!" cried Elinor,
dashing the tears from her eyes. "I am not jealous: but fancy what it would be with the--other,
the real, the---- I cannot, cannot, say the word; yes, the father. If it is so with you, what
would it be with him?"

John listened with his head bent down, leaning on his hand: every word went to his heart. Yes,
he was nothing but a cousin, it was true. The boy did not belong to him, was nothing to him.
If the father stepped in, the real father, the man of whom Philip had never heard, in all the
glory of his natural rights and the novelty and wonder of his existence, how different would
that be from any feeling that could be raised by a cousin, an uncle, with whom the boy had
played all his life! No doubt it was true: and Phil Compton would probably charm the inexperienced
boy with his handsome, disreputable grace, and the unknown ways of the man of the world. And
yet, he thought to himself, there is a perspicacity about children which is not always present
in a man. Philip had no precocious instincts to be tempted by his father's habits; he had the
true sight of a boy trained amid everything that was noble and pure. Would it indeed be more
dangerous now, when the boy was a boy, with all those safeguards of nature, than when he was
a man? John kept his mind to this question with the firmness of a trained intelligence, not
letting himself go off into other matters, or pausing to feel the sting that was in Elinor's
words, the reminder that though he had been so much, he was still nothing to the family to
whom he had consecrated so much of his life, so much now of his thoughts.

"I do not think I agree with you, Elinor," he said at last. "I think it would have been better
had he always known that his father lived, and who he was, and what family he belonged to;
that is not to say that you were to thrust him into his father's arms. And I think now that,
though we cannot redeem the past, it should be done as soon as possible, and that he should
know before he goes to school. I think the effect will be less now than if the discovery bursts
upon him when he is a young man, when he finds, perhaps, as may well be, that his position
and all his prospects are changed in a moment, when he may be called upon without any preparation
to assume a name and a rank of which he knows nothing."

"Not a name. He has always borne his true name."

"His true name may be changed at any moment, Elinor. He may become Lord Lomond, and the heir----"

"My dear," said Mrs. Dennistoun, growing red, "that is a chance we have never taken into account."

"What has that to do with it?" she said. "Is his happiness and his honour to be put in comparison
with a chance, a possibility that may never come true? John, for the sake of everything that
is good, let him wait till he is a man and knows good from evil."

"It is that I am thinking of, Elinor; a boy of fourteen often knows good from evil much better
than a youth of twenty-one, which is, I suppose, what you call a man. My opinion is that it
would be better and safer now."

"No!" she said. "And no! I will never consent to it. If you go and poison my boy's mind I will
never forgive you, John."

"I have no right to do anything," he said; "it is of course you who must decide, Elinor: I
advise only; and I might as well give that up," he added, "don't you think? for you are not
to be guided by me."

And she was of course supreme in everything that concerned her son. John, when he could do
no more, knew how to be silent, and Mrs. Dennistoun, if not so wise in this respect, was yet
more easily silenced than John. And Philip Compton went to the old grammar-school among the
dales, where was the young and energetic head-master, who, as Elinor anticipated, found this
one pupil like a pearl among the pebbles of the shore, and spared no pains to polish him and
perfect him in every way known to the ambitious schoolmaster of modern times.

CHAPTER XXXIII.

It is needless to say that the years which developed Elinor's child into a youth on the verge
of manhood, had not passed by the others of the family without full evidence of its progress.
John Tatham was no longer within the elastic boundaries of that conventional youth which is
allowed to stretch so far when a man remains unmarried. He might have been characterized as
encore jeune, according to the fine distinction of our neighbours in France, had he desired
it. But he did not desire it. He had never altogether neglected society, having a wholesome
liking for the company of his fellow creatures, but neither had he ever plunged into it as
those do who must keep their places in the crowd or die. John had pursued the middle path,
which is the most difficult. He had cultivated friends, not a mob of acquaintances, although
as people say he "knew everybody," as a man who had attained his position and won his success
could scarcely fail to do. He had succeeded indeed, not in the fabulous way that some men do,
but in a way which most men in his profession looked upon as in the highest degree satisfactory.
He had a silk gown like any dowager. He had been leading counsel in many cases which were now
of note. He was among, not the two or three perhaps, but the twenty or thirty, who were at
the head of his profession. If he had not gone further it was perhaps more from lack of ambition
than from want of power. He had been for years in Parliament, but preferred his independence
to the chance of office. It is impossible to tell how John's character and wishes might have
been modified had he married and had children round him like other men. Had the tall boy in
the north, the young hero of Lakeside, been his, what a difference would that have made in
his views of life! But Philip was not his, nor Philip's mother--probably, as he always said
to himself, from his own fault. This, as the reader is aware, had always been fully recognised
by John himself. Perhaps in the old days, in those days when everything was possible, he had
not even recognised that there was but one woman in the world whom he could ever wish to marry.
Probably it was only her appropriation by another that revealed this fact to him. There are
men like this to be found everywhere; not so hotly constituted as to seize for themselves what
is most necessary for their personal happiness--possessed by so many other subjects that this
seems a thing to be thought of by-and-by--which by-and-by is generally too late.

But John Tatham was neither a disappointed nor an unhappy man. He might have attained a higher
development and more brilliant and full life, but that was all; and how few men are there of
whom this could not be said! He had become Mr. Tatham of Tatham's Cross, as well as Q.C. and
M.P., a county gentleman of modest but effective standing, a lawyer of high reputation, quite
eligible either for the bench or for political elevation, had he cared for either, a member
of Parliament with a distinct standing, and therefore importance of his own. There was probably
throughout England no society in which he could have found himself where his position and importance
would have been unknown. He was a man approaching fifty, who had not yet lost any of the power
of enjoyment or begun to feel the inroads of decay, at the very height of life, and unconscious
that the ground would shortly begin to slope downwards under his feet; indeed, it showed no
such indication as yet, and probably would not do so for years. The broad plateau of middle
age lasts often till sixty, or even beyond. There was no reason to doubt that for John Tatham
it would last as long as for any man. His health was perfect, and his habits those of a man
whose self had never demanded indulgences of the vulgar kind. He had given up with some regret,
but years before, his chambers in the Temple: that is, he retained them as chambers, but lived
in them no longer. He had a house in one of the streets about Belgrave Square, one of those
little bits of awkward, three-cornered streets where there are some of the pleasantest houses
of a moderate kind in London; furnished from top to bottom, the stairs, the comfortable quaint
landings, the bits of corridor and passage, nothing naked or neglected about it--no cold corner;
but nothing fantastic; not very much ornament, a few good pictures, a great deal of highly-polished,
old-fashioned dark mahogany, with a general flavour of Sherraton and Chippendale: and abundance
of books everywhere. John was able to permit himself various little indulgences on which wives
are said to look with jealous eyes. He had a fancy for rare editions (in which I sympathise)
and also for bindings, which seems to me a weakness--however, it was one which he indulged
in moderation. He possessed in his drawing-room (which was not very much used) a beautiful
old-fashioned harpsichord, and also he had belonging to him a fiddle of value untold. I ought,
of course, to say violin, or rather to distinguish the instrument by its family name; I have
no doubt it was a Stradivarius. But there is an affectionate humour in the fiddle which does
not consist with fine titles. He had always been fond of music, but even the Stradivarius did
not beguile him, in the days of which I speak, to play, nor perhaps was his performance worthy
of it, though his taste was said to be excellent. It will be perceived by all this that John
Tatham's life had many pleasures.

And I am not myself sorry for him because he was not married, as many people will be. Perhaps
it is a little doleful coming home, when there is never anybody looking out for you, expecting
you. But then he had never been accustomed to look for that, and the effect might have been
irksome rather than pleasant. His household went on velvet under the care of a respectable
couple who had "done for" Mr. Tatham for years. He would not have submitted to extortion or
waste, but everything was ample in the house; the cook by no means stinted in respect to butter
or any of those condiments which are as necessary to good cooking as air is to life. Mr. Tatham
would not have understood a lack of anything, or that what was served to him should not have
been the best, supplied and served in the best way. Failure on such points would have so much
surprised him that he would scarcely have known what steps to take. But Jervis, his butler,
knew what was best as well as Mr. Tatham did, and was quite as little disposed to put up with
any shortcoming. I say I am not sorry for him that he was not married--up to this time. But,
as a matter of fact, the time does come when one becomes sorry for the well-to-do, highly respectable,
refined, and agreeable man who has everything that heart can desire, except the best things
in life--love, and the companionship of those who are his very own. When old age looms in sight
everything is changed. But Mr. Tatham, as has been said, was not quite fifty, and old age seemed
as far off as if it could never be.

He was a man who was very good to a number of people, and spent almost as much money in being
kind as if he had possessed extravagant children of his own. His sister Mary, for instance,
had married a clergyman not very well off, and the natural result had followed. How they could
have existed without Uncle John, much less how they could have stumbled into public schools,
scholarships, and all the rest of it, would be difficult to tell, especially now in these days
when a girl's schooling ought, we are told, to cost as much as a boy's. This latter is a grievance
which must be apparent to the meanest capacity. Unless the girl binds herself by the most stringent
vows not to marry a poor curate or other penniless man the moment that you have completed her
expensive education, I do not think she should in any case be permitted to go to Girton. It
is all very well when the parents are rich or the girls have a sufficiency of their own. But
to spend all that on a process which, instead of fructifying in other schools and colleges,
or producing in life a highly accomplished woman, is to be lost at once and swallowed up in
another nursery, is the most unprofitable of benefactions. This is what Mary Tatham's eldest
girl had just done, almost before her bills at Newnham had been paid. A wedding present had,
so to speak, been demanded from Uncle John at the end of the bayonet to show his satisfaction
in the event which had taken all meaning out of his exertions for little Mary. He had given
it indeed--in the shape not of a biscuit-box, which is what she would have deserved, but of
a cheque--but he was not pleased. Neither was he pleased, as has been seen, by the proceedings
of Elinor, who had slighted all his advice yet clung to himself in a way some women have. I
do not know whether men expect you to be quite as much their friend as ever after they have
rejected your counsel and taken their own (exactly opposite) way: but women do, and indeed
I think expect you to be rather grateful that they have not taken amiss the advice which they
have rejected and despised. This was Elinor's case. She hoped that John was ashamed of advising
her to make her boy acquainted with his family and the fact of his father's existence, and
that he duly appreciated the fact that she did not resent that advice; and then she expected
from him the same attention to herself and her son as if the boy had been guided in his and
not in her way. Thus it will be seen his friends and relations expected a very great deal from
John.

He had gone to his chambers one afternoon after he left the law courts, and was there very
busily engaged in getting up his notes for to-morrow's work, when he received a visit which
awakened at once echoes of the past and alarms for the future in John's mind. It was very early
in the year, the end of January, and the House was not sitting, so that his public duties were
less overwhelming than usual. His room was the same in which we have already seen on various
occasions, and which Elinor in her youth, before anything had happened to make life serious
for her, had been in the habit of calling the Star Chamber, for no reason in the world except
that law and penalties or judgments upon herself in her unripe conviction, and suggestions
of what ought to be done, came from that place to which Mrs. Dennistoun had made resort in
her perplexities almost from the very beginning of John's reign there. Mr. Tatham had been
detained beyond his usual time by the importance of the case for which he was preparing, and
a clerk, very impatient to get free, yet obliged to simulate content, had lighted the lamp
and replenished the fire. It had always been a comfortable room. The lamp by which John worked
had a green shade which concentrated the light upon a table covered with that litter of papers
in which there seemed so little order, yet which Mr. Tatham knew to the last scrap as if they
had been the tidiest in the world. The long glazed book-case which filled up one side of the
room gave a dark reflection of the light and of the leaping brightness of the fire. The curtains
were drawn over the windows. If the clerk fumed in the outer rooms, here all was studious life
and quiet. No spectator could have been otherwise than impressed by the air of absolute self-concentration
with which the eminent lawyer gave himself up to his work. He was like his lamp, giving all
the light in him to the special subject, indifferent to everything outside.

"What is it, Simmons?" he said abruptly, without looking up.

"A lady, sir, who says she has urgent business and must see you."

"A lady--who must see me." John Tatham smiled at the very ineffectual must, which meant coercion
and distraction to him. "I don't see how she is going to accomplish that."

"I told her so," said the clerk.

"Well, you must tell her so again." He had scarcely lifted his head from his work, so that
it was unnecessary to return to it when the door closed, and Mr. Tatham went on steadily as before.

It is easy to concentrate the light of the lamp when it is duly shaded and no wind to blow
it about, and it is easy to concentrate a man's attention in the absolute quiet when nothing
interrupts him; but when there suddenly rises up a wind of talk in the room which is separated
from him only by a door, a tempest of chattering words and laughter, shrill and bursting forth
in something like shrieks, making the student start, that is altogether a different business.
The lady outside, who evidently had multiplied herself--unless it was conceivable that the
serious Simmons had made himself her accomplice--had taken the cleverest way of showing that
she was not to be beat by any passive resistance of busy man, though not even an audible conversation
with Simmons would have startled or disturbed his master, to whom it would have been apparent
that his faithful vassal was thus defending his own stronghold and innermost retirement. But
this was quite independent of Simmons, a discussion in two voices, one high-pitched and shrill,
the other softer, but both absolutely unrestrained by any consciousness of being in a place
where the chatter of strange voices is forbidden, and stillness and quiet a condition of being.
The sound of the talk rang through Mr. Tatham's head as if all the city bells were ringing.
One of the unseen ladies had a very shrill laugh, to which she gave vent freely. John fidgeted
in his chair, raised up his eyes above the level of his spectacles (he wore spectacles, alas!
by this time habitually when he worked) as if lifting a voiceless appeal to those powers who
interest themselves in law cases to preserve him from disturbance, then made a manly effort
to disregard the sounds that filled the air, returning with a shake of his head to his reading.
But at the end of a long day, and in the dulness of the afternoon, perhaps a man is less capable
than at other moments to fight against interruption of this kind and finally he threw down
his papers and touched his bell. Simmons came in full of pale indignation, which made itself
felt even beyond the circle illuminated by the lamp.

"What can I do?" he said. "They've planted themselves by the fire, and there they mean to stay.
'Oh, very well, we'll wait,' they said, quite calm. And I make no doubt they will, having nothing
else to do, till all is blue."

Mr. Simmons had a gift of expression of which all his friends were flatteringly sensible, and
he was very friendly and condescending to John, of whom he had taken care for many years.

"What is to be done?" said Mr. Tatham. "Can't you do anything to get them away?"

Simmons shook his head. "There's two of them," he said, "and they entertain each other, and
they think it's fun to jabber like that in a lawyer's office. The young one says, 'What a queer
place!' and the other, she holds forth about other times when she's been here."

"Oh, she's been here other times---- Do you know her, Simmons?"

"Not from Adam, Mr. Tatham--or, I should say, from Eve, as she's a lady. But a real lady I
should say, though she don't behave herself as such--one of the impudent ones. They are never
impudent like that," said Mr. Simmons, with profound observation, "unless they are real high
or--real low."

"Hum!" said John, hesitating. And then he added, "There is a young one, you say?"

But I do not myself think, though the light-minded may imagine it to be so, that it was because
there was a young one that John gave in. It was because he could do nothing else, the noise
and chatter of the voices being entirely destructive of that undisturbed state of the atmosphere
in which work can be done. It was not merely the sounds but the vibration they made in the
air, breaking all its harmony and concentration. He tried a little longer, but was unsuccessful,
and finally in despair he said to Simmons, "You had better show them in, and let me get done
with them," in an angry tone.

"Oh, he will see us after all," said the high-pitched voice. "So good of Mr. Tatham; but of
course I should have waited all the same. Dolly, take Toto; I can't possibly get up while I
have him on my knee. You can tell Mr. Tatham I did not send in my name to disturb him, which
makes it all the more charitable of him to receive me; but, dear me, of course I can tell him
that himself as he consents to see us. Dolly, don't strangle my poor darling! I never saw a
girl that didn't know how to take up a dear dog before."

"He's only a snappish little demon, and you spoil him so," said the other voice. This was attended
by the sound of movement as if the party were getting under weigh.

"My poor darling pet, it is only her jealousy: is that the way? Yes, to be sure it is the next
room. Now, Dolly, remember this is where all the poor people are ruined and done for. Leave
hope behind all ye who enter here." A little shriek of laughter ended this speech. And John,
looking up, taking off his spectacles, and raising a little the shade of the lamp, saw in the
doorway Lady Mariamne, altered as was inevitable by the strain and stress of nearly twenty years.

CHAPTER XXXIV.

I do not mean to assert that John Tatham had not seen Lady Mariamne during these twenty years,
or that her changed appearance burst upon him with anything like a shock. In society, when
you are once a member of that little world within a world, everybody sees everybody else from
time to time. He had not recognised her voice, for he was not in the smallest degree thinking
of Lady Mariamne or of any member of her family, notwithstanding that they now and then did
make a very marked appearance in his mind in respect of the important question of that connection
which Elinor in her foolishness tried to ignore. And John was not at all shocked by the progress
of that twenty years, as reflected in the appearance of this lady, who was about his own standing,
a woman very near fifty, but who had fought strenuously against every sign of her age, as some
women foolishly do. The result was in Lady Mariamne's case, as in many others, that the number
of her years looked more like a hundred and fifty than their natural limit. A woman of her
class has but two alternatives as she gets old. She must get stout, in which case, though she
becomes unwieldy, she preserves something of her bloom; or she may grow thin, and become a
spectre upon which art has to do so much that nature, flouted and tortured, becomes vindictive,
and withdraws every modifying quality. Lady Mariamne had, I fear, false hair, false teeth,
false complexion, everything that invention could do in a poor little human countenance intended
for no such manipulation. The consequence was that every natural advantage (and there are some
which age confers, as well as many that age takes away) was lost. The skin was parchment, the
eyes were like eyes of fishes, the teeth--too white and too perfect--looked like the horrible
things in the dentists' windows, which was precisely what they were. On such a woman, the very
height of the fashion, to which she so often attaches herself with desperation, has an antiquated
air. Everything "swears," as the French say, with everything else. The softness, the whiteness,
the ease, the self-abnegation of advancing age are all so many ornaments if people but knew.
But Lady Mariamne had none of these. She wore a warm cloak in her carriage, it is true, but
that had dropped from her shoulders, leaving her in all the bound-up rigidity in which youth
is trim and slim and elastic, as becomes it. It is true that many a woman of fifty is, as John
Tatham was, serenely dwelling on that tableland which shows but little difference between thirty-five,
the crown of life, and fifty-five; but Lady Mariamne was not one of these. She had gone "too
fast," she would herself have allowed; "the pace" had been too much for such survivals. She
was of the awful order of superannuated beauties of which Mr. Rider Haggard would in vain persuade
us "She" was not one. I am myself convinced that "She's" thousands of years were all written
on her fictitious complexion, and that other people saw them clearly if not her unfortunate
lover. And Lady Mariamne had come to be of the order of "She." By dint of wiping out the traces
of her fifty years, she had made herself look as if she might have been a thousand, and in
this guise she appeared to the robust, ruddy, well-preserved man of her own age, as she stood,
with a fantastic little giggle, calling his attention, on the threshold of his door.

Behind Lady Mariamne was a very different figure--that of the serious and independent girl
without any illusions, who is in so many cases the child of such a mother, and who is in revolt
so complete from all that mother's traditions, so highly set on the crown of every opposite
principle, that nature vindicates itself by the possibility that she may at any moment topple
over and become again what her mother was. He would have been a bold man, however, who in the
present stage would have prophesied any such fate for Dolly Prestwich, who between working
at Whitechapel, attending on a ward in St. Thomas's, drawing three days a week in the Slade
School, and other labours of equally varied descriptions, had her time very fully taken up,
and only on special occasions had time to accompany her mother. She had been beguiled on this
occasion by the family history which was concerned, and which, fin de siècle as Dolly was,
excited her curiosity almost as much as if she had been born in the "forties." Dolly was never
unkind, sometimes indeed was quite the reverse, to her mother. When Mr. Tatham, with a man's
brutal unconsciousness of what is desirable, placed a chair for Lady Mariamne in front of the
fire, Dolly twisted it round with a dexterous movement so as to shield the countenance which
was not adapted for any such illumination. For herself, Dolly cared nothing, whether it was
the noonday sun or the blaze of a furnace that shone upon her; she defied them both to make
her wink. As for complexion, she scorned that old-fashioned vanity. She had not very much,
it is true. Having been scorched red and brown in Alpine expeditions in the autumn, she was
now of a somewhat dry whitish-greyish hue, the result of much loss of cuticle and constant
encounter with London fogs and smoke. She carried Toto--who was a shrinking, chilly Italian
greyhound--in a coat, carelessly under one arm, and sat down beside her mother, studying the
papers on John's table with exceedingly curious eyes. She would have liked to go over all his
notes about his case, and form her own opinion on it--which she would have done, we may be
sure, much more rapidly, and with more decision, than Mr. Tatham could do.

"So here I am again, you will say," said Lady Mariamne. She had taken off her gloves, and was
smoothing her hands, from the points of the fingers downwards, not, I believe, with any intention
of demonstrating their whiteness, but solely because she had once done so, and the habit remained.
She wore several fine rings, and her hands were still pretty, and--unlike the rest of her--younger
than her age. They made a little show with their sparkling diamonds, just catching the edge
of the light from John's shaded lamp. Her face by Dolly's help was in the shadow of the green
shade. "You will say so, Mr. Tatham, I know: here she is again--without thinking how self-denying
I have been, never to come, never to ask a single question, for all these years."

"The loss is mine, Lady Mariamne," said John, gravely.

"It's very pretty of you to say that, isn't it, Dolly? One's old flirts don't always show up
so well." And here the lady gave a laugh, such as had once been supposed to be one of Lady
Mariamne's charms, but which was rather like a giggle now--an antiquated giggle, which is much
less satisfactory than the genuine article. "How I used to worry you about poor Phil, and that
little spitfire of a Nell--and what a mess they have made of it! I suppose you know what changes
have happened in the family, Mr. Tatham, since those days?"

"I heard indeed, with regret, Lady Mariamne, that you had lost a brother----"

"A brother! two!" she cried. "Isn't it extraordinary--poor Hal, that was the picture of health?
How little one knows! He just went, don't you know, without any one ever thinking he would
go. Regg in India was different--you expect that sort of thing when a man is in India. But
poor Hal! I told you Mr. Tatham wouldn't have heard of it, Dolly, not being in our own set,
don't you know."

"It was in all the papers," said Miss Dolly.

"Ah, well, you didn't notice it, I suppose: or perhaps you were away. I always say it is of
no use being married or dying or anything else in September--your friends never hear of it.
You will wonder that I am not in black, but black was always very unbecoming to me, and dark
grey is just as good, and doesn't make one quite so ghastly. But the funny thing is that now
Phil--who looked as if he never could be in the running, don't you know--is heir presumptive.
Isn't it extraordinary? Two gone, and Phil, that lived much faster than either of them, and
at one time kept up an awful pace, has seen them both out. And St. Serf has never married.
He won't now, though I have been at him on the subject for years. He says, not if he knows
it, in the horrid way men have. And I don't wonder much, for he has had some nasty experiences,
poor fellow. There was Lady---- Oh, I almost forgot you were there, Dolly."

"You needn't mind me," said Dolly, gravely; "I've heard just as bad."

"Well," said Lady Mariamne, with a giggle, "did you ever know anything like those girls? They
are not afraid of anything. Now, when I was a girl--don't you remember what an innocent dear
I was, Mr. Tatham?--like a lamb; never suspecting that there was any naughtiness in the world----"

John endeavoured to put on a smile, in feeble sympathy with the uproariousness of Lady Mariamne's
laugh--but her daughter took no such trouble. She sat as grave as a young judge, never moving
a muscle. The dog, however, held in her arms, and not at all comfortable, then making prodigious
efforts to struggle on to its mistress's more commodious lap, burst out into a responsive bark,
as shrill and not much unlike.

"Darling Toto," said Lady Mariamne, "come!--it always knows what it's mummy means. Did you
ever see such a darling little head, Mr. Tatham?--and the faithful pet always laughs when I
laugh. What was I talking of?--St. Serf and his ladies. Well, it is not much wonder, you know,
is it? for he has always been a sort of an invalid, and he will never marry now--and poor Hal
being gone there's only Phil. Phil's been going a pace, Mr. Tatham; but he has had a bad illness,
too, and the other boys going has sobered him a bit; and I do believe, now, that he'll probably
mend. And there he is, you know, tied to a---- Oh, of course, she is as right as a--as right
as a--trivet, whatever that may be. Those sort of heartless people always are: and then there's
the child. Is it living, Mr. Tatham?--that's what I want to know."

"Philip is alive and well, Lady Mariamne, if that is what you want to know."

"Philip!--she called him after Phil, after all! Well, that is something wonderful. I expected
to hear he was John, or Jonathan, or something. Now, where is he?" said Lady Mariamne, with
the most insinuating air.

John burst into a short laugh. "I don't suppose you expect me to tell you," he said.

"Why not?--you can't hide a boy that is heir to a peerage, Mr. Tatham!--it is impossible. Nell
has done the best she could in that way. They know nothing about her in that awful place she
was married from--of course you remember it--a dreadful place, enough to make one commit suicide,
don't you know. The Cottage, or whatever they call it, is let, and nobody knows anything about
them. I took the trouble to go there, I assure you, on my own hook, to see if I could find
out something. Toto nearly died of it, didn't you, darling? Not a drop of cream to be had for
him, the poor angel; only a little nasty skim milk. But Mr. Tatham has the barbarity to smile,"
she went on, with a shrill outcry. "Fancy, Toto--the cruelty to smile!"

"No cream for the angel, and no information for his mistress," said John.

"You horrid, cruel, cold-blooded man!--and you sit there at your ease, and will do nothing
for us----"

"Should you like me," said John, "to send out for cream for your dog, Lady Mariamne?"

"Cream in the Temple?" said the lady. "What sort of a compound would it be, Dolly? All plaster
of Paris, or stuff of that sort. Perhaps you have tea sometimes in these parts----"

"Very seldom," said John; "but it might be obtainable if you would like it." He put forward
his hand, but not with much alacrity, to the bell.

"Mother never takes any tea," said Miss Dolly, hastily; "she only crumbles down cake into it
for that little brute."

"It is you who are a little brute, you unnatural child. Toto likes his tea very much--he is
dying for it. But you must have patience, my pet, for probably it would be very bad, and the
cream all stucco, or something. Mr. Tatham, do tell us what has become of Nell? Now, have you
hidden her somewhere in London, St. John's Wood, and that sort of thing, don't you know? or
where is she? Is the old woman living? and how has that boy been brought up? At a dame's school,
or something of that sort, I suppose."

"Mother," said Dolly, "you ought to know there are now no dame's schools. There's Board Schools,
which is what you mean, I suppose; and it would be very good for him if he had been there.
They would teach him a great deal more than was ever taught to Uncle Phil."

"Teach him!" said Lady Mariamne, with another shriek. "Did I ask anything about teaching? Heaven
forbid! Mr. Tatham knows what I mean, Dolly. Has he been at any decent place--or has he been
where it will never be heard of? Eton and Harrow one knows, and the dame's schools one knows,
but horrible Board Schools, or things, where they might say young Lord Lomond was brought up--oh,
goodness gracious! One has to bear a great many things, but I could not bear that."

"It does not matter much, does it, so long as he does not come within the range of his nearest
relations?" This was from John, who was almost at the end of his patience. He began to put
his papers back in a portfolio, with the intention of carrying them home with him, for his
hour's work had been spoilt as well as his temper. "I am afraid," he added, "that I cannot
give you any information, Lady Mariamne."

"Oh, such nonsense, Mr. Tatham!--as if the heir to a peerage could be hid."

It was not often that Lady Mariamne produced an unanswerable effect, but against this last
sentence of hers John had absolutely nothing to say. He stared at her for a moment, and then
he returned to his papers, shovelling them into the portfolio with vehemence. Fortunately,
she did not herself see how potent was her argument. She went on diluting it till it lost all
its power.

"There is the 'Peerage,' if it was nothing else--they must have the right particulars for that.
Why, Dolly is at full length in it, her age and all, poor child; and Toto, too, for anything
I know. Is du in the 'Peerage,' dear Toto, darling? And yet Toto can't succeed, nor Dolly either.
And this year Phil will be in as heir presumptive and his marriage and all--and then a blank
line. It's ridiculous, it's horrible, it's a thing that can't, can't be! Only think of all
the troops of people, nice people, the best people, that read the 'Peerage,' Mr. Tatham!--and
that know Phil is married, and that there is a child, and yet will see nothing but that blank
line. Nell was always a little fool, and never could see things in a common-sense way. But
a man ought to know better--and a lawyer, with chambers in the Temple! Why, people come and
consult you on such matters--I might be coming to ask you to send out detectives, and that
sort of thing. How do you dare to hide away that boy?"

Lady Mariamne stamped her foot at John, but this proceeding very much incommoded Toto, who,
disturbed in his position on her knee, got upon his feet and began to bark furiously, first
at his mistress and then, following her impulse, at the gentleman opposite to her, backing
against the lady's shoulder and setting up his little nose furiously with vibrations of rage
against John, while stumbling upon the uncertain footing of the lap, volcanically shaken by
the movement. The result of this onslaught was to send Lady Mariamne into shrieks of laughter,
in the midst of which she half smothered Toto with mingled endearments and attempts at restraint,
until Dolly, coming to the rescue, seized him summarily and snatched him away.

"The darling!" cried Lady Mariamne, "he sees it, and you can't see it, a great big lawyer though
you are. Dolly, don't throttle my angel child. Stands up for his family, don't he, the dear?
Mr. Tatham, how can you be so bigoted and stubborn, when our dear little Toto---- But you always
were the most obstinate man. It was a rainy October afternoon, and through the door she could see
the black main street --houses and road alike bedabbled in wet and mire. At one point in the
street her eye caught a small standing crowd of women and children, most of them with tattered
shawls thrown over their heads to protect them from the weather.

She knew what it meant.

They were waiting for the daily opening of the soup kitchen, started in the third week of the
great strike by the Baptist minister, who, in the language of the Tory paper, was "among the
worst firebrands of the district." There was another soup kitchen further down, to which George
had begun to subscribe immediately on his return to the place. She had thought it a foolish
act on his part thus to help his own men to fight him the better. But--now, as she watched the
miserable crowd outside the Baptist chapel, she felt the teasing pressure of those new puzzles
of her married life which had so far done little else, it seemed, than take away her gaiety
and her power of amusing herself.

Near her sat an oldish woman with an almost toothless mouth, who was chattering to her in a tone that
Letty knew to be three parts hypocritical.

"Well, the treuth is the men is that fool 'ardy when they gets a thing into their yeds, there's
no taakin wi un. There's plenty as done like the strike, my lady, but they dursent say so--they'd
be afeard o' losin the skin off their backs, for soom o' them lads
o' Burrows's is a routin rough lot as done keer what they doos to
a mon, an yo canna exspeck a quiet body to stan up agen 'em.

Now, my son, ee comes in at neet all slamp and downcast, an I says to 'im, 'Is there noa news
yet o' the Jint Committee, John?' I ses to un. 'Noa, mither,' ee
says, 'they're just keepin ov it on.' An ee do seem so down'earted
when ee sees the poor soart ov a supper as is aw I can gie un to 'is
stomach.

Now, I'm wun o' thoase as wants nuthin.

The doctor ses, 'Yo've got no blude in yer, Missus 'Ammersley, what 'ull yer 'ave?' An I says,
'Nuthin! it's sun cut, an it's sun cooked, nuthin!' Noa, I've niver
bin on t' parish--an I might--times.

An I don't 'old wi strikes. Lor, it is a poor pleace, is ours--ain't it?--an nobbut a bit
o' bread an drippin for supper."

The old woman threw her eyes round her kitchen, bringing them back slyly to Letty's face. Letty
ended by leaving some money with her, and walking away as dissatisfied with her own charity
as she was with its recipient. Perhaps this old body was the only person in the village who
would have begged of "Tressady's wife" at this particular moment. Letty, moreover, had some
reason to believe that her son was one of the roughest of Burrows's bodyguard; while the old
woman was certainly no worse off than any of her neighbours.

Outside, she was disturbed to find as she walked home, that the street was full of people,
in spite of the rain--of gaunt men and pinched women, who threw her hostile and sidelong glances
as she passed. She hurried through them. How was it that she knew nothing of them--except, perhaps,
of the few toadies and parasites among them? How was one to penetrate into this ugly, incomprehensible
world of "the people"? The mere idea of trying to do so filled her with distaste and ennui. She
was afraid of them. She wished she had not stayed so long with that old gossip, Mrs. Hammersley,
and that there were not so many yards of dark road between her and her own gate. Where was George?
She knew that he had gone up to the pits that afternoon to consult his manager about some
defect in the pumping arrangements. She wished she had secured his escort for the walk home.

But
before she left the village she paused irresolutely, then turned down a side street, and went to see
Mary Batchelor, George's old nurse, the mother who had lost her only son in his prime.

When, a few minutes later, she came up the lane, she was flatly conscious of having done a virtuous
thing--several virtuous things--that afternoon, but certainly without any pleasure in them. She
did not get on with Mary, nor Mary with her. The tragic absorption of the mother--little abated
since the spring--in her dead boy seemed somehow to strike Letty dumb. She felt pity, but yet
the whole emotion was beyond her, and she shrank from it. As for Mary, she had so far received
Lady Tressady's visits with a kind of dull surprise, always repeated and not flattering. Letty believed
that, in her inmost heart, the broken woman was offended each time that it was not George who
came. Moreover, though she never said a word of it to Tressady's wife, she was known to be passionately
on the side of the strikers, and her manner gave the impression that she did not want to be
talking with their oppressors. Perhaps it was this feeling that had reconciled her to the loutish
lad who lived with her, and had been twice "run in" by the police for stone-throwing at non-union
men since the beginning of the strike. At any rate, she took a great deal more notice of him
than she had done.

No--they were not very satisfactory, these attempts of Letty's in the village. She thought of them
with a kind of inner exasperation as she walked home. She had been going to a few old and sick people,
and trying to ignore the strike. But at bottom she felt an angry resentment towards these loafing,
troublesome fellows, who filled the village street when they ought to have been down in the
pits--who were starving their own children no less than disturbing and curtailing the incomes of their
betters. Did they suppose that people were going to run pits for them for nothing? Their drink
and their religion seemed to her equally hideous. She hated the two Dissenting ministers of the
place only less than Valentine Burrows himself, and delighted to pass their wives with her head
high in air.

With these general feelings towards the population in her mind, why these efforts at consolation
and almsgiving? Well, the poor old people were not responsible; but she did not see that any
good had come of it. She had said nothing about her visits to George, nor did-she suppose
that he had noticed them. He had been so incessantly busy since their arrival with conferences
and committees that she had seen very little of him. It was generally believed that the strike
was nearing its end, and that the men were exhausted; but she did not think that George was
very hopeful yet.

Presently, as she neared a dark slope of road, bordered with trees on one side and the high
"bank" of the main pit on the other, her thoughts turned back to their natural and abiding subject--herself.
Oh, the dulness of life at Ferth during the last three weeks! She thought of her amusements in town,
of the country houses where they might now be staying but for George's pride, of Cathedine,
even; and a rush of revolt and self-pity filled her mind. George always away, nothing to do in
the ugly house, and Lady Tressady coming directly--she said to herself, suffocating, her small
hands stiffening, that she felt fit to kill herself.

Half-way down the slope she heard steps behind her in the gathering darkness, and at the same
moment something struck her violently on the shoulder. She cried out, and clutched at some wooden
railings along the road for support, as the lump of "dirt" from the bank which had been flung
at her dropped beside her.

"Letty, is that you?" shouted a voice from the direction of the village--her husband's voice.
She heard running. In a few seconds George had reached her and was holding her.

"What is it struck you? I see! Cowards! damned cowards! Has it broken your arm? Try and move it."

Sick
with pain she tried to obey him. "No," she said faintly; "it is not broken--I think not."

"Good!" he cried, rejoicing; "probably only a bad bruise. The brute mercifully picked up nothing
very hard"--and he pushed the lump with his foot. "Take my scarf, dear; let me sling it. Ah!--what
was that? Letty! can you be brave--can you let me go one minute? I sha'n't be out of your sight."

And
he pointed excitedly to a dark spot moving among the bushes along the lower edge of the "bank."

Letty
nodded. "I can stay here."

George leapt the palings and ran. The dark spot ran too, but in queer leaps and bounds. There
was the sound of a scuffle, then George returned, dragging something or someone behind him.

"I
knew it," he said, panting, as he came within earshot of his wife;
"it was that young ruffian, Mary Batchelor's grandson!

Now you stand still, will you? I could hold two of the likes of you with one hand. Madan!"

He had but just parted from his manager on the path which led sideways up the "bank," and waited
anxiously to see if his voice would reach the Scotchman's ears. But no one replied. He shouted
again; then he put two fingers in his mouth and whistled loudly towards the pit, holding the
struggling lad all the time.

At the same moment a couple of heavily built men, evidently colliers, came down the road from
the village. George at once called to them from across the palings.

"Here, you there! this young rascal has been throwing a lump of dirt at Lady Tressady, and has
hit her badly on the arm. Will you two just walk him up to the police-station for me, while I take
my wife home?"

The two men stopped and stared at the lady by the railings and at Sir George holding the boy,
whose white but grinning face was just visible in the growing dusk.

"Noa," said one of them at last, "it's noa business ov ourn--is it, Bill?"

"Noa," said the other, stolidly; and on they tramped.

"Oh, you heroes!" George flung after them.

"Attacking a woman in the dark is about what you understand!--Madan!"

He whistled again, and this time there was a hurrying from overhead.

"Sir George!"

"Come down here, will you, at once!"

In a few more minutes the boy was being marched up the road to the police-station in charge of
the strong-wristed Scotch manager, and George was free to attend
to Letty.

He adjusted a sling very fairly, then made her cling to him with her sound arm; and they were
soon inside their own gates.

"You can't climb this hill," he said to her anxiously.

"Rest at the lodge, and let me go for the brougham."

"I can walk perfectly well--and it will be much quicker."

Involuntarily, he was surprised to find her rather belittling than exaggerating the ill. As they
climbed on in the dark, he helping her as much as he could, both could not but think of another
accident and another victim. Letty found herself imagining again and again what the scene with
Lady Maxwell, after the East End meeting, might have been like; while, as for him, a face drew itself
upon the rainy dusk, which the will seemed powerless to blot out. It was a curious and unwelcome
coincidence. His secret sense of it made him the more restlessly kind.

"What were you in the village for?" he asked, bending to her; "I did not know you had anything
to do there!"

"I had been to see old Bessie Hammersley and Mrs. Batchelor," she
said, in a tone that tried to be stiff or indifferent.

"Bessie begged, as usual."

"That was very good of you. Have you been doing visiting, then, during all these days I have been
away?"

"Yes--a few people."

George groaned.

"What's the use of it--or of anything? They hate us and we them.

This strike begins to eat into my very being. And the men will be beaten soon, and the feeling
towards the employers will be worse than ever."

"You are sure they will be beaten?"

"Before Christmas, anyway.

I daresay there will be some bad times first. To think a woman even can't walk these roads
without danger of ill-treatment! How is one to have any dealings
with the brutes, or any peace with them?"

His rage and bitterness made her somehow feel her bruises less. She even looked up in protest.

"Well,
it was only a boy, and you used to think he wasn't all there."

"Oh! all there!" said George, scornfully. "There'd be half of them
in Bedlam if one had to make that excuse for them.

There isn't a day passes without some devilry against the non-union men somewhere. It was
only this morning I heard of two men being driven into a reservoir
near Rilston, and stoned in the water."

"Perhaps we should do the same," she said unwillingly.

"Lean on me more heavily--we shall soon be there. You think we should be brutes too? Probably.
We seem to be all brutes for each other--that's the charming way this competitive world is managed. So
you have been looking after some of the old people, have you? You must have had a dull time
of it this last three weeks--don't think I don't know that!"

He spoke with emotion. He thought he felt her grasp waver a little
on his arm, but she did not speak.

"Suppose--when this business was over--I were to cut the whole concern--let
the pits and the house, and go right away?

I daresay I could."

"Could you?" she said eagerly.

"We shouldn't get so much money, you know, as in the best years.

But then it would be certain. What would you say to a thousand a
year less?" he asked her, trying to speak lightly.

"Well, it doesn't seem easy to get on with what we have--even if we
had it," she said sharply.

He understood the reference to his mother's debts, and was silent.

But evidently the recollection, once introduced, generated the usual
heat and irritation in her, for, as they neared the front door, she
suddenly said, with an acerbity he had not heard for some weeks:

"Of
course, to have a country house, and not to be able to spend a farthing
upon it--to ask your friends, or have anything decent--is enough to
make anyone sick of it.

And, above all, when we needn't have been here at all this October--"

She stopped, shrinking from the rest of the sentence, but not before he had time to think, "She
say that!--monstrous!"

Aloud he coldly replied:

"It is difficult to see where I could have been but here, this October."

Then the door opened, and the light showed her to him pale, with lips tight pressed from the
pain of her injury. Instantly he forgot everything but his natural pity and chivalry towards women.
He led her in, and half carried her upstairs.

A little later she was resting on her bed, and he had done everything he could for her till the doctor
should come. She seemed to have passed into an eclipse of temper or moodiness, and he got little
gratitude.

The evening post brought her a letter which he took up to her himself. He knew the clear, rapid
hand, and he knew, too, that Letty had received many such during
the preceding month.

He stood beside her a moment, almost on the point of asking her to let him see it. But the
words died on his lips.

And, perceiving that she would not read it while he was there, he went away again.

When he returned, carrying a new book and asking if he should read
to her, he found her lying with her cheek on her hand, staring into
the fire, and so white and miserable that his heart sank.

Had he married her, a girl of twenty-four, only to destroy her chance
of happiness altogether?

A kind of terror seized him.

He had been "good to her," so far as she and his business had allowed him, since their return;
there had been very little outward jarring; but no one knew better than he that there had not
been one truly frank or reconciling moment.

His own inner life during these weeks had passed in one obscure continuous struggle--a sort of dull
fever of the soul. And she had simply held herself aloof from him.

He knelt down beside her, and laid his face against hers.

"Don't look so unhappy!" he said in a whisper, caressing her free hand. She did not answer
or make any response till, as he got up again in a kind of despair as to what to do or say next,
she hastily asked:

"Has the constable been up here to see you?"

He looked at her in surprise.

"Yes. It is all arranged. The lad will be brought up before the magistrates on Thursday."

She fidgeted, then said abruptly:

"I should like him to be let off."

He hesitated.

"That's very nice of you, but it wouldn't be very good for the district."

She did not press the matter, but as he moved away she said fretfully:

"I wish you'd read to me. The pain's horrid."

Thankful, in his remorse, to do anything for her, he tried to amuse and distract her as he best could.
But in the middle of a magazine story she interrupted him:

"Isn't it the day after to-morrow your mother's coming?"

"According to her letter this morning." He put down the book. "But
I don't think you'll be at all fit to look after her. Shall I write
to-night and suggest that she stays in London a little?"

"No. I shall
be all right, the doctor says. I want to tell Esther"--Esther was
the housemaid--"not to get the Blue Room ready for her. I looked in
to-day, and it seemed damp. The back room over the dining-room is
smaller, but it's much warmer."

She turned to look at him with a
rather flushed face.

"You know best," he said, smiling. "I am sure
it will be all right. But I sha'n't let her come unless you are better."

He
went on reading till it grew late, and it seemed to him she was dropping
off to sleep. He was stealing off by way of the large dressing-room
near by, where he had been installed since their return, when, she
said faintly, "Good-night!"

He returned, and felt the drawing of
her hot hand. He stooped and kissed her. Then she turned away from
him, and seemed to go instantly to sleep.

He went downstairs to his
library, and gathered about him some documents he had brought back
from the last meeting of the masters' committee, which had to be read.
But in reality he spent an hour of random thought. When would she
herself tell him anything of her relations to Lady Maxwell, of the
nature and causes of that strange subjection which, as he saw quite
plainly, had been brought about? She must know that he pined to know;
yet she held her secret only the more jealously, no doubt to punish
him.

He thought of her visits to the village, half humorously, half
sadly; then of her speech about the Blue Room and his mother. They
seemed to him signs of some influence at work.

But at last he turned
back to his papers with a long impatient sigh. The clear pessimism
with which he was wont to see facts that concerned himself maintained
that all the surrounding circumstance of the case was as untoward
as it could be--this dull house, a troubled district, his money affairs,
the perpetual burden of his mother, Letty's own thirst for pleasure,
and the dying down in himself of the feelings that might once--possibly--have
made up to her for a good deal. The feelings might be simulated. Was
the woman likely to be deceived? That she was capable of the fiercest
jealousy had been made abundantly plain; and such a temper once roused
would find a hundred new provocations, day by day, in the acts and
doings of a husband who had ceased to be a lover.

Two days later
Lady Tressady arrived, with Justine, and her dogs, and all her paraphernalia.
She declared herself better, but she was a mere shadow of the woman
who had tormented George with her debts and affectations at Malford
House a twelvemonth before. She took Ferth discontentedly, as usual,
and was particularly cross with Letty's assignment to her of the back
room, instead of the larger spare room to the front of the house.

"Damp?--nonsense!"
she said to Justine, who was trying to soothe her on the night she
arrived. "I suppose Lady Tressady has some friend of her own coming
to stay--that's, of course, what it is. C'est parfaitement clair,
je te dis--parfaitement!"

The French maid reminded her that her daughter-in-law
had said, on showing her the room, she had only to express a wish
to change, and the arrangements should be altered at once.

"I daresay,"
cried Lady Tressady. "But I shall ask no favours of her--and that,
of course, she knew."

"But, miladi, I need only speak to the housemaid."

"Thank
you! Then afterwards, whenever I had a pain or a finger-ache, it would
be, 'I told you so!' No! she has managed it very cleverly--very cleverly
indeed!--and I shall let it alone."

Thenceforward, however, there
were constant complaints of everything provided for her--room, food,
the dulness of the place, the manners of her daughter-in-law. Whether
it was that her illness had now reached a stage when the will could
no longer fight against it, and its only effect was demoralising;
or whether the strange flash of courage and natural affection struck
from the volatile nature by the first threat of death could not in
any case have maintained itself, it is hard to say. At any rate, George
also found it hard to keep up his new and better ways with her. The
fact was, he suffered through Letty. In a few days his sympathies
were all with her, and to his amazement he perceived before long that,
in spite of occasional sharp speeches and sulky moments that only
an angel could have forborne, she was really more patient under his
mother's idiosyncrasies than he was. Yet Lady Tressady, even now,
was rarely unmanageable in his presence, and could still restrain
herself if it was a question of his comfort and repose; whereas, it
was clear that she felt a cat-like impulse to torment Letty whenever
she saw her.

One recent habit, however, bore with special heaviness
on himself. Oddly enough, it was a habit of religious discussion.
Lady Tressady in health had never troubled herself in the least as
to what the doctors of the soul might have to say, and had generally
gaily professed herself a sceptic in religious matters, mostly, as
George had often thought, for the sake of escaping all inconvenient
restrictions--such as family prayers, or keeping Sunday, or observing
Lent--which might have got in the way of her amusements.

But, now,
poor lady, she was all curiosity and anxiety about this strange other
side of things, and inclined, too, to be rather proud of the originality
of her inquiries on the subject. So that night after night she would
keep George up, after an exhausting day, till the small hours, while
she declared her own views "on God, on Nature, and on Human Life,"
and endeavoured to extract his. This latter part of the exercise was
indeed particularly attractive to her; no doubt because of its difficulty.
George had been a singularly reserved person in these respect's all
his life, and had no mind now to play the part of a coal-seam for
his mother to "pike" at. But "pike" she would incessantly.

"Now,
George, look here! what do you really think about a future life? Now
don't try and get out of it! And don't just talk nonsense to me because
you think I'm ill. I'm not a baby--I really am not. Tell me--seriously--what
you think. Do you honestly expect there is a future life?"

"I've
told you before, mother, that I have no particular thoughts on that
subject. It isn't in my line," George would say, smiling profanely,
but uneasily, and wondering how long this bout of it might be going
to last.

"Don't be shocking, George! You must have some ideas about
it. Now, don't hum and haw--just tell me what you think." And she
would lean forward, all urgency and expectation.

A pause, during
which George could think only of the ghastly figure on the sofa. She
sat upright, generally, against a prop of cushions, dressed in a white
French tea-gown, slim enough to begin, with, but far too large now
for the shrunk form--a bright spot of rouge on either pinched cheek,
and the dyed "fringe" and "coils" covering all the once shapely head.
Meanwhile her hand would play impatiently on her knee. The hand was
skin and bone; and the rings with which it was laden would often slip
off from it to the floor--a diversion of which George was always prompt
to avail himself.

"Why don't you talk to Mr. Fearon, mother?" he
would say gently at last. "It's his business to discuss these things."

"Talk
to a clergyman! thank you! He had been obliged to refuse, his time being
already fully taken up, and he had not looked into the case. But now it began slowly to dawn
upon him that the trial was that of the once absconded manager of a certain joint-stock company,
and that this was precisely the company in which Elinor's money had been all but invested by
her husband. It might be upon that subject that she had to appear.

"Well," he said, "I can imagine a possible reason why you should be called, and yet not a good
one; for it was not of course you who were acting, but your--husband for you. It is he that
should appear, and not you."

"Oh, John," she cried. "Oh, John!" wringing her hands. She had followed his looks eagerly,
noticing the light that seemed to dawn over his face with a strange anxiety and keen interest.
But John, it was evident, had not got the clue which she expected, and her face changed into
impatience, disappointment, exasperation. "You have not heard anything about it," she said;
"you don't know."

"It was brought to me," he said, "but I could not take it up--no, I don't know--except that
it's curious from the lapse of time--twenty years or thereabouts: that's all I know."

"The question is," she said, "about a date. There were some books destroyed, and it is not
known who did it. Suspicion fell upon one--who might have been guilty: but that on that day--he
arrived at the house of the girl--whom he was going to marry: and consequently could not have
been there----"

"Elinor!"

"Yes," she said, "that is what I am wanted for, John, an excellent reason after all these years.
I must appear to--clear my husband: and that is how Pippo will find out that I have a husband
and he a father. Oh, John, John! support me with your approval, and help me, oh, help me to
go away."

"Good gracious!" was all that John could say.

"I should have gone first and asked you after," she cried, "for you are a lawyer, and I suppose
you will think you must not advise any one to fly in the face of the law. And I don't even
know whether it will be of any use to fly. Will they have it in the papers all the same? Will
they put it in that his wife refused to appear on his behalf, that she had gone away to avoid
the summons? Will it be all there for Pippo to guess and wonder at the name and come to me
with questions, mother, who is this? and mother, what is that? John, can't you answer me, you
that I came to to guide me, to tell me what I must do; have you nothing, nothing to say?"

"I am too much bewildered to know what I am doing, Elinor. This is all sprung upon me like
a mine: and there was plenty before."

"There was nothing before," she cried, indignantly, "it was all plain sailing before. He knew
nothing of family troubles--how should he, poor child, being so young? That was simple enough.
And I think I see a way still, John. I will take him off at Easter for a trip abroad, and when
we have started to go to Switzerland or somewhere, I will change my mind, and make him think
of Greece or somewhere far, far away--the East where there will be no newspapers. Tell me when
the trial will come on, and how long you think it will last, and I will keep him away till
it is all over. John! you have nothing surely to say against that? Think from how much it will
save the boy."

"It is impossible, Elinor, that the boy can be saved. I never knew of this complication, but
there are other circumstances, of which I have lately heard."

"What can any other circumstances have to do with it, John, even if he must hear? I know, I
know, you have always been determined upon that. Is that the way you would have him hear, not
only that he has a father, but that his father was involved in--in transactions like that before
ever he was born?"

"Elinor, let us understand each other," said Mr. Tatham. "You mean that you have it in your
power to exonerate your husband, and he has had you subpoenaed, knowing this?"

She looked at him with a look which he could not fathom. Was it reluctance to save Phil Compton
that was in Elinor's eyes? Was she ready to leave her husband to destruction when she could
prevent it, in order to save her boy from the knowledge of his existence? John Tatham was horrified
by the look she fixed upon him, though he could not read it. He thought he could read it, and
read it that way, in the way of hate and deliberate preference of her own will to all law and
justice. There could be no such tremendous testimony to the power of that long continued, absolutely-faithful,
visionary love which John Tatham bore to Elinor than that this discovery which he thought he
had made did not destroy it. He was greatly shocked, but it made no difference in his feelings.
Perhaps there was more of the brotherly character in them than he thought. For a moment they
looked at each other, and he thought he made this discovery--while she met his eyes with that
look which she did not know was inscrutable, which she feared was full of self-betrayal. "I
believe," she said, bending her head, "that that is what he thinks."

"If it had been me," said John Tatham, moved out of his habitual calm, "I would rather be proved
guilty of anything than owe my safety to such an expedient as that. Drag in a woman who hates
me to prove my alibi as if she loved me! By Jove, Elinor! you women have the gift of drawing
out everything that's worst in men."

"It seems to make you hate me, John, which I don't think I have deserved."

"Oh, no, I don't hate you. It's a consequence, I suppose, of use and wont. It makes little
difference to me----"

She gave him another look which he did not understand--a wistful look, appealing to something,
he did not know what--to his ridiculous partiality, he thought, and that stubborn domestic
affection to which it was of so little importance what she did, as long as she was Elinor;
and then she said with a woman's soft, endless pertinacity, "Then you think I may go?"

He sprang from his seat with that impatient despair which is equally characteristic of the
man. "Go!" he said, "when you are called upon by law to vindicate a man's character, and that
man your husband! I ought not to be surprised at anything with my experience, but, Elinor,
you take away my breath."

She only smiled, giving him once more that look of appeal.

"How can you think of it?" he said. "The subpoena is enough to keep any reasonable being, besides
the other motive. You must not budge. I should feel my own character involved, as well as yours,
if after consulting me on the subject you were guilty of an evasion after all."

"It would not be your fault, John."

"Elinor! you are mad--it must not be done," he cried. "Don't defy me, I am capable of informing
upon you, and having you stopped--by force--if you do not give this idea up."

"By force!" she said, with her nostril dilating. "I shall go, of course, if I am threatened."

"Then Philip must not go. Do you know what has happened in the family to which he belongs,
and must belong, whether you like it or not? Do you know--that the boy may be Lord Lomond before
the week is out? that his uncle is dying, and that your husband is the heir?"

She turned round upon him slowly, fixing her eyes upon his, with simple astonishment and no
more in her look. Her mind, so absorbed in other thoughts, hardly took in what he could mean.

"Have you not heard this, Elinor?"

"But there is Hal," she said, "Hal--the other brother--who comes first."

"Hal is dead, and the one in India is dead, and Lord St. Serf is dying. The boy is the heir.
You must not, you cannot, take him away. It is impossible, Elinor, it is against all nature
and justice. You have had him for all these years; his father has a right to his heir."

"Oh, John!" she cried, in a bitter note of reproach, "oh, John, John!"

"Well," he cried, "is not what I tell you the truth? Would Philip give it up if it were offered
to him? He is almost a man--let him judge for himself."

"Oh, John, John! when you know that the object of my life has been to keep him from knowing--to
shut that chapter of my life altogether; to bring him up apart from all evil influences, from
all instructions----"

"And from his birthright, Elinor?"

She stopped, giving him another sudden look, the natural language of a woman brought to bay.
She drew a long breath in impatience and desperation, not knowing what to reply; for what could
she reply? His birthright! to be Lord Lomond, Lord St. Serf, the head of the house. What was
that? Far, far better Philip Dennistoun, of Lakeside, the heir of his mother and his grandmother,
two stainless women, with enough for everything that was honest and of good report, enough
to permit him to be an unworldly scholar, a lover of art, a traveller, any play-profession
that he chose if he did not incline to graver work. Ah! but she had not been so wise as that,
she had not brought him up as Philip Dennistoun. He was Philip Compton, she had not been bold
enough to change his name. She stood at bay, surrounded as it were by her enemies, and confronted
John Tatham, who had been her constant companion and defender, as if all that was hostile to
her, all that was against her peace was embodied in him.

"I must go a little further, Elinor," said John, "though God knows that to add to your pain
is the last thing in the world I wish. You have been left unmolested for a very long time,
and we have all thought your retreat was unknown. I confess it has surprised me, for my experience
has always been that everything is known. But you have been subpoenaed for this trial, therefore,
my dear girl, we must give up that idea. Everybody, that is virtually everybody, all that are
of any consequence, know where you are and all you are about now."

She sank into a chair, still keeping her eyes upon him, as if it were possible that he might
take some advantage of her if she withdrew them; then, still not knowing what to reply, seized
at the last words because they were the last, and had little to do with the main issue. "All
about me?" she said faintly, as if there had been something else besides the place of her refuge
to conceal.

"You know what I mean, Elinor. The moment that your home is known all is known. That Philip
lives and is well, a promising boy; that you have brought him up to do honour to any title
or any position."

He could not help saying this, and partly in the testimony to her, partly for love of the boy,
John Tatham's voice faltered a little and the water came into his eyes.

"Ah, John! you say that!" she cried, as if it had been an admission forced from him against
his will.

"What could I say otherwise? Elinor, because I don't approve of all your proceedings, because
I don't think you have been wise in one respect, is that to say that I do not understand and
know you? I am not such a fool or a formalist as you give me credit for being. You have made
him all that the fondest and proudest could desire. You have done far better for him, I do
not doubt for a moment, than---- But, my dear cousin, my dear girl, my poor Nellie----"

"Yes, John?"

He paused a moment, and then he said, "Right is right, and justice is justice at the end of all."

CHAPTER XXXVII.

When Elinor received the official document which had so extraordinary an effect upon her life,
and overturned in a moment all the fabric of domestic quiet and security which she had been
building up for years, it was outside the tranquil walls of the house at Lakeside, in the garden
which lay between it and the high-road, opening upon that not very much-frequented road by
a pair of somewhat imposing gates, which gave the little establishment an air of more pretension
than it really possessed. Some fine trees shrouded the little avenue, and Elinor was standing
under one of them, stooping over a little nest of primroses at its roots, from which the yellow
buds were peeping forth, when she heard behind her the sound of a vehicle at the gates, and
the quick leap to the ground of someone who opened them. Then there was a pause; the carriage,
whatever it was, did not come farther, and presently she herself, a little curious, turned
round to see a man approaching her, whom she did not know. A dog-cart driven by another, whose
face she recognized, waited in the road while the stranger came forward. "You are Mrs. Compton,
ma'am?" he said. A swift thrill of alarm, she could scarcely tell why, ran over Elinor from
head to foot. She had been settled for nearly eighteen years at Lakeside. What could happen
to frighten her now? but it tingled to her very fingers' ends. And then he said something to
her which she scarcely understood, but which sent that tingle to her very heart and brain,
and gave her the suspicious looking blue paper which he held in his hand. It all passed in
a moment of time to her dazed yet excited consciousness. The early primrose which she had gathered
had not had time to droop in her grasp, though she crushed the stalk unconsciously in her fingers,
before the gates were closed again, the sound of the departing wheels growing faint on the
road, and she herself standing like one paralyzed with that thing in her hand. A subpoena!--what
was a subpoena? She knew as little, perhaps less, than the children in the parish school, who
began to troop along the road in their resounding clogs at their dinner hour. The sound of
this awoke her a little to a frightened sense that she had better put this document out of
sight, at least until she could manage to understand it. And then she sped swiftly away past
the pretty white house lying in the sunshine, with all its doors and windows open, to the little
wood behind, where it would be possible to think and find out at her leisure what this was.
It was a small wood and a public path ran through it; but where the public was so limited as
at Lakeside this scarcely impaired the privacy of the inhabitants, at least in the morning,
when everybody in the parish was at work. Elinor hurried past the house that her mother might
not see her, and climbed the woody hillock to a spot which was peculiarly her own, and where
a seat had been placed for her special use. It was a little mount of vision from which she
could look out, up and down, at the long winding line of the lake cleaving the green slopes,
and away to the rugged and solemn peaks among which lay, in his mountain fastnesses, Helvellyn,
with his hoary brethren crowding round him. Elinor had watched the changes of many a north-country
day, full of endless vicissitudes, of flying clouds and gleams of sunshine, from that seat,
and had hoped and tried to believe that nothing, save these vicissitudes of nature, would ever
again disturb her. Had she really believed that? Her heart thumping against her breast, and
the pulses of her brain beating loud in her ears, answered "No." She had never believed it--she
had known, notwithstanding all her obstinacy, and indignant opposition to all who warned her,
that some day or other her home must be broken up, and the storm burst upon her. But even such
a conviction, desperately fought against and resisted, is a very different matter from the
awful sense of certainty that it has come, now----

The trees were thick enough to conceal her from any passer-by on the path, the young half-unfolded
foliage of the birches fluttered over her head, while a solid fir or two stood, grim guardians,
yet catching pathetic airs from every passing wind to soothe her. But Elinor neither heard
nor saw lake, mountain, nor sunshine, nor spring breezes, but only the bit of paper in her
hand, and the uncomprehended words she had heard when it was given to her. It was not long,
however, before she perceived and knew exactly what it meant. It was a subpoena in the case
of "The Queen versus Brown," to attend and give evidence on a certain day in May, in London.
It was for a few minutes a mystery to her as great as it was alarming, notwithstanding the
swift and certain mental conviction she had that it concerned infallibly the one secret and
mystery of her life. But as she sat there pondering, those strange strays of recollection that
come to the mind, of things unnoted, yet unconsciously stored by memory, drew gradually about
her, piecing out the threads of conviction. She remembered to have heard her mother read, among
the many scraps which Mrs. Dennistoun loved to read out when the newspaper arrived, something
about a man who had absconded, whose name was Brown, who had brought ruin on many, and had
at length, after a number of years, ventured back to England and had been caught. It was one
of the weaknesses of Mrs. Dennistoun's advancing years to like these bits of news, though there
might be little interest in them to so quiet a household; and her daughter was wont to listen
with a very vague attention, noting but a word now and then, answering vaguely the lively remarks
her mother would make on the subjects. In this case even she had paid no attention; and yet,
the moment that strong keynote had been struck, which vibrated through her whole being, this
echo suddenly woke up and resounded as if it had been thundered in her ears--"Brown!" She began
to remember bit by bit--and yet what had she to do with Brown? He had not defrauded her; she
had never seen him; she knew nothing about his delinquencies. Then there came another note
faintly out of the distance of the years: her husband's image, I need not say, had come suddenly
into her sight with the first burst of this new event. His voice seemed to be in the air saying
half-forgotten things. What had he to do with this man? Oh, she knew very well there was something--something!
which she would have given her life not to recollect; which she knew in another moment would
flash completely upon her as she tried not to remember it. And then suddenly her working mind
caught another string which was not that; which was a relief to that for the moment. Brown!--who
was it that had talked of Brown?--and the books that were destroyed--and the----and the----day
that Phil Compton arrived at Windyhill?

Elinor rose up from her seat with a gasp. She put her arm round the rough stem of the fir-tree
to support herself, but it shook with her though there was no wind, only the softest of morning
airs. She saw before her a scene very different from this--the flowery garden at the cottage
with the copse and the sandy road beyond, and the man whom Phil had expected, whom he had been
so anxious to see--and his fingers catching hers, keeping her by him, and the questions to
which she had replied. Twenty years! What a long time it is! time enough for a boy to grow
into almost a man who had not been born or thought of--and yet what a moment, what a nothing!
Her mind flashed from that scene in the garden to the little hall in the cottage, the maid
stooping down fastening the bolt of the door, the calendar hanging on the wall with the big
6 showing so visible, so obtrusive, forcing itself as it were on the notice of all. "Only ten
days, Nell!" And the maid's glance upwards of shy sympathy, and the blank of Mrs. Dennistoun's
face, and his look. Oh, that look of his! which was true and yet so false; which meant so much
besides, and yet surely, surely meant love too!

The young fir-tree creaked and swayed in Elinor's grip. She unloosed it as if the slim thing
had cried under the pressure, and sat down again. She had nothing to grasp at, nothing. Oh,
her life had not been without support! Her mother--how extraordinary had been her good fortune
to have her mother to fall back upon when she was shipwrecked in her life--to have a home,
a shelter, a perpetual protector and champion, who, whether she approved or disapproved, would
forsake her never. And then the boy, God bless him! who might quiver like the little fir if
she flung herself upon him, but who, she knew, would stand as true. Oh, God forbid, God forbid
that he should ever know! Oh, God help her, God help her! how was she to keep it from his knowledge?
Elinor flung herself down upon the mossy knoll in her despair as this came pouring into her
mind a flood of horrible light, of unimaginable bitterness. He must not know, he must not know;
and yet how was it to be kept from his knowledge? It was a public thing; it could not be hid.
It would be in all the papers, his father's name: and the boy did not know he had a father
living. And his mother's evidence on behalf of her husband; and the boy thought she had no husband.

This was what had been said to her again and again and again. Sometime the boy must know--and
she had pushed it from her angrily, indignantly asking why should he know? though in the bottom
of her own heart she too was aware that it was the delusion of a fool, and that the time must
come---- But how could she ever have thought that it would come like this, that the boy would
discover his father through the summons of his mother to a public court to defend her husband
from a criminal accusation? Oh, life that pardons nothing! Oh, severe, unchanging heaven!--that
this should be the way!

And then there came into Elinor's mind wild thoughts of flight. She was not a woman whose nature
it was to endure. When things became intolerable to her she fled from them, as the reader knows;
escaped, shutting her ears to all advice and her heart to all thoughts except that life had
become intolerable, and that she could bear it no longer. It is not easy to hold the balance
even in such matters. Had Elinor fulfilled what would appear to many her first duty, and stood
by Phil through neglect, ill-treatment, and misery, as she had vowed, for better, for worse,
she would by this time have been not only a wretched but a deteriorated woman, and her son
most probably would have been injured both in his moral and intellectual being. What she had
done was not the abstract duty of her marriage vow, but it had been better--had it not been
better for them both? In such a question who is to be the judge? And now again there came surging
up into Elinor's veins the impulse of flight. To take the boy and fly. She could take him where
he wished most to go, to the scenes of that literature and history of which his schoolboy head
was full, to the happiest ideal wandering, his mother and he, two companions almost better
than lovers. How his eyes would brighten at the thought! among the summer seas, the golden
islands, the ideal countries--away from all the trouble and cares, all the burdens of the past,
all the fears of the future! Why should she be held by that villainous paper and obey that
dreadful summons? Why allow all her precautions, all the fabric of her life to fall in a moment?
Why pour upon the boy the horror of that revelation, when everything she had done and planned
all his life had been to keep it from him? In the sudden energy of that new possibility of
escape Elinor rose up again from the prostration of despair. She saw once more the line of
shining water at her feet full of heavenly splendour, the mountain tops sunning themselves
in the morning light, the peace and the beauty that was over all. And there was nothing needed
but a long journey, which would be delightful, full of pleasure and refreshment, to secure
her peace to her, and to save her boy.

When she had calmed herself with this new project, which, the moment it took form in her mind
seemed of itself, without reference to the cause, the most delightful project in the world
and full of pleasure--Elinor smoothed back her hair, put her garden hat, which had got a little
out of order, straight, and took her way again towards the house. Her heart had already escaped
from the shock and horror and was beating softly, exhausted yet refreshed, in her bosom. She
felt almost like a child who had sobbed all its troubles out, or like a convalescent recovering
from a brief but violent illness, and pathetically happy in the cessation of pain. She went
along quietly, slowly, by the woodland path among the trees full of the sweetness of the morning
which seemed to have come back to her. Should she say anything about it to her mother, or only
by degrees announce to her the plan she had begun to form for Pippo's pleasure, the long delightful
ramble which would come between his school-time and the university? She had almost decided
that she would do this when she went into the house; but she had not been half an hour with
her mother when her intention became untenable, for the good reason that she had already told
Mrs. Dennistoun of the new incident. They were not in the habit of keeping secrets from each
other, and in that case there is nothing in the world so difficult. It requires training to
keep one's affairs to one's self in the constant presence of those who are our nearest and
dearest. Some people may be capable of this effort of self-control, but Elinor was not. She
had showed that alarming paper to her mother with a partial return of her own terror at the
sight of it before she knew. And I need not say that for a short time Mrs. Dennistoun was overwhelmed
by that natural horror too.

"But," she said, "what do you know, what can you tell about this Mr. Brown, Elinor? You never
saw him in your life."

"I think I know what it means," said Elinor, with a sudden dark glow of colour, which faded
instantly, leaving her quite pale. She added hurriedly, "There were some books destroyed. I
cannot tell you the rights of the story. It is too dreadful altogether, but--another was exculpated
by the date of the day he arrived at Windyhill. This must be the reason I am called."

"The date he arrived--before your marriage, Elinor? But then they might call me, and you need
not appear."

"Not for the world, mother!" cried Elinor. The colour rose again and faded. "Besides, you do
not remember."

"Oh, I could make it out," said Mrs. Dennistoun. "It was when he came from Scotland, and went
off in the evening next day. I don't at this moment remember what the day was, but I could
make it out. It was about a fortnight before, it was----"

"Do you remember, mother, the little calendar in the hall, and what it marked, and what he said?"

"I remember, of course, perfectly well the little calendar in the hall. You gave it me at Christmas,
and it was always out of order, and never kept right. But I could make it out without that."

"You must not think of it for a moment," cried Elinor, with a shudder. There had been so many
things to think of that it had scarcely occurred to her what it was to which she had to bear
witness. She told her mother hurriedly the story of that incident, and then she added, without
stopping to take breath, "But I will not appear. I cannot appear. We must keep it out of the
papers, at every cost. Mother, do not think it dreadful of me. I will run away with Pippo;
far away, if you will not be anxious. This is just his chance between school and college. I
will take him to Greece."

"To Greece, Elinor?" Mrs. Dennistoun cried, with almost a shriek.

"Mother, dear, it is not so very far away."

"I am not thinking how far away it is, Elinor. And leave his father's reputation to suffer?
Leave him perhaps to be ruined--by a false charge?"

"Oh, mother," cried Elinor, starting to her feet. She was quite unprepared for such remonstrance.

"My dear, I have not opposed you; though there have been many things I have scarcely approved
of. But, Elinor, this must not be. Run away from the law? Allow another to suffer when you
can clear him? Elinor, Elinor, this must not be--unless I can go and be his witness in your
place. I might do that," said Mrs. Dennistoun, seriously. She paused a moment, and then she
said, "But I think you are wrong about the sixth. He stayed only one night, and the night he
went away was the night that Alick Hudson--who was going up for his examination. I can make
it out exactly, if you will give me a little time to think it over. My poor child! that you
should have this to disturb your peace. But I will go, Elinor. I can clear him as well as you."

Elinor stood up before her, pallid as a ghost. "For God's sake, mother, not another word,"
she said, with a dreadful solemnity. "The burden is mine, and I must bear it. Let us not say
a word more."

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

I will not confuse the reader with a description of all Elinor's thoughts during the slow progress
of that afternoon and evening, which were as the slow passing of a year to her impatient spirit.
She took the usual afternoon walk with her mother soberly, as became Mrs. Dennistoun's increasing
years, and then she made a pretext of some errands in the village to occupy her until dark,
or rather to leave her free to twist the thread of her own thoughts as she went along the silent
country road. Her thoughts varied in the afternoon from those which had seized upon her with
such vulture's claws in the morning; but they were not less overwhelming in that respect. Her
mother's suggestion that she and not Elinor should be the witness of that date, and then her
ponderings as to that date, her slow certainty that she could make it out, or puzzle it out,
as Elinor in her impatience said, which was the last of all things to be desired--had stung
the daughter into a new and miserable realization of what it was that was demanded of her,
which nobody could do but she. What was it that would be demanded of her? To stand up in the
face of God and man and swear to tell the truth, and tell--a lie: or else let the man who had
been her husband, the love of her youth, the father of her boy, sink into an abyss of shame.
She thought rapidly, knowing nothing, that surely there could be no punishment for him, even
if it were proved, at the long interval of twenty years. But, shame--there would be shame.
Nothing could save him from that. Shame which would descend more or less to his son. And then
Elinor reflected, with hot moisture coming out upon her forehead against the cold breeze of
the spring night, on what would be asked of her. Oh, no doubt, it would be cleverly done! She
would be asked if she remembered his visit, and why she remembered it. She would be led on
carefully to tell the story of the calendar in the hall, and of how it was but ten days before
her marriage--the last hurried, unexpected visit of the lover before he came as a bridegroom
to take her away. It would be all true, every word, and yet it would be a lie. And standing
up there in that public place, she would be made to repeat it, as she had done in the flowery
garden, in the sunshine, twenty years ago--then dazed and bewildered, not knowing what she
did, and with something of the blind confidence of youth and love in saying what she was told
to say; but now with clearer insight, with a horrible certainty of the falsehood of that true
story, and the object with which it was required of her. Happily for herself, Elinor did not
think of the ordeal of cross-examination through which witnesses have to pass. She would not,
I think, have feared that if the instinct of combativeness had been roused in her: her quick
wit and ready spirit would not have failed in defending herself, and in maintaining the accuracy
of the fact to which she had to bear witness. It was herself, and not an opposing counsel,
that was alarming to Elinor. But I have promised that the reader should not be compelled to
go through all the trouble and torment of her thoughts.

Dinner, with the respect which is necessary for the servant who waits, whether that may be
a solemn butler with his myrmidons, or a little maid--always makes a pause in household communications;
but when the ladies were established afterwards by the pleasant fireside which had been their
centre of life for so many years, and with the cheerful lamp on the table between them which
had lighted so many cheerful talks, readings, discussions, and consultations, the new subject
of anxiety and interest immediately came forth again. It was Mrs. Dennistoun who spoke first.
She had grown older, as we all do; she wore spectacles as she worked, and often a white shawl
on her shoulders, and was--as sometimes her daughter felt, with shame of herself to remark
it--a little slower in speech, a little more pertinacious and insistent, not perhaps perceiving
with such quick sympathy the changes and fluctuations of other minds, and whether it was advisable
or not to follow a subject to the bitter end. She said, looking up from her knitting, with
a little rhetorical movement of her hand which Elinor feared, and which showed that she felt
herself on assured and certain ground:

"My dear, I have been thinking. I have made it out day by day. God knows there were plenty
of landmarks in it to keep any one from forgetting. I can now make out certainly the day--of
which we were speaking; and if you will give me your attention for a minute or two, Elinor,
you will see that whatever the calendar said--which I never noticed, for it was as often wrong
as right--you are making a mis----"

"Oh, for Heaven's sake, mother," cried Elinor, "don't let us talk of that any more!"

"I have no desire to talk of it, my dear child; but for what you said I should never---- But
of course we must take some action about this thing--this paper you have got. And it seems
to me that the best thing would be to write to John, and see whether he could not manage to
get it transferred from you to me. I can't see what difficulty there could be about that."

"I would not have it for the world, mother! And what good would it do? The great thing in it,
the dreadful thing, would be unchanged. Whether you appear or me, Pippo would be made to know,
all the same, what it has been our joint object to conceal from him all his life."

Mrs. Dennistoun did not say anything, but she would not have been mortal if she had not, very
slightly, but yet very visibly to keen eyes, shaken her head.

"I know what you mean," said Elinor, vehemently, "that it has been I, and not we, whose object
has been to conceal it from him. Oh, yes, I know you are right; but at least you consented
to it, you have helped in it, it is your doing as well as mine."

"Elinor, Elinor!" cried her mother, who, having always protested, was not prepared for this
accusation.

"Is there any advantage to be got," said Elinor, like an injured and indignant champion of
the right, "in opening up the whole question over again now?"

What could poor Mrs. Dennistoun do? She was confounded, as she often had been before, by those
swift and sudden tactics. She gave a glance up at her daughter over her spectacles, but she
said nothing. Argument, she knew by long experience, was difficult to keep up with such an
opponent.

"But John is an idea," said Elinor. "I don't know why I should not have thought of him. He
may suggest something that could be done."

"I thought of him, of course, at once," said Mrs. Dennistoun, not able to refrain from that
small piece of self-assertion. "It is not a time that it would be easy for him to leave town;
but at least you could write and lay your difficulties before him, and suggest----"

"Oh, you may be sure, mother," cried Elinor, "I know what I have to say."

"I never doubted it, my dear," said Mrs. Dennistoun, gently.

And then there was a little pause. They sat and worked, the elder lady stumbling a little over
her knitting, her thoughts being so much engaged; the younger one plying a flying needle, the
passion and impetus of her thoughts lending only additional swiftness and vigour to everything
she did. And for ten minutes or more there was nothing to be heard in the room but the little
drop of ashes from the fire, the sudden burst of a little gas-flame from the coals, the rustle
of Elinor's arm as it moved. The cat sat with her tail curled round her before the fire, the
image of dignified repose, winking at the flames. The two human inhabitants, save for the movements
of their hands, might have been in wax, they were so still. Suddenly, however, the quietness
was broken by an energetic movement. Elinor threw her work down on the table and rose from
her chair. She went to the window and drew the curtain aside, and looked out upon the night.
She shut it carefully again, and going to the writing-table, struck a match and lighted the
candles there, and sat down and began, or appeared to begin, to write. Then she rose quickly
again and returned to the table at which Mrs. Dennistoun was still seated, knitting on, but
watching every movement of her restless companion. "Mother," she said, "I can't write, I have
far too much to say. I will run up to town to-morrow myself and see John."

"To town, Elinor, by yourself? My dear, you forget it is not an hour's journey, as it was to
Windyhill."

"I know that very well, mother. But even the journey will be an advantage. The movement will
do me good, and I can tell John much better than I could write. Who could write about a complicated
business like this? He will understand me when he sees me at half a word; whereas in writing
one can never explain. Don't oppose me, please, mother! I feel that to do something, to get
myself in motion, is the only thing for me now."

"I will not oppose you, Elinor. I have done so, perhaps, too little, my dear; but we will not
speak of that. No doubt, as you say, you will understand each other better if you tell him
the circumstances face to face. But, oh, my dear child, do nothing rash! Be guided by John;
he is a prudent adviser. The only thing is that he, no more than I, has ever been able to resist
you, Elinor, if you had set your heart upon any course. Oh, my dear, don't go to John with
a foregone conclusion. Hear first what he has to say!"

Elinor came behind her mother with one of those quick returns of affectionate impulse which
were natural to her, and put her arms suddenly round Mrs. Dennistoun. "You have always been
far too good to me, mamma," she said, kissing her tenderly, "both John and you."

And next morning she carried out her swiftly conceived intention and went to town, as the reader
is aware. A long railway journey is sometimes soothing to one distracted with agitation and
trouble. The quiet and the noise, which serves as a kind of accompaniment, half silencing,
half promoting too active thought; the forced abstraction and silence, and semi-imprisonment
of mind and body, which are equally restless, but which in that enclosure are bound to self-restraint,
exercise, in spite of all struggles of the subject, a subduing effect. And it was a strange
thing that in the seclusion of the railway compartment in which she travelled alone there came
for the first time to Elinor a softening thought, the sudden sensation of a feeling, of which
she had not been sensible for years, towards the man whose name she bore. It occurred to her
quite suddenly, she could not tell how, as if some one invisible had thrown that reflection
into her mind (and I confess that I am of opinion they do: those who are around us, who are
unseen, darting into our souls thoughts which do not originate with us, thoughts not always
of good, blasphemies as well as blessings)--it occurred to her, I say, coming into her mind
like an arrow, that after all she had not been so well hidden as she thought all these years,
seeing that she had been found at once without difficulty, it appeared, when she was wanted.
Did this mean that he had known where she was all the time--known, but never made any attempt
to disturb her quiet? The thought startled her very much, revealing to her a momentary glimpse
of something that looked like magnanimity, like consideration and generous self-restraint.
Could these things be? He could have hurt her very much had he pleased, even during the time
she had remained at Windyhill, when certainly he knew where she was: and he had not done so.
He might have taken her child from her: at least he might have made her life miserable with
fears of losing her child: and he had not done so. If indeed it was true that he had known
where she was all the time and had never done anything to disturb her, what did that mean?
This thought gave Elinor perhaps the first sense of self-reproach and guilt that she had ever
known towards this man, who was her husband, yet whom she had not seen for more than eighteen
years.

And then there was another thing. After that interval he was not afraid to put himself into
her hands--to trust to her loyalty for his salvation. He knew that she could betray him--and
he knew equally well that she would not do so, notwithstanding the eighteen years of estrangement
and mutual wrong that lay between. It did not matter that the loyalty he felt sure of would
be a false loyalty, an upholding of what was not true. He would think little of that, as likely
as not he had forgotten all about that. He would know that her testimony would clear him, and
he would not think of anything else; and even did he think of it the fact of a woman making
a little mis-statement like that would never have affected Philip. But the strange thing was
that he had no fear she would revenge herself by standing up against him--no doubt of her response
to his appeal; he was as ready to put his fate in her hands as if she had been the most devoted
of wives--his constant companion and champion. This had the most curious effect upon her mind,
almost greater than the other. She had shown no faith in him, but he had faith in her. Reckless
and guilty as he was, he had not doubted her. He had put it in her power to convict him not
only of the worst accusation that was brought against him, but of a monstrous trick to prove
his alibi, and a cruel wrong to her compelling her to uphold that as true. She was able to
expose him, if she chose, as no one else could do; but he had not been afraid of that. This
second thought, which burst upon Elinor without any volition of her own, had the most curious
effect upon her. She abstained carefully, anxiously, from allowing herself to be drawn into
making any conclusion from these darts of unintended thoughts. But they moved her in spite
of herself. They made her think of him, which she had for a long time abstained from doing.
She had shut her heart for years from any recollection of her husband, trying to ignore his
existence in thought as well as in fact. And she had succeeded for a long time in doing this.
But now in a moment all her precautions were thrown to the winds. He came into her memory with
a sudden rush for which she was no way responsible, breaking all the barriers she had put up
against him: that he should have known where she was all this time, and never disturbed her,
respected her solitude all these years--that when the moment of need came he should, without
a word to conciliate her, without an explanation or an apology, have put his fate into her
hands---- To the reader who understands I need not say more of the effect upon the mind of
Elinor, hasty, generous, impatient as she was of these two strange facts. There are many in
the world who would have given quite a different explanation--who would have made out of the
fact that he had not disturbed her only the explanation that Phil Compton was tired of his
wife and glad to get rid of her at any price: and who would have seen in his appeal to her
now only audacity combined with the conviction that she would not compromise herself by saying
anything more than she could help about him. I need not say which of these interpretations
would have been the true one. But the first will understand and not the other what it was that
for the first time for eighteen years awakened a struggle and controversy which she could not
ignore, and vainly endeavoured to overcome, in Elinor's heart.

CHAPTER XXXIX.

Elinor had not been three days gone, indeed her mother had but just received a hurried note
announcing her arrival in London, when as she sat alone in the house which had become so silent,
Mrs. Dennistoun suddenly became aware of a rising of sound of the most jubilant, almost riotous
description. It began by the barking of Yarrow, the old colley, who was fond of lying at the
gate watching in a philosophic way of his own the mild traffic of the country road, the children
trooping by to school, who hung about him in clusters, with lavish offerings of crust and scraps
of biscuit, and all the leisurely country flâneurs whom the good dog despised, not thinking
that he himself did nothing but flâner at his own door in the sun. A bark from Yarrow was no
small thing in the stillness of the spring afternoon, and little Urisk, the terrier, who lay
wrapt in dreams at Mrs. Dennistoun's feet, heard where he lay entranced in the folds of sleep
and cocked up an eager ear and uttered a subdued interrogation under his breath. The next thing
was no bark, but a shriek of joy from Yarrow, such as could mean nothing in the world but "Philip!"
or Pippo, which was what no doubt the dogs called him between following their mistress. Urisk
heard and understood. He made but one spring from the footstool on which he lay and flung himself
against the door. Mrs. Dennistoun sat for a moment and listened, much disturbed. When some
troublous incident occurs in the deep quiet of domestic life how often is it followed by another,
and her heart turned a little sick. She was not comforted even by the fact that Urisk was waggling
not his tail only, but his whole little form in convulsions of joy, barking, crying aloud for
the door to open, to let him forth. By this time all the friendly dogs about had taken up the
sound out of sympathy with Yarrow's yells of delight--and into this came the clang of the gate,
the sound of wheels, an outcry in a human voice, that of Barbara, the maid--and then a young
shout that rang through the air--"Where's my mother, Barbara, where's granny?" Philip, it may
be imagined, did not wait for any answer, but came in headlong. Yarrow leaping after him, Urisk
springing into the air to meet him--himself in too great a hurry to heed either, flinging himself
upon the astonished lady who rose to meet him, with a sudden kiss, and a "Where's my mother,
granny?" of eager greeting.

"Pippo! Good gracious, boy, what's brought you home now?"

"Nothing but good news," he said, "so good I thought I must come. I've got it, granny: where
is my mother----"

"You've got it?" she said, so full of other thoughts that she could not recollect what it was
he meant. Pippo thought, as Elinor sometimes thought, that his granny was getting slow of understanding--not
so bright as she used to be in her mind.

"Oh, granny, you've been dozing: the scholarship! I've got it--I thought you would know the
moment you heard me at the door----"

"My dear boy," she said, putting her arms about him, while the tall boy stood for the homage
done to him--the kiss of congratulation. "You have got the scholarship! notwithstanding Howard
and Musgrave and the hard fight there was to be----"

Pippo nodded, with a bright face of pleasure. "But," he said--"I can't say I'm sorry I've got
it, granny--but I wish there had been another for Musgrave: for he worked harder than I did,
and he wanted so to win. But so did I, for that matter. And where is my mother all this time?"

"How delighted she will be: and what a comfort to her just now when she is upset and troubled!
My dear, it'll be a dreadful disappointment to you: your mother is in London. She had to hurry
off the day before yesterday--on business."

"In London!" cried Pippo. His countenance fell: he was so much disappointed that for a moment,
big boy as he was, he looked ready to cry. He had come in bursting with his news, expecting
a reception almost as tumultuous as that given him by the dogs outside. And he found only his
grandmother, who forgot what it was he was "in for"--and no mother at all!

"It is a disappointment, Pippo--and it will be such a disappointment to her not to hear it
from your own lips: but you must telegraph at once, and that will be next best. She has some
worrying business--things that she hates to look after--and this will give her a little heart."

"What a bore!" said Pippo, with his crest down and the light gone out of him. He gave himself
up to the dogs who had been jumping about him, biding their time. "Yarrow knew," he said, laughing,
to get the water out of his eyes. "He gave me a cheer whenever he saw me, dear old fellow--and
little Risky too----"

"And only granny forgot," said Mrs. Dennistoun; "that was very hard upon you, Pippo; my thoughts
were all with your mother. And I couldn't think how you could get back at this time----"

"Well," said the boy, "my work's over, you know. There's nothing for a fellow to do after he's
got the scholarship. I needn't go back at all--unless you and my mother wish it. I've--in a
sort of a way, done everything that I can do. Don't laugh at me, granny!"

"Laugh at you, my boy! It is likely I should laugh at you. Don't you know I am as proud of
you as your mother herself can be? I am glad and proud," said Mrs. Dennistoun, "for I am glad
for her as well as for you. Now, Pippo, you want something to eat."

The boy looked up with a laugh. "Yes, granny," he said, "you always divine that sort of thing.
I do."

Mrs. Dennistoun did not occupy her mind with any thought of that little unintentional and grateful
jibe--that she always divined that sort of thing. Among the other great patiences of her life
she had learnt to know that the mother and son, loving and tender as they were, had put her
back unconsciously into the proper place of the old woman--always consulted, always thought
of, never left out; but divining chiefly that sort of thing, the actual needs, the more apparent
thoughts of those about her. She knew it, but she did not dwell upon it--sometimes it made
her smile, but it scarcely hurt her, and never made her bitter, she comprehended it all so
well. Meanwhile Pippo, left alone, devoted himself to the dogs for a minute or two, making
them almost too happy. Then, at the very climax of riotous enjoyment, cast them off with a
sudden, "Down, Yarrow!" which took all the curl in a moment out of the noble tail with which
Yarrow was sweeping all the unconsidered trifles off Mrs. Dennistoun's work-table. The young
autocrat walked to the window as he shook off his adoring vassal, and stared out for a little
with his hands deeply dug into his pockets. And then a new idea came into Pippo's head; the
most brilliant new idea, which restored at once the light to his eyes and elevation to his
crest. He said nothing of this, however, till he had done justice to the excellent luncheon,
while his grandmother, seated beside him in the dining-room with her knitting, looked on with
pride and pleasure and saw him eat. This was a thing, they were all of accord, which she always
thoroughly understood.

"You will run out now and telegraph to your mother. She is in the old rooms in Ebury Street,
Pippo."

"Yes, granny; don't you think now a fellow of my age, having done pretty well and all that,
might be trusted to--make a little expedition out of his own head?"

"My dear! you have always been trusted, Pippo, you know. I can't remember when your mother
or I either have shown any want of trust----"

"Oh, it's not that," said Pippo, confused. "I know I've had lots, lots--far more than most
fellows--of my own way. It was not that exactly. I meant without consulting any one, just to
do a thing out of my own head."

"I have no doubt it will be quite a right thing, Pippo; but I should know better if you were
to tell me."

"That would scarcely be doing it out of my own head, would it, granny? But I can't keep a thing
to myself; now Musgrave can, you know; that's the great difference. I suppose it is having
nobody but my mother and you, who always spoil me, that has made me that I can't keep a secret."

"It is something about making it up to Musgrave for not winning the scholarship?"

Philip grew red all over with a burning blush of shame. "What a beast I am!" he said. "You
will scarcely believe me, but I had forgotten that--though I do wish I could. I do wish there
was any way----No, granny, it was all about myself."

"Well, my dear?" she said, in her benignant, all-indulgent grandmother's voice.

"It is no use going beating about the bush," he said. "Granny, I'm not going to telegraph to
mamma. I'll run up to London by the night mail."

"Pippo!"

"Well, it isn't so extraordinary; naturally I should like to tell her better than to write.
It didn't quite come off, my telling it to you, did it? but my mother will be excited about
it--and then it will be a surprise seeing me at all--and then if she is worried by business
it will be a good thing to have me to stand by her. And--why there are a hundred reasons, granny,
as you must see. And then I should like it above all."

"My dear," said Mrs. Dennistoun, trembling a little. She had time during this long speech to
collect herself, to get over the first shock, but her nerves still vibrated. "In ordinary circumstances,
I should think it an excellent plan. And you have worked well for it, and won your holiday;
and your mother always enjoys wandering about town with you. Still, Pippo----"

"Now what can there be against it?" the boy said, with the same spark of fire coming into his
blue eyes which had often been seen in Elinor's hazel ones. He was like the Comptons, a refined
image of his father, with the blue eyes and very dark hair which had once made Phil Compton
irresistible. Pippo had the habit, I am sorry to say, of being a little impatient with his
grandmother. Her objections seemed old-world and obsolete at the first glance.

"The chief thing against it is that I don't think your mother--would wish it, Pippo."

"Mamma--think me a bore, perhaps!" the lad cried, with a laugh of almost scornful amusement
at this ridiculous idea.

"She would never, of course, think you a bore in any circumstances--but she will be very much
confined--she could not take you with her to--lawyers' offices. She will scarcely have any
time to herself."

"What is this mysterious business, granny?"

"Indeed, Pippo, I can scarcely tell you. It is something connected with old times--that she
wishes to have settled and done with. I did not inquire very closely; neither, I think, should
you. You know your poor mother has had troubles in her life----"

"Has she?" said Pippo, with wide open eyes. "I have never seen any. I think, perhaps, don't
you know, granny, ladies--make mountains of molehills--or so at least people say----"

"Do they?" said Mrs. Dennistoun, with a laugh. "So you have begun to learn that sort of thing
already, Pippo, even here at the end of the world!"

Pippo was a little mortified by her laugh, and a little ashamed of what he had said. It is
very tempting at eighteen to put on a man's superiority, yet he was conscious that it was perhaps
a little ungenerous, he who owed all that he was and had to these two ladies; but naturally
he was the more angry because of this.

"I suppose," he said, "that what is in every book that ever was written is likely to be true!
But that has nothing to do with the question. I won't do anything against you if you forbid
me absolutely, granny; but short of that I will go----"

Mrs. Dennistoun looked at the boy with all the heat in him of his first burst of independence.
It is only wise to compute the forces opposed to one before one launches a command which one
may not have force to ensure obedience to. He said that he would not disobey her "absolutely"
with his lips; but his eyes expressed a less dutiful sentiment. She had no mind to be beaten
in such a struggle. Elinor had complained of her mother in her youth that she was too reasonable,
too unwilling to command, too reluctant to assume the responsibility of an act; and it was
not to be supposed that she had mended of this, in all the experience she had had of her impatient
daughter, and under the influence of so many additional years. She looked at Philip, and concluded
that he would at least find some way of eluding her authority if she exercised it, and it did
not consist with her dignity to be either "absolutely" or partially disobeyed.

"You forget," she said, "that I have never taken such authority upon me since you were a child.
I will not forbid you to do what you have set your heart upon. I can only say, Philip, that
I don't think your mother would wish you to go----"

"If that's all, granny," said the boy, "I think I can take my mother into my own hands. But
why do you call me Philip? You never call me that but when you are angry."

"Was I ever angry?" she said, with a smile; "but if we are to consider you a man, looking down
upon women, and taking your movements upon your own responsibility, my dear, it would be ridiculous
that you should be little Pippo any more."

"Not little Pippo," he said, with a boyish, complacent laugh, rising up to his full height.
A young man nearly six feet high, with a scholarship in his pocket, how is he to be expected
to take the law from his old grandmother as to what he is to do?

And young Philip did go to town triumphantly by the night mail. He had never done such a thing
before, and his sense of manly independence, of daring, almost of adventure, was more delightful
than words could say. There was not even any one, except the man who had driven him into Penrith,
to see him away, he who was generally accompanied to the last minute by precautions, and admonitions,
and farewells. To feel himself dart away into the night with nobody to look back to on the
platform, no gaze, half smiling, half tearful, to follow him, was of itself an emancipation
to Pippo. He was a good boy and no rebel against the double maternal bond which had lain so
lightly yet so closely upon him all his life. It was only for a year or two that he had suspected
that this was unusual, or even imagined that for a growing man the sway of two ladies, and
even their devotion, might make others smile. Perhaps he had been a little more particular
in his notions, in his manners, in his fastidious dislike to dirt and careless habits, than
was common in the somewhat rough north country school which had so risen in scholastic note
under the last head master, but which was very far from the refinements of Eton. And lately
it had begun to dawn upon him that a mother and a grandmother to watch over him and care for
him in everything might be perhaps a little absurd for a young man of his advanced age. Thus
his escapade, which was against the will of his elder guardian, and without the knowledge of
his mother--which was entirely his own act, and on his own responsibility, went to Philip's
head, and gave him a sort of intoxication of pleasure. That his mother should be displeased,
really displeased, should not want him--incredible thought! never entered into his mind save
as an accountable delusion of granny's. His mother not want him! All the arguments in the world
would never have got that into young Pippo's head.

Mrs. Dennistoun waking up in the middle of the night to think of the boy rushing on through
the dark on his adventurous way, recollected only then with much confusion and pain that she
ought to have telegraphed to Elinor, who might be so engaged as to make it very embarrassing
for her in her strange circumstances to see Pippo--that the boy was coming. In her agitation
she had forgotten this precaution. Was it perhaps true, as the young ones thought, that she
was getting a little slower in her movements, a little dulled in her thoughts?

CHAPTER XL.

John Tatham had in vain attempted to persuade Elinor to come to his house, to dine there in
comfort--he was going out himself--so that at least in this time of excitement and trouble
she might have the careful service and admirable comfort of his well-managed house. Elinor
preferred her favourite lodgings and a cup of tea to all the luxuries of Halkin Street. And
she was fit for no more consultations that night. She had many, many things to think of, and
some new which as yet she barely comprehended. The rooms in Ebury Street were small, and they
were more or less dingy, as such rooms are; but they were comfortable enough, and had as much
of home to Elinor as repeated visits there with all her belongings could give them. The room
in which she slept was next to that in which her boy had usually slept. That was enough to
make it no strange place. And I need not say that it became the scene of many discussions during
the few days that followed. The papers by this time were full of the strange trial which was
coming on: the romance of commercial life and ruin--the guilty man who had been absent so long,
enjoying his ill-gotten gains, and who now was dragged back into the light to give an account
of himself--and of other guilt perhaps less black than his own, yet dreadful enough to hear
of. The story of the destroyed books was a most remarkable and picturesque incident in the
narrative. The leading papers looked up their own account of the facts given at the time, and
pointed out how evidently justified by the new facts made known to the public was the theory
they had themselves given forth. As these theories, however, were very different, and as all
claimed to be right, perhaps the conclusion was less certain than this announcement gave warrant
to believe. But each and all promised "revelations" of the most surprising kind--involving
some of the highest aristocracy, the democratic papers said--bringing to light an exciting
story of the private relations between husband and wife, said those of society, and revealing
a piquant chapter of social history hushed up at the time. It was a modest print indeed that
contented itself with the statement that its readers would find a romance of real life involved
in the trial which was about to take place. Elinor did not, fortunately, see all these comments.
The Times and the Morning Post were dignified and reticent, and she did not read, and was indeed
scarcely cognisant of the existence of most of the others. But the faintest reference to the
trial was enough, it need hardly be said, to make the blood boil in her veins.

It was a curious thing in her state of mind, and with the feelings she had towards her husband's
family, that one of the first things she did on establishing herself in her Ebury Street rooms,
was to look for an old "Peerage" which had lain for several years she remembered on a certain
shelf. Genteel lodgings in Ebury Street which did not possess somewhere an old "Peerage" would
be out of the world indeed. She found it in the same corner as of old, where she had noted
it so often and avoided it as if it had been a serpent; but now the first thing she did, as
soon as her tray was brought her, and all necessary explanations given, and the door shut,
was to take the book furtively from its place, almost as if she were afraid of what she should
see. What a list there was of sons of Lord St. Serf! some she had never known, who died young:
and Reginald in India, and Hal, who was so kind--what a good laugh he had, she remembered,
not a joyless cackle like Mariamne's, a good natural laugh, and a kind light in his eyes: and
he had been kind. She could remember ever so many things, nothings, things that made a little
difference in the dull, dull cloudy sky of a neglected wife. Poor Hal! and he too was gone,
and St. Serf dying, and---- Pippo the heir!--Pippo was perhaps, for any thing she knew, Lord
Lomond now.

To say that this did not startle Elinor, did not make her heart beat, did not open new complications
and vistas in life, would be a thing impossible. Pippo Lord Lomond! Pippo, whom she had feared
to expose to his father's influence, whom she had kept apart, who did not know anything about
himself except that he was her son--had she kept and guarded the boy thus in the very obscurity
of life, in the stillest and most protected circumstances, only to plunge him suddenly at last,
without preparation, without warning, into the fiery furnace of temptation, into a region where
he might pardonably (perhaps) put himself beyond her influence, beyond her guidance? Poor Elinor!
and yet she was not wholly to be pitied either. For her heart was fired by the thought of her
boy's elevation in spite of herself. It did not occur to her that such an elevation for him
meant something also for her. That view of the case she did not take into consideration for
a moment. Nay, she did not think of it. But that Pippo should be Lord Lomond went through her
like an arrow--like an arrow that gave a wound, acute and sharp, yet no pain, if such a thing
could be said. That he should discover his father had been the danger before her all his life,
but if he must find out that he had a father that was a way in which it might not be all pain.
I do not pretend that she was very clear in all these thoughts. Indeed, she was not clear at
all. John Tatham, knowing but one side, had begun to think vaguely of Elinor what Elinor thought
of her mother, that her mind was not quite as of old, not so bright nor so vivid, not so clear
in coming to a conclusion; had he known everything he might not have been so sure even on that
point. But then had he known everything that Elinor knew, and been aware of what it was which
Elinor had been summoned by all the force of old fidelity and the honour of her name to do,
John would have been too much horrified to have been able to form an opinion. No, poor Elinor
was not at all clear in her thoughts--less clear than ever after these revelations--the way
before her seemed dark in whatever way she looked at it, complications were round her on every
side. She had instinctively, without a word said, given up that idea of flight. Who was it
that said the heir to a peerage could not be hid? John had said it, she remembered, and John
was always right. If she was to take him away to the uttermost end of the earth, they would
seek him out and find him. And then there was--his father, who had known all the time, had
known and never disturbed her----No wonder that poor Elinor's thoughts were mixed and complicated.
She walked up and down the room, not thinking, but letting crowds and flights of thoughts like
birds fly through her mind; no longer clear indeed as she had been wont to be, no longer coming
to sudden, sharp conclusions, admitting possibilities of which Elinor once upon a time would
never have thought.

And day by day as he saw her, John Tatham understood her less and less. He did not know what
she meant, what she was going to do, what were her sentiments towards her husband, what were
her intentions towards her son. He had found out a great deal about the case, merely as a case,
and it began to be clear to him where Elinor's part came in. Elinor Compton could not have
appeared on her husband's behalf, and whether there might not arise a question whether, being
now his wife, her evidence could be taken on what had happened before she was his wife, was
by no means sure--"Why didn't they call your mother?" John said, as Mrs. Dennistoun also had
said--but he did not at all understand, how could he? the dismay that came over Elinor, and
the "Not for the world," which came from her lips. He had come in to see her in the morning
as he went down to his chambers, on the very morning when Pippo, quite unexpected and also
not at all desired, was arriving at Euston Square.

"It would have been much better," he said, "in every way if they had called your mother--who
of course must know exactly what you know, Elinor, in respect to this matter----"

"No," said Elinor with dry lips. "She knows nothing. She--calculates back by little incidents--she
does not remember: I--do----"

"That's natural, I suppose," said John, with an impatient sigh and a half-angry look. "Still--my
aunt----"

"Would do no good at all: you may believe me, John. Don't let us speak of this any more. I
know what has to be done: my mother would twist herself up among her calculations--about Alick
Hudson's examination and I know not what. Whereas I--there is nothing, nothing more to be said.
I thought I could escape, and it is your doing if I now see that I cannot escape. I can but
hope that Providence will protect my boy. He is at school, where they have little time for
reading the papers. He may never even see--or at least if he does he may think it is another
Compton--some one whom he never heard of----"

"And how if he becomes Lord Lomond, as I said, before the secret is out?"

"Oh, John," cried Elinor, wringing her hands--"don't, don't torment me with that idea now--let
only this be past and then: Oh, I see, I see--I am not a fool--I perceive that I cannot hide
him as you say if that happens. But oh, John, for pity's sake let this be over first! Let us
not hurry everything on at the same time. He is at school. What do schoolboys care for the
newspapers, especially for trials in the law courts? Oh, let this be over first! A boy at school--and
he need never know----"

It was at this moment that a hansom drew up, and a rattling peal came at the door. Hansoms
are not rare in Ebury Street, and how can one tell in these small houses if the peal is at
one's door or the next? Elinor was not disturbed. She paid no attention. She expected no one,
she was afraid of nothing new for the present. Surely, surely, as she said, there was enough
for the present. It did not seem possible that any new incident should come now.

"I do not want to torment you, Elinor--you may imagine I would be the last--I would only save
you if I could from what must be---- What! what? who's this?--PHILIP! the boy!"

The door had burst open with an eager, impatient hand upon it, and there stood upon the threshold,
in all the mingled excitement and fatigue of his night journey, pale, sleep in his eyes, yet
happy expectation, exultation, the certainty of open arms to receive him, and cries of delight--the
boy. He stood for a second looking into the strange yet familiar room. John Tatham had sprung
to his feet and stood startled, hesitating, while young Philip's eyes, noting him with a glance,
flashed past him to the other more important, more beloved, the mother whom he had expected
to rush towards him with an outcry of joy.

And Elinor sat still in her chair, struck dumb, grown pale like a ghost, her eyes wide open,
her lips apart. The sight of the boy, her beloved child, her pride and delight, was as a horrible
spectacle to Elinor. She stared at him like one horrified, and neither moved nor spoke.

"Elinor!" cried John, terrified, "there's nothing wrong. Don't you see it's Philip? Boy, what
do you mean by giving her such a fright? She's fainting, I believe."

"I--give her a fright!" cried, half in anguish, half in indignation, the astonished boy.

"No, I'm not fainting. Pippo! there's nothing wrong--at home?" Elinor cried, holding out her
hand to him--coming to herself, which meant only awakening to the horror of a danger far more
present than she had ever dreamt, and to the sudden sight not of her boy, but of that Nemesis
which she had so carefully prepared for herself, and which had been awaiting her for years.
She was not afraid of anything wrong at home. It was the first shield she could find in the
shock which had almost paralysed her, to conceal her terror and distress at the sight of him
from the astonished, disappointed, mortified, and angry boy.

"I thought," he said, "you would have been glad to see me, mother! No, there's nothing wrong
at home."

"Thank heaven for that!" cried Elinor, feeling herself more and more a hypocrite as she recovered
from the shock. "Pippo, I was saying this moment that you were at school. The words were scarcely
off my lips--and then to see you in a moment, standing there."

"I thought," he repeated again, trembling with the disappointment and mortification, wounded
in his cheerful, confident affection, and in his young pride, the monarch of all he surveyed--"I
thought you would have been pleased to see me, mother!"

"Of course," said John, cheerfully, "your mother is glad to see you: and so am I, you impetuous
boy, though you don't take the trouble of shaking hands with me. He wants to be kissed and
coddled, Elinor, and I must be off to my chambers. But I should like to know first what's up,
boy? You've got something to say."

"Pippo, what is it, my dearest? You did give me a great fright, and I am still nervous a little.
Tell me, Pippo; something has brought you--your uncle John is right. I can see it in your eyes.
You've got something to tell me!"

The tired and excited boy looked from one to another, two faces both full of a veiled but intense
anxiety, looking at him as if what they expected was no good news. He burst out into a big,
hoarse laugh, the only way to keep himself from crying. "You don't even seem to remember anything
about it," he cried, flinging himself down in the nearest chair; "and for my part I don't care
any longer whether any one knows or not."

And Elinor, whose thoughts were on such different things--whose whole mind was absorbed in
the question of what he could have heard about the trial, about his father, about the new and
strange future before him--gazed at him with eyes that seemed hollowed out all round with devouring
anxiety. "What is it?" she said, "what is it? For God's sake tell me! What have you heard?"

It goes against all prejudices to imagine that John Tatham, a man who never had had a child,
an old bachelor not too tolerant of youth, should have divined the boy better than his mother.
But he did, perhaps because he was a lawyer, and accustomed to investigate the human countenance
and eye. He saw that Philip was full of something of his own, immediately interesting to himself;
and he cast about quickly in his mind what it could be. Not that the boy was heir to a peerage:
he would never have come like this to announce that: but something that Philip was cruelly
disappointed his mother did not remember. This passed through John's mind like a flash, though
it takes a long time to describe. "Ah," he said, "I begin to divine. Was not there something
about a--scholarship?"

"Pippo!" cried Elinor, lighting up great lamps of relief, of sudden ease and quick coming joy,
in her brightened eyes and face. "My boy! you've won your battle! You've got it, you've got
it, Pippo! And your foolish, stupid mother that thought for a moment you could rush to her
like this with anything but good news!"

It took a few moments to soothe Pippo down, and mend his wounded feelings. "I began to think
nobody cared," he said, "and that made me that I didn't care myself. I'd rather Musgrave had
got it, if it had not been to please you all. And you never seemed so much as to remember--only
Uncle John!" he added after a moment, with a half scorn which made John laugh at the never-failing
candour of youth.

"Only the least important of all," he said. "It was atrocious of the ladies, Philip. Shake
hands, my boy, I owe you five pounds for the scholarship. And now I'll take myself off, which
will please you most of all."

He went down-stairs laughing to himself all the way, but got suddenly quite grave as he stepped
outside--whether because he remembered that it does not become a Q.C. and M.P. to laugh in
the street, or for other causes, it does not become us to attempt to say.

And Elinor meanwhile made it up to her boy amply, and while her heart ached with the question
what to do with him, how to dispose of him during those dreadful following days, behaved herself
as if her head too was half turned with joy and exultation, only tempered by the regret that
Musgrave, who had worked so hard, could not have got the scholarship too.

CHAPTER XLI.

Elinor made much of her boy during that day and the following days, to take away the sense
of disappointment which even after the first great mortification was got over still haunted
young Philip's mind. It surprised him beyond measure to find that she did not wish to go out
with him, indeed in so far as was possible avoided it altogether, save for a hurried drive
to a few places, during which she kept her veil down and sheltered herself with an umbrella
in the most ridiculous way. "Are you afraid of your complexion, mother?" the boy asked of her
with disdain. "It looks like it," she said, but with a laugh that was full of embarrassment,
"though it is a little late in the day." Elinor was perhaps better aware than Pippo was that
she had a complexion which a girl might have envied, and was still as fresh as a rose, notwithstanding
that she was a year or two over forty; but I need not say it was not of her complexion she
was thinking. She had been careful to choose her time on previous visits to London so as to
risk as little as possible the chance of meeting her husband. But now there was no doubt that
he was in town, and not the least that if he met her anywhere with Pippo, her secret, so far
as it had ever been a secret, would be in his hands. Even when John took the boy out it was
with a beating heart that his mother saw him go, for John was too well known to make any secret
possible about his movements, or who it was who was with him. Perhaps it was for this reason
that John desired to take him out, and even cut short his day's work on one or two occasions
to act as cicerone to Philip. He took him to the House, to the great excitement and delight
of the boy, who only wished that the entertainment could have been made complete by a speech
from Uncle John, which was a point in which his guide, philosopher, and friend, though in every
other way so complaisant, did not humour Pippo. On one occasion during the first week they
had an encounter which made John's middle-aged pulses move a little quicker. When they were
walking along through Hyde Park, having strolled that way in the fading of the May afternoon,
when the carriages were still promenading up and down, before they returned to Halkin Street
to dinner, where Elinor awaited them--it happened to Mr. Tatham to meet the roving eyes of
Lady Mariamne, who lay back languidly in her carriage, wrapped in a fur cloak, and shivering
in the chill of the evening. She was not particularly interested in anything or any person
whom she had seen, and was a little cross and desirous of getting home. But when she saw John
she roused up immediately, and gave a sign to Dolly, who sat by her, to pull the check-string.
"Mr. Tatham!" she cried, in her shrill voice. Lady Mariamne was not one of the people who object
to hear their voice in public or are reluctant to make their wishes known to everybody. She
felt herself to be of the cast in which everybody is interested, and that the public liked
to know whom she honoured with her acquaintance. "Mr. Tatham! are you going to carry your rudeness
so far as not to seem to know me? Oh, come here this moment, you impertinent man!"

"Can I be of any use to you, Lady Mariamne?" said John, gravely, at the carriage door.

"Oh, dear no; you can't be of any use. What should I have those men for if I wanted you to
be of use? Come and talk a moment, that's all; or get into the carriage and I'll take you anywhere.
Dolly and I have driven round and round, and we have not seen a creature we cared to see. Yes!
there was a darling, darling little Maltese terrier, with white silk curls hanging over his
eyes, on an odious woman's lap; but I cannot expect you to find that angel for me. Mr. Tatham,
who is that tall boy?"

"Pippo," said John, quickly (though probably he had never in his life before used that name,
which he disapproved of angrily, as people often do of a childish name which does not please
them), "go on. I'll come after you directly. The boy is a cousin of mine, Lady Mariamne, just
from school."

"Mr. Tatham, I am quite sure it is Nell's boy. Call after him. What's his name? Bring him back!
John Thomas, run after that young gentleman, and say with my compliments----"

"Nothing," said John, stopping the footman with a lifted hand and a still more emphatic look.
"He is hastening home to--an engagement. And it's evident I had better go too--for your little
friend there is showing his teeth."

"The darling!" said Lady Mariamne, "did it show its little pearls at the wicked man that will
not do what its mummy says? Dolly, can't you jump down and run after that boy? I am sure it
is your Uncle Philip's boy."

"He is out of sight, mother," said Miss Dolly, calmly.

"You are the most dreadful, wicked, unkind people, all of you. Show its little teeth, then,
darling! Oo's the only one that has any feeling. Mr. Tatham, do tell me something about this
trial. What is going to be done? Phil is mixed up in it. I know he is. Can they do anything
to anybody--after all this time? They can't make you pay up, I know, after a certain time.
Oh, couldn't it all be hushed up and stopped and kept out of the newspapers? I hate the newspapers,
always chuckling over every new discovery. But this cannot be called a new discovery. If it's
true it's old, as old as the old beginning of the world. Don't you think somebody could get
at the newspaper men and have it hushed up?"

"I doubt if you could get hold of all of them, their name is legion," said John.

"Oh, I don't care what their name is. If you will help me, Mr. Tatham, we could get hold of
most of them--won't you? You know, don't you, poor St. Serf is so bad; it may be over any day--and
then only think what a complication! Dolly, turn your head the other way; look at that silly
young Huntsfield capering about to catch your eye. I don't want you to hear what I have got
to say."

"I don't in the least way want to hear what you have got to say, dear mamma," said Dolly.

"That would have made me listen to every word," said Lady Mariamne; "but girls are more queer
nowadays than anything that ever was. Mr. Tatham"--she put her hand upon his, which was on
the carriage door, and bent her perfumed, powdered face towards him--"for goodness' sake--think
how awkward it would be--a man just succeeding to a title and that sort of thing put in all
the papers about him. Do, do stop it, or try something to stop it, for goodness' sake!"

"I assure you," said John, "I can do nothing to stop it. I am as powerless as you are."

"Oh, I don't say that I am powerless," said Lady Mariamne, with her shrill laugh. "One has
one's little ways of influence." Then she put her hand again upon John with a sudden grip.
"Mr. Tatham," she said, "tell me, in confidence, was that Phil's boy?"

"I have told you, Lady Mariamne, it is a nephew of mine."

"A nephew--oh, I know what kind of a nephew--à la mode de Bretagne!"

She turned her head to the other side, where her daughter was gazing calmly in front of her.

"Dolly! I was sure of it," she cried, "don't you hear? Dolly, don't you hear?"

"Which, mamma?" said Dolly, gravely; "of course I could not help hearing it all. Which part
was I to notice? about the newspapers or about the boy?"

Lady Mariamne appealed to earth and heaven with the loud cackle of her laugh. "He can't deny
it," she said; "he as good as owns it. I am certain that's the boy that will be Lomond."

"Uncle St. Serf is not dead yet," said Dolly, reprovingly.

"Poor Serf!--but he's so very bad," said Lady Mariamne, "that it's almost the same thing. Mr.
Tatham, can't we take you anywhere? I'm so glad I've seen Nell's boy. Can't we drive you home?
Perhaps you've got Nell there too?"

John stood back from the carriage door, just in time to escape the start of the horses as the
remorseless string was touched and the footman clambered up into his seat. Lady Mariamne's
smile went off her face, and she had forgotten all about it, to judge from appearances, before
he had got himself in motion again. And a little farther on, behind the next tree, he found
young Philip waiting, full of curiosity and questions.

"Who was that lady, Uncle John? Was she asking about me? I thought I heard her call. I had
half a mind to run back and say 'Here I am.'"

"It was much better that you didn't do anything of the kind. Never pay any attention when you
think you hear a fine lady calling you, Philip. It is better not to hear the Siren's call."

"When they're elderly Sirens like that!" said the boy, with a laugh. "But I say, Uncle John,
if you won't tell me who the lady is, who is the girl? She has a pair of eyes!--not like Sirens
though--eyes that go through you--like--like a pair of lancets."

"A surgical operation in fact: and I shouldn't wonder if she meant to be a doctor," said John.
"The mother has done nothing all her life, therefore the daughter means to do much. It is the
natural reaction of the generations. But I never noticed that Miss Dolly had any eyes--to speak
of," said the highly indifferent middle-aged man.

The boy flushed with a sense of indignation. "Perhaps you think the old lady's were finer?"
he said.

"I never admired the old lady, as you call her," said John, shortly; and then he turned Philip's
attention to something, possibly with the easily satisfied conviction of a spectator that the
boy thought of it no more.

"We met my Lady Mariamne in the park," he said to Elinor when they sat at dinner an hour later
at that bachelor table in Halkin Street, where everything was so exquisitely cared for. It
was like Elinor, but most unlike the place in which she found herself, that she started so
violently as to shake the whole table, crying out in a tone of consternation, "John!" as if
he did not know very well what he might venture to say, or as if he had any intention of betraying
her to her son.

"She was very anxious," he said, perhaps playing a little with her excitement, "to have Philip
presented to her: but I sent him on--that is to say, I thought I sent him on. The fellow went
no farther than to the next tree, where he stood and watched Miss Dolly, not feeling any interest
in the old lady, as he said."

"Well, Uncle John--did you expect me to look at the old lady? You are not so fond of old ladies
yourself."

"And who is Miss Dolly?" said Elinor, trying to conceal the beating of her heart and the quiver
on her lips with a smile; and then she added, with a little catch of her breath, "Oh, yes,
I remember there was a little girl."

"You will be surprised to hear that we are by way of being great friends. Her ladyship visits
me in my chambers----"

Again Elinor uttered that startled cry, "John!" but she tried this time to cover it with a
tremulous laugh. "Are you becoming a flirt in your old age?"

"It appears so," said John. And then he added, "That aphorism, which struck you as it struck
me, Elinor, by its good sense--about the heir to a peerage--is really her production, and not
mine."

"Miss Dolly's? And what was the aphorism, Uncle John?" cried Philip.

"No, it was not Miss Dolly's, my young man. It was the mother's, and so of course does not
interest you any more."

It did not as a matter of fact: the old lady was supremely indifferent to Pippo; but as he
looked up saying something else which did not bear upon the subject, it occurred to the boy,
as it will sometimes occur by the merest chance to a young observer, to notice his mother.
She caught his eye somehow in the most accidental way; and Pippo was too well acquainted with
her looks not to perceive that there was a thrill in every line of her countenance, a slight
nervous tremble in her hands and entire person, such as was in no way to be accounted for (he
thought) by anything that had been said or done. There was nothing surely to disquiet her in
dining at Uncle John's, the three alone, not even one other guest to fill up the vacant side
of the table. Philip had himself thought that Uncle John might have asked some one to meet
them. He should have remembered that he himself, Philip, was now of an age to dine out, and
see a little society, and go into the world. But what in the name of all that was wonderful
was there in this entertainment to agitate his mother? And John Tatham had a look--which Philip
did not understand--the look of a man who was successful in argument, who was almost crushing
an opponent. It was as if a duel had been going on between them, and the man was the victor,
which, as was natural, immediately threw Philip violently on the other side.

"You're not well, mother," he said.

"Do you think not, Pippo? Well, perhaps you are right. London is too much for me. I am a country
bird," said Elinor, with smiling yet trembling lips.

"You shall not go to the theatre if you are not up to it," said the boy in his imperious way.

She gave him an affectionate look, and then she looked across the table at John. What did that
look mean? There was a faint smile in it: and there was a great deal which Philip did not understand,
things understood by Uncle John--who was after all what you might call an outsider, no more--and
not by him, her son! Could anything be so monstrous? Philip blazed up with sudden fire.

"No," said John Tatham; "I think Philip's right. We'll take her home to be coddled by her maid,
and we'll go off, two wild young fellows, to the play by ourselves."

"No," said Philip, "I'll leave her to be coddled by no maid. I can take care of my mother myself."

"My dear boy," said Elinor, "I want no coddling. But I doubt whether I could stand the play.
I like you to go with Uncle John."

And then it began to dawn upon Philip that his mother had never meant to be of the party, and
that this was what had been settled all along. He was more angry; more wounded and hurt in
his spirit than he had of course the least occasion to be. He was of opinion that his mother
had never had any secrets from him, that she had taken him into her confidence since he was
a small boy, even things that Granny did not know! And here all at once there was rising between
them a cloud, a mist, which there was no reason for. If he had done anything to make him less
worthy he would have understood; had there been a bad report from school, had he failed in
his work and disappointed her, there might have been some reason for it. But he had done nothing
of the kind! Never before had he been so deserving of confidence; he had got his scholarship,
he had finished the first phase of his education in triumph, and fulfilled all her expectations.
And now just at this point of all others, just when he was most fit to understand, most worthy
of trust, she turned from him. His heart swelled as if it would burst, with anger first, almost
too strong to be repressed, and with that sense of injured merit which is of all things the
most hard to bear. It is hard enough even when one is aware one deserves no better. But to
be conscious of your worth and to feel that you are not appreciated, that is indeed too much
for any one. There was not even the satisfaction of giving up the play which he had looked
forward to, making a sacrifice of it to his mother, in which there would have been a severe
pleasure. But she did not want him! She preferred that he should leave her by herself to be
coddled by her maid, as Uncle John (vulgarly) said. Or perhaps was there somebody else coming,
some old friend whom he knew nothing of, somebody, some one or other like that old witch in
the carriage whom Pippo was not meant to know?

It ended, however, in the carrying out of the plan settled beforehand by those old conspirators.
The old conspirators do generally manage to carry out their plans for the management of rebellious
youth, however injured the latter may feel. Pippo wound himself up in solemn dignity and silence
when he understood that it was ordained that he should proceed to the play with John Tatham.
And the pair had got half way to Drury Lane--or it may have been the Lyceum, or the Haymarket,
or any of half-a-dozen other theatres, for here exact information fails--before he condescended
to open his lips for more than Yes or No. But Philip's gloom did not survive the raising of
the curtain, and he had forgotten all offences and had taken his companion into favour again,
and was talking to Uncle John between the acts with all the excitement of a country youth to
whom a play still was the greatest of novelties and delights, when he suddenly saw a change
come over John Tatham's countenance and a slight bow of recognition directed towards a box,
which made Philip turn round and look too. And there was the old witch of the carriage, and,
what was more interesting, the girl with the keen eyes, who looked out suddenly from the shade
of the draperies, and fixed upon Philip--Philip himself--a look which startled that young hero
much. Nor was this all; for later in the evening, after another act of the play, some one else
appeared in the same box, and fixed the dark and impassive stare of a long pair of opera-glasses
upon Philip. It amused him at first, and afterwards it half frightened him, and finally made
him very angry. The gazer was a man, of whom, however, Philip could make nothing out but his
white shirt front and his tall stature, and the long black tubes of the opera-glass. Was it
at him the man was looking, or perhaps at Uncle John? But the boy thought it on the whole unlikely
that anybody should stare in that way at anything so little out of the ordinary as Uncle John.

"I say," he said, in the next interval, "who is that fellow staring at us out of your old lady's
box?"

"Staring at the ladies behind us, you mean," said John. "Pippo, do you think we could make
a rush for it the moment the play's over? I've got something to look over when I get home.
Are you game to be out the very first before the curtain's down?"

"Certainly I'm game," said Philip, delighted, "if you wish it, Uncle John."

"Yes, I wish it," said the other, and he put his hand on the boy's shoulder as the act finished
and the characters of the piece drew together for the final tableau. And the pair managed it
triumphantly, and were the very first to get out at the head of the crowd, to Philip's immense
amusement and John Tatham's great relief. The elder hurried the younger into the first hansom,
all in the twinkling of an eye: and then for the first time his gravity relaxed. Philip took
it all for a great joke till they reached Ebury Street. But when his companion left him, and
he had time to think of it, he began to ask himself why?

CHAPTER XLII.

I will not say that Philip's sleep was broken by this question, but it undoubtedly recurred
to his mind the first thing in the morning when he jumped out of bed very late for breakfast,
and the events of the past night and the lateness of the hour at which he got to rest came
back upon him as excuses in the first place for his tardiness. And then, which was remarkable,
it was not the scene in the play in which he had been most interested which came to his mind,
but a vision of that box and the man standing in front of it staring at him through the black
tubes of the opera-glass which came before Philip like a picture. Uncle John had said it was
at the ladies behind, but the boy felt sure it was no lady behind, but himself, on whom that
stare was fixed. Who would care to stare so at him? It faintly gleamed across his thoughts
that it might be some one who had heard of the scholarship, but he dismissed that thought instantly
with a blush. It also gleamed upon him with equal vagueness like a momentary but entirely futile
light, consciously derived from story books, and of which he was much ashamed, that the inexplicable
attention given to himself might have something to do with the girl who had such keen eyes.
Philip blushed fiery red at this involuntary thought, and chased it from his mind like a mad
dog; but he could not put away the picture of the box, the girl putting aside the curtain to
look at him, and the opera-glass fixed upon his face. And then why was Uncle John in such a
hurry to get away? It had seemed a capital joke at that moment, but when he came to think of
it, it was rather strange that a man who might be Solicitor-General to-morrow if he liked,
and probably Lord Chancellor in a few years, should make a schoolboy rush from the stalls of
a theatre with the object of being first out. Philip disapproved of so undignified a step on
the part of his elderly relation. And he saw now in the serious morning that Uncle John was
very unlikely to have done it for fun. What, then, did it mean?

He came down full of these thoughts, and rather ashamed of being late, wondering whether his
mother would have waited for him (which would have annoyed him), or if she would have finished
her breakfast (which would have annoyed him still more). Happily for Elinor, she had hit the
golden mean, and was pouring out for herself a second cup of coffee (but Philip was not aware
it was the second) when the boy appeared. She was quite restored to her usual serenity and
freshness, and as eager to know how he had enjoyed himself as she always was. He gave her a
brief sketch of the play and of what pleased him in it as in duty bound. "But," he added, "what
interested me almost more was that we had a sort of a--little play of our own."

"What?" she cried, with a startled look in her eyes. One thing that puzzled him was that she
was so very easily startled, which it seemed to Philip had never been the case before.

"Well," he said, "the lady was there whom Uncle John met in the park--and the girl with her--and
I believe the little dog. She made all sorts of signs to him, but he took scarcely any notice.
But that's not all, mother----"

"It's a good deal, Pippo----"

"Is it? Why do you speak in that choked voice, mother? I suppose it is just one of his society
acquaintances. But the thing was that before the last act somebody else came forward to the
front of the box, and fixed--I was going to say his eyes, I mean his opera-glasses upon us."

Philip had meant to say upon me--but he had produced already so great an effect on his mother's
face that he moderated instinctively the point of this description. "And stared at us," he
added, "all the rest of the time, paying not the least attention to anything that was going
on. It's a queer sensation," he went on, with a laugh, "to feel that black mysterious-looking
thing like the eyes of some monster with no speculation in them, fixed upon you. Now, I want
you to tell me---- What's the matter, mother?"

"Nothing, Pippo; nothing," said Elinor, faintly, stooping to lift up a book she had let fall.
"Go on with your story. I am very much interested; and then, my dear?"

"Mother," cried Philip, "I don't know what has come over you, or over me. There's something
going on I can't understand. You never used to have any secrets from me. I was always in your
confidence--wasn't I, mother?"

It was not a book she had let fall, but a ring that she had dropped from her finger, and which
had to be followed over the carpet. It made her red and flushed when she half raised her head
to say, "Yes, Pippo--you know--I have always told you----"

Philip did not remark that what his mother said was nothing after all. He got up to help her
to look for her ring, and put his arm round her waist as she knelt on the floor.

"Yes, mamma," he said, tenderly, protectingly, "I do know: but something's changed; either
it's in me that makes you feel you can't trust me--or else it is in you. And I don't know which
would be worst."

"There is no change," she said, after a moment, for she could not help the ring being found,
and immediately when his quick, young eyes came to the search: but she did not look him in
the face. "There is no change, dear. There is only some worrying business which involves a
great many troubles of my old life before you were born. You shall hear--everything--in a little
while: but I cannot enter into it all at this moment. It is full of complications and--secrets
that belong to other people. Pippo, you must promise me to wait patiently, and to believe--to
believe--always the best you can--of your mother."

The boy laughed as he raised her up, still holding her with his arm. "Believe the best I can!
Well, I don't think that will be a great effort, mother. Only to think that you can't trust
me as you always have done makes me wretched. We've been such friends, haven't we, mamma? I've
always told you everything, or at least everything except just the nonsense at school: and
you've told me everything. And if we are going to be different now----"

"You've told me everything!" the boy was as sure of it as that he was born. She had to hold
by him to support herself, and it cost her a strong effort to restrain the shiver that ran
through her. "We are not going to be different," she said, "as soon as we leave London--or
before--you shall know everything about this business of mine, Pippo. Will that satisfy you?
In the meantime it is not pleasant business, dear; and you must bear with me if I am abstracted
sometimes, and occupied, and cross."

"But, mother," said Philip, bending over her with that young celestial foolish look of gravity
and good advice with which a neophyte will sometimes address the much-experienced and heavily-laden
pilgrim, "don't you think it would be easier if it was all open between us, and I took my share?
If it is other people's secrets I would not betray them, you know that."

Unfortunately Elinor here murmured, scarcely knowing what words came from her lips, "That is
what John says."

"John," said the boy, furious with the quick rage of injured tenderness and pride, "Uncle John!
and you tell him more, him, an outsider, than you tell me!"

He let her go then, which was a great relief to Elinor, for she could command herself better
when he was a little farther off, and could not feel the thrill that was in her, and the thumping
of her heart.

"You must remember, Pippo," she said, "what I have told you, that my present very disagreeable,
very painful business is about things that happened before you were born, which John knew everything
about. He was my adviser then, as far as I would take any advice, which I am afraid never was
much, Pippo," she said; "never, alas! all my life. Granny will tell you that. But John, always
the kindest friend and the best brother in the world, did everything he could. And it would
have been better for us all if I had taken his advice instead of always, I fear, always my
own way."

Strangely enough this cheered Pippo and swept the cloud from his face. "I'm glad you didn't
take anybody's advice, mother. I shouldn't have liked it. I've more faith in you than anybody.
Well, then, now about this man. What man in the world--I really mean in the world, in what
is called society, for that is the kind of people they were--could have such a curiosity about--me?"

She had resumed her seat, and her face was turned away from him. Also the exquisite tone of
complacency and innocent self-appreciation with which Philip expressed this wonder helped her
a little to surmount the situation. Elinor could have laughed had her heart been only a trifle
less burdened. She said: "Are you sure it was at you?"

"Uncle John said something about ladies behind us, but I am sure it was no ladies behind. It
might, of course," the boy added, cautiously, "have been him, you know. I suppose Uncle John's
a personage, isn't he? But after all, you know, hang it, mother, it isn't easy to believe that
a fellow like that would stare so at Uncle John."

"Poor John! It is true there is not much novelty about him," said Elinor, with a tremble in
her voice, which, if it was half agitation, was yet a little laughter too: for there are scarcely
any circumstances, however painful, in which those who are that way moved by nature are quite
able to quench the unconquerable laugh. She added, with a falter in which there was no laughter,
"and what--was the--fellow like?"

"All that I could see was that he was a tall man. I saw his large shirt-front and his black
evening clothes, and something like grey hair above those two big, black goggles----"

"Grey hair!" Elinor said, with a low suppressed cry.

"He never took them away from his eyes for a moment, so of course I could not see his face,
or anything much except that he was more than common tall--like myself," Pippo said, with a
little air of pleased vanity in the comparison.

Like himself! She did not make any remark. It is very doubtful whether she could have done
so. There came before her so many visions of the past, and such a vague, confused, bewildering
future, of which she could form no definite idea what it would be. Was it with a pang that
she foresaw that drawing towards another influence: that mingled instinct, curiosity, perhaps
admiration and wonder, which already seemed to move her boy's unconscious mind? Elinor did
not even know whether that would hurt her at all. Even now there seemed a curious pungent sense
of half-pleasure in the pain. Like himself! So he was. And if it should be that it was his
father, who for hours had stood there, not taking his eyes off the boy (for hours her imagination
said, though Pippo had not said so), his father who had known where she was and never disturbed
her, never interfered with her; the man who had summoned her to perform her martyrdom for him,
never doubting--Phil, with grey hair! To say what mingled feelings swept through Elinor's mind,
with all these elements in them, is beyond my power. She saw him with his face concealed, standing
up unconscious of the crowded place and of the mimic life on the stage, his eyes fixed upon
his son whom he had never seen before. Where was there any drama in which there was a scene
like this? His son, his only child, the heir! Unconsciously even to herself that fact had some
influence, no doubt, on Elinor's thoughts. And it would be impossible to say how much influence
had that unexpected subduing touch of the grey hair: and the strange change in the scene altogether.
The foolish, noisy, "fast" woman, with her tourbillon of men and dogs about her, turned into
the old lady of Pippo's careless remark, with her daughter beside her far more important than
she: and the tall figure in the front of the box, with grey hair----

Young Philip had not the faintest light or guidance in the discovery of his mother's thoughts.
He was much more easy and comfortable now that there had been an explanation between them,
though it was one of those explanations which explained nothing. He even forgave Uncle John
for knowing more than he did, moved thereto by the consolatory thought that John's advice had
never been taken, and that his mother had always followed her own way. This was an incalculable
comfort to Pippo's mind, and gave him composure to wait calmly for the clearing up of the mystery,
and the restoration of that perfect confidence between his mother and himself which he was
so firmly convinced had existed all his life. He was a great deal happier after, and gave her
an excellent account of the play, which he had managed to see quite satisfactorily, notwithstanding
the other "little play of our own" which ran through everything. At Philip's age one can see
two things at once well enough. I knew a boy who at one and the same moment got the benefit
of (1st) his own story book, which he read lying at full length before the fire, half buried
in the fur of a great rug; and (2nd) of the novel which was being read out over his head for
the benefit of the other members of the family--or at least he strenuously asserted he did,
and indeed proved himself acquainted with both. Philip in the same way had taken in everything
in the play, even while his soul was intent upon the opera-glass in the box. He had not missed
anything of either. He gave an account of the first, from which the drama might have been written
down had fate destroyed it: and had noticed the minauderies of the heroine, and the eager determination
not to be second to her in anything which distinguished the first gentleman, as if he had nothing
else in his mind: while all the time he had been under the fascination of the two black eyeholes
braqués upon him, the mysterious gaze as of a ghost from eyes which he never saw.

This occupied some part of the forenoon, and Philip was happy. But when he had completed his
tale and began to feel the necessity of going out, and remembered that he had nowhere to go
and nothing to do, the prospect was not alluring. He tried very hard to persuade his mother
to go out with him, but this was a risk from which Elinor shrank. She shrank, too, from his
proposal at last to go out to the park by himself.

"To the Row. I sha'n't know the people except those who are in Punch every week, and I shall
envy the fellows riding--but at least it will be something to see."

"I wish you would not go to the Row, Pippo."

"Why, mother? Doesn't everybody go? And you never were here at this time of the year before."

"No," she said, with a long breath of despair. No; of all times of the year this was the one
in which she had never risked him in London. And, oh! that he had been anywhere in the world
except London now!

Philip, who had been watching her countenance with great interest, here patted her on the shoulder
with condescending, almost paternal, kindness. "Don't you be frightened, mother. I'll not get
into any mischief. I'll neither be rode over, nor robbed, nor run away. I'll take as great
care of myself as if you had been there."

"I'm not afraid that you will be ridden over or robbed," she said, forcing a smile; "but there
is one thing, Pippo. Don't talk to anybody whom you--don't know. Don't let yourself be drawn
into---- If you should meet, for instance, that lady--who was in the theatre last night."

"Yes, mother?"

"Don't let her make acquaintance with you; don't speak to her, nor the girl, nor any one that
may be with her. At the risk even of being uncivil----"

"Why, mother," he said, elevating his eyebrows, "how could I be uncivil to a lady?"

"Because I tell you," she cried, "because you must--because I shall sit here in terror counting
every moment till you come back, if you don't promise me this."

He looked at her with the most wondering countenance, half disapproving, half pitying. Was
she going mad? what was happening to her? was she after all, though his mother, no better than
the jealous foolish women in books, who endeavoured at all costs to separate their children
from every influence but their own? How could Pippo think such things of his mother? and yet
what else could he think?

"I had better," he said, "if that is how you feel, mother, not go to the Row at all."

"Much better, much better!" she cried. "I'll tell you what we'll do, Pippo--you have never
been to see--the Tower." She had run over all the most far-off and unlikely places in her mind,
and this occurred to her as the most impossible of all to attract any visitor of whom she could
be afraid. "I have changed my mind," she added. "Well have a hansom, and I will go with you
to see the Tower."

"So long as you go with me," said Pippo, "I don't care where I go."

And they set out almost joyfully as in their old happy expeditions of old, for that long drive
through London in the hansom. And yet the boy was only lulled for the moment, and in his heart
was more and more perplexed what his mother could mean.

CHAPTER XLIII.

Fortune was favourable to Elinor that day. At the Tower, where she duly went over everything
that was to be seen with Pippo, conscious all the time of his keen observance of her through
all that he was doing, and even through his interest in what he saw--and feeling for the first
time in her life that there was between her boy and her something that he felt, something that
was not explained by anything she had said, and that awaited the dreadful moment when everything
would have to be told--at the Tower, as I say, they met some friends from the north, the rector
of the parish, who had come up with his son to see town, and was naturally taking his boy,
as Elinor took hers, to see all that was not town, in the usual sense of the word. They were
going to Woolwich and Greenwich next day, and with a pang of mingled trouble and relief in
her mind Elinor contrived to engage Pippo to accompany them. On the second day I think they
were to go to St. Katherine's Docks, or the Isle of Dogs, or some other equally important and
interesting sight--far better no doubt for the two youths than to frequent such places as the
Row, and gaze at the stream of gaiety and luxury which they could not join. Pippo in ordinary
circumstances would have been delighted to see Woolwich and the docks--but it was so evident
to him that his mother was anxiously desirous to dispose of him so, that his satisfaction was
much lessened. The boy, however, was magnanimous enough to consent without any appearance of
reluctance. In the many thoughts which filled his mind Philip showed his fine nature, by having
already come to consent to the possibility that his mother might have business of her own into
which he had no right to enter unless at her own time and with her full consent. It cost him
an effort, I allow, to come to that: but yet he did so, and resolved, a little pride helping
him, to inquire no more, and if possible to wonder or be offended no more, but to wait the
time she had promised, when the old rule of perfect confidence should be re-established between
them. The old rule! if Pippo had but known! nothing yet had given Elinor such a sense of guilt
as his conviction that she had told him everything, that there had been no secrets between
them during all the happy life that was past.

How entirely relieved Elinor was when he started to join his friends next morning it would
be impossible to put into words. She watched all his lingering movements before he went with
eyes in which she tried to quench the impatience, and look only with the fond admiration and
interest she felt upon all his little preparations, his dawning sense of what was becoming
in apparel, the flower in his coat, the carefully rolled umbrella, the hat brushed to the most
exquisite smoothness, the handkerchief just peeping from his breast-pocket. It is always a
revelation to a woman to find that these details occupy as much of a young man's attention
as her own toilette occupies hers; and that he is as tremulously alive to "what is worn" in
many small particulars that never catch her eye, as she is to details which entirely escape
him. She smiles at him as he does at her, each in that conscious superiority to the other,
which is on the whole an indulgent sentiment. Underneath all her anxiety to see him go, to
get rid of him (was that the dreadful truth in this terrible crisis of her affairs?), she felt
the amusement of the boy's little coquetries, and the mother's admiration of his fresh looks,
his youthful brightness, his air of distinction; how different from the Rector's boy, who was
a nice fellow enough, and a credit to his rectory, and whose mother, I do not doubt, felt in
his ruddy good looks something much superior in robustness, and strength, and manhood to the
too-tall and too-slight golden youth of the ladies at Lakeside! It even flitted across Elinor's
mind to give him within herself the title that was to be his, everybody said--Lord Lomond!
And then she asked herself indignantly what honour it could add to her spotless boy to have
such a vain distinction; a name that had been soiled by so much ignoble use? Elinor had prided
herself all her life on an indifference to, almost a contempt for, the distinctions of rank:
and that it should occur to her to think of that title as an embellishment to Pippo--nay, to
think furtively, without her own knowledge, so to speak, that Pippo looked every inch a lord
and heir to a peerage, was an involuntary weakness almost incredible. She blushed for herself
as she realised it:--a peerage which had meant so little that was excellent--a name connected
with so many undesirable precedents: still I suppose when it is his own even the veriest democrat
is conscious at least of the picturesqueness, the superiority, as a mode of distinguishing
one man from another, of anything that can in the remotest sense be called a historical name.

When Pippo was out of sight Elinor turned from the window with a sigh, and came back to the
dark chamber of her own life, full at this moment of all the gathered blackness of the past
and of the future. She put her hands over her eyes, and sank down upon a seat, as if to shut
out from herself all that was before her. But shut it out as she might, there it was--the horrible
court with the judgment-seat, the rows of faces bent upon her, the silence through which her
own voice must rise alone, saying--what? What was it she was called there to say? Oh, how little
they knew who suggested that her mother should have been called instead of her, with all her
minute old-fashioned calculations and exact memory, who even now, when all was over, would
probably convict Elinor of a mistake! Even at that penalty what would not she give to have
it over, the thing said, the event done with, whatever it might bring after it! And it could
now be only a very short time till the moment of the ordeal would come, when she should stand
up in the face of her country, before the solemn judge on his bench, before all the gaping,
wondering people--before, oh! thought most dreadful of all, which we would not, could not,
contemplate--before one who knew everything, and say---- She picked herself up trembling as
it were, and uncovered her eyes, and protested to herself that she would say nothing that was
not true. Nothing that was not true! She would tell her story--so well remembered, so often
conned; that story that had been put into her lips twenty years ago which she had repeated
then confused, not knowing how it was that what was a simple fact should nevertheless not be
true. Alas! she knew that very well now, and yet would have to repeat it before God and the
world. But thinking would make it no better--thinking could only make it worse. She sprang
up again, and began to occupy herself with something she had to do: the less it was thought
over the better: for now the trial had begun, and her ordeal would soon be done too. If only
the boy could be occupied, kept away--if only she could be left alone to do what she had to
do! That he should be there was the last aggravation of which her fate was capable; there in
idleness, reading the papers in the morning, which was a thing she had so lately calculated
a boy at school was unlikely to do; and what so likely as that his eye would be caught by his
own name in the report of the trial, which would be an exciting trial and fully reported--a
trial which interested society. The boy would see his own name: she could almost hear him cry
out, looking up from his breakfast, "Hallo, mother! here's something about a Philip Compton!"
And all the questions that would follow--"Is he the same Comptons that we are? What Comptons
do we belong to? You never told me anything about my family. Is this man any relation, I wonder?
Both surname and Christian name the same. It's strange if there is no connection!" She could
almost hear the words he would say--all that and more--and what should she reply?

"I have only one thing to say, Elinor," said John, to whom in her desperation she turned again,
as she always did, disturbing him, poor man, in his chambers as he was collecting his notes
and his thoughts in the afternoon after his work was over: "it is the same as I have always
said; even now make a clean breast of it to the boy. Tell him everything; better that he should
hear it from your own lips than that it should burst upon him as a discovery. He has but to
meet Lady Mariamne in the park, the most likely thing in the world----"

"No, John," cried Elinor, "no; the Marshalls are here, our Rector from Lakeside, and he is
taking his boy to see all the sights. I have got Pippo to go with them. They are going to Woolwich
to-day, and afterwards to quite a long list of things--oh, entirely out of everybody's way."

Her little look of uneasy triumph and satisfaction made John smile. She was not half so sure
as she tried to look; but, all the same, had a little pride, a little pleasure in her own management,
and in the happy chance of the Marshalls being in London, which was a thing that could not
have been planned, an intervention of Providence. He could not refuse to smile--partly with
her, partly at her simplicity--but, all the same, he shook his head.

"The only way in which there is any safety--the only chance of preserving him from a shock,
a painful shock, Elinor, that may upset him for life----"

"How do you mean, upset him for life?"

"By showing him that his mother, whom he believes in like heaven, has deceived him since ever
he was born."

She covered her face with her hands, and burst into a sobbing cry. "Oh, John, you don't know
how true that is! He said to me only yesterday, 'You have always told me everything, mother.
There has never been any secret between us.' Oh! John, John, only think of having that said
to me, and knowing what I know!"

"Well, Elinor; believe me, my dear, there is but one thing to do. The boy is a good boy, full
of love and kindness."

"Oh, isn't he, John? the best boy, the dearest----"

"And adores his mother, as a boy should," John got up from his chair and walked about the room
for a little, and then he came behind her and put his hand on her shoulder. "Tell him, Elinor:
my dear Nelly, as if I had never said a word on the subject before, I beseech you tell him,
trust him fully, even now, at the eleventh hour."

She raised her head with a quivering, wistful smile. "The moment the trial is over, the moment
it is over! I give you my word, John."

"Do not wait till it is over, do it now; to-night when he comes home."

She began to tremble so that John Tatham was alarmed--and kept looking at him with an imploring
look, her lips quivering and every line in her countenance. "Oh, not to-night. Spare me to-night!
After the trial; after my part of it. At least--after--after--oh, give me till to-morrow to
think of it!"

"My dear Elinor, I count for nothing in it. I am not your judge; I am your partisan, you know,
whatever you do. But I am sure it will be the better done, and even the easier done, the sooner
you do it."

"I will--I will: at the very latest the day after I have done my part at the trial. Is not
that enough to think of at one time, for a poor woman who has never stood up before the public
in all her life, never had a question put to her? Oh, John! oh, John!"

"Elinor, Elinor! you are too sensible a woman to make a fuss about a simple duty like this."

"There speaks the man who has stood before the world all his life, and is not afraid of any
public," she said, with a tremulous laugh. But she had won her moment's delay, and thus was
victorious after a fashion, as it was her habit to be.

I do not know that young Philip much amused himself at Woolwich that day. He did and he did
not. He could not help being interested in all he saw, and he liked the Marshalls well enough,
and in ordinary circumstances would have entered very heartily into any sight-seeing. But he
kept thinking all the time what his mother was doing, and wondering over the mysterious business
which was to be explained to him sooner or later, and which he had so magnanimously promised
to wait for the revelation of, and entertain no suspicions about in the meantime. The worst
of such magnanimity is that it is subject to dreadful failings of the heart in its time of
waiting--never giving in, indeed, but yet feeling the pressure whenever there is a moment to
think. This matter mixed itself up so with all Philip saw that he never in after life saw a
great cannon, or a pyramid of balls (which is not, to be sure, an every-day sight) without
a vague sensation of trouble, as of something lying behind which was concealed from him, and
which he would scarcely endure to have concealed. When he left his friends in the evening,
however, it was with another engagement for to-morrow, and several to-morrows after, and great
jubilation on the part of both father and son, as to their good luck in meeting, and having
his companionship in their pleasures. And, in fact, these pleasures were carried on for several
days, always with the faint bitter in them to Philip, of that consciousness that his mother
was pleased to be rid of him, glad to see his back turned, the most novel, extraordinary sensation
to the boy. Due to its ancestry its logical scope was the more technical Science Fiction farthest removed
from sheer fantasy, but, none-the-less, one of the most important branches. Now it is specializing
in that type.

When Astounding Stories appeared many of us were apt to be skeptical, particularly when we noticed
that an established corporation was backing it, one that had been limited to westerns and the
like. The first few issues came and there was a dubious tinge of the occult, the "black-magical."
This petered out, and we noticed that no matter how poor the subject matter from the point of
view of Science Fiction, the style of writing was almost always on the highest level.

Then we realized that this magazine was no menace to the literature of Science Fiction, but
a valuable addition. It could afford the better writers and hence keep up the quality of work
of every writer. It was adopting as its own a type of Science Fiction that the rest minimized,
and that demanded good writing--a type having a skeleton of science,
like the girders of a great building, holding it erect and determining
its shape, yet holding the skeleton of less importance than the vision
of the completed edifice.

Stories with emphasis on the fiction rather than the science.

But enough of that. Here is a hopeful thought for the time-travelers. There is nothing in physics
or chemistry to prevent you from going into the past or future--at least, the future--and shaking
hands with yourself or killing yourself. We will eliminate the past, for it seems that it cannot
be altered physically. But take the future: not so very far from to-day the matter of your body
will have been totally replaced by new matter; the old will disappear in waste. Physically,
you will be a new man, and physically the matter of to-day may destroy that of to-morrow and
return in itself unaltered. But none-the-less there will be some limiting interval during which
"you" have not been entirely transformed to new matter, so that an atom would have to be in two
places at once.

Maybe time-traveling progresses in little jumps like emission of light. And maybe an atom can
be in two places at once. If you are going to treat time as just another dimension, there seems
to be no reason why an object which can be in one place at two times cannot be at one time
in two places. This is all physics. The paradoxes of time-traveling arise more particularly from its
effect on what we call consciousness, the something that makes me "me"--an individual. We can imagine
an atom in two places at once, but not a soul, if you will. This will not bother the materialist
who considers a living creature merely a machine, but it will most
of us. So I must be content with offering a materialistic possibility
of traveling in time. And the consequence was that he said to himself really
those words which his mother in imagination had so often heard him say, "Hallo! Philip Compton,
my name! I wonder if he is any relation. I wonder if we have anything to do with those St.
Serf Comptons." Then he reflected, but vaguely, that he did not know to what Comptons he belonged,
nor even what county he came from, to tell the truth. And then it was time to hurry over his
breakfast, to swallow his cup of tea, to snatch up his hat and gloves, and to rush off to meet
his friends. But on that day Philip was unlucky. When he got to the place of meeting he found
nothing but a telegram from Ralph, announcing that his father was so knocked up with his previous
exertions that they were obliged to take a quiet day. And thus Philip was left in the Temple,
of all places in the world, on the day when his mother was to appear in the law-courts close
by--on the day of all others when if she could have sent him for twenty-four hours to the end
of the earth she would have done so--on the day when so terrible was the stress and strain
upon herself that for once in the world even Pippo had gone as completely out of her mind as
if he had not been.

The boy looked about him for awhile, and reflected what to do, and then he started out into
the Strand, conscientiously waiting for the Marshalls before he should visit the Temple and
all its historical ways; and then he was amused and excited by seeing a barrister or two in
wig and gown pass by; and then he thought of the trial in the newspapers, in which somebody
who, like himself, was called Philip Compton, was involved. Philip was still lingering, wondering
if he could get into the court, a little shy of trying, but gradually growing eager, thinking
at least that he would try and get a sight of the wonderful grand building, still so new, when
he suddenly saw Simmons, his uncle John's clerk, passing through the quadrangle of the law-courts.
Here was his chance. He rushed forward and caught the clerk by the arm, who was in a great
hurry, as everybody seemed to be. "Oh, Simmons, can you get me into that Brown trial?" cried
Philip. "Brown!" Simmons said. "Mr. Tatham is not on in that." "Oh, never mind about Mr. Tatham,"
said the boy. "Can't you get me in? I have never seen a trial, and I take an interest in that."
"I advise you," said Simmons, "to wait for one that your uncle's in." "Can't you get me in?"
said Philip, impatiently: and this touched the pride of Simmons, who had many friends, if not
in high places, yet in low.

CHAPTER XLIV.

Philip had never been in a court of law before. I am almost as ignorant as he was, yet I cannot
imagine anything more deeply interesting than to find one's self suddenly one of a crowded
assembly trying more or less--for is not the public but a larger jury, sometimes contradicting
the verdict of the other, and when it does so almost invariably winning the cause?--a fellow-creature,
following out the traces of his crime or his innocence, looking on while a human drama is unrolled,
often far more interesting than any dramatic representation of life. He was confused for the
moment by the crowd, by the new and unusual spectacle, by the bewilderment of seeing for the
first time what he had so often heard of, the judge on the bench, the wigged barristers below,
the one who was speaking, so different from any other public speaker Philip had ever heard,
addressing not the assembly, but the smaller circle round him, interrupted by other voices:
the accused in his place and the witness--standing there more distinctly at the bar than the
culprit was--bearing his testimony before earth and heaven, with the fate of another hanging
on his words. The boy was so full of the novel sight--which yet he had heard of so often that
he could identify every part of it, and soon perceived the scope of what was going on--that
he did not at first listen, so full was he of the interest of what he saw. The imperturbable
judge, grave, letting no emotion appear on his face; the jury, just the reverse, showing how
this and that piece of evidence affected them; the barristers who were engaged, so keenly alive
to everything, starting up now and then when the witness swerved from the subject, when the
opposition proposed a leading question, or one that was irrelevant to the issue; the others
who were not "in it," as Simmons said, so indifferent; and then the spectators who had places
about or near the central interest. Philip saw, with a sudden leap of his heart, the ladies
of the theatre and park, the witch and the girl with the keen eyes, in a conspicuous place;
the old lady, as he called her, full of movement and gesture, making signs to others near her,
keeping up an interrupted whispering, the girl at her side as impassive as the judge himself.
And then Pippo's roving eye caught a figure seated among the barristers with an opera-glass,
which made his heart jump still more. Was that the man? He had, at the moment Philip perceived
him, his opera-glass in his hand: a tall man leaning back with a look of interest, very conspicuous
among the wigged heads about him, with grey hair in a mass on his forehead as if it had grown
thin and had been coaxed to cover some denuded place, and a face which it seemed to Philip
he had seen before, a face worn--was it with study, was it with trouble? Pippo knew of no other
ways in which the eyes could be so hollowed out, and the lines so deeply drawn. A man, perhaps,
hard worn with life and labor and sorrow. A strange sympathy sprang up in the boy's mind: he
was sure he knew the face. It was a face full of records, though young Philip could not read
them--the face, he thought, of a man who had had much to bear. Was it the same man who had
fixed so strange a gaze upon himself at the theatre? And what interest could this man have
in the trial that was going on?

The accused at the bar was certainly not of a kind to arouse the interest which sprang into
being at sight of this worn and noble hero. He had the air of a comfortable man of business,
a man evidently well off, surprised at once and indignant to find himself there, sometimes
bursting with eagerness to explain, sometimes leaning back with an air of affected contempt--not
a good man in trouble, as Philip would have liked to think him, nor a criminal fully conscious
of what might be awaiting him; but a man of the first respectability, indignant and incredulous
that anything should be brought against him. Philip felt himself able to take no interest whatever
in Mr. Brown.

It was not till he had gone through all these surprises and observations that he began to note
what was being said. Philip was not learned in the procedure of the law, nor did he know anything
about the case; but it became vaguely apparent to him after awhile that the immediate question
concerned the destruction of the books of a joint-stock company, of which Brown was the manager,
an important point which the prosecution had some difficulty in bringing home to him. After
it had been proved that the books had been destroyed, and that so far as was known it was to
Brown's interest alone to destroy them, the evidence as to what had been seen on the evening
on which this took place suddenly took a new turn, and seemed to introduce a new actor on the
scene. Some one had been seen to enter the office in the twilight who could not be identified
with Brown; whom, indeed, even Philip, with his boyish interest in the novelty of the proceedings,
vaguely perceived to be another man. The action of the piece, so to speak (for it was like
a play to Philip), changed and wavered here--and he began to be sensible of the character of
the different players in it. The counsel for the prosecution was a well-known and eminent barrister,
one of the most noted of the time, a man before whom witnesses trembled, and even the Bench
itself was sometimes known to quail. That this was the case on the present occasion Philip
vaguely perceived. There were points continually arising which the opposing counsel made objections
to, appealing to the judge; but it rarely failed that the stronger side, which was that of
the prosecution, won the day. The imperious accuser, whose resources of precedent and argument
seemed boundless, carried everything with a high hand. The boy, of course, was not aware of
the weakness of the representative of the majesty of the law, nor the inferiority, in force
and skill, of the defence; but he gradually came to a practical perception of how the matter stood.

Philip listened with growing interest, sometimes amused, sometimes indignant, as the remorseless
prosecutor ploughed his way through the witnesses, whom he bullied into admissions that they
were certain of nothing, and that in the dusk of that far-off evening, the man whom they had
sworn at the time to be quite unlike him, might in reality have been Brown. Philip got greatly
interested in this question. He took up the opposite side himself with much heat, feeling as
sure as if he had been there that it was not Brown: and he was delighted in his excitement,
when there stood up one man who would not be bullied, a man who had the air of a respectable
clerk of the lower class, and who held his own. He had been an office boy, the son apparently
of the housekeeper in charge of the premises referred to when the incident occurred, and the
gist of his evidence was that the prisoner at the bar--so awful a personage once to the little
office boy, so curtly discussed now as Brown--had left the office at four o'clock in the afternoon
of the 6th of September, and had not appeared again.

"A different gentleman altogether came in the evening, a much taller man, with a large moustache."

"Where was it that you saw this man?"

"Slipping in at the side door of the office as if he didn't want to be seen."

"Was that a door which was generally open, or used by the public?"

"Never, sir; but none of the doors were used at that time of night."

"And how, then, could any one get admittance there?"

"Only those that had private keys; the directors had their private keys."

"Then your conclusion was that it was a director, and that he had a right to be there?"

"I knew it was a director, sir, because I knew the gentleman," the witness said.

"You say it was late in the evening of the 6th of September. Was it daylight at the time?"

"Oh, no, sir; nearly dark--a sort of a half light."

"Did the person you saw go in openly, or make any attempt at concealment?"

"He had a light coat on, like the coats gentlemen wear when they go to the theatre, and something
muffled round his throat, and his hat pulled down over his face."

"Like a person who wished to conceal himself?"

"Yes, sir," said the witness.

"And how, then, if he was muffled about the throat, and his hat pulled over his face, in the
half light late in the evening, could you see that he had a large moustache?"

The witness stood and stared with his mouth open, and made no reply.

The counsel, with a louder voice and those intonations of contemptuous insinuation which are
calculated to make a man feel that he is convicted of the basest perjury, and is being held
up to the reprobation of the world, repeated the question, "How could you see that he had a
large moustache?"

"I saw it," said the witness, hotly, "because I knew the gentleman."

"And how did you know the gentleman? You thought you recognised the gentleman, and therefore,
though you could not possibly perceive it, you saw his moustache? I fear that is not an answer
that will satisfy the jury."

"I submit," said the counsel for the defence, "that it is very evident what the witness means.
He recognised a man with whose appearance he was perfectly familiar."

"I saw him," said the witness, "as clear as I see you, sir."

"What! in the dark, late on a September night, with a coat collar up to his ears, and a hat
pulled down over his face! You see my learned friend in broad daylight, and with the full advantage
of standing opposite to him and studying his looks at your leisure. You might as well say because
you know the gentleman that you could see his half was dark and abundant under his wig."

At this a laugh ran through the court, at which Philip, listening, was furiously indignant,
as it interrupted the course of the investigation. It was through the sound of this laugh that
he heard the witness demand loudly, "How could I be mistaken, when I saw Mr. Compton every day?"

Mr. Compton! Philip's heart began to beat like the hammers of a steam-engine. Was this, then,
the real issue? And who was Mr. Compton? He could not have told how it was that he somehow
identified the man whom the witness had seen, or had not seen, with the man who had the opera-glass,
and who had fixed a dreadful blank stare upon the other in the witness-box during a great part
of this discussion. Was it he who was on his trial, and not Brown? And who was he? And where
was it that Philip had known and grown familiar with that face, which, so far as he could remember,
he had never seen before, but which belonged to the man who bore his own name?

When the counsel for the prosecution had turned the unfortunate witness outside in, and proved
that he knew nothing and had seen nobody: and that, besides, he was a man totally unworthy
of credit, who had lied from his cradle, and whose own mother and friends put no trust in him,
the court adjourned for lunch. But Philip forgot that he required any lunch. His mind was filled
with echoes of that name. He began to feel a strange certainty that it was the same man who
had fixed him with the same gaze in the theatre. Who was Mr. Compton, and what was he? The
question took the boy's breath away.

He sat through the interval, finding a place where he could see better, through the kind offices
of the usher to whom Simmons had commended him, and waiting with impatience till the trial
should be resumed. Nobody remarked the boy among the crowd of the ordinary public, many of
whom remained, as he did, to see it out, Philip cared nothing about Brown: all that he wanted
to know was about this namesake of his--this Compton, this other man, who was not Brown. If
it was the man with the opera-glass, he was not so much excited as his young namesake, for
he went to luncheon with the rest; while the boy remained counting the minutes, eager to begin
the story, the drama, again. The impression left, however, on Philip's impartial mind was that
the last witness, though driven and badgered out of what wits he had by the examination, had
really seen a man whom he perfectly knew, his recognition of whom was not really affected either
by the twilight or the disguise.

The thrill of interest which he felt running through all his veins as the court filled again
was like, but stronger than, the interest with which he had ever seen the curtain rise in the
theatre. His heart beat: he felt as if in some sort it was his own fate that was going to be
decided: all his prepossessions were in favour of that other accused, yet not openly accused,
person who was not Brown; and yet he felt almost as sure as if he had been there that the office
boy of twenty years ago had seen that man stealing in at the side door.

Young Philip did not catch the name of the next witness who was called; such a thing will happen
sometimes even with the quickest ear at a moment when every whisper is important. If he had
heard he would probably have thought that he was deceived by his excitement, impossible as
it was that such a name should have anything to do with this or any other trial. The shock
therefore was unbroken when, watching with all the absorbed interest of a spectator at the
most exciting play, the boy saw a lady come slowly forward into the witness-box. Philip had
the same strange sense of knowing who it was that he had felt the previous witness to have
in respect to the man whom he could not see, but yet had infallibly recognised: but he said
to himself, No! it was not possible! No! it was not possible! She came forward slowly, put
up the veil that had covered her face, and grasped the bar before her to support herself; and
then the boy sprang to his feet, in the terrible shock which electrified him from head to feet!
His movements, and the stifled cry he uttered, made a little commotion in the crowd, and called
forth the cry of "Silence in the court." His neighbours around him hustled him back into his
place, where he sank down incapable indeed of movement, knowing that he could not go and pluck
her from that place--could not rush to her side, could do nothing but sit there and gasp and
gaze at his mother. His mother, in such a place! in such a case! with which--surely, surely--she
could have nothing to do. Elinor Compton, at the time referred to Elinor Dennistoun, of Windyhill,
in Surrey--there was no doubt about the name now. And Philip had time enough to identify everything,
name and person, for there rose a vague surging of contention about the first questions put
to her, which were not evidence, according to the counsel on the other side, which he felt
with fury was done on purpose to prolong the agony. During this time she stood immovable, holding
on by the rail before her, her eyes fixed upon it, perfectly pale, like marble, and as still.
Among all the moving, rustling, palpitating crowd, and the sharp volleys of the lawyers' voices,
and even the contradictory opinions elicited from the harassed judge himself--to look at that
figure standing there, which scarcely seemed to breathe, had the most extraordinary effect.
For a time Philip was like her, scarcely breathing, holding on in an unconscious sympathy to
the back of the seat before him, his eyes wide open, fixed upon her. But as his nerves began
to accustom themselves to that extraordinary, inconceivable sight, the other particulars of
the scene came out of the mist, and grew apparent to him in a lurid light that did not seem
the light of day. He saw the eager looks at her of the ladies in the privileged places, the
whispers that were exchanged among them. He saw underneath the witness-box, almost within reach
of her, John Tatham, with an anxious look on his face. And then he saw, what was the most extraordinary
of all, the man--who had been the centre of his interest till now--the man whose name was Philip
Compton, like his own; he who fixed the last witness with the stare of his opera-glass, who
had kept it in perpetual use. He had put it down now on the table before him, his arms were
folded on his breast, and his head bent. Philip thought he detected now and then a furtive
look under his brows at the motionless witness awaiting through the storm of words the moment
when her turn would come; but though he had leant forward all the time, following every point
of the proceedings with interest, he now drew back, effaced himself, retired as it were from
the scene. What was there between these two? Was there any link between them? What was the
drama about to be played out before Pippo's innocent and ignorant eyes? At last the storm and
wrangling seemed to come to an end, and there came out low but clear the sound of her voice.
It seemed only now, when he heard his mother speak, that he was certified that so inconceivable
a thing as that she should be here was a matter of fact: his mother here! Philip fixed his
whole being upon her--eyes, thoughts, absorbed attention, he scarcely seemed to breathe except
through her. Could she see him, he wondered, through all that crowd? But then he perceived
that she saw nothing with those eyes that looked steadily in front of her, not turning a glance
either to the right or left.

For some time Philip was baffled completely by the questions put, which were those to which
the counsel on the other side objected as not evidence, and which seemed, even to the boy's
inexperienced mind, to be mere play upon the subject, attempts to connect her in some way with
the question as to Brown's guilt or innocence. Something in the appearance, at this stage,
of a lady so unlike the other witnesses, seemed to exercise a certain strange effect, however,
quickening everybody's interest, and when the examining counsel approached the question of
the date which had already been shown to be so momentous, all interruptions were silenced,
and the court in general, like Philip, held its breath. There were many there expecting what
are called in the newspapers "revelations:" the defence was taken by surprise, and did not
know what new piece of evidence was about to be produced: and even the examining counsel was,
for such a man, subdued a little by the other complicating threads of the web among which he
had to pick his way.

"You recollect," he said in his most soothing tones; "the evening of the 6th September, 1863?"

She bowed her head in reply. And then as if that was sparing herself too much, added a low "Yes."

"As I am instructed, you were not then married, but engaged to Mr. Philip Compton. Is that so?"

"Yes."

"One of the directors of the company of which the defendant was manager?"

"I believe so."

"I am sorry to have to enter upon matters so private: but there was some question, I believe,
about an investment to be made of a portion of your fortune in the hands of this company?"

"Yes."

"You received a visit from Mr. Compton on the subject on the day I have mentioned."

The witness made a slight movement and pause: then answered as before, but more firmly, "Yes:"
she added, "not on this subject," in a lower tone.

"You can recollect, more or less exactly, the time of his arrival?"

"Yes. It was in the evening, after dinner; in the darkening before the lamps were lit."

"Were you looking for him on that night?"

"No; it was an unexpected visit. He was going to Ireland, and paused on his way through town
to come down to Windyhill."

"You have particular reasons for remembering the date, which make it impossible that there
could be any mistake?"

"No; there could be no mistake."

"You will perhaps inform the court, Mrs. Compton, why your memory is so exact on this point."

Once more she hesitated for a moment, and then replied--

"It was exactly ten days before my marriage."

"I think that will do, Mrs. Compton. I will trouble you no further," the counsel said.

The hubbub which sprang up upon this seemed to Philip for the moment as if it were directed
against his mother, which, of course, was not the case, but intended to express the indignant
surprise of the defence at the elaborate examination of a witness who had nothing to say on
the main subject.

The leader on the other side, however, though taken by surprise, and denouncing the trick which
his learned brother had played upon the court by producing evidence which had really nothing
to do with the matter, announced his intention to put a further question or two to Mrs. Compton.
Young Philip in the crowd started again from his seat with the feeling that he would like to
fly at that man's throat.

"Twenty years is a long time," he said, "and it is difficult to be sure of any circumstance
at such a distance. Perhaps the witness will kindly inform us what were the circumstances which
fixed this, no doubt one of many visits, on her mind?"

Elinor turned for the first time to the side from which the question came with a little movement
of that impatience which was habitual to her, which three persons in that crowd recognised
in a moment as characteristic. One of these was John Tatham, who had brought her to the court,
and kept near that she might feel that she was not alone; the other was her son, of whose presence
there nobody knew; the third, sat with his eyes cast down, and his arms folded on his breast,
not looking at her, yet seeing every movement she made.

"It was a very simple circumstance," she said with the added spirit of that impetuous impulse:
but then the hasty movement failed her, and she came back to herself and to a consciousness
of the scene in which she stood. A sort of tremulous shiver came into her voice. She paused
and then resumed, "There was a calendar hanging in the hall; it caught Mr. Compton's eye, and
he pointed it out to me. It marked the 6th. He said, 'Just ten days----'"

Here her voice stopped altogether. She could say no more. And there was an answering pause
throughout the whole crowded court, a holding of the general breath, the response to a note
of passion seldom struck in such a place. Even in the cross-examination there was a pause.

"Till when? What was the other date referred to?"

"The sixteenth of September," she said in a voice that was scarcely audible to the crowd. She
added still more low so that the judge curved his hand over his ear to hear her, "Our wedding-day."

"I regret to enter into private matters, Mrs. Compton, but I believe it is not a secret that
your married life came to a--more rapid conclusion than could have been augured from such a
beginning. May I ask what your reasons were for----"

But here the other counsel sprang to his feet, and the contention arose again. Such a question
was not clearly permissible. And the prosecution was perfectly satisfied with the evidence.
It narrowed the question by the production of this clear and unquestionable testimony--the
gentleman whom it had been attempted to involve being thus placed out of the question, and
all the statements of the previous witness about the moustache which he could not see, etc.,
set aside. 

The extensive springs of pure water that issue from beneath this immense rock have kept them
flourishing in the midst of a tequisquite valley. Long gray threads of Spanish moss hang pendent
from the extremity of their limbs and cover the lower leaves. These trees are the only living links
that unite modern and ancient American civilization; for they were in being while that mysterious
race, the Toltecs, were still upon the table-lands of Mexico--a race that has left behind, not
only at Teotihuacan, but in the hot country, the imperishable memorials
of a civilization like that of Egypt; and from them the Aztecs acquired
an imperfect knowledge of a few simple arts.[38]

These trees had
long been standing, when a body of Aztecs, wandering away from their
tribe in search of game, fixed themselves upon the islands of this
marsh, first about the rock of Chapultepec, then at Mexicalzingo and
Iztapalapan, and finally at Mexico.

These trees were undisturbed by the Spaniards when Cortéz took the
city, and the Americans respected their great antiquity, so that during
all the wars and battles that have taken place around and above them,
they have passed unharmed.

Not only unnumbered generations, but whole races have appeared and disappeared, while these
trees have quietly flourished amid the strife of the elements and
the contentions of men, taking no heed of the passing events of which
they were spectators.

The Toltecs, of whom we must speak more fully hereafter, were the
first of these races that disappeared from the table-land--the victims
of wars, and of that plague of the Indian races, the matlazhuatl.

 But all that had secured Philip's attention
was gone. John Tatham's head was no longer visible under the witness-box; the ladies had disappeared
from their elevated seats; the man with the opera-glass was gone. They were all gone, and the
empty husks of a question which only concerned the comfort and life of the commonplace culprit
in the dock were being turned over and over like chaff by the wind. And yet it was some time
before poor young Pippo, shy of attracting attention, feeling some subtle change even in himself
which he did not understand, afraid to have people look at him and divine him, knowing more
of him perhaps than he himself knew, could make up his mind to move. He might have remained
there till the court broke up but for the movement of some one beside him, who gathered up
his hat and umbrella, and with some commotion pushed his way between the rows of seats. Philip
followed, thankful of the opportunity, and, as it happened, the sensation of the day being
over, many others followed too, and thus he got out into the curious, wondering daylight, which
seemed to look him in the face, as if this Philip had never been seen by it before. That was
the impression given him--that when he first came out the atmosphere quivered round him with
a strange novelty, as if he were some other being, some one without a name, new to the world,
new to himself. He did not seem sure that he would know his way home, and yet he did not call
a passing hansom, as he would have done yesterday, with a schoolboy's pleasure in assuming
a man's careless, easy ways. It is a long way from the Law Courts to Ebury Street, but it seemed
a kind of satisfaction to be in motion, to walk on along the crowded streets. And, as a matter
of fact, Philip did lose his way, and got himself entangled in a web of narrow streets and
monotonous little openings, all so like each other that it took him a long time to extricate
himself and find again the thread of a locality known to him. He did not know what he was to
do when he got in. Should he find her there, in the little dingy drawing-room as usual, with
the tea on the table? Would she receive him with her usual smile, and ask where he had been
and what he had seen, and if the Musgraves had enjoyed it, exactly as if nothing had happened?
Even this wonder was faint in Philip's mind, for the chief wonder to him was himself, and to
find out how he had changed since the morning--what he was now, who he was? what were the relations
to him of other people, of that other Philip Compton who had been seated in the court with
the opera-glass, who had arrived at Windyhill to visit Elinor Dennistoun on the 6th of September,
1863, twenty years ago? Who was that man? and what was he, himself Philip Compton, of Lakeside,
named Pippo, whom his mother had never once in all his life called by his real name?

To his great wonder, and yet almost relief, Philip found that his mother had not yet returned
when he got to Ebury Street. "Mrs. Compton said as she would very likely be late. Can I get
you some tea, sir? or, perhaps you haven't had your lunch? you're looking tired and worrited,"
said the landlady, who had known Pippo all his life. He consented to have tea, partly to fill
up the time, and went up languidly to the deserted room, which looked so miserable and desert
a place without her who put a soul into it and made it home. He did not know what to do with
himself, poor boy, but sat down vacantly, and stared into empty space, seeing, wherever he
turned, the rows of faces, the ladies making signs to each other, the red robes of the judge,
the lawyers contending, and that motionless pale figure in the witness-box. He shut his eyes
and saw the whole scene, then opened them again, and still saw it--the dingy walls disappearing,
the greyness of the afternoon giving a depth and distance to the limited space. Should he always
carry it about with him wherever he went, the vision of that court, the shock of that revelation?
And yet he did not yet know what the revelation was; the confusion in his mind was too great,
and the dust and mist that rose up about him as all the old building of his life crumbled and
fell away.

"I'm sure as it's that nasty trial, sir, as has been turning your mamma all out of her usual
ways," said the landlady, appearing with her tray.

"Oh, the trial! Did you know about the trial?" said Philip.

"Not, Mr. Pippo, as ever she mentioned it to me. Mrs. Compton is a lady as isn't that confidential,
though always an affable lady, and not a bit proud; but when you've known folks for years and
years, and take an interest, and put this and that together---- Dear, dear, I hope as you don't
think it's taking a liberty. It's more kindness nor curiosity, and I hope as you won't mention
it to your mamma."

Pippo shook his head and waved his hand, at once to satisfy the woman and dismiss her if possible;
but this was not so easy to do.

"And Lord St. Serf so bad, sir," she said. "Lord, to think that before we know where we are
there may be such changes, and new names, and no knowing what to say! But it's best not to
talk of it till it comes to pass, for there's many a slip between the cup and the lip, and
there's no saying what will happen with a man that's been a-dying for years and years."

What did the woman mean? He got rid of her at length, chiefly by dint of making no reply: and
then, to tell the truth, Pippo's eye had been caught by the pile of sandwiches which the kind
woman, pitying his tired looks, had brought up with the tea. He was ashamed of himself for
being hungry in such a dreadful emergency as this, but he was so, and could not help it, though
nothing would have made him confess so much, or even touch the sandwiches till she had gone
away. He pretended to ignore them till the door was shut after her, but could not help vividly
remembering that he had eaten nothing since the morning. The sandwiches did him a little good
in his mind as well as in his body. He got rid of the vision of the faces and of the red figure
on the bench. He began to believe that when he saw her she would tell him. Had she not said
so? That after awhile he should hear everything, and that all should be as it was before? All
as it was before--in the time when she told him everything, even things that Granny did not
know. But she had never told him this, and the other day she had told him that it was other
people's secrets, not her own, that she was keeping from him. "Other people's secrets"--the
secrets of the man who was Philip Compton, who went to Windyhill on the 6th of September, ten
days before Elinor Dennistoun's marriage day. "What Philip Compton? Who was he? What had he
to do with her? What, oh, what," Pippo said to himself, "has he to do with me?" After all,
that was the most tremendous question. The others, or anything that had happened twenty years
ago, were nothing to that.

Meanwhile Elinor, of all places in the world, was in John Tatham's chambers, to which he had
taken her to rest. I cannot tell how Mr. Tatham, a man so much occupied, managed to subtract
from all he had to do almost a whole day to see his cousin through the trial, and stand by
her, sparing her all the lesser annoyances which surround and exaggerate such a great fact.
He had brought her out into the fresh air, feeling that movement was the best thing for her,
and instead of taking her home in the carriage which was waiting, had made her walk with him,
supported on his arm, on which she hung in a sort of suspended life, across the street to the
Temple, hoping thus to bring her back, by the necessity of exertion, to herself. And indeed
she was almost more restored to herself by this remedy than John Tatham had expected or hoped.
For though he placed her in the great easy-chair, in which her slender person was engulfed
and supported, expecting her to rest there and lie motionless, perhaps even to faint, as women
are supposed to do when it is particularly inconvenient and uncomfortable, Elinor had not been
there two minutes before she rose up again and began to walk about the room, with an aspect
so unlike that of an exhausted and perhaps fainting woman, that even John, used as he was to
her capricious ways, was confounded. Instead of being subdued and thankful that it was over,
and this dreadful crisis in her life accomplished, Elinor walked up and down, wringing her
hands, moaning and murmuring to herself; what was it she was saying? "God forgive me! God forgive
me!" over and over and over, unconscious apparently that she was not alone, that any one heard
or observed her. No doubt there is in all our actions, the very best, much for God to forgive;
mingled motives, imperfect deeds, thoughts full of alloy and selfishness; but in what her conscience
could accuse her now he could not understand. She might be to blame in respect to her husband,
though he was very loth to allow the possibility; but in this act of her life, which had been
so great a strain upon her, it was surely without any selfishness, for his interest only, not
for her own. And yet John had never seen such a fervour of penitence, so strong a consciousness
of evil done. He went up to her and laid his hand upon her arm.

"Elinor, you are worn out. You have done too much. Will you try and rest a little here, or
shall I take you home?"

She started violently when he touched her. "What was I saying?" she said.

"It does not matter what you were saying. Sit down and rest. You will wear yourself out. Don't
think any more. Take this and rest a little, and then I will take you home."

"It is easy to say so," she said, with a faint smile. "Don't think! Is it possible to stop
thinking at one's pleasure?"

"Yes," said John, "quite possible; we must all do it or we should die. And now your trial's
over, Nelly, for goodness' sake exert yourself and throw it off. You have done your duty."

"My duty! do you think that was my duty? Oh, John, there are so many ways to look at it."

"Only one way, when you have a man's safety in your hands."

"Only one way--when one has a man's safety--his honour, honour! Do you think a woman is justified
in whatever she does, to save that?"

"I don't understand you, Elinor; in anything you have done, or could do, certainly you are
justified. My dear Nelly, sit down and take this. And then I will take you home."

She took the wine from his hand and swallowed a little of it; and then looking up into his
face with the faint smile which she put on when she expected to be blamed, and intended to
deprecate and disarm him, as she had done so often: "I don't know," she said, "that I am so
anxious to get home, John. You were to take Pippo to dine with you, and to the House to-night."

"So I was," he said. "We did not know what day you would be called. It is a great nuisance,
but if you think the boy would be disappointed not to go----"

"He would be much, much disappointed. The first chance he has had of hearing a debate."

"He would be much better at home, taking care of you."

"As if I wanted taking care of! or as if the boy, who has always been the object of everybody's
care himself, would be the proper person to do it! If he had been a girl, perhaps--but it is
a little late at this time of day to wish for that now."

"You were to tell him everything to-night, Elinor."

"Oh, I was to tell him! Do you think I have not had enough for one day? enough to wear me out
body and soul? You have just been telling me so, John."

He shook his head. "You know," he said, "and I know, that in any case you will have it your
own way, Elinor; but you have promised to tell him."

"John, you are unkind. You take advantage of me being here, and so broken down, to say that
I will have my own way. Has this been my own way at all? I would have fled if I could, and
taken the boy far, far away from it all; but you would not let me. Yes, yes, I have promised.
But I am tired to death. How could I look him in the face and tell him----" She hid her face
suddenly in her hands with a moan.

"It will be in the papers to-morrow morning, Elinor."

"Well! I will tell him to-morrow morning," she said.

John shook his head again; but it was done behind her, where she could not see the movement.
He had more pity of her than words could say. When she covered her face with her hands in that
most pathetic of attitudes, there was nothing that he would not have forgiven her. What was
to become of her now? Her position through all these years had never been so dangerous, in
John's opinion, never so sad, as now. Philip Compton had been there looking on while she put
his accusers to silence, at what cost to herself John only began dimly to guess--to divine,
to forbid himself to inquire. The fellow had been there all the time. He had the grace not
to look at her, not to distract her with the sight of him--probably for his own sake, John
thought bitterly, that she might not risk breaking down. But he was there, and knew where she
was to be found. And he had seen the boy, and had cared enough to fix his gaze upon him, that
gaze which John had found intolerable at the theatre. And he was on the eve of becoming Lord
St. Serf, and Pippo his heir. What was to be the issue of these complications? What was to
happen to her who had hid the boy so long, who certainly could hide him no more?

He took her home to Ebury Street shortly after, where Philip, weary of waiting, and having
made a meal he much wanted off the sandwiches, had gone out again in his restlessness and unhappiness.
Elinor, who had become paler and paler as the carriage approached Ebury Street, and who by
the time she reached the house looked really as if at last she must swoon, her heart choking
her, her breathing quick and feverish, had taken hold of John to support herself, clutching
at his arm, when she was told that Philip was out. She came to herself instantly on the strength
of that news. "Tell him when he comes in to make haste," she said, "for Mr. Tatham is waiting
for him. As for me I am fit for nothing but bed. I have had a very tiring day."

"You do look tired, ma'am," said the sympathetic landlady. "I'll run up and put your room ready,
and then I'll make you a nice cup of tea."

John Tatham thought that, notwithstanding her exhaustion, her anxiety, all the realities of
troubles present and to come that were in her mind and in her way, there was a flash something
like triumph in Elinor's eyes. "Tell Pippo," she said, "he can come up and say good-night to
me before he goes. I am good for nothing but my bed. If I can sleep I shall be able for all
that is before me to-morrow." The triumph was quenched, however, if there had been triumph,
when she gave him her hand, with a wistful smile, and a sigh that filled that to-morrow with
the terror and the trouble that must be in it, did she do what she said. John went up to the
little drawing-room to wait for Pippo, with a heavy heart. It seemed to him that never had
Elinor been in so much danger. She had exposed herself to the chance of losing the allegiance
of her son: she was at the mercy of her husband, that husband whom she had renounced, yet whom
she had not refused to save, whose call she had obeyed to help him, though she had thrown off
all the bonds of love and duty towards him. She had not had the strength either way to be consistent,
to carry out one steady policy. It was cruel of John to say this, for but for him and his remonstrances
Elinor would, or might have, fled, and avoided this last ordeal. But he had not done so, and
now here she was in the middle of her life, her frail ship of safety driven about among the
rocks, dependent upon the magnanimity of the husband from whom she had fled, and the child
whom she had deceived.

"Your mother is very tired, Philip," he said, when the boy appeared. "I was to tell you to
go up and bid her good-night before you went out; for it will probably be late before you get
back, if you think you are game to sit out the debate."

"I will sit it out," said Philip, with no laughter in his eye, with an almost solemn air, as
if announcing a grave resolution. He went up-stairs, not three steps at a time, as was his
wont, but soberly, as if his years had been forty instead of eighteen. And he showed no surprise
to find the room darkened, though Elinor was a woman who loved the light. He gave his mother
a kiss and smoothed her pillow with a tender touch of pity. "Is your head very bad?" he said.

"It is only that I am dreadfully tired, Pippo. I hope I shall sleep: and it will help me to
think you are happy with Uncle John."

"Then I shall try to be happy with Uncle John," he said, with a sort of smile. "Good-night,
mother; I hope you'll be better to-morrow."

"Oh, yes," she said. "To-morrow is always a new day."

He seemed in the half light to nod his head, and then to shake it, as one that assents, but
doubts--having many troubled thoughts and questions in his mind. But Pippo did not at all expect
to be happy with Uncle John.

CHAPTER XLVI.

It cannot be said that Uncle John was very happy with Philip, but that was a thing the others
did not take into account. John Tatham was doing for the boy as much as a man could do. A great
debate was expected that evening, in which many eminent persons were to speak, and Mr. Tatham
gave Philip a hasty dinner in the House so that he should lose nothing, and he found him a
corner in the distinguished strangers' gallery, telling him with a smile that he expected him
hereafter to prove his title to such a place. But Philip's smile in return was very unlike
the flush of pleasure that would have lighted it up only yesterday. John felt that the boy
was not at all the delightful young companion, full of interest in everything, that he had
been. Perhaps he was on his good behaviour, on his dignity, bent upon showing how much of a
man he was and how little influenced by passing sentiments, as some boys do. Anyhow it was
certain that he was much less agreeable in his self-subdued condition. But John was fortunately
much interested in the discussion, in which, indeed, he took himself a slight part, and, save
for a passing wonder and the disappointment of the moment, did not occupy himself so very much
with Pippo. When he looked into the corner, however, in a lull of the debate, when one of those
fools who rush in at unguarded moments, when the Speaker chances to look their way, had managed
to get upon his foolish feet to the despair of all around, the experienced man of the world
received a curious shock from the sight of young Philip's intense gravity, and the self-absorbed,
unconscious look he wore. The boy had the look of hearing nothing, seeing nothing that was
around him, of being lost in thoughts of his own, thoughts far too serious and troubled for
his age. Had he discovered something? What did he know? This was the instinctive question that
rose in John's mind, and not an amused anticipation of Pippo's original boyish view of the
question and the speakers, such as had delighted him on the boy's previous visits to the House.
And indeed Philip's attention was little fixed upon the debate. He tried hard to bring it back,
to keep it there, to get the question into his mind, but in spite of himself his thoughts flew
back to the other public assembly in which he had sat unnoticed that day: till gradually the
aspect of things changed to him, the Speaker became the judge, the wigged secretaries the pleaders,
and he almost expected to see that sudden apparition, that sight that had plucked him out of
his careless life of boyhood and trust, the sight of his mother standing before the world on
trial for her life. Oh, no, no, not on trial at all! he was aware of that: a harmless witness,
doing only good. The judge could have nothing but polite regard for her, the jury admiration
and thanks for the clear testimony which took a weight from their shoulders. But before her
son she was on her trial, her trial for more than life--and he who said with so much assurance
that his mother had no secrets from him! until the moment arrived, without any warning, in
the midst of his security, which proved that everything had been secret, and that all was mystery--all
mystery! and nothing sure in life.

It crossed Philip's mind more than once to question John Tatham upon this dreadful discovery
of his--John, who was a relation, who had been the universal referee of the household as long
as he could remember, Uncle John must know. But there were two things which held him back:
first, the recollection of his own disdainful offence at the suggestion that Uncle John, an
outsider, could know more than he did of the family concerns; and partly from the proud determination
to ask no questions, to seek no information that was not freely given to him. He made up his
mind to this while he looked out from his corner upon the lighted House, seeing men move up
and down, and voices going on, and the sound of restless members coming and going, while the
business of the country went on. It was far more important than any private affairs that could
be passing in an individual brain, and Philip knew with what high-handed certainty he would
have put down the idea that to himself at his age there could be anything private half so exciting,
half so full of interest, as a debate on the policy of the country which might carry with it
the highest issues. But conviction comes readily on such subjects when the personal interest
comes which carries every other away. It was while a minister was speaking, and everything
hanging on his words, that the boy made up his mind finally that he would ask no questions.
He would ignore that scene in the Law Courts, as if it had not been. He would say nothing,
try to look as if nothing had passed, and wait to see if any explanation would come.

It was not, perhaps, then to be wondered at if John found him a much less interesting companion
than ever before, as they walked home together in the small hours of the night. Mr. Tatham's
own speech had been short, but he had the agreeable consciousness that it had been an effective
one, and he was prepared to find the boy excited by it, and full of applause and satisfaction.
But Philip did not say a word about the speech. He was only a boy, and it may be supposed that
any applause from him would have had little importance for the famous lawyer--the highly-esteemed
member who kept his independence, and whose speeches always secured the attention of the House,
and carried weight as among the few utterances which concerned the real import of a question
and not its mere party meaning. But John was hurt more than he could have thought possible
by Philip's silence. He even tried to lead the conversation artfully to that point in the debate,
thinking perhaps the boy was shy of speaking on the subject--but with no effect. It was exceedingly
strange. Had he been deceived in Philip? had the boy really no interest in subjects of an elevated
description? or was he ill? or what was the matter with him? It troubled John to let him go
on alone from Halkin Street to his lodging, with a vague sense that something might happen.
But that was, of course, too absurd. "Tell your mother I'll come round in the afternoon to-morrow,
as soon as I am free," he said, holding Philip's hand. And then he added, paternally, still
holding that hand, "Go to bed at once, boy. You've had a tiring day."

"Yes--I suppose so," said Philip, drawing his hand away.

"I hope you haven't done too much," said John, still lingering. "You're too young for politics--and
to sit up so late. I was wrong to keep you out of bed."

"I hope I'm not such a child as that," said Philip, with a half-smile: and then he went away,
and John Tatham, with an anxious heart, closed behind him his own door. If it were not for
Elinor and her boy what a life free of anxiety John would have had! Never any need to think
with solicitude of anything outside that peaceful door, no trouble with other people's feelings,
with investigations what this or that look or word meant. But perhaps it was Elinor and her
boy, after all (none of his! thinking of him as an outsider, having nothing to do with their
most intimate circle of confidence and natural defence), who, by means of that very anxiety,
kept alive the higher principles of humanity in John Tatham's heart.

Philip went home, walking quickly through the silent streets. They were very silent at that
advanced hour, yet not so completely but that there was a woman who came up to the boy at the
corner. Philip neither knew nor desired to know what she said. He thought nothing about her
one way or another. He took a shilling out of his pocket and threw it to her as he passed--walking
on with the quick, elastic step which the sudden acquaintance he had made with care had not
been able to subdue. He saw that there was still a faint light in his mother's window when
he reached the house, but he would not disturb her. How little would he have thought of disturbing
her on any other occasion! "Are you asleep, mother?" he would have said, looking in; and the
time had never been when Elinor was asleep. She had always heard him, always replied, always
been delighted to hear the account of what he had been doing, and how he had enjoyed himself.
But not to-night. With a heart full of longing, yet of a sick revolt against the sight of her,
he went past her door to his room. He did not want to see her, and yet--oh, if she had only
called to him, if she had but said a word!

Elinor for her part was not asleep. She had slept a little while she was sure that Philip was
safely disposed of and herself secured from all interruption; but when the time came for his
return she slept no longer, and had been lying for a long time holding her breath, listening
to every sound, when she heard his key in the latch and his foot on the stair. Would he come
in as he always did? or would he remember her complaint of being tired, a complaint she so
seldom made? It was as a blow to Elinor when she heard his step go on past her door: and yet
she was glad. Had he come in there was a desperate thought in her mind that she would call
him to her bedside and in the dark, with his hand in hers, tell him--all that there was to
tell. But it was again a relief when he passed on, and she felt that she was spared for an
hour or two, spared for the new day, which perhaps would give her courage. It was an endless
night, long hours of dark, and then longer hours of morning light, too early for anything,
while still nobody in the house was stirring. She had scarcely slept at all during that long
age of weary and terrible thought. For it was not as if she had but one thing to think of.
When her mind turned, like her restless body, from one side to another, it was only to a change
of pain. What was it she had said, standing up before earth and heaven, and calling God to
witness that what she said was true? It had been true, and yet she knew that it was not, and
that she had saved her husband's honour at the cost of her own. Oh, not in those serious and
awful watches of the night can such a defence be accepted as that the letter of her testimony
was true! She did not attempt to defend herself. She only tried to turn to another thought
that might be less bitter: and then she was confronted by the confession that she must make
to her boy. She must tell him that she had deceived him all his life, hid from him what he
ought to have known, separated him from his father and his family, kept him in ignorance, despite
all that had been said to her, despite every argument. George was silent. But the better atmosphere
was affecting him somewhat, and consciousness was becoming clearer. Only, what seemed to him
a loud noise disturbed him--tortured the wound in his head. Then, gradually, as he bent his
mind upon it, he made out what it was--a slow drip or trickle of water from the face of the
wall. The contrast between his imagination and the reality supplied him with a kind of measure of
the silence that enwrapped them--silence that seemed in itself a living thing, charged with
the brooding vengeance of the earth upon the creatures that had been delving at her heart.

"Burrows!--that water--maddens me." He moved his head miserably. "Could you get some? The brandy-flask
has a cup."

"There is a little pool by the brattice. I put my cap in as we got there, and dashed it over
you. I'll go again."

George heard the long limbs drag themselves painfully along. Then he lost count again of time,
and all impressions on the ear, till he was roused by the water at his lips and a hand dashing
some on his brow.

He drank greedily.

"Thanks! Put it by me--there; that's safe. Now, Burrows, I'm dying. Leave me. You can't do anything--and
you--you might still try for it. There are one or two ways that might be worth trying. Take these
keys. I could explain--"

But the little thread of life wavered terribly as he spoke. Burrows had to put his ear close to the
scorched lips.

"No," he said gloomily, "I don't leave a man while there's any life in him. Besides, there's no
chance--I don't know the mine."

Suddenly, as though answering to the other's despair, a throb of such agony rose in George
it seemed to rive body and soul asunder. His poor Letty!--his child that was to be!--his own
energy of life, he had been so conscious of at the very moment of descending to this hideous
death--all gone, all done!--his little moment of being torn from
him by the inexorable force that restores nothing and explains nothing.

A
picture flashed into his mind, an etching that he had seen in Paris
in a shop window--had seen and pondered over. "Entombed" was written
underneath it, and it showed a solitary miner, on whom the awful trap
has fallen, lifting his arms to his face in a last cry against the
universe that has brought him into being, that has given him nerve
and brain--for this!

Wherever he turned his eyes in the blackness
he saw it--the lifted arms, the bare torso of the man, writhing under
the agony of realisation--the tools, symbols of a life's toil, lying
as they had dropped for ever from the hands that should work no more.
It had sent a shudder through him, even amid the gaiety of a Paris
street.

Then this first image was swept away by a second. It seemed
to him that he was on the pit bank again. It was night, but the crowd
was still there, and big fires lighted for warmth threw a glow upon
the faces. There were stars, and a pale light of snow upon the hills.
He looked into the engine-house. There she was--his poor Letty! O God! Elinor asked, with a sudden precaution, that
the newspapers might be brought up to her, not so much for her own satisfaction--for it made
her heart sick to think of reading over in dreadful print, as would be done that morning at
millions of breakfast-tables, her own words: perhaps with comments on herself and her history,
which might fall into Pippo's hands, and be read by him before he knew: which was a sudden
spur to herself and evidence of the dread necessity of letting him know that story from her
own lips, which had not occurred to her before. She glanced over the report with a sickening
sense that all the privacy of sheltered life and honourable silence was torn off from her,
and that she was exposed as on a pillory to the stare and the remarks of the world, and crushed
the paper away like a noxious thing into a drawer where the boy at least would never find it.
Vain thought! as if there was but one paper in the world, as if he could not find it at every
street corner, thrust into his hand even as he walked along; but at all events for the moment
he would not see it, and she would have time--time to tell him before that revelation could
come in his way. She went down-stairs, with what a tremor in her and sinking of her heart it
would be impossible to say. To have to condemn herself to her only child; to humble herself
before him, her boy, who thought there was no one like his mother; to let him know that he
had been deceived all his life, he who thought she had always told him everything. Oh, poor
mother! and oh, poor boy!

She was still sitting by the breakfast-table, waiting, in a chill fever, if such a thing can
be, for Philip, when a thing occurred which no one could have thought of, and yet which was
the most natural thing in the world--which came upon Elinor like a thunderbolt, shattering
all her plans again just at the moment when, after so much shrinking and delay, she had at
last made up her mind to the one thing that must be done at once. The sound of the driving
up of a cab to the door made her go to the window to look out, without producing any expectation
in her mind: for people were coming and going in Ebury Street all day long. She saw, however,
a box which she recognised upon the cab, and then the door was opened and Mrs. Dennistoun stepped
out. Her mother! the wonder was not that she came now, but that she had not come much sooner.
No letters for several days, her child and her child's child in town, and trouble in the air!
Mrs. Dennistoun had borne it as long as she could, but there had come a moment when she could
bear it no longer, and she too had followed Pippo's example and taken the night mail. Elinor
stood motionless at the window, and saw her mother arrive, and did not feel capable of going
to meet her, or of telling whether it was some dreadful aggravation of evil, or an interposition
of Providence to save her for another hour at least from the ordeal before her.

CHAPTER XLVII.

Mrs. Dennistoun had a great deal to say about herself and the motives which had at the last
been too much for her, which had forced her to come after her children at a moment's notice,
feeling that she could bear the uncertainty about them no longer; and it was a thing so unusual
with her to have much to say about herself that there was certainly something apologetic, something
self-defensive in this unaccustomed outburst. Perhaps she had begun to feel a little the unconscious
criticism that gathers round the elder person in a house, the inclination involuntarily--which
every one would repudiate, yet which nevertheless is true--to attribute to her a want of perception,
perhaps--oh, not unkindly!--a little blunting of the faculties, a suggestion quite unintentional
that she is not what she once was. She explained herself so distinctly that there was no doubt
there was some self-defence in it. "I had not had a letter for three days."

And Elinor was far more humble than her wont. "I know, mother: I felt as if it were impossible
to write--till it was over----"

"My darling! I thought at last I must come and stand by you. I felt that I ought to have seen
that all the time--that you should have had your mother by your side to give you countenance."

"I had John with me, mother."

"Then it is over!" Mrs. Dennistoun cried.

And at that moment Pippo, very late, pale, and with eyes which were red with sleeplessness,
and perhaps with tears, came in. Elinor gave her mother a quick look, almost of blame, and
then turned to the boy. She did not mean it, and yet Mrs. Dennistoun felt as if the suggestion,
"He might never have known had you not called out like that," was in her daughter's eyes.

"Pippo!" she said. "Why, Elinor! what have you been doing to the boy?"

"He does not look well," said Elinor, suddenly waking up to that anxiety which had been always
so easily roused in respect to Pippo. "He was very late last night. He was at the House with
John," she added, involuntarily, with an apology to her mother for the neglect which had extended
to Pippo too.

"There is nothing the matter with me," he said, with a touch of sullenness in his tone.

The two women looked at each other with all the vague trouble in their eyes suddenly concentrated
upon young Philip, but they said nothing more, as he sat down at table and began to play with
the breakfast, for which he had evidently no appetite. No one had ever seen that sullen look
in Pippo's face before. He bent his head over the table as if he were intent upon the food
which choked him when he tried to eat, and which he loathed the very sight of--and did not
say a word. They had certainly not been very light-hearted before, but the sight of the boy
thus obscured and changed made all the misery more evident. There was always a possibility
of over-riding the storm so long as all was well with Pippo: but his changed countenance veiled
the very sun in the skies.

"You don't seem surprised to see me here," his grandmother said.

"Oh!--no, I am not surprised. I wonder you did not come sooner. Have you been travelling all
night?" he said.

"Just as you did, Pippo. I drove into Penrith last night and caught the mail train. I was seized
with a panic about you, and felt that I must see for myself."

"It is not the first time you have taken a panic about us, mother," said Elinor, forcing a smile.

"No; but it is almost the first time I have acted upon it," said Mrs. Dennistoun, with that
faint instinct of self-defence; "but I think you must have needed me more than usual to keep
you in order. You must have been going out too much, keeping late hours. You are pale enough,
Elinor, but Pippo--Pippo has suffered still more."

"I tell you," said Philip, raising his shoulders and stooping his head over the table, "granny,
that there is nothing the matter with me."

And he took no part in the conversation as they went on talking, of any subjects but those
that were most near their hearts. They had, indeed, no thoughts at all to spare but those that
were occupied with the situation, and with this new feature in it, Pippo's worn and troubled
looks, yet had to talk of something, of nothing, while the meal went on, which was no meal
at all for any of them. When it was over at last Pippo rose abruptly from the table.

"Are you going out?" Elinor said, alarmed, rising too. "Have you any engagement with the Marshalls
for to-day?"

"I don't know," Philip said; "Mr. Marshall was ill yesterday. I didn't see them. I'm not going
out. I am going to my room."

"You've got a headache, Pippo!"

"Nothing of the kind! I tell you there is nothing the matter with me. I'm only going to my room."

Elinor put her hands on his arm. "Pippo, I have something to say to you before you go out.
Will you promise to let me know before you go out? I don't want to keep you back from anything,
but I have something that I must say."

He did not ask with his usual interest what it was. He showed no curiosity; on the contrary,
he drew his arm out of her hold almost rudely. "Of course," he said, "I will come in here before
I go out. I have no intention of going out now."

And thus he left them, and went with a heavy step, oh, how different from Pippo's flying foot:
so that they could count every step, up-stairs.

"What is the matter, what is the matter, Elinor?"

"I know nothing," she said; "nothing! He was like himself yesterday morning, full of life.
Unless he is ill, I cannot understand it. But, mother, I have to tell him--everything to-day."

"God grant it may not be too late, Elinor!" Mrs. Dennistoun said.

"Too late? How can it be too late? Yes; perhaps you are right, John and you. He ought to have
known from the beginning; he ought to have been told when he was a child. I acknowledge that
I was wrong; but it is no use," she said, wiping away some fiery tears, "to go back upon that now."

"John could not have told him anything?" Mrs. Dennistoun said, doubtfully.

"John! my best friend, who has always stood by me. Oh, never, never. How little you know him,
mother! He has been imploring me every day, almost upon his knees, to tell Pippo everything;
and I promised to do it as soon as the time was come. And then last night I was so glad to
think that he was engaged with John, and I so worn out, not fit for anything. And then this
morning----"

"Then--this morning I arrived, just when I would have been better away!"

"Don't say that, mother. It is always, always well you should be with your children. And, oh,
if I had but taken your advice years and years ago!"

How easy it is to wish this when fate overtakes us, when the thing so long postponed, so long
pushed away from us, has to be done at last! There is, I fear, no repentance in it, only the
intolerable sense that the painful act might have been over long ago, and the soul free now
of a burden which is so terrible to bear.

Philip did not leave his room all the morning. His mother, overwhelmed now by the new anxiety
about his health, which had no part in her thoughts before, went to his door and knocked several
times, always with the intention of going in, of insisting upon the removal of all barriers,
and of telling her story, the story which now was as fire in her veins and had to be told.
But he had locked his door, and only answered from within that he was reading--getting up something
that he had forgotten--and begged her to leave him undisturbed till lunch. Poor Elinor! Her
story was, as I have said, like fire in her veins; but when the moment came, and a little more
delay, an hour, a morning was possible, she accepted it like a boon from heaven, though she
knew very well all the same that it was but prolonging the agony, and that to get it accomplished--to
get it over--was the only thing to desire. She tried to arrange her thoughts, to think how
she was to tell it, in the hurrying yet flying minutes when she sat alone, listening now and
then to Philip's movements over her head, for he was not still as a boy should be who was reading,
but moved about his room, with a nervous restlessness that seemed almost equal to her own.
Mrs. Dennistoun, to leave her daughter free for the conversation that ought to take place between
Elinor and her son, had gone to lie down, and lay in Elinor's room, next door to the boy, listening
to every sound, and hoping, hoping that they would get it over before she went down-stairs
again. She did not believe that Philip would stand out against his mother, whom he loved. Oh,
if they could but get it over, that explanation--if the boy but knew! But it was apparent enough,
when she came down to luncheon, where Elinor awaited her, pale and anxious, and where Philip
followed, so unlike himself, that no explanation had yet taken place between them. And the
luncheon was as miserable a pretence at a meal as the breakfast had been--worse as a repetition,
yet better in so far that poor Pippo, with his boyish wholesome appetite, was by this time
too hungry to be restrained even by the unusual burden of his unhappiness, and ate heartily,
although he was bitterly ashamed of so doing: which perhaps made him a little better, and certainly
did a great deal of good to the ladies, who thus were convinced that whatever the matter might
be, he was not ill at least. He was about to return up-stairs after luncheon was over, but
Elinor caught him by the arm: "You are not going to your room again, Pippo?"

"I--have not finished my reading," he said.

"I have a claim before your reading. I have a great deal to say to you, and I cannot put it
off any longer. It must be said----"

"As you please, mother," he replied, with an air of endurance. And he opened the door for her
and followed her up to the drawing-room, the three generations going one before the other,
the anxious grandmother first, full of sympathy for both; the mother trembling in every limb,
feeling the great crisis of her life before her; the boy with his heart seared, half bitter,
half contemptuous of the explanation which he had forestalled, which came too late. Mrs. Dennistoun
turned and kissed first one and then the other with quivering lips. "Oh, Pippo, be kind to
your mother; she never will have such need of your kindness again in all your life." The boy
could almost have struck her for this advice. It raised a kind of savage passion in him to
be told to be kind to his mother--kind to her, when he had held her above all beings on the
earth, and prided himself all his life upon his devotion to her! What Mrs. Dennistoun said
to Elinor I cannot tell, but she clasped her hands and gave her an imploring look, which was
almost as bitterly taken as her appeal to Philip. It besought her to tell everything, to hide
nothing; and what was Elinor's meaning but to tell everything, to lay bare her heart?

But once more at this moment an interruption--the most wonderful and unthought-of of all interruptions--came.
I suppose it must have been announced by the usual summons at the street-door, and that in
their agitation they had not heard it. But all that I know is, that when Mrs. Dennistoun turned
to leave the mother and son to their conversation, which was so full of fate, the door of the
drawing-room opened almost upon her as she was about to go out, and with a little demonstration
and pride, as of a name which it was a distinction even to be permitted to say, of a visitor
whose arrival could not be but an honour and delightful surprise, the husband of the landlady--the
man of the house, once a butler of the highest pretensions, now only condescending to serve
his lodgers when the occasion was dignified--swept into the room, noiseless and solemn, holding
open the door, and announced "Lord St. Serf." Mrs. Dennistoun fell back as if she had met a
ghost; and Elinor, too, drew back a step, becoming as pale as if she had been the ghost her
mother saw. The gasp of the long breath they both drew made a sound in the room where the very
air seemed to tingle; and young Philip, raising his head, saw, coming in, the man whom he had
seen in court--the man who had gazed at him in the theatre, the man of the opera-glass. But
was this then not the Philip Compton for whom Elinor Dennistoun had stood forth, and borne
witness before all the world?

He came in and stood without a word, waiting for a moment till the servant was gone and the
door closed; and then he advanced with a step, the very assurance and quickness of which showed
his hesitation and uncertainty. He did not hold out his hands--much less his arms--to her.
"Nell?" he said, as if he had been asking a question, "Nell?"

She seemed to open her lips to speak, but brought forth no sound; and then Mrs. Dennistoun
came in with the grave voice of every day, "Will you sit down?"

He looked round at her, perceiving her for the first time. "Ah," he said, "mamma! how good
that you are here. It is a little droll though, don't you think, when a man comes into the
bosom of his family after an absence of eighteen years, that the only thing that is said to
him should be, 'Will you sit down?' Better that, however, a great deal, than 'Will you go away?'"

He sat down as she invited him, with a short laugh. He was perfectly composed in manner. Looking
round him with curious eyes, "Was this one of the places," he said, "Nell, that we stayed in
in the old times?"

She answered "No" under her breath, her paleness suddenly giving way to a hot flush of feverish
agitation. And then she took refuge in a vacant chair, unable to support herself, and he sat
too, and the party looked--but for that agitation in Elinor's face, which she could not master--as
if the ladies were receiving and he paying a morning call. The other two, however, did not
sit down. Young Philip, confused and excited, went away to the second room, the little back
drawing-room of the little London house, which can never be made to look anything but an anteroom--never
a habitable place--and went to the window, and stood there as if he were looking out, though
the window was of coloured glass, and there was nothing to be seen. Mrs. Dennistoun stood with
her hand upon the back of a chair, her heart beating too, and yet the most collected of them
all, waiting, with her eyes on Elinor, for a sign to know her will, whether she should go or
stay. It was the visitor who was the first to speak.

"Let me beg you," he said, with a little impatience in his voice, "to sit down too. It is evident
that Nell's reception of me is not likely to be so warm as to make it unpleasant for a third
party. There was a fourth party in the room a minute ago, if my eyes did not deceive me. Ah!"--his
glance went rapidly to where Philip's tall boyish figure, with his back turned, was visible
against the further window--"that's all right," he said, "now I presume everybody's here."

"Had we expected your visit," said Mrs. Dennistoun, faltering, after a moment, as Elinor did
not speak, "we should have been--better prepared to receive you, Mr. Compton."

"That's not spoken with your usual cleverness," he said, with a laugh. "You used to be a great
deal too clever for me, you and Nell too. But if she did not expect to see me, I don't know
what she thought I was made of--everything that is bad, I suppose: and yet you know I could
have worried your life out of you if I had liked, Nell."

She turned to him for the first time, and, putting her hands together, said almost inaudibly,
"I know--I know. I have thought of that, and I am not ungrateful."

"Grateful! Well, perhaps you have not much call for that, poor little woman. I don't doubt
I behaved like a brute, and you were quite right in doing what you did; but you've taken it
out of me since, Nell, all the same."

Then there was again a silence, broken only by the labouring, which she could not quite conceal,
of her breath.

"You wouldn't believe me," he resumed after a moment, "if I were to set up a sentimental pose,
like a sort of a disconsolate widower, eh, would you? Of course it was a position that was
not without its advantages. I was not much made for a family man, and both in the way of expense
and in--other ways, it suited me well enough. Nobody could expect me to marry them or their
daughters, don't you see, when they knew I had a wife alive? So I was allowed my little amusements.
You never went in for that kind of thing, Nell? Don't snap me up. You know I told you I never
was against a little flirtation. It makes a woman more tolerant, in my opinion, just to know
how to amuse herself a little. But Nell was never one of that kind----"

"I hope not, indeed," said Mrs. Dennistoun, to whom he had turned, with indignation.

"I don't see where the emphasis comes in. She was one that a man could be as sure of as of
Westminster Abbey. The heart of her husband rests upon her--isn't that what the fellow in the
Bible says, or words to that effect? Nell was always a kind of a Bible to me. And you may say
that in that case to think of her amusing herself! But you will allow she always did take everything
too much au grand serieux. No? to be sure, you'll allow nothing. But still that was the truth.
However, I'll allow something if you won't. I'm past my first youth. Oh, you, not a bit of
it! You're just as fresh and as pretty, by George! as ever you were. When I saw you stand up
in that court yesterday looking as if--not a week had passed since I saw you last, by Jove!
Nell---- And how you were hating it, poor old girl, and had come out straining your poor little
conscience, and saying what you didn't want to say--for the sake of a worthless fellow like me----"

A sob came out of Elinor's breast, and something half inaudible besides, like a name.

"I can tell you this," he said, turning to Mrs. Dennistoun again, "I couldn't look at her.
I'm an unlikely brute for that sort of thing, but if I had looked at her I should have cried.
I daresay you don't believe me. Never mind, but it's true."

"I do believe you," said the mother, very low.

"Thank you," he said, with a laugh. "I have always said for a mother-in-law you were the least
difficult to get on with I ever saw. Do you remember giving me that money to make ducks and
drakes of? It was awfully silly of you. You didn't deserve to be trusted with money to throw
it away like that, but still I have not forgotten it. Well! I came to thank you for yesterday,
Nell. And there are things, you know, that we must talk over. You never gave up your name.
That was like your pluck. But you will have to change it now. It was indecent of me to have
myself announced like that and poor old St. Serf not in his grave yet. But I daresay you didn't
pay any attention. You are Lady St. Serf now, my dear. You don't mind, I know, but it's a change
not without importance. Well, who is that fellow behind there, standing in the window? I think
you ought to present him to me. Or I'll present him to you instead. I saw him in the theatre,
by Jove! with that fellow Tatham, that cousin John of yours that I never could bear, smirking
and smiling at him as if it were his son! but I saw the boy then for the first time. Nell,
I tell you there are some things in which you have taken it well out of me----"

"Mr. Compton," she said, labouring to speak. "Lord St. Serf. Oh, Phil, Phil!----"

"Ah," he said, with a start, "do you remember at last? the garden at that poky old cottage
with all the flowers, and the days when you looked out for wild Phil Compton that all the world
warned you against? And here I am an old fogey, without either wife or child, and Tatham taking
my boy about and Nell never looking me in the face."

Philip, at the window looking out at nothing through the hideous-coloured glass, had heard
every word, with wonder, with horror, with consternation, with dreadful disappointment and
sinking of the heart. For indeed he had a high ideal of a father, the highest, such as fatherless
boys form in their ignorance. And every word made it more sure that this was his father, this
man who had so caught his eyes and filled him with such a fever of interest. But to hear Phil
Compton talk had brought the boy's soaring imagination down, down to the dust. He had not been
prepared for anything like this. Some tragic rending asunder he could have believed in, some
wild and strange mystery. But this man of careless speech, of chaff and slang, so little noble,
so little serious, so far from tragic! The disappointment had been too sudden and dreadful
to leave him with any ears for those tones that went to his mother's heart. He had no pity
or sense of the pathos that was in them. He stood in his young absolutism disgusted, miserable.
This man his father!--this man! so talking, so thinking. Young Philip stood with his back to
the group, more miserable than words could say. He heard some movement behind, but he was too
sick of heart to think what it was, until suddenly he felt a hand on his shoulder, and most
unwillingly suffered himself to be turned round to meet his father's eyes. He gave one glance
up at the face, which he did not now feel was worn with study and care--which now that he saw
it near was full of lines and wrinkles which meant something else, and which even the emotion
in it, emotion of a kind which Pippo did not understand, hidden by a laugh, did not make more
prepossessing--and then he stood with his eyes cast down, not caring to see it again.

The elder Philip Compton had, I think, though he was, as he said, an unlikely subject for that
mood, tears in his eyes--and he had no inclination to see anything that was painful in the
face of his son, whose look he had never read, whose voice he had never heard, till now. He
held the boy with his hands on his shoulders, with a grasp more full perhaps of the tender
strain of love (though he did not know him) than ever he had laid upon any human form before.
The boy's looks were not only satisfactory to him, but filled his own heart with an unaccustomed
spring of pride and delight--his stature, his complexion, his features, making up as it were
the most wonderful compliment, the utmost sweetness of flattery that he had ever known. For
the boy was himself over again, not like his mother, like the unworthy father whom he had never
seen. It took him some time to master the sudden rush of this emotion which almost overwhelmed
him: and then he drew the boy's arm through his own and led him back to where the two ladies
sat, Elinor still too much agitated for speech. "I said I'd present my son to you, Nell--if
you wouldn't present him to me," he said, with a break in his voice which sounded like a chuckle
to that son's angry ears. "I don't know what you call the fellow--but he's big enough to have
a name of his own, and he's Lomond from this day."

Pippo did not know what was meant by those words: but he drew his arm from his father's and
went and stood behind Elinor's chair, forgetting in a moment all grievances against her, taking
her side with an energy impossible to put into words, clinging to his mother as he had done
when he was a little child.

CHAPTER XLVIII.

It was while this conversation was going on that John Tatham, anxious and troubled about many
things, knocked at the door in Ebury Street. Twenty years earlier the Library had also assisted
in the reorganisation of the Turnbull Library as a State library. Mr J. C. Andersen was for some time
on the staff, resigning to become first Librarian. In addition, both Mr Wilson and Dr Scholefield
were in turn Advisory Directors to the Turnbull Library until the post was abolished in 1930.

The
Library as a Museum

The Library has during its century collected many curios which should really have been given to
a museum. The Library Committee has had to decide frequently whether historical relics could be
displayed.

In 1886, after the Taiaha of Wahanui presented to James Bryce had been refused, the Committee
laid down that nothing but books, manuscripts, maps, etc., should be deposited without special
permission.

However the Library possesses today many such relics. There are the caskets containing the Freedoms
of certain cities presented to Mr Fraser, a similar collection of
Mr Seddon's and of Sir Joseph Ward's, the pen used by Mr Massey to
sign the Treaty of Versailles, a kava bowl, mats, etc., from Samoa,
and many other items.

The Library also had for a time the Bishop Monrad etchings and the
Chevalier pictures, but these were handed over to the Turnbull Library
and Academy of Fine Arts respectively.

The display of such objects tends to attract to the Library visitors not interested in the books,
but whose conversation distracts more serious readers.

Purchase of Books

Though today books are purchased in many countries
most of the books have always been obtained in England. The first
books were bought from Smith and Elder in London, but this was not
continued. Instead, an arrangement was entered into with a Mr Maberly
of Auckland, partner in a London firm of booksellers, to obtain and
bind books uniformly.

Young Lord Lomond too! The boy! who had been more like John's boy than anything else, but now
tricked out in a new name, a new position, his father's heir. Oh, yes, it was John himself
who had insisted on that only a few days ago! "The heir to a peerage can't be hid." It was
he that had quoted this as an aphorism worthy of a social sage. But when the moment came and
the boy was taken from him, and introduced into that other sphere, by the side of that man
who had once been the dis-Honourable Phil! Good heavens, what changes life is capable of! What
wrongs, what cruelties, what cuttings-off, what twists and alterations of every sane thought
and thing! John Tatham was a sensible man as well as an eminent lawyer, and knew that between
Elinor's son, who was Phil Compton's son, and himself, there was no external link at all--nothing
but affection and habit, and the ever-strengthening link that had been twisted closer and closer
with the progress of these years; but nothing real, the merest shadow of relationship, a cousin,
who could count how often removed? And it was he who had insisted, forced upon Elinor the necessity
of making his father known to Philip, of informing him of his real position. Nobody had interfered
in this respect but John. He had made himself a weariness to her by insisting, never giving
over, blaming her hourly for her delay. And yet now, when the thing he had so worked for, so
constantly urged, was done----!

He smiled grimly to himself as he walked away: they were all together, the lordship and the
ladyship, young Lord Lomond too!--and Phil Compton, whitewashed, a peer of the realm, and still,
the scoundrel! a handsome fellow enough: with an air about him, a man who might still dazzle
a youngster unaccustomed to the world. He had re-entered the bosom of his family, and doubtless
was weeping upon Philip's neck, and bandying about that name of "Nell" which had always seemed
to John an insult--an insult to himself. And in that moment of bitterness John did not know
how she would take it, what effect it would produce upon her. Perhaps the very sight of the
fellow who had once won her heart, the lover of her youth, with whom John had never for a moment
put himself in competition, notwithstanding the bitter wonder in his heart that Elinor--Elinor
of all people!--could ever have loved such a man. Yet she had loved him, and the sight of him
again after so many years, what effect might it not produce? As he walked away, it was the
idea of a happy family that came into John Tatham's mind--mutual forgiveness, mutual return
to the old traditions which are the most endearing of all; expansions, confessions, recollections,
and lives of reunion. Something more than a prodigal's return, the return of a sinner bringing
a coronet in his hand, bringing distinction, a place and position enough to dazzle any boy,
enough to make a woman forgive. And was not this what John wished above all things, every advancement
for the boy, and an assured place in the world, as well as every happiness that might be possible--happiness!
yet it was possible she might think it so--for Elinor? Yes, this was what he had wished for,
been ready to make any sacrifice to secure. In the sudden shock Mr. Tatham thought of the only
other person who perhaps--yet only perhaps--might feel a little as he did--the mother, Mrs.
Dennistoun, upon whom he thought all this would come like a thunder-clap, not knowing that
she was up-stairs in the family party, among the lordships and the ladyship too.

He went home and into his handsome library, and shut the door upon himself, to have it out
there--or rather to occupy himself in some more sensible way and shut this foolish subject
out of his mind. It occurred to him, however, when he sat down that the best thing to do would
be to write an account of it all to Mrs. Dennistoun, who doubtless in the excitement would
have a long time to wait for news of this great change. He drew his blotting-book towards him
with this object, and opened it, and dipped his pen in the ink, and wrote "My dear Aunt;" but
he did not get much further. He raised his head, thinking how to introduce his narrative, for
which she would in all likelihood be wholly unprepared, and in so doing looked round upon his
book-cases, on one shelf of which the reflection of a ray of afternoon sunshine caught in the
old Louis Treize mirror over the mantelpiece was throwing a shaft of light. He got up to make
sure that it was only a reflection, nothing that would harm the binding of a particular volume
upon which he set great store--though of course he knew very well that it could only be a reflection,
no impertinent reality of sunshine being permitted to penetrate there. And then he paused a
little to draw his hand lovingly over the line of choice books--very choice--worth a little
fortune, which he laughed at himself a little for being proud of, fully knowing that what was
inside them (which generally is the cream of a book, as of a letter, according to Tony Lumpkin)
was in many cases worth nothing at all. And then John went and stood upon the hearth-rug, and
looked round him upon this the heart of his domain. It was a noble library, any man might have
been proud of it. He asked himself whether it did not suit him better, with all the comforts
and luxuries beyond it, than if he had been like other men, with an entirely different centre
of life up-stairs in the empty drawing-room, and the burden upon him of setting out children,
boys and girls, upon the world.

When a man asks himself this question, however complacent may be the reply, it betrays perhaps
a doubt whether the assurance he has is so very sure after all; and he returned to his letter
to Mrs. Dennistoun, which would be quite easy to write if it were only once well begun. But
he had not written above a few words, having spent some time in his previous reflections, when
he paused again at the sound of a tumultuous summons at the street-door. As may be well supposed,
his servant took more time than usual to answer it, resenting a noise so out of character with
the house, during which John listened half-angrily, fearing, yet wishing for, a diversion.
And then his own door burst open, not, I need not say, by any intervention of legitimate hands,
but by the sudden rush of Philip, who seemed to come in in a whirl of long limbs and eager
eyes, flinging himself into a chair and fixing his gaze across the corner of the table upon
his astonished yet expectant friend. "Oh, Uncle John!" the boy cried, and had not breath to
say any more.

John put forth his hand across the table, and grasped the young flexible warm hand that wanted
something to hold. "Well, my boy," he said.

"I suppose you know," said Philip. "I have nothing to tell you, though it is all so strange to me."

"I know--nothing about what interests me most at present--yourself, Pippo, and what has happened
to you."

John had always made a great stand against that particular name, but several times had used
it of late, not knowing why.

"I don't know what you thought of me last night," said the boy, "I was so miserable. May I
tell you everything, Uncle John?"

What balm that question was! He clasped Pippo's hand in his own, but scarcely could answer
to bid him go on.

"It was unnecessary, all she wanted to tell me. I fought it off all the morning. I was there
yesterday in the court and heard it all."

"In the court! At the trial?"

"I had no meaning in it," said Philip. "I went by chance, as people say, because the Marshalls
had not turned up. I got Simmons to get me into the court. I had always wanted to see a trial.
And there I saw my mother stand up--my mother, that I never could bear the wind to blow on,
standing up there alone with all these people staring at her to be tried--for her life."

"Don't be a fool, Philip," said John Tatham, dropping his hand; "tried! she was only a witness.
And she was not alone. I was there to take care of her."

"I saw you--but what was that? She was alone all the same; and for me, it was she who was on
her trial. What did I know about any other? I heard it, every word."

"Poor boy!"

"So what was the use of making herself miserable to tell me? She tried to all this morning,
and I fought it off. I was miserable enough. Why should I be made more miserable to hear her
perhaps excusing herself to me? But at last she had driven me into a corner, angry as I was--Uncle
John, I was angry, furious, with my mother--fancy! with my mother."

John did not say anything, but he nodded his head in assent. How well he understood it all!

"And just then, at that moment, he came. I am angry with her no more. I know whatever happened
she was right. Angry with her, my poor dear, dearest mother! Whatever happened she was right.
It was best that she should not tell me. I am on her side all through--all through! Do you
hear me, Uncle John! I have seen you look as if you blamed her. Don't again while I am there.
Whatever she has done it has been the right thing all through!"

"Pippo," said John, with a little quivering about the mouth, "give me your hand again, old
fellow, you're my own boy."

"Nobody shall so much as look as if they blamed her," cried the boy, "while I am alive!"

Oh, how near he was to crying, and how resolute not to break down, though something got into
his throat and almost choked him, and his eyes were so full that it was a miracle they did
not brim over. Excitement, distress, pain, the first touch of human misery he had ever known
almost overmastered Philip. He got up and walked about the room, and talked and talked. He
who had never concealed anything, who had never had anything to conceal. And for four-and-twenty
hours he had been silent with a great secret upon his soul. John was too wise to check the
outpouring. He listened to everything, assented, soothed, imperceptibly led him to gentler
thoughts.

"And what does he mean," cried the boy at last, "with his new name? I shall have no name but
my own, the one my mother gave me. I am Philip Compton, and nothing else. What right has he,
the first time he ever saw me, to put upon me another name?"

"What name?"

"He called me Lomond--or something like that," said young Philip: and then there came a sort
of stillness over his excitement, a lull in the storm. Some vague idea what it meant came all
at once into the boy's mind: and a thrill of curiosity, of another kind of excitement, of rising
thoughts which he did not hardly understand, struggled up through the other zone of passion.
He was half ashamed, having just poured forth all his feelings, to show that there was something
else, something that was no longer indignation, nor anger, nor the shock of discovery, something
that had a tremor perhaps of pleasure in it, behind. But John was far too experienced a man
not to read the boy through and through. He liked him better in the first phase, but this was
natural too.

"It happens very strangely," he said, "that all these things should come upon you at once:
but it is well you should know now all about it. Lomond is the second title of the Comptons,
Earls of St. Serf. Haven't I heard you ask what Comptons you belonged to, Philip? It has all
happened within a day or two. Your father was only Philip Compton yesterday at the trial, and
a poor man. Now he is Lord St. Serf, if not rich, at least no longer poor. Everything has changed
for you--your position, your importance in the world. The last Lord Lomond bore the name creditably
enough. I hope you will make it shine." He took the boy by the hand and grasped it heartily
again. "I am thankful for it," said John. "I would rather you were Lord Lomond than----"

"What! Uncle John?"

"Steady, boy. I was going to say Philip Compton's son; but Lord St. Serf is another man."

There was a long pause in the room where John Tatham's life was centred among his books. He
had so much to do with all this business, and yet so little. It would pass away with all its
tumults, and he after being absorbed by it for a moment would be left alone to his own thoughts
and his own unbroken line of existence. So much the better! It is not good for any man to be
swept up and put down again at the will of others in matters in which he has no share. As for
Philip, he was silent chiefly to realise this great thing that had come upon him. He, Lord
Lomond, a peer's son, who was only Pippo of Lakeside like any other lad in the parish, and
not half so important at school as Musgrave, who did not get that scholarship. What the school
would say! the tempest that would arise! They would ask a holiday, and the head master would
grant it. Compton a lord! Philip could hear the roar and rustle among the boys, the scornful
incredulity, the asseverations of those who knew it was true. And a flush that was pleasure
had come over his musing face. It would have been strange if in the wonder of it there had
not been some pleasure too.

He had begun to tolerate his father before many days were over, to cease to be indignant and
angry that he was not the ideal father of his dreams. That was not Lord St. Serf's fault, who
was not at all aware of his son's dreams, and had never had an ideal in his life. But John
Tatham was right in saying that Lord St. Serf was another man. The shock of a new responsibility,
of a position to occupy and duties to fulfil, were things that might not have much moved the
dis-Honourable Phil two years before. But he was fifty, and beginning to feel himself an old
fogey, as he confessed. And his son overawed Lord St. Serf. His son, who was so like him, yet
had the mother's quick, impetuous eyes, so rapid to see through everything, so disdainful of
folly, so keen in perception. He was afraid to bring upon himself one of those lightning flashes
from the eyes of his boy, and doubly afraid to introduce his son anywhere, to show him anything
that might bring upon him the reproach of doing harm to Pippo. His house, which had been very
decent and orderly in the late Lord St. Serf's time, became almost prim in the terror Phil
had lest they should say that it was bad for the boy.

As for Lady St. Serf, it was popularly reported that the reason why she almost invariably lived
in the country was her health, which kept her out of society--a report, I need not say, absolutely
rejected by society itself, which knew all the circumstances better than you or I do: but which
sufficed for the outsiders who knew nothing. When Elinor did appear upon great occasions, which
she consented to do, her matured beauty gave the fullest contradiction to the pretext on which
she continued to live her own life. But old Lord St. Serf, who got old so long before he need
to have done, with perhaps the same sort of constitutional weakness which had carried off all
his brothers before their time, or perhaps because he had too much abused a constitution which
was not weak--grew more and more fond in his latter days of the country too, and kept appearing
at Lakeside so often that at last the ladies removed much nearer town, to the country-house
of the St. Serfs, which had not been occupied for ages, where they presented at last the appearance
of a united family; and where "Lomond" (who would have thought it very strange now to be addressed
by any other name) brought his friends, and was not ill-pleased to hear his father discourse,
in a way which sometimes still offended the home-bred Pippo, but which the other young men
found very amusing. It was not in the way of morals, however, that Lord St. Serf ever offended.
The fear of Elinor kept him as blameless as any good-natured preacher of the endless theme,
that all is vanity, could do.

These family arrangements, however, and the modified happiness obtained by their means, were
still all in the future, when John Tatham, a little afraid of the encounter, yet anxious to
have it over, went to Ebury Street the day after these occurrences, to see Elinor for the first
time under her new character as Lady St. Serf. He found her in a languor and exhaustion much
unlike Elinor, doing nothing, not even a book near, lying back in her chair, fallen upon herself,
as the French say. Some of those words that mean nothing passed between them, and then she
said, "John, did Pippo tell you that he had been there?" 

The Library also played its part in the establishment of the Country
and later the National Library Services.

In 1935 Dr Scholefield travelled overseas at the invitation of the
Carnegie Corporation of New York and on his return made a report on
rural library services, which turned further attention to this matter.

A group of New Zealand librarians interested the Carnegie Corporation
of New York in the proposal to organise a demonstration scheme in
Taranaki and asked Mr G. T. Alley to prepare plans.

In 1937, however, £3,000 was placed on the Estimates for the Country
Library Service and Mr Alley was appointed Director later in the year.

For some time the Service was also located in Parliament Buildings.
 "When you tell a fact--that is true:
with the intention to deceive: John, you that know the laws of evidence, is that a lie?"
