After the wedding of Prince Juan in March 1497, when Queen Isabella had more time to give to
external affairs, the promise to Columbus was again remembered, and his position was considered
in detail.  An order was made (April 23rd, 1497), restoring to the Admiral the original privileges
bestowed upon him at Santa Fe.  He was offered a large tract of land in Espanola, with the
title of Duke; but much as he hankered after titular honours, he was for once prudent enough
to refuse this gift. 

Without a doubt, the presence of the older people brought back the memories the girl had of other
older people who had been long lost.

The shaking Baucis gave an explanation. Two days by train, they had fled with all they could carry.
His last meal was in the afternoon of the day before; however, this does not worry them, the old
eat less. What frightens them is the fatigue. They arrived at ten
o'clock, not a single carriage, not a single man in the station would
carry their packages. All are in the war. Instead, he accepted
a measure of relief from the obligations incurred by his eighth share in the many unprofitable
expeditions that had been sent out during the last three years, agreeing for the next three
years to receive an eighth share of the gross income, and a tenth of the net profits, without
contributing anything to the cost.  His appointment of Bartholomew to the office of Adelantado,
which had annoyed Ferdinand, was now confirmed; the universal license which had been granted
to Spanish subjects to settle in the new lands was revoked in so far as it infringed the Admiral's
privileges; and he was granted a force of 330 officers, soldiers, and artificers to be at his
personal disposal in the prosecution of his next voyage.

The death of Prince Juan in October 1497 once more distracted the attention of the Court from
all but personal matters; and Columbus employed the time of waiting in drafting a testamentary
document in which he was permitted to create an entail on his title and estates in favour of
his two sons and their heirs for ever.  This did not represent his complete or final testament,
for he added codicils at various times, the latest being executed the day before his death.
The document is worth studying; it reveals something of the laborious, painstaking mind reaching
out down the rivers and streams of the future that were to flow from the fountain of his own
greatness; it reveals also his triple conception of the obligations of human life in this world--the
cultivation and retention of temporal dignity, the performance of pious and charitable acts,
and the recognition of duty to one's family. "They are going to consume all my figs and my peaches!" Cried lifting
his arms. For it would have been better a cyclone in the application flower bed the gay soldiers.
But as a man of tact, but he pledged a bit, eventually silenced.

The Lord had currently reached. His whiskers was shiny and his head was glowing like a triangle
motif throwing lightning just as the sun. Miguel came back with an embedded reinforcement prized pebbles
forming exclusive patterns.

Brought up the back all ministers and older fantastic court officials.

fortunes had been wrecked on the enterprise, which had so far brought nothing to Spain but
the promise of luxurious adventure that was not fulfilled and of a wealth and glory that had
not been realised.  It must have been a very humiliating circumstance to Columbus that in the
preparations which he was now (February 1498) making for the equipment of his new expedition
a great difficulty was found in procuring ships and men.  Not even before the first voyage
had so much reluctance been shown to risk life and property in the enterprise.
