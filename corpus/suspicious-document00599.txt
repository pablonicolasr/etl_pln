This is a very crude and brief way of putting many pages of teaching, but the important point
is that this line between the layas is one of solar energy, with a dynamic "field" of solar
energy, elliptical in shape, connecting with the reverse fields at the laya points.  These
"dead points" are the limits of each electric field, which "create", we say in electrical work,
opposing fields beyond them.

Each one of these planets has its laya centre inside the sun's photosphere.  Each planet has
a line of solar energy with its "field" of solar energy--not only a wireless telegraph, but
a wireless lighting, heating, and life-giving system.  These six solar laya points are the
six "hidden planets," the earth and moon being one, of the ancient metaphysics.  The moon is
the one "laid aside."  In their reception of energy from the sun, it is as if the planet were
at the solar laya point, or connected with it by a special pipe-line. Wanka thought it was a former barracks, which
is now the demolition was abandoned, and occurred because the court concluded no further appeared,
one by one of the yawning gates. The farms were with Thürrahmen and doors, boards and filled all
sorts of old rubbish, and these things looked quite incredibly sad in the dull, slow fading
light of late afternoon. The student turned determined from time, from any feeling that he
climbed the worn wooden stairs and went long white corridors and down along with many whitewashed
rooms, whose low ceilings, which Floorboards were torn up in part. And then he walked ascended
the stairs and stood still again in a course leading to a final wall was torn down already halfway
to the wind hereinkonnte broad; from gray day.

That the planets themselves affected any one or anything on this earth, no real astrologer
ever believed;  that their position in the heavens indicated certain changes and modifications
of the flow of solar energy to the earth, they knew from their knowledge of physics.  "The
twelve houses are in the sun," says Hermes, "six in the north and six in the south."  Connect
them with the zodiac, and the position of the planets shows the interferences of the solar
currents.

The one objection to this ancient theory is that it does not present enough difficulties. 
The present value to science of the many theories in relation to the sun is the impossibility
of reconciling any two of them, and the fact that no two theorists can unite to pummel a third.
This ancient theory does not call for any great amount of heat, light, or energy in any condition
to keep the Cosmos in order--not even enough for two persons to quarrel over. He was thirsty, no doubt about it, but if the men turned back,
he knew that they would all discover the same tone of the other long Things, speaking of art
and the like. He saw that, to a man, their enthusiasm was nothing but violence, and they had
nothing in common but their imagination. Then, she took it back from them. He stopped again in the
evenings at home, zealously devoting himself to his studies at the university, and after a
while, everything was the same as before.  That it will be "verified" in time, even as the first stumbling-block
has been removed at the end of the nineteenth century, its students may at least hope.

The lesson, if there is one, is that the Western student of Eastern physics does not ride an
auto along asphalted roads. He must own himself and not be owned by another man, or even by
"Modern Science."
