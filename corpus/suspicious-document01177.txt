Besides the unrelieved hardness of daily life--the need, which never lifts from them, of making
shift and doing all things for themselves--there has always been another influence at work
upon my neighbours, leaving its indelible mark on them. Almost from infancy onwards, in a most
personal and intimate way, they are familiar with harrowing experiences of calamity such as
people who employ them are largely able to escape. The little children are not exempt. There
being no nursemaids to take care of the children while fathers and mothers are busy, the tiniest
are often entrusted to the perilous charge of others not quite so tiny, and occasionally they
come to grief. Then too often the older children, who are themselves more secure for a few
years, are eyewitnesses of occurrences such as more fortunate boys and girls are hardly allowed
even to hear of. Nor is it only with the gory or horrible disaster that the people thus become
too early acquainted. The nauseating details of sickness are better known and more openly discussed
in the cottage than in comfortable middle-class homes. For it is all such a crowded business--that
of living in these cramped dwellings. Besides, the injured and the sick, absorbed in the interest
of their ailments, are amiably willing to give others an opportunity of sharing it. The disorder
or the disablement is thus almost a family possession. An elderly man, who had offered to show
me a terrible ulcer on his leg, smiled at my squeamishness, as if he pitied me, when I declined
the privilege. "Why, the little un," he said, pointing to a four-year-old girl on the floor,
"the little un rolls the bandage for me every evening, because I dresses'n here before the
fire." That is the way in the labourer's cottage. Even where privacy is attempted for the sufferer's
sake there is no refuge for the family from the evidence of suffering. The young people in
one room may hardly avoid knowing and hearing where a man is dying, or a woman giving birth
to a child, just the other side of a latched deal door.

In this connection it should be remembered how much more than their share of the afflictions
of the community falls to the labouring people. The men's work naturally takes them where accidents
happen, where disease is contracted. And then, from ignorance or the want of conveniences,
from the need to continue wage-earning as long as endurance will hold out, and also from the
sheer carelessness which is a part of their necessary habit, both the men and the women not
seldom allow themselves to fall into sickness which a little self-indulgence, if only they
dared yield to it, would enable them to avoid. I should not know how to begin counting the
numbers I have personally known enfeebled for life in this way. Things are better now than
they were twenty years ago; there are many more opportunities than there used to be of obtaining
rest or nursing, but still the evil is widespread. Without going out of my way at all, during
the last fortnight I have heard of--have almost stumbled across--three cases of the sort. The
first was that of a woman who had been taking in washing during her husband's long illness.
Meeting the man, who was beginning to creep about again, I happened to ask how his wife was;
and he said that she was just able to keep going, but hardly knew how to stand because of varicose
veins in both legs. The second case, too, was a woman's. She met me on the road, and on the
off chance asked if I could give her a letter of admission to the County Hospital, and so save
her the pain of going down to the Vicarage to beg for a letter there. What was the matter?
"I give birth to twins five months ago," she said, "and since then dropsy have set in. I gets
heavier every day. The doctor wants me to go to the hospital, and I was goin' to the Vicar
to ask for a letter, but I dreads comin' back up that hill." As it was she had already walked
half a mile. In the third case a man's indifference to his own suffering was to blame for the
plight in which he found himself. Driving a van, he had barked his shin against the iron step
on the front of the van. Just as the skin had begun to heal over he knocked it again, severely,
in exactly the same way, and he described to me the immense size of the aggravated wound. But,
as he said, he had supposed it would get well, and, beyond tying his leg up with a rag, he
took no further trouble about it, until it grew so bad that he was obliged to see a doctor.
His account of the interview went in this way: "'How long since you done this?' the doctor
says. 'A month,' I says. 'Then you must be a damn fool not to 'ave come to me afore,' the doctor
says." The man, indeed, looked just as likely as not to be laid up for six months, if not permanently
crippled, as a result of his carelessness.

Yet, common as such cases are now, they were commoner when I first knew the village--when there
was no cottage hospital, no proper accommodation at the workhouse infirmary, no parish nurse,
and when the parish contained few people of means to help those who were in distress. I remember
once looking round in that early period, and noting how there was hardly a cottage to be seen
which had not, to my own knowledge, been recently visited by trouble of some sort or another.
True, the troubles were not all of them of a kind that could be avoided by any precaution,
for some of them arose from the death of old people. Yet in a little cottage held on a weekly
tenancy death often involves the survivors of the family in more disturbance, more privation
too, than it does elsewhere. Putting these cases aside, however, I could still see where, within
two hundred yards of me, there had been four other deaths--one being that of an infant, and
one that of a woman in child-birth. In the other two cases the victims were strong men--one,
a railway worker, who was killed on the line; the other a carter, who died of injuries received
in an accident with his horse. The list of lesser misfortunes included the illness of a man
who broke down while at work, with hæmorrhage of the stomach, and the bad case of a bricklayer's
labourer, who lay for days raving from the effects of a sunstroke. In pre-Christian times it
might have been argued that the gods were offended with the people, so thickly did disasters
fall upon them, but my neighbours seemed unaware of anything abnormal in the circumstances.
By lifelong experience they had learned to take calamity almost as a matter of course.

For, as I said, the experience begins early. The children, the young girls, have their share
of it. During those earlier years I am recalling, a little girl of the village, who was just
beginning domestic service in my household, was, within the space of six months, personally
concerned in two accidents to little children. She came from one of half-a-dozen families whose
cottages, for a wonder in this village, stood in a row; and amongst scraps of her talk which
were repeated to me I heard how her little brother--only five years old, but strong at throwing
stones--threw at a girl playmate and knocked out one of her eyes. That happened in the springtime.
In the autumn of the same year a mishap, if possible more shocking at the moment, befell another
child in that row of cottages. A man there one evening was trimming a low hedge. His tool was
a fag-hook--well sharpened, for he was one of the ablest men in the village. And near by where
he worked his children were at play, the youngest of them being between three and four years old.

As he reached over the hedge, to chop downwards at the farther side, this little one suddenly
came running dangerously near. "Take care, ducky!" he cried. "Don't come so close, 'r else
perhaps father'll cut ye."

He gave three more strokes, and again the child ran in. The hook fell, right across the neck.
I had these particulars from a neighbour. "If 't had bin another half inch round, the doctor
said, 'twould have bin instant death.... The man was covered with blood, and all the ground,
too. I was at work when I heared of it, but I couldn't go on after that, it upset me so....
And all this mornin' I can't get it out o' my mind. There's a shiver all up that row. They
be all talkin' of it. The poor little thing en't dead this mornin', and that's all's you can
say. They bin up all night. Ne'er a one of 'em didn't go to bed."

So far the neighbour. Later the little maidservant, who had gone home that evening, told me:
"We was passin' by at the time--me and my older sister.... She run in and wrapped a towel round
its neck."

"Where, then, was the mother?"

"She was with its father. He'd fainted. So we went in. We thought p'raps we could run for the
doctor. But she went herself, jest as she was," carrying the child down to the town.

As for the girl's sister, who had behaved with some aplomb, "It made her feel rather bad afterwards.
She felt sick. All the floor was covered with blood." The little maidservant had a curious
look, half horror, half importance, as she said this. She herself was not more than fifteen
at the time.

But sickness is commoner by far than accident, and owing to the necessity the cottagers are
under of doing everything for themselves they often get into dire straits. Of some of the things
that go on one cannot hear with equanimity. The people are English; bone of our bone. But we
shut our eyes. I have heard of well-to-do folk in the parish who, giving of their abundance
to foreign missions, deny that there is distress here at home. The most charitable explanation
of that falsehood is to suppose that across their secluded gardens and into their luxurious
rooms, or even to their back-doors, an average English cottager is too proud to go. Yet it
is hard to understand how all signs of what is so constantly happening can be shut out. For
myself, I have never gone out of my way to look for what I see. I have never invited confidences.
The facts that come to my knowledge seem to be merely the commonplaces of the village life.
If examples of the people's troubles were wanted, they could be provided almost endlessly,
and in almost endless diversity. But there is one feature that never varies. Year after year
it is still the same tale; all the extra toil, all the discomfort, or horror, or difficulty,
of dealing with sickness falls immediately on the persons of the family where the sickness
occurs; and it sets its cruel mark upon them, so that the signs can be seen as one goes about,
in the faces of people one does not know. And the women suffer most.

One winter evening a woman came to my door to see if she could borrow a bed-rest. Her sister,
she said, had been ill with pleurisy and bronchitis for a week or more, and for the last two
days had been spitting a great deal of blood. The woman looked very poor; she might have been
judged needlessly shabby. A needle and thread would so soon have remedied sundry defects in
her jacket, which was gaping open at the seams. But her face suggested that there were excuses
for her.

I have never forgotten her face, as it showed that evening, although I have since seen it looking
happier. It was dull of colour--the face of an overworked and over-burdened soul; and it had
a sullen expression of helplessness and resentment. The eyes were weary and pale--I fancied
that trouble had faded the colour out of them. But with all this I got an impression of something
dogged and unbeaten in the woman's temper. She went away with the bed-rest, apologizing for
coming to borrow it. "'Tis so bad"--those were her words--"'tis so bad to see 'em layin' there
like that, sufferin' so much pain."

I had never seen her before--for it was years ago; and, knowing no better then, I supposed
her to be between forty and fifty years old. In reality, she can hardly have been thirty. It
was the stress of personal service that had marred her so young. Did her jacket need mending?
As I have since learnt, at that period the youngest of her family was unborn, and the oldest
cannot have been more than eight or nine. Besides nursing her sister, therefore, she had several
children to wait upon, as well as her husband--a man often ailing in health. For all I know
she was even then, as certainly she has been since, obliged to go out working for money, so
as to keep the family going; and, seeing that she was a mother, it is probable that she herself
had already known the extremity of hardship.

Because, as scarcely needs saying, the principle of self-help is strained to the uttermost
at time of child-birth. Then, the other members of the family have to shift for themselves
as best they can, with what little aid neighbours can find time to give; and where there are
young children in the cottage, it is much if they are sufficiently fed and washed. But it is
the situation of the mother herself that most needs to be considered. Let me give an illustration
of how she fares.

Several years ago there was a birth in a cottage very near to me. Only a few hours before it
happened the woman had walked into the town to do her shopping for herself and carry home her
purchases. As soon as the birth was known, a younger sister, out at service, got a week's holiday,
so that she might be at hand to help, though there was no spare room in the cottage where she
could sleep. During that week, also, the parish nurse came in daily, until more urgent cases
occupied all her time. After that the young mother was left to her own resources. According
to someone I know, who looked in from time to time, she lay in bed with her new-born baby,
utterly alone in the cottage, her husband being away at work all day for twelve hours, while
the elder children were at school. She made no complaint, however, of being lonely; she thought
the solitude good for her. But she was worried by thinking of the fire in the next room--the
living-room, which had the only fireplace in the house, there being none in her bedroom--lest
it should set fire to the cottage while she lay helpless. It seems that the hearth was so narrow
and the grate so high that coals were a little apt to fall out on to the floor. Once, she said,
there had almost been "a flare-up." It was when she was still getting about, and she had gone
no farther away than into her garden to feed the fowls; but in that interval a coal fell beyond
the fender, and she, returning, found the place full of smoke and the old hearthrug afire.
The dread that this might happen again distressed her now as she lay alone, unable to move.

I could furnish more pitiful tales than this, if need were--tales of women in child-bed tormented
with anxiety because their husbands are out of work, and there is no money in the cottage,
and no prospect of any; or harassed by the distress of little children who miss the help which
the mother cannot give, and so on. But this case illustrates the normal situation. Here there
was no actual destitution, nor any fear of it, and the other children were being cared for.
The husband was earning a pound a week at constant work, and the circumstances of the family
were on the whole quite prosperous. But one of the conditions of prosperity was that the father
of the family should be away all day, leaving the mother and infant unattended.

From whatever sickness the woman suffers, there is always the same piteous story to be told--she
is destitute of help. The household drudge herself, she has no drudges to wait upon her. The
other day I was told of a woman suffering from pleurisy. Her husband had left home at six o'clock
for his work; a neighbour-woman came in to put on a poultice and make things comfortable; then
she, too, had to go to her work. In the afternoon a visitor, looking in by chance, found that
the sick woman had been alone for five hours; she was parched with thirst, and her poultice
had gone cold. For yet one more example. I mentioned just now a man who was killed on the railway.
His widow, quite a young woman then, reared her three or four children, earning some eight
or nine shillings a week at charing or washing for people in the town; and still she keeps
herself, pluckily industrious. There is one son living with her--an errand-boy--and there are
two daughters both in service at a large new house in the village. During last spring the woman
had influenza, and had to take to her bed, her girls being permitted to take turns in coming
home to care for her. Just as she, fortunately, began to recover, this permission was withdrawn:
both girls were wanted in "their place," because a young lady there had taken influenza. So
they had to forsake their mother. But by-and-by one of these girls took the infection. Her
"place," then, was thought to be--at home. She was sent back promptly to her mother, and it
was not long before the mother herself broke down again, not being yet strong enough to do
sick-nursing in addition to her daily work.

It must be borne in mind that these acute and definite troubles spring up from the surface
of an ill-defined but chronic anxiety, from which very few of the cottagers are free for any
length of time. For though there is not much extreme destitution, a large number of the villagers
live always on the brink of it; they have the fear of it always in sight. In a later chapter
I shall give some particulars as to their ways and means; in this, I only wish it to be remembered
that the question of ways and means is a life-and-death one for the labourer and his wife,
and leaves them little peace and little hope of it. During the trade depression which culminated
in 1908-09 I was frequently made aware of the disquiet of their minds by the scraps of talk
which reached me as I passed along the road, and were not meant for my hearing. From women
who were comparing notes with one another, this was the sort of thing one would hear: "'En't
had nothin' to do this six weeks; and don't sim no likelihoods of it." "I s'pose we shall get
through, somehow." "I'm sure I dunno what 'tis a-comin' to." "'Tis bad 'nough now, in the summer;
what it'll be like in the winter, Gawd only knows." Again and again I heard talk like this.

And all this was only an accentuation or a slight increase in volume of a note of apprehension
which in better times still runs less audibly as a kind of undertone to the people's thought.
I had stopped one day to say good-morning to an old widow-woman outside her cottage. She was
the mother of that young man whose funeral was mentioned two chapters back; but this was before
his death, and while, in fact, he was still doing a little occasional work. She spoke cheerfully,
smiled even, until some chance word of mine (I have forgotten what it was) went through the
armour of her fortitude, and she began to cry. Then she told me of the position she was in,
and the hopelessness of it, and her determination to hold out. Some charitable lady had called
upon her. "Mrs. Curtis," the lady had said, "if ever you are ill, I hope you'll be sure and
send to me." And Mrs. Curtis had replied: "Well, ma'am, if ever I sends, you may be sure I
am ill." "But," she added, "they don't understand. 'Tis when you're on yer feet that help's
wanted--not wait till 'tis too late." With regard to her present circumstances--she "didn't
mind saying it to me--sometimes she didn't hardly know how they was goin' on," for she hadn't
a penny except what her son could earn. And "people seemed to think it didn't matter for a
single chap to be out o' work. They didn't think he might have a mother to keep, or, if he
was in lodgin's, he couldn't live there for nothin'.... Sometimes we seems to be gettin' on
a little, and then you has bad luck, and there you are again where you was before. It's like
gettin' part way up a hill and fallin' down to the bottom again, and you got it all to begin
over again."

I said something--some platitude--turning to go away. Then she managed to smile--a shining-eyed
smile--saying: "Well, 'tis only for life. If 'twas for longer than that I don't know if we
should hardly be able to bear it."

This was but one old woman. Yet, if you have an ear for a folk-saying, you will recognize one
there in that "only for life" of hers. Be sure that a by-word so compact as that was not one
old woman's invention. To acquire such brevity and smoothness, it must have been wandering
about the parish for years; and when it reached me at last it had been polished by the despair
of hundreds of other people, as a coin is polished by passing through hundreds of hands.

V

DRINK

It will be understood, from what was said on the subject in the first chapter, that the village
population has its rough element, and that drunkenness, or at any rate excessive drinking,
is very common. It is true that there are very few habitual drunkards in the parish--there
are not even many men, perhaps, who frequently take too much; but, on the other hand, the majority
are beer-drinkers, and every now and then one or another of them, normally sober, oversteps
the limit. Thus, possibly every other family has had its passing experience of what drunkenness
means in the temporary lapse of father, or son, or brother. A rainy Bank Holiday invariably
leads to much mischief in this way, and so does a sudden coming of hot weather in the summer.
The men have too much to do to spare time for the public-house in the ordinary weekdays, but
on Saturday and Sunday nights, when the strain is relaxed, they are apt to give way too far.

The evils of drunkenness, however, are well enough known, and I do not propose to dwell on
that side of the matter. But there is another aspect of it which must be considered, if only
because it is so thoroughly characteristic of the old village outlook. Incidentally, this other
aspect may be worth a little attention from temperance reformers.

For the truth is that the average villager's attitude towards drink and temperance is not that
of an unrepentant or rebellious sinner; rather, it is the attitude of a man who has sound reasons
for adhering to his own point of view. If he grows restive under the admonitions of the pharisaical,
if he meets them defiantly, or if he merely laughs, as often as not it is because he feels
that his mentors do not understand the situation so well as he does. How should they, who see
it wholly from the outside--they who never go near the public-house; they who have no experience
either of poverty or of hard work--how should they, who speak from prejudice, be entitled to
dictate to him, who has knowledge? He resents the interference, considers it insulting, and
goes his own way, supported by a village opinion which is entirely on his side, and certainly
has its claims to respect. It is this village opinion which I wish to examine now.

In the eyes of the older villagers or of the more old-fashioned ones mere occasional drunkenness
is a very venial fault. The people make a distinction between the habitual drunkard and him
who occasionally drinks too much, and they are without compassion for the former. He is a "low
blackguard"; they look reproachfully if you talk of trying to help him by giving him a job
of work, or at any rate they pity your wasted efforts. But for the occasional defaulter they
have a friendly feeling, unless, of course, he turns savage in his cups. As long as he is cheerful
he is rather a figure of fun to them than anything, or he is an object of wondering interest.
On a certain August Bank Holiday I saw one of our villagers staggering up the hill--a middle-aged
man, far gone in drink, so that all the road was none too wide for him. Other wayfarers accompanied
and observed him with a philosophically detached air, and between whiles a woman grabbed at
his coat between the shoulders, trying to steady him. But by and by, lurching free, he wobbled
across the road to within an inch of a perambulator with two children which another man was
pushing. The drunken man leant over it, poised like an impending fate, and so hung for a few
seconds before he staggered away, and it might be supposed that at least the man with the perambulator
would be indignant. But not he. He merely remarked wonderingly: "You wouldn't ha' thought it
possible he could ha' done it, would ye?" The other wayfarers laughed lightly, amongst them
a young married woman with a refined face.

While the comic side of a man in drink makes its strong appeal to the village folk, they are
ready to see excuses for him, too. Anybody, they argue, is liable to be overtaken before he
knows, and where is the great disgrace in an accident that may befall themselves, or me, or
you? There is at least no superiority in their outlook, no pharisaism. Listen, for proof of
it, to a talk of Bettesworth's about a neighbour who had been working with the "ballast-train"
on the railway all night. "You," he began--and this first word showed how innocent he was of
shame in his own attitude, since he supposed that I must share his amusement--"you'd ha' laughed
if you'd ha' sin Isaac yest'day. He was got fair boozed; an' comin' up the gully, thinkin'
he was goin' straight for 'ome, he run his head right into they bushes down by ol' Dame Smith's.
Then he got up the slope about a dozen yards, an' begun to go back'ards 'till he come to Dame
Smith's wall, and that turn'd 'n, and he begun to go back'ards again down the gully. I did
laugh. He bin at work all night on the ballast-train, an' come back reg'lar fagged out, an'
hadn't had no vittles--an' a feller wants something--and then the fust glass he has do's for
'n. He bin workin' every night for a week, an' Sundays, too. And Alice" ("Alice" is Isaac's
wife) "is away hop-tyin' all day, so, of course, Isaac didn't care 'bout goin' 'ome to lop
about there by hisself.... I've seed a many go like that. They works all night, an' gets reg'lar
fagged out, an' then the fust drop does 'em. When Alice come 'ome, she looked at least to find
the kettle boilin'. 'Stead o' that, she couldn't git in. At least, she had to fetch the key
from where she put 'n when she went away in the mornin'. I laughed at her when I went down
'ome. 'Where is he now?' I says. 'Ah, you may laugh,' she says, 'but I got to rouse 'n up about
ten o'clock an' git 'n a cup o' tea. He got to be at work again at eleven.' That's how they
do's. Begins about ten or eleven o'clock, and don't leave off again afore six or seven, or
p'raps nine or ten, next mornin'. Makes days an' quarters for three an' ninepence. I've knowed
a many like that come 'ome an' git boozed fust glass, like old Isaac. I did laugh, though,
and so did Dame Smith when she was a-tellin' of me."

Inheriting from their forefathers such an unimaginative point of view, most of the cottage
folk have been, until quite lately, far from regarding the public-house as a public nuisance.
It had a distinct value in their scheme of living. That fact was demonstrated plainly in an
outburst of popular feeling some years ago. The licensing magistrates of the neighbourhood
had taken the extreme, and at that time unprecedented, course of refusing to renew the licenses
of several houses in the town. But while the example they had thus set was winning them applause
all up and down England, they were the objects, in this and the adjacent villages, of all sorts
of vituperation on account of what the cottagers considered a wanton insult to their class.
It must be admitted that the action of the justices had some appearance of being directed against
the poor. Nobody could deny, for instance, that the houses frequented by middle-class clients,
and responsible for a good deal of middle-class drinking, were all passed over, and that those
singled out for extinction served only the humblest and least influential. My neighbours entertained
no doubts upon the matter. They were not personally concerned--at any rate, the public-houses
in this village were left open for them to go to--but the appearance of favouritism offended
them. They were as sure as if it had been officially proclaimed that the intention was to impose
respectability upon them against their will; their pleasures were to be curtailed to please
fanatics who understood nothing and cared less about the circumstances of cottage folk. So,
during some weeks the angry talk went round the village; it was not difficult to know what
the people were thinking. They picked to pieces the character of the individual magistrates,
planning ineffective revenge. "That old So-and-So" (Chairman of the Urban Council)--"they'd
bin to his shop all their lives, but he'd find he'd took his last shillin' from 'em now! And
that What's-his-Name--the workin' classes had voted for 'n at last County Council election,
and this was how he served 'em! He needn't trouble to put up again, when his turn was up!"
Then they commiserated the suffering publicans. "Look at poor old Mrs. ----, what kept the
house down Which Street--always a most well-conducted house. Nobody couldn't find no fault
with it, and 'twas her livin'! Why should she have her livin' took away like that, poor old
gal?... They sims to think nobody en't right 'xcep' jest theirselves--as if we poor people
could live an' go on same as they do. They can 'ave their drink at 'ome, and their music, but
where be we to go to if they shuts up the 'ouses?" Such were the remarks I heard over and over
again. It seemed to the poor that there were to be no more cakes and ale, because Malvolio
was virtuous, or because their own manners were not refined enough.

In the light of subsequent political events I am prepared to believe that some of this popular
indignation was engineered from the public-houses. But I do not think it required much engineering.
It sounded spontaneous at the time, and considering how the villagers are placed, their resentment
was not unnatural. As I have said, the public-house has its value in their scheme of living.
They have no means of enjoying themselves at home, no room in their cottages for entertaining
friends, and they may well ask what they are to do if the public-houses are closed to them.

One thing, at least, is sure. If the ordinary village inn were nothing but the foul drink-shop
which its enemies allege, if all that it provided was an irresistible temptation to depravity,
the majority of the people who resort to it now would very soon leave it alone. And the same
is true of the little lowly places in the town. In the third chapter I mentioned how the village
women, with their men-folk and their children, too--until the recent Act of Parliament shut
the children out--would make a Saturday-night call at some public-house before going home from
the weekly shopping expedition. But these are the reverse of bad women. They are honest and
self-respecting mothers of families; women obviously innocent of anything approaching intemperance.
I have seen them chatting outside a public-house door, and then smilingly pushing it open and
going in, as happily unconscious of evil as if they were going to a mothers' meeting. They
see no harm in it. They are away from home, they have far to go, and they want refreshment.
But it is perfectly certain that most of them would rather drop than enter such places--for
they are not afraid of fatigue--if there were risk of anything really wrong within. The labouring-class
woman, as already explained, takes no hurt from a frank style of talk. She is not squeamish,
but she has a very strong sense of her own honour; and if you remember how keen is the village
appetite for scandal, you will perceive that there can be no fear of scandal attaching to her
because of a visit to a public-house, or she would not go there. It should be noted, as evidence
of a strict public opinion regulating the custom, that these same women seldom enter the public-houses
in the village, and never any others save on this one occasion. They require the justification
of their weekly outing, when supper is delayed, and the burden of living can be forgotten amongst
friends for an hour. At other times they would consider the indulgence disgraceful; and though
they enjoy it just at these times, I do not remember that I have ever seen one of them showing
the least sign of having carried her enjoyment too far.

The men certainly are governed by no such severe public opinion, but are free to "get a drink"
at any time without being thought the worse of by their neighbours; yet they, too, for the
most part, are of good and sober character enough to prove that the village public-house cannot
be so utterly given up to evil as might be supposed from the horrified talk of refined people.
Not many men in this parish would tolerate a place in which they could do nothing but get drunk.
It is for something else that they go to the Fox or the Happy Home. The drinking is but a pleasant
incident. They despise the fellow who merely goes in to have his unsociable glass and be off
again, as heartily as they dislike the habitual soaker who brings their entertainment into
disfavour; and they themselves keep a rough sort of order--or they increase disorder in trying
to quell it--rather than that the landlord should interfere. That loud harsh talk which one
hears as one passes the public-house of an evening is not what the hyper-sensitive suppose.
It does not betoken drunkenness so much as uncouth manners--the manners of neglected men who
spend their lives at severe physical labour, and want a little relaxation in the evening. So
far as I have seen, the usual conversation in the taproom of a country public-house is a lazy
and innocent interchange of remarks, which wander aimlessly from one subject to another, because
nobody wants to bother his head with thinking; or else it is a vehement discussion, in which
dogmatic assertion does duty for argument and loudness for force. In either case it rests and
stimulates the tired men, while the drink refreshes their throats, and it has no more necessary
impropriety than the drawing-room talk of the well-to-do. In this intercourse men who do not
read the papers get an inkling of the news of the day, those who have no books come into contact
with other minds, opinions are aired, the human craving for fun gets a little exercise; and
for topics of talk, instead of those which occupy moneyed people, who know about the theatre
or the Church, or foreign travel, or golf, or the state of the poor, or the depreciation of
Consols, the labourers have their gardens, and the harvest, and the horses they drive. They
talk about their employers, and their work, and their wages; they dispute about county cricket
or exchange notes about blight, or new buildings, or the latest public sensation; and all this
in endless detail, endlessly interesting to them. So, utterly unaided by arts or any contrivances
for amusement, they make entertainment for themselves. That they must make it in kindly temper,
too, is obvious; for who would take part in it to be usually annoyed? And it may well be conceived
that in an existence so empty of other pleasures, the pleasures to be derived from company
are held precious. The scheme of living would be very desolate without that consolation, would
grow very illiberal and sombre. But the public-houses at least do something to prevent this,
and in clinging to them the villagers have clung to something which they need and cannot get
elsewhere. It is idle to pretend that the "Institute" which was started a few years ago provides
a satisfactory alternative. Controlled by people of another class, whose "respectability" is
irksome, and open only to members and never to women, the Institute does not lend itself to
the easy intercourse which tired men enjoy at the public-house. Its billiard-table is not for
their heavy hands, used to the pick-axe and shovel; its card games interrupt their talk; its
newspapers remind them that they cannot read very well, and suggest a mode of life which they
are unable to share.

These reasons, I believe, prevail to keep the labouring men from patronizing the Institute
more even than does its strictly teetotal policy. Or perhaps I should say, rather, that while
they dislike going without their beer, they object more strongly still to the principle on
which it is forbidden in the Institute. For that principle is nothing more or less than a tacit
arraignment of their own point of view. It imputes evil propensities to them; it directly challenges
the truth of an idea which not only have they never doubted, but which their own experience
seems to them to confirm. The day-labourer really knows nothing to take the place of beer.
A man who has been shovelling in a gravel-pit, or carrying bricks up a ladder, or hoeing in
the fields, or carting coal, for ten hours in the day, and has, perhaps, walked six or seven
miles to do it, acquires a form of thirst which no other drink he can buy will touch so coolly.
Of alternatives, milk fails utterly; "minerals" are worse than unsatisfactory; tea, to serve
the purpose at all, must be taken very hot, and then it produces uncomfortable sweat, besides
involving the expense of a fire for its preparation. There remains cold water. But cold water
in copious draughts has its drawbacks, even if it can be obtained, and that is assuming too
much. In this parish, at any rate, good water was, until quite lately, a scarce commodity,
and nobody cared to drink the stagnant stuff out of the tanks or water-butts which supplied
most of the cottages. In short, prudence itself has seemed to recommend beer as the one drink
for tired men. In their view it is the safest, and the most easily obtained, and, when obtained,
it affords the most refreshment. Thus much their own experience has taught the villagers.

And they have the tradition of long generations to support them in their taste. As far back
as they can remember, the strongest and ablest men, whose virtues they still recall and admire,
renewed their strength with beer daily. Not labourers alone, but farmers and other employers
too, whose health and prosperity were a sufficient justification of their habits, were wont
to begin their morning with a glass of beer, which they took, not as a stimulant, but as a
food; and the belief in it as a food was so convinced that a man denied his beer by doctor's
orders was hardly to be persuaded that he was not being starved of due nourishment. Such was
the esteem in which beer was held twenty years ago, nor has the belief been uprooted yet. Indeed,
an opinion so sanctioned to a man, by the approval of his own father and grandfather and all
the worthies he can remember, does not immediately become false to him just because it is condemned
by strangers who do not know him, and who, with all their temperance, seem to him a delicate
and feeble folk. He prefers his own standard of good and evil, and in sitting down to his glass
he has no doubt that he is following a sensible old fashion, modestly trying to be, not a fine
gentleman, but a sturdy Englishman.

On much the same principle the public-house as a place of resort is justified to the villager.
I have already shown how it serves him for entertainment instead of newspaper, or book, or
theatre; and here, again, he has a long-standing country tradition to support him. In spite
of reformers on the one hand, and on the other hand that tendency of "the trade," which is
spoiling the public-house as a place of comfortable rest by frowning upon customers who stay
too long and drink too little--in spite of these discouragements, the villagers still cannot
believe that what was good enough for their fathers is not good enough for themselves. It might
not be equally good if they wished to be "superior persons," but for the modest needs of people
like themselves they think it should serve. So they go to the public-house just as their fathers
did, content to miss the approval of the cultured, so long as they can do as well as those
worthies. Of course, if they ever analyzed their impressions, they must often go home discerning
that they had been disappointed; that the company had been dull and the comfort small; that
they had got less conviviality than they wanted, and more of the drink that should have been
only its excuse; but as they are never introspective, so the disappointment goes unnoticed,
and leads to no disillusionment.

VI

WAYS AND MEANS

Before going farther I must try to give some account of the ways and means of the villagers,
although, obviously, in a population so heterogeneous, nothing short of a scientific survey
on the lines pursued by Sir Charles Booth or Mr. Rowntree could be of much value in this direction.
The observations to be offered here pretend to no such authority. They have been collected
at random, and subjected to no tests, and they refer almost exclusively to the "unskilled"
labouring people.

During twenty years there have not been many fluctuations in the price of a day's labour in
the parish, but probably on the whole there has been a slight increase. The increase, however,
is very uncertain. While the South African War was in progress, and afterwards when Bordon
Camp was building, eight miles away, labour did indeed seem to profit. But then came the inevitable
trade depression, work grew scarce, and by the summer of 1909 wages had dropped to something
less than they had been before the war. I heard, for instance, of a man--one of the most capable
in the district--who was glad that summer to go haymaking at half a crown a day. And yet two
or three years earlier he had certainly been earning from fourpence halfpenny to fivepence
an hour, or, say, from three and sixpence to four shillings for a day's work. In 1909 the low-water
mark was reached; the following spring saw a slight revival, and at present the average may
be put at three shillings. For this sum a fairly good man can be got to do an ordinary day's
work of nine hours in the vegetable-garden or at any odd job.

The builders' labourers are rather better paid--if their employment were not so intermittent--with
an average of from fourpence halfpenny to fivepence an hour. Carters, too, and vanmen employed
by coal-merchants, builders, and other tradesmen in the town, are comparatively well off with
constant work at eighteen or twenty shillings a week. The men in the gravel-pits--but that
industry is rapidly declining as one after another the pits are worked out--can earn perhaps
five shillings a day if at piece-work, or about three and sixpence on ordinary terms. From
this sum a deduction must be made for tools, which the men provide and keep in repair themselves.
It is rather a heavy item. The picks frequently need repointing, and a blacksmith can hardly
do this for less than twopence the point. The gravel-work, too, is very irregular. In snow
or heavy rain it has to stop, and in frost it is difficult. More than once during the winter
of 1908-09, it being a time of great distress, gravel-pit workers came to me with some of those
worked flints--the big paleoliths of the river-gravel--which they had found and saved up, but
now desired to sell, in order to raise money for pointing their pickaxes. I have wondered sometimes
if the savages who shaped those flints had ever looked out upon life so anxiously as these
neighbours of mine, whose iron tools were so strangely receiving this prehistoric help.

At one time upwards of forty men in the parish had more or loss constant work on one of the
"ballast-trains" which the South-Western Railway kept on the line for repairing the permanent
way. The work, usually done at night and on Sundays, brought them in from eighteen to twenty-four
shillings a week, according to the hours they made. I do not know how many of our men are employed
on the railway now, but they are certainly fewer. Some years ago--it was when the great trade
depression had already hit the parish badly, and dozens of men were out of work here--the railway-company
suddenly stopped this train, and consternation spread through the village at the prospect of
forty more being added to the numbers of its unemployed.

Reviewing the figures, and making allowance for short time due to bad weather, public holidays,
sickness, and so on, it may be estimated that even when trade is good the average weekly wage
earned by one of the village men at his recognized work is something under seventeen shillings.
This, however, does not constitute quite the whole income of the family. In most cases the
man's wages are supplemented by small and uncertain sums derived from the work of women and
children, and from odd jobs done in the evenings, and from extra earnings in particular seasons.

Field-work still employs a few women, although every year their numbers decrease. It is miserably
paid at a shilling a day, or in some cases on piece-work terms which hardly work out at a higher
figure. Piecework, for instance, was customary in the hop-gardens (now rapidly disappearing),
where the women cut the bines and "tied" or "trained" the hops at so much per acre, providing
their own rushes for the tying. At haymaking and at harvesting there is work for women; and
again in the hop-gardens, when the picking is over, women are useful at clearing up the bines.
They can earn money, too, at trimming swedes, picking up newly-dug potatoes, and so on; but
when all is said, there are not many of them who can find work to do in the fields all the
year round. At the best, bad weather often interrupts them, and the stress and hardships of
the work, not to mention other drawbacks, make the small earnings from it a doubtful blessing.

A considerable number of women formerly eked out the family income by taking in washing for
people in the town. Several properly equipped laundries have of late years greatly reduced
this employment, but it still occupies a few. The difficulties of carrying it on are considerable,
apart from the discomforts of it in a small cottage. Unless a woman has a donkey and cart,
it is hard for her to get the washing from her customers' homes and carry it back again. Of
the amount that can be earned at the work by a married woman, with husband and children to
do for, I have no knowledge.

Charwomen, more in demand than ever as the residential character of the place grows more pronounced,
earn latterly as much as two shillings a day, besides at least one substantial meal. The meal
is a consideration, and obviously good for the women. In bad times, when the men and even the
children go rather hungry, it often happens that the mother of the family is able to keep her
strength up, thanks to the tolerable food she gets three or four days a week in the houses
where she goes scrubbing and cleaning.

A few women--so few that they really need not be mentioned--earn a little at needlework, two
or three of them having a small dressmaking connection amongst their cottage neighbours and
with servant-girls. It will be realized that the prices which such clients can afford to pay
are pitifully small.

In one or other of these ways most of the labouring class women do something to add to the
earnings of their husbands, so that in prosperous times the family income may approach twenty-four
shillings a week. Yet the average must be below that sum. The woman's work is very irregular,
and just when her few shillings would be most useful--namely, when she has a baby or little
children to care for--of course her employment stops. If not, it is unprofitable in the end;
for, involving as it does some neglect of the children, as well as of the woman's own health,
it leads to sickness and expenses which may impoverish the whole family for years.

With regard to the minor sources of income, I have often wondered at the eagerness of the average
labourer to earn an odd shilling, and at the amount of work he will do for it, after his proper
day's work is over. I know several men who frequently add two or three shillings to their week's
money in this way. To give an instance of how they go on, one evening recently I was unexpectedly
wanting to send a heavy parcel into the town. Going out to seek somebody who would take it,
I chanced upon a man--very well known to me--who was at work just within the hedge of a villa
garden, where he was erecting on a pole a notice-board announcing a "sale of work" shortly
to be held. He had obviously nearly done, so I proposed my errand to him. Yes; he would go
as soon as he had finished what he was doing. Then, perceiving that he looked tired, I commented
on the fact. He smiled. "I bin mowin' all day over there at ...," and he mentioned a farm two
or three miles distant. Still, he could go with my parcel. This was at about seven o'clock
in the evening, and would mean a two-mile walk for him. The very next evening, when it was
raining, I saw him in the churchyard digging a grave. "Haven't been mowing to-day, have you?"
"Yes," he said cheerily. Mowing is, perhaps, the most fatiguing work a man can do, but fatigue
was nothing to this man where a few shillings could be earned. His ordinary wages, I believe,
are eighteen shillings a week, but during last winter he was out of work for six or eight weeks.

I have known this man, and others also, to make now and then quite a little harvest, amounting
to several pounds, at the unsavoury work of cleaning out cess-pits. One man, indeed--a farm-labourer
by day--had for a time a sort of trade connection in the parish for this employment, and would
add the labour of two or three nights a week to that of his days; but, of course, he could
not keep it up for long. It is highly-paid work, as it ought to be; but the ten shillings or
so that a man may earn at it four or five times a year come rather as a welcome windfall than
as a part of income upon which he can rely.

The seasonal employments are disappearing from the neighbourhood, as agriculture gives place
to the residential interests. Hop-picking used to be the most notable of them, and even now,
spite of the much-diminished acreage under hops, it is found necessary at the schools to defer
the long holiday until September, because it would be impossible to get the children to school
while the hops are being picked. For all the family goes into the gardens--all, that is to
say, who have no constant work. The season now lasts some three weeks, during which a family
may earn anything from two to four pounds. At this season a few of the more experienced and
trustworthy men--my friend who mows, and digs graves, and runs errands is one of them--do better
in the hop-kilns at "drying" than in the gardens. Theirs is an anxious, a responsible, and
almost a sleepless duty. The pay for it, when I last heard, was two guineas a week, and--pleasant
survival from an older mode of employment--the prudent hop-grower gives his dryers a pound
at Christmas as a sort of retaining-fee. It is to be observed that failure of the crop is too
frequent an occurrence. In years when there are no hops, the people feel the want of their
extra money all the following winter.

Another custom, as it is all but extinct, needs only a passing mention now. No longer do large
gangs of our labourers--with some of their womenfolk, perhaps--troop off "down into Sussex"
for the August harvesting there, and for the hoeing that follows it; and no longer is the village
enriched by the gold they used to bring back. When July is ending, perhaps two or three men,
whether enticed by some dream of old harvesting joys in sight of the sea, or driven by want
at home, may stray off for a few weeks; but I do not hear that their adventure is ever so prosperous
nowadays as to induce others to follow suit.

Where the income of a family from the united efforts of the father and mother is still so small,
every shilling that can be added to it is precious, and, consequently, the children have to
begin earning as early as they may. Hence there is not much lingering at school, after the
minimum age for leaving has been reached. Nay, some little boys, and here and there a little
girl, will make from a shilling to half a crown a week at carrying out milk or newspapers before
morning school begins, so that they go to their lessons with the first freshness taken off
them by three or four miles of burdened walking. In view of the wear and tear of shoe-leather,
even those parents who countenance the practice are doubtful of its economy. Still, a few of
them encourage it; and though, if spread out amongst the families, these pitiful little earnings
could hardly make a perceptible difference to the average income. I mention them here in order
to leave no source of income unnoticed. When school-days are over, the family begins to benefit
from the children's work. At fourteen years old, few of the boys are put to trades, but most
of them get something to do in the town, where there is a great demand for errand-boys. Their
wages start at about four shillings a week, increasing in a few years to as much as seven or
eight. Then, at seventeen years old or so, the untrained youths begin to compete in the labour
market with the men, taking too early, and at too small wages, to the driving of carts or even
to work in the gravel-pits. The amount of help that these fellows then contribute towards the
family expenses out of their twelve or fourteen shillings a week depends upon the parents,
but it is something if they merely keep themselves; and I believe, though I do not certainly
know, that it is customary for them to pay a few shillings for their lodging at least.

For girls leaving school there is no difficulty in finding, as they say, "a little place" for
a start in domestic service; for even the cheaper villas which have sprung up around the town
generally need their cheap drudges. Hence, at an earlier age than the boys, the girls are taken
off their parents' hands and become self-supporting. True, it is long before they can earn
much more in money than suffices for their own needs in clothes and boots--they cannot send
many shillings home to their mothers; but no doubt a family may be found here and there enriched
to the extent of a pound or two a year by the labour of the girls.

Putting the various items together, it might seem that in favourable circumstances there would
be some twenty-three or twenty-four shillings a week for a family to live on all the year round.
But it must be remembered, first, that the circumstances seldom remain favourable for many
months together; and, second, that the greater number of families have to do without those
small supplementary sums provided by the work of children, or by odd jobs, or by the good wages
of hop-drying, and so forth. Nor is this the only deduction to be made. As I have already explained,
in the cases where money is most needed--namely, where there is a family of little children--the
mother cannot go out to work, and the income is reduced to the bare amount earned by the father
alone. And these cases are very plentiful, while, on the contrary, those in which the best
conditions prevail are very scarce. Taking the village all through, and balancing bad times
against good ones, I question if the income of the labouring class families averages twenty
shillings a week; indeed, I should be greatly surprised to learn that it amounted to so much.
In very many instances eighteen shillings or even less would be the more correct estimate.

One other item remains to be recognized, although its value is too variable to be computed
with any exactness in money and added to the sum of an average week's income. What is the worth
to a labourer of the crops he grows in his garden? It depends, obviously, on the man's skill,
and the size of the garden, and the clemency of the seasons--matters, all of them, in which
any attempt at generalization must be received with suspicion. All that can be said with certainty
is that most of the cottages in the valley have gardens, and that most of the cottagers are
diligent to cultivate them. But when the circumstances are considered, it will be plain that
the value of the produce must not be put very high. The amount of ground that can be worked
in the spring and summer evenings is, after all, not much; it is but little manure that can
be bought out of a total money-income of eighteen shillings a week; and even good seed is,
for the same reason, seldom obtained. The return for the labour expended, therefore, is seldom
equal to what it should be, and we may surmise that he is a fortunate man, or an unusually
industrious one, who can make his gardening worth more than two shillings a week to him in
food. There must be many cottages in the valley where the yield of the garden is scarcely half
that value.

To complete the picture of the people's ways and means, it ought next to be shown how the money
income is spent by an average family. To do that, however, would be beyond my power, even if
it were possible to determine what an "average family" is. I know, of course, that rent takes
from three and sixpence a week for the poorest hovels to six shillings for the newer tenements
on the outskirts of the parish; in other words, that from a quarter to a third of the labourer's
whole income goes back immediately into the pockets of the employing classes for shelter alone.
I know also that payments into benefit societies drain away another eightpence to a shilling
a week. I realize that very often the weekly bread bill runs away with nearly half the money
that is left, and so I can reckon that tea and groceries, boots and clothes, firing and light,
have somehow to be obtained at a cost of no more than seven or eight shillings weekly. But
these calculations fail to satisfy me. They leave unsolved the problem of those last seven
or eight shillings, on the expenditure of which turns the really vital question which an inquiry
like this ought to settle. How do the people make both ends meet? Are the seven shillings as
a rule enough for so many purposes? or almost, but not quite enough? or nothing like enough?
After all, I do not know. Information breaks down just at this point where information is most
to be desired.

There is no doubt at all, however, as to the strain and stress of the general struggle to live
in the valley, the sheer wear and tear of temper and spirits involved in the daily grappling
with that problem. Everywhere one comes across symptoms of it--partial evidences--but the most
complete exposition that I have had was given, some years ago now, by a woman who had no intention
of complaining. She came to me with a message from a neighbour who was ill, but, in explanation
of her part in helping him, she began to speak of her own affairs. With some of these affairs
I was already acquainted. Thus I knew her to be the mother of an exceptionally large family,
so that her case could not be quite typical. But I also knew that her husband had been in constant
work for many years, so that, in her case, there had been no period when the income at her
disposal ceased altogether, as in the case of so many other women otherwise less handicapped
than she. I was aware, too, that she herself helped out the family earnings by taking in washing.

To these items of vague knowledge she added a few particulars. As to income, I learnt that
her husband--a labourer on a farm some three miles away--earned fifteen shillings a week during
the winter, and rather more in the summer months, when he was allowed to do "piece-work." The
piece-work had the further advantage of permitting him to begin so early in the day--four o'clock
was his time in summer--that he usually got home again by four in the afternoon, and was able
to do better than most men with his garden. Amongst other things, he raised flowers for sale.
He was wont to send to a well-known nursery in Norfolk for his seeds--china-asters and stocks
were his speciality--and he reared his plants under a little glass "light" which he had made
for himself out of a few old window-sashes. His pains with these flowers were unsparing. Neighbours
laughed at him (so his wife assured me, with some pride) because he went to the plants down
on his hands and knees, smoking each one with tobacco to clear it from green aphis. He also
raised fifty or sixty sticks of celery every year, which sold for threepence apiece. Meanwhile
he by no means neglected his main business as a cottage-gardener--namely, the growing of food-crops
for home use. By renting for five shillings a year an extra plot of ground near his cottage,
he was able to keep his large family supplied with potatoes for quite half the year. It was
much to do. They wanted nearly a bushel of potatoes a week, the wife said; and if that was
so, the man was adding, in the shape of potatoes at half a crown a bushel, the value of more
than three pounds a year to his income. No doubt he grew other vegetables too--parsnips, carrots,
turnips, and some green-stuff--but these were not mentioned. A little further help was at last
coming from the family, the eldest daughter having begun to pay half the rent out of her earnings
as a servant-girl.

Help certainly must have been welcome. There were two other girls in service, and therefore
off their parents' hands; but six children--the youngest only a few months old--were still
at home, dependent on what their father and mother could earn. Of these, the eldest was a boy
near thirteen. "I shall be glad when he's schoolin's over," the mother said; and she had applied
for a "labour certificate" which would allow him to finish school as a "half-timer," and to
go out and earn a little money.

Since their marriage, twenty-three years earlier, the couple had occupied always the came cottage,
at a rental of three shillings a week. After the first twenty years--the property then changing
owners--the first few repairs in all that long period had been undertaken. That is to say,
the outside woodwork was painted; a promise was given to do up the interior; the company's
water was laid on; and--the rent was raised to three-and-sixpence. The woman thought this a
hardship; but she said that her husband, looking at the bright side of things, rejoiced to
think that now the water from the old tank, hitherto so precious for household uses, might
be spared for his flowers.

After the rent was paid--with the daughter's help--there were about fourteen shillings left.
But the man was an "Oddfellow," and his subscription was nine shillings a quarter, or eightpence
halfpenny a week. In prudence, that amount should perhaps have been put by every week, but
apparently prudence often had to give way to pressing needs. "When the club money's due, that's
when we finds it wust," the woman remarked. "Sometimes I've said to 'n, 'I dunno how we be
goin' to git through the week.' 'Oh,' he says, 'don't you worry. We shall get to the end of
'n somehow.'"

But she did not explain, nor is it easy to conceive, how it was done. For observe, the weekly
bushel of potatoes did not feed the family, even for half the year. "A gallon of potatoes a
day, that's what it is," she had said; and then she had enumerated other items. "A gallon of
bread a day," was needed too, besides a gallon of flour once a week "for puddings." In other
words, bread and flour cost upwards of six shillings weekly. Seeing that this left but eight
shillings for eight people, it is small wonder that the club-money was rarely put by, and great
wonder how the family managed at all when the club-money was wanted in a lump. It must have
been that they went short that week. For instance, they would do without puddings, and so save
on flour and firing; and the man would forego his tobacco--he had never any time to visit the
public-house, so that there was nothing to be saved in that direction. Yet assuming all this,
and assuming that the eldest daughter advanced a few extra shillings, still the situation remains
baffling. On what could they save, out of eight shillings? Probably one or other of the children,
or may be the mother herself, would make an old pair of boots serve just one more week, until
there was money in hand again; and that would go far to tide the family over. Yet the next
week would then have to be a pinched one; for, said the woman, "boots is the wust of all. It
wants a new pair for one or t'other of us purty near every week."

So far this woman's testimony. It is corroborated by what other cottagers have told me. A man
said, looking fondly at his children: "I has to buy a new pair o' shoes for one or other of
us every week. Or if I misses one week, then next week I wants two pair." Others, again, have
told of spending five to six shillings a week on bread. But of the less essential items one
never hears. Even of clothes there is rarely any talk, and of coal not often; nor yet often
of meat, or groceries. I do not suggest that meat and groceries are foresworn, but it would
appear that they come second in the household expenses. They are luxuries, only to be obtained
if and when more necessary things have been provided. With regard to firing--a little coal
is made to go a long way in the labourer's cottage; and with regard to clothes--it is doubtful
if anything new is bought, in many families, from year's end to year's end. At "rummage sales,"
for a few pence, the women are now able to pick up surprising bargains in cast-off garments,
which they adapt as best they can for their own or their children's wear. Economies like this,
however, still hardly suffice to explain how the scanty resources are really spread out. Apart
from a few cases of palpable destitution, it is not obvious that any families in the village
suffer actual want; and seeing that inquiries in the school in recent winters have failed to
discover more than two or three sets of children manifestly wanting food, one is led to conclude
that acute poverty is of rare occurrence here. On the other hand, all the calculations suggest
that a majority perhaps of the labouring folk endure a less intense but chronic poverty, in
which, at some point or other every day, the provision for bare physical needs falls a little
short.

VII

GOOD TEMPER

In view of their unpromising circumstances the people as a rule are surprisingly cheerful.
It is true there are never any signs in the valley of that almost festive temper, that glad
relish of life, which, if we may believe the poets, used to characterize the English village
of old times. Tested by that standard of happiness, it is a low-spirited, mirthless, and all
but silent population that we have here now. Of public and exuberant enjoyment there is nothing
whatever. And yet, subdued though they may be, the cottagers usually manage to keep in tolerable
spirits. A woman made me smile the other day. I had seen her husband a week earlier, and found
him rheumatic and despondent; but when I inquired how he did, she conceded, with a laugh: "Yes,
he had a bit o' rheumatism, but he's better now. He 'ad the 'ump then, too." I inferred that
she regarded his dejection as quite an unnecessary thing; and this certainly is the customary
attitude. The people are slow to admit that they are unhappy. At a "Penny Readings" an entertainer
caused some displeasure by a quite innocent joke in this connection. Coming through the village,
he noticed the sign of one of the public-houses--The Happy Home--and invented a conundrum which
he put from the platform: "Why was this a very miserable village?" But the answer, "Because
it has only one Happy Home in it," gave considerable offence. For we are not used to these
subtleties of language, and the point was missed, a good many folk protesting that we have
"a lot o' happy homes" here.

That they should be so touchy about it is perhaps suggestive--pitifully suggestive--of a suspicion
in them that their happiness is open to question. None the less, the general impression conveyed
by the people's manners is that of a quiet and rather cheery humour, far indeed from gaiety,
but farther still from wretchedness. And in matters like this one's senses are not deceived.
I know that my neighbours have abundant excuses for being down-hearted; and, as described in
an earlier chapter, I sometimes overhear their complainings; but more often than not the evidence
of voice-tones and stray words is reassuring rather than dispiriting.

Notice, for instance, the women who have done their shopping in the town early in the morning,
and are coming home for a day's work. They are out of breath, and bothered with their armfuls
of purchases; but nine times out of ten their faces look hopeful; there is no sound of grievance
or of worry in their talk; their smiling "Good-morning" to you proves somehow that it is not
a bad morning with them. One day a woman going to the town a little late met another already
returning, loaded up with goods. "'Ullo, Mrs. Fry," she laughed, "you be 'bliged to be fust,
then?" "Yes; but I en't bought it all, I thought you'd be comm', so I left some for you." "That's
right of ye. En't it a nice mornin'?" "Jest what we wants! My old man was up an' in he's garden...."
The words grow indistinguishable as you get farther away; you don't hear what the "old man"
was doing so early, but the country voices sound for a long time, comfortably tuned to the
pleasantness of the day.

This sort of thing is so common that I seldom notice it, unless it is varied in some way that
attracts attention. For instance, I could not help listening to a woman who was pushing her
baby in a perambulator down the hill. The baby sat facing her, as bland as a little image of
Buddha, and as unresponsive, but she was chaffing it. "Well, you be a funny little gal, ben't
ye? Why, you be goin' back'ards into the town! Whoever heared tell o' such a thing--goin' to
the town back'ards. You be a funny little gal!" To me it was a funny little procession, with
a touch of the pathetic hidden away in it somewhere; but it bore convincing witness to happiness
in at least one home in our valley.

It is not so easy to discover, or rather to point out, the corresponding evidence in the demeanour
of the men, although when one knows them one is aware that their attitude towards life is quite
as courageous as the women's, if not quite so playful. I confess that I rarely see them until
they have put a day's work behind them; and they may be more lightsome when they start in the
morning, at five o'clock or soon after it. Be that as it may, in the evenings I find them taciturn,
nonchalant rather than cheerful, not much disposed to be sprightly. Long-striding and ungainly,
they walk home; between six o'clock and seven you may be sure of seeing some of them coming
up the hill from the town, alone or by twos and threes. They speak but little; they look tired
and stern; very often there is nothing but a twinkle in their eyes to prove to you that they
are not morose. But in fact they are still taking life seriously; their thoughts, and hopes
too, are bent on the further work they mean to do when they shall have had their tea. For the
more old-fashioned men allow themselves but little rest, and in many a cottage garden of an
evening you may see the father of the family soberly at work, and liking it too. If his wife
is able to come and look on and chatter to him, or if he can hear her laughing with a friend
in the next garden, so much the better; but he does not stop work. Impelled, as I shall show
later, by other reasons besides those of economy, many of the men make prodigiously long days
of it, at least during the summer months. I have known them to leave home at five or even four
in the morning, walk five or six miles, do a day's work, walk back in the evening so as to
reach home at six or seven o'clock, and then, after a meal, go on again in their gardens until
eight or nine. They seem to be under some spiritual need to keep going; their conscience enslaves
them. So they grow thin and gaunt in body, grave and very quiet in their spirits. But sullen
they very rarely are. With rheumatism and "the 'ump" combined a man will sometimes grow exasperated
and be heard to speak irritably, but usually it is a very amiable "Good-evening" that greets
you from across the hedge where one of these men is silently digging or hoeing.

The nature of their work, shall I say, tends to bring them to quietness of soul? I hesitate
to say it, because, though work upon the ground with spade or hoe has such a soothing influence
upon the amateur, there is a difference between doing it for pleasure during a spare hour and
doing it as a duty after a twelve hours' day, and without any prospect of holiday as long as
one lives. Nevertheless it is plain to be seen that, albeit their long days too often reduce
them to a state of apathy, these quiet and patient men experience no less often a compensating
delight in the friendly feeling of the tool responding to their skill, and in the fine freshness
of the soil as they work it, and in the solace, so varied and so unfailingly fresh, of the
open air. Thus much at least I have seen in their looks, and have heard in their speech. On
a certain June evening when it had set in wet, five large-limbed men, just off their work on
the railway, came striding past me up the hill. They had sacks over their shoulders; their
clothes and boots, from working in gravel all day, were of the same yellowish-brown colour
as the sacks; they were getting decidedly wet; but they looked enviably easy-going and unconcerned.
As they went by me one after another, one sleepy-eyed man, comfortably smoking his pipe, vouchsafed
no word or glance. But the others, with friendly sidelong glance at me, all spoke; and their
placid voices were full of rich contentment. "Good-night"; "Nice rain"; "G'd-evenin'"; and,
last of all, "This'll make the young taters grow!" The man who said this looked all alert,
as if the blood were dancing in him with enjoyment of the rain; his eyes were beaming with
pleasure. So the five passed up the hill homewards, to have some supper, and then, perhaps,
watch and listen to the rain on their gardens until it was time to go to bed.

I ought to mention, though I may hardly illustrate, one faculty which is a great support to
many of the men--I mean the masculine gift of "humour." Not playful-witted like the women,
nor yet apt, like the women, to refresh their spirits in the indulgence of sentiment and emotion,
but rather stolid and inclined to dim brooding thought, they are able to see the laughable
side of their own misadventures and discomforts; and thanks to this they keep a sense of proportion,
as though perceiving that if their labour accomplishes its end, it does not really matter that
they get tired, or dirty, or wet through in doing it. This is a social gift, of small avail
to the men working alone in their gardens; but it serves them well during the day's work with
their mates, or when two or three of them together tackle some job of their own, such as cleaning
out a well, or putting up a fowl-house. Then, if somebody gets splashed, or knocks his knuckles,
and softly swears, his wrath turns to a grin as the little dry chuckle or the sly remark from
the others reminds him that his feelings are understood. It is well worth while to be present
at these times. I laugh now to think of some of them that I have enjoyed; but I will not risk
almost certain failure in trying to describe them, for their flavour depends on minute details
into which I have no space to enter.

But whatever alleviations there may be to their troubles, the people's geniality is still noteworthy.
In circumstances that contrast so pitifully with those of the employing classes, it would seem
natural if they were full of bitterness and envy; yet that is by no means the case. Being born
to poverty and the labouring life, they accept the position as if it were entirely natural.
Of course it has its drawbacks; but they suppose that it takes all sorts to make a world, and
since they are of the labouring sort they must make the best of it. With this simple philosophy
they have contrived hitherto to meet their troubles calmly, not blaming other people for them,
unless in individual cases, and hardly dreaming of translating them into social injustice.
They have no sense of oppression to poison their lives. The truth which economists begin to
recognize, that where there are wealthy and idle classes there must as an inevitable result
be classes who are impoverished and overworked, has not found its way into the villager's head.

So, supported by an instinctive fatalism, the people have taken their plight for granted, without
harbouring resentment against the more fortunate. It may be added that most of them are convinced
believers in those fallacies which cluster around the phrase "making work." It were strange
if they were not. The labourer lives by being employed at work; and, knowing his employer personally--this
or that farmer or tradesman or villa-resident--he sees the work he lives by actually being
"made." Only very rarely does it occur to him that when he goes to the shop he, too, makes
work. In bad times, perhaps, he gets an inkling of it; and then, when wages are scarce, and
the public-house landlord grumbles, old-fashioned villagers will say, "Ah, they misses the
poor man, ye see!" But the idea is too abstract to be followed to its logical conclusion. The
people do not see the multitudes at work for them in other counties, making their boots and
ready-made clothes, getting their coal, importing their cheap provisions; but they do see,
and know by name, the well-to-do of the neighbourhood, who have new houses built and new gardens
laid out; and they naturally enough infer that labour would perish if there were no well-to-do
people to be supplied.

Against the rich man, therefore, the labourers have no sort of animosity. If he will spend
money freely, the richer he is the better. Throughout the south of England this is the common
attitude. I remember, not long ago, on a holiday, coming to a village which looked rarely prosperous
for its county, owing, I was told, to the fact that the county lunatic asylum near by caused
money to be spent there. In the next village, which was in a deplorable state, and had no asylum,
the people were looking enviously towards this one, and wishing that at least their absentee
landlords would come and hunt the neighbourhood, though it appeared that one of these gentlemen
was a Bishop. But the labouring folk were not exacting as to the sort of person--lunatics,
fox-hunters, Bishops--anybody would be welcome who would spend riches in a way to "make work."
And so here. This village looks up to those who control wealth as if they were the sources
of it; and if there is a little dislike of some of them personally, there has so far appeared
but little bitterness of feeling against them as a class.

I do not say that there has never been any grumbling. One day, years ago, an old friend of
mine broke out, in his most contemptuous manner, "What d'ye think Master Dash Blank bin up
to now?" He named the owner of a large estate near the town. "Bin an' promised all his men
a blanket an' a quarter of a ton o' coal at Christmas. A blanket, and a quarter of a ton o'
coal! Pity as somebody hadn't shoved a brick down his throat, when he had got 'n open, so's
to keep 'n open!" The sentiment sounds envious, but in fact it was scornful. It was directed,
not against the great man's riches, but against the well-known meanness he displayed anew in
his contemptible gifts.

A faint trace of traditional class animosity sounds in one or two customary phrases of the
village, for instance in the saying that there is one law for the rich and another for the
poor. Yet this has become such a by-word as to be usually stated with a smile; for is it not
an old acquaintance amongst opinions? The older people even have a humorous development of
it. According to their improved version, there are not two only, but three kinds of law: one
kind for the rich, one for the poor, and one "the law that nobody can't make." What is this
last? Why, the law "to make a feller pay what en't got nothink." By such witticisms the edge
of bitterness is turned; the sting is taken out of that sense of inequality which, as the labourer
probably knows, would poison his present comfort and lead him into dangerous courses if he
let it rankle. With one exception, the angriest recognition of class differences which I have
come across amongst the villagers was when I passed two women on their way home from the town,
where, I surmised, they, or some friend of theirs, had just been fined at the County Court
or the Petty Sessions. "Ah!" one was saying, with spiteful emphasis, "there'll come a great
day for they to have their Judge, same as we poor people." Yet even there, if the emotion was
newly-kindled, the sentiment was too antiquated to mean much. For it is a very ancient idea--that
of getting even with one's enemies in the next world instead of in this. So long as the poor
can console themselves by leaving it to Providence to avenge them at the Day of Judgment, it
cannot be said that there is any virulent class-feeling amongst them. The most that you can
make of it is that they occasionally feel spiteful. It happened, in this case, to be against
rich people that those two women felt their momentary grudge; but it was hardly felt against
the rich as a class; and if the same kind of offence had come from some neighbour, they would
have said much the same kind of thing. In the family disputes which occur now and then over
the inheritance of a few pounds' worth of property, the losers put on a very disinterested
and superior look, and say piously of the gainers: "Ah, they'll never prosper! They can't prosper!"

The exceptional case alluded to above was certainly startling. I was talking to an old man
whom I had long known: a little wrinkled old man, deservedly esteemed for his integrity and
industry, full of experience as well as of old-world notions sometimes a little "grumpy," a
little caustic in his manner of talking, but on the whole quite kindly and tolerant in his
disposition. You could often watch in his face the habitual practice of patience, as, with
a wry smile and a contemptuous remark, he dismissed some disagreeable topic or other from his
thoughts. He had come down in the world. His father's cottage, already mortgaged when he inherited
it, had been sold over his head after the death of the mortgagee, so that thenceforth he was
on no better footing than any other of the labourers. Gradually, as the demand failed for his
old-fashioned forms of skill--thatching, mowing, and so on--his position became more and more
precarious; yet he remained good-tempered, in his queer acid way, until he was past seventy
years old. That evening, when he startled me, he had been telling of his day's work as a road-mender,
and he was mightily philosophical over the prospect of having to give up even that last form
of regular employment, because of the exposure and the miles of walking which it entailed.
Nobody could have thought him a vindictive or even a discontented man so far. By chance, however,
something was said about the uncultivated land in the neighbourhood, covered as it is with
fir-woods now; and at that he suddenly fired up. Pointing to the woods, which could be seen
beyond the valley, he said spitefully, while his eyes blazed: "I can remember when all that
was open common, and you could go where you mind to. Now 'tis all fenced in, and if you looks
over the fence they'll lock ye up. And they en't got no more right to it, Mr. Bourne, than
you and me have! I should like to see they woods all go up in flames!"

That was years ago. The woods are flourishing; the old man is past doing any mischief; but
I remember his indignation. And it was the sole case I have met with in the parish, of animosity
harboured not so much against persons as against the existing position of things. This one
man was alive to the injustice of a social arrangement; and in that respect he differed from
the rest of my neighbours, unless I am much deceived in them. Of course there may be more of
envious feeling abroad in the village than I know about. It is the sort of thing that would
keep itself secret; and perhaps this old man's contemporaries, who shared his recollections,
silently shared his bitterness too. But if so, I do not believe that they have passed the feeling
on to their children. The impression is strong in me that the people have never learnt to look
upon the distribution of property, which has left them so impoverished, as anything other than
an inevitable dispensation of Providence. If they thought otherwise, at any rate if the contrary
view were at all prevalent amongst them, they must be most gifted hypocrites, to go about with
the good temper in their eyes and the cheerfulness in their voices that I have been describing.

To what should it be attributed--this power of facing poverty with contentment? To some extent
doubtless it rests on Christian teaching, although perhaps not much on the Christian teaching
of the present day. Present-day religion, indeed, must often seem to the cottagers a tiresome
hobby reserved to the well-to-do; but from distant generations there seems to have come down,
in many a cottage family, a rather lofty religious sentiment which fosters honesty, patience,
resignation, courage. Much of the gravity, much of the tranquillity of soul of the more sedate
villagers must be ascribed to this traditional influence, whose effects are attractive enough,
in the character and outlook of many an old cottage man and woman.

Yet there is much more in the village temper than can be accounted for by this cause alone.
In most of the people the cheerfulness does not suggest pious resignation, in the hope of the
next world; it looks like a grim and lusty determination to make the best of this world. It
is contemptuous, or laughing. As I have shown, it has a tendency to be beery. It occasionally
breaks out into disorder. In fact, if the folk were not habitually overworked they would be
boisterous, jolly. Of course it may all proceed from the strong English nature in them; and
in that case we need seek no other explanation of it. Yet if one influence, namely, a traditional
Christianity, is to be credited--as it certainly should be--with an effect upon the village
character in one direction, then probably, behind this other effect in another direction, some
other influence is at work. And for my part I make no doubt of it. The cheerfulness of the
cottagers rests largely upon a survival of the outlook and habits of the peasant days before
the common was enclosed. It is not a negative quality. My neighbours are not merely patient
and loftily resigned to distress; they are still groping, dimly, for an enjoyment of life which
they have not yet realized to be unattainable. They maintain the peasant spirits. Observe,
I do not suggest that they are intentionally old-fashioned. I do not believe them to be sympathetic
at all to those self-conscious revivals of peasant arts which are now being recommended to
the poor by a certain type of philanthropists. They make no æsthetic choice. They do not deliberate
which of the ancestral customs it would be "nice" for them to follow; but, other things being
equal, they incline to go on in the way that has been usual in their families. It is a tendency
that sways them, not a thought-out scheme of the way to live. Now and again, perhaps, some
memory may strengthen the tendency, as they are reminded of this or that fine old personality
worthy of imitation, or as some circumstance of childhood is recalled, which it would be pleasant
to restore; but in the main the force which bears them on is a traditional outlook, fifty times
more potent than definite but transient memories. This it is that has to be recognized in my
neighbours. Down in their valley, until the "residents" began to flock in, the old style of
thinking lingered on; in the little cottages the people, from earliest infancy, were accustomed
to hear all things--persons and manners, houses and gardens, and the day's work--appraised
by an ancient standard of the countryside; and consequently it happens that this evening while
I am writing, out there on the slopes of the valley the men and women, and the very children
whose voices I can just hear, are living by an outlook in which the values are different from
those of easy-going people, and in which, especially, hardships have never been met by peevishness,
but have been beaten by good-humour.

THE ALTERED CIRCUMSTANCES

VIII

THE PEASANT SYSTEM

The persistence into the twentieth century--the scarcely realized persistence--not so much
of any definite ideas, as of a general temper more proper to the eighteenth century, accounts
for all sorts of anomalies in the village, and explains not only why other people do not understand
the position of its inhabitants to-day, but why they themselves largely fail to understand
it. They are not fully aware of being behind the times, and probably in many respects they
no longer are so; only there is that queer mental attitude giving its bias to their view of
life. Although very feebly now, still the momentum derived from a forgotten cult carries them on.

But, having noticed the persistence of the peasant traditions, we have next to notice how inadequate
they are to present needs. Our subject swings round here. Inasmuch as the peasant outlook lingers
on in the valley, it explains many of those peculiarities I have described in earlier chapters;
but, inasmuch as it is a decayed and all but useless outlook, we shall see in its decay the
significance of those changes in the village which have now to be traced out. The little that
is left from the old days has an antiquarian or a gossipy sort of interest; but the lack of
the great deal that has gone gives rise to some most serious problems.

For, as I hinted at the outset, the "peasant" tradition in its vigour amounted to nothing less
than a form of civilization--the home-made civilization of the rural English. To the exigent
problems of life it furnished solutions of its own--different solutions, certainly, from those
which modern civilization gives, but yet serviceable enough. People could find in it not only
a method of getting a living, but also an encouragement and a help to live well. Besides employment
there was an intense interest for them in the country customs. There was scope for modest ambition
too. Best of all, those customs provided a rough guidance as to conduct--an unwritten code
to which, though we forget it, England owes much. It seems singular to think of now; but the
very labourer might reasonably hope for some satisfaction in life, nor trouble about "raising"
himself into some other class, so long as he could live on peasant lines. And it is in the
virtual disappearance of this civilization that the main change in the village consists. Other
changes are comparatively immaterial. The valley might have been invaded by the leisured classes;
its old appearance might have been altered; all sorts of new-fangled things might have been
introduced into it; and still under the surface it would have retained the essential village
characteristics, had but the peasant tradition been preserved in its integrity amongst the
lowlier people; but with that dying, the village, too, dies where it stands. And that is what
has been happening here. A faint influence from out of the past still has its feeble effect;
but, in this corner of England at least, what we used to think of as the rural English are,
as it were, vanishing away--vanishing as in a slow transformation, not by death or emigration,
not even by essential change of personnel, but by becoming somehow different in their outlook
and habits. The old families continue in their old home; but they begin to be a new people.

It was of the essence of the old system that those living under it subsisted in the main upon
what their own industry could produce out of the soil and materials of their own countryside.
A few things, certainly, they might get from other neighbourhoods, such as iron for making
their tools, and salt for curing their bacon; and some small interchange of commodities there
was, accordingly, say between the various districts that yielded cheese, and wool, and hops,
and charcoal; but as a general thing the parish where the peasant people lived was the source
of the materials they used, and their well-being depended on their knowledge of its resources.
Amongst themselves they would number a few special craftsmen--a smith, a carpenter or wheelwright,
a shoemaker, a pair of sawyers, and so on; yet the trades of these specialists were only ancillary
to the general handiness of the people, who with their own hands raised and harvested their
crops, made their clothes, did much of the building of their homes, attended to their cattle,
thatched their ricks, cut their firing, made their bread and wine or cider, pruned their fruit-trees
and vines, looked after their bees, all for themselves. And some at least, and perhaps the
most, of these economies were open to the poorest labourer. Though he owned no land, yet as
the tenant, and probably the permanent tenant, of a cottage and garden he had the chance to
occupy himself in many a craft that tended to his own comfort. A careful man and wife needed
not to despair of becoming rich in the possession of a cow or a pig or two, and of good clothes
and household utensils; and they might well expect to see their children grow up strong and
prosperous in the peasant way.

Thus the claim that I have made for the peasant tradition--namely, that it permitted a man
to hope for well-being without seeking to escape from his own class into some other--is justified,
partially at least. I admit that the ambition was a modest one, but there were circumstances
attending it to make it a truly comforting one too. Look once more at the conditions. The small
owners of the parish might occupy more land than the labourers, and have the command of horses
and waggons, and ploughs and barns, and so on; but they ate the same sort of food and wore
the same sort of clothes as the poorer folk, and they thought the same thoughts too, and talked
in the same dialect, so that the labourer working for them was not oppressed by any sense of
personal inferiority. He might even excel in some directions, and be valued for his excellence.
Hence, if his ambition was small, the need for it was not very great.

And then, this life of manifold industry was interesting to live. It is impossible to doubt
it. Not one of the pursuits I have mentioned failed to make its pleasant demand on the labourer
for skill and knowledge; so that after his day's wage-earning he turned to his wine-making
or the management of his pigs with the zest that men put into their hobbies. Amateurs the people
were of their homely crafts--very clever amateurs, too, some of them. I think it likely, also,
that normally even wage-earning labour went as it were to a peaceful tune. In the elaborate
tile-work of old cottage roofs, in the decorated ironwork of decrepit farm-waggons, in the
carefully fashioned field-gates--to name but a few relics of the sort--many a village of Surrey
and Hampshire and Sussex has ample proofs that at least the artisans of old time went about
their work placidly, unhurriedly, taking time to make their products comely. And probably the
same peaceful conditions extended to the labouring folk. Of course, their ploughing and harvesting
have left no traces; but there is much suggestiveness in some little things one may note, such
as the friendly behaviour of carter-men to their horses, and the accomplished finish given
to the thatch of ricks, and the endearing names which people in out-of-the-way places still
bestow upon their cows. Quietly, but convincingly, such things tell their tale of tranquillity,
for they cannot have originated amongst a people habitually unhappy and harassed. But whether
the day's work went comfortably or no, certainly the people's own home-work--to turn to that
again--must often have been agreeable, and sometimes delightful. The cottage crafts were not
all strictly useful; some had simple æsthetic ends. If you doubt it, look merely at the clipped
hedges of box and yew in the older gardens; they are the result of long and loving care, but
they serve no particular end, save to please the eye. So, too, in general, if you think that
the folk of old were inappreciative of beauty, you have but to listen to their names of flowers--sweet-william,
hearts-ease, marigold, meadow-sweet, night-shade--for proof that English peasant-life had its
graceful side.

Still, their useful work must, after all, have been the mainstay of the villagers; and how
thoroughly their spirits were immersed in it I suppose few living people will ever be able
to realize. For my part, I dare not pretend to comprehend it; only at times I can vaguely feel
what the peasant's attitude must have been. All the things of the countryside had an intimate
bearing upon his own fate; he was not there to admire them, but to live by them--or, say, to
wrest his living from them by familiar knowledge of their properties. From long experience--experience
older than his own, and traditional amongst his people--he knew the soil of the fields and
its variations almost foot by foot; he understood the springs and streams; hedgerow and ditch
explained themselves to him; the coppices and woods, the water-meadows and the windy heaths,
the local chalk and clay and stone, all had a place in his regard--reminded him of the crafts
of his people, spoke to him of the economies of his own cottage life; so that the turfs or
the faggots or the timber he handled when at home called his fancy, while he was handling them,
to the landscape they came from. Of the intimacy of this knowledge, in minute details, it is
impossible to give an idea. I am assured of its existence because I have come across surviving
examples of it, but I may not begin to describe it. One may, however, imagine dimly what the
cumulative effect of it must have been on the peasant's outlook; how attached he must have
grown--I mean how closely linked--to his own countryside. He did not merely "reside" in it;
he was part of it, and it was part of him. He fitted into it as one of its native denizens,
like the hedgehogs and the thrushes. All that happened to it mattered to him. He learnt to
look with reverence upon its main features, and would not willingly interfere with their disposition.
But I lose the best point in talking of the individual peasant; these things should rather
be said of the tribe--the little group of folk--of which he was a member. As they, in their
successive generations, were the denizens of their little patch of England--its human fauna--so
it was with traditional feelings derived from their continuance in the land that the individual
peasant man or woman looked at the fields and the woods.

Out of all these circumstances--the pride of skill in handicrafts, the detailed understanding
of the soil and its materials, the general effect of the well-known landscape, and the faint
sense of something venerable in its associations--out of all this there proceeded an influence
which acted upon the village people as an unperceived guide to their conduct, so that they
observed the seasons proper for their varied pursuits almost as if they were going through
some ritual. Thus, for instance, in this parish, when, on an auspicious evening of spring,
a man and wife went out far across the common to get rushes for the wife's hop-tying, of course
it was a consideration of thrift that sent them off; but an idea of doing the right piece of
country routine at the right time gave value to the little expedition. The moment, the evening,
became enriched by suggestion of the seasons into which it fitted, and by memories of years
gone by. Similarly in managing the garden crops: to be too late, to neglect the well-known
signs which hinted at what should be done, was more than bad economy; it was dereliction of
peasant duty. And thus the succession of recurring tasks, each one of which seemed to the villager
almost characteristic of his own people in their native home, kept constantly alive a feeling
that satisfied him and a usage that helped him. The feeling was that he belonged to a set of
people rather apart from the rest of the world--a people necessarily different from others
in their manners, and perhaps poorer and ruder than most, but yet fully entitled to respect
and consideration. The usage was just the whole series or body of customs to which his own
people conformed; or, more exactly, the accepted idea in the village of what ought to be done
in any contingency, and of the proper way to do it. In short, it was that unwritten code I
spoke of just now--a sort of savoir vivre--which became part of the rural labourer's outlook,
and instructed him through his days and years. It was hardly reduced to thoughts in his consciousness,
but it always swayed him. And it was consistent with--nay, it implied--many strong virtues:
toughness to endure long labour, handiness, frugality, habits of early rising. It was consistent
too--that must be admitted--with considerable hardness and "coarseness" of feeling; a man might
be avaricious, loose, dirty, quarrelsome, and not offend much against the essential peasant
code. Nor was its influence very good upon his intellectual development, as I shall show later
on. Yet whatever its defects, it had those qualities which I have tried to outline; and where
it really flourished it ultimately led to gracefulness of living and love of what is comely
and kindly. You can detect as much still, in the flavour of many a mellow folk-saying, not
to mention folk-song; you may divine it yet in all kinds of little popular traits, if once
you know what to look for.

In this particular valley, where the barren soil challenged the people to a severer struggle
for bare subsistence, the tradition could not put forth its fairer, its gentler, features;
nevertheless the backbone of the village life was of the genuine peasant order. The cottagers
had to "rough it," to dispense with softness, to put up with ugliness; but by their own skill
and knowledge they forced the main part of their living out of the soil and materials of their
own neighbourhood. And in doing this they won at least the rougher consolations which that
mode of life had to offer. Their local knowledge was intensely interesting to them; they took
pride in their skill and hardihood; they felt that they belonged to a set of people not inferior
to others, albeit perhaps poorer and ruder; and all the customs which their situation required
them to follow sustained their belief in the ancestral notions of good and evil. In other words,
they had a civilization to support them--a poor thing, perhaps, a poor kind of civilization,
but their own, and entirely within the reach of them all. I have no hesitation in affirming
all this; because, though I never saw the system in its completeness, I came here soon enough
to find a few old people still partially living by it. These old people, fortunate in the possession
of their own cottages and a little land, were keepers of pigs and donkeys, and even a few cows.
They kept bees, too; they made wine; they often paid in kind for any services that neighbours
did for them; and with the food they could grow, and the firing they could still obtain from
the woods and heath, their living was half provided for. The one of them I knew best was not
the most typical. Shrewd old man that he was, he had adapted himself so far as suited him to
a more commercial economy, and had grown suspicious and avaricious; yet if he could have been
translated suddenly back into the eighteenth century, he would scarce have needed to change
any of his habits, or even his clothes. He wore an old-fashioned "smock frock," doubtless home-made;
and in this he pottered about all day--pottered, at least, in his old age, when I knew him--not
very spruce as to personal cleanliness, smelling of his cow-stall, saving money, wanting no
holiday, independent of books and newspapers, indifferent to anything that happened farther
off than the neighbouring town, liking his pipe and glass of beer, and never knowing what it
was to feel dull. I speak of him because I knew him personally; but there were others of whom
I used to hear, though I never became acquainted with them, who seem to have been hardly at
all tainted with the commercial spirit, and were more in the position of labourers than this
man, yet lived almost dignified lives of simple and self-supporting contentment. Of some of
them the middle-aged people of to-day still talk, not without respect.

But in writing of such folk I have most emphatically to use the past tense; for although a
sort of afterglow from the old civilization still rests upon the village character, it is fast
fading out, and it has not much resemblance to the genuine thing of half a century ago. The
direct light has gone out of the people's life--the light, the meaning, the guidance. They
have no longer a civilization, but only some derelict habits left from that which has gone.
And it is no wonder if some of those habits seem now stupid, ignorant, objectionable; for the
fitness has departed from them, and left them naked. They were acquired under a different set
of circumstances--a set of circumstances whose disappearance dates from, and was caused by,
the enclosure of the common.

IX

THE NEW THRIFT

One usually thinks of the enclosure of a common as a procedure which takes effect immediately,
in striking and memorable change; yet the event in this village seems to have made no lasting
impression on people's minds. The older folk talk about things that happened "before the common
was enclosed" much as they might say "before the flood," and occasionally they discuss the
history of some allotment or other made under the award; but one hears little from them to
suggest that the fateful ordinance seemed to them a fateful one at the time.

It may be that the stoical village temper is in part accountable for this indifference. As
the arrangement was presumably made over the heads of the people, they doubtless took it in
a fatalistic way as a thing that could not be helped and had better be dismissed from their
thoughts. Were this all, however, I think that I should have heard more of the matter. Had
sudden distress fallen upon the valley, had families been speedily and obviously ruined by
the enclosure, some mention of the fact would surely have reached me. But the truth appears
to be that nothing very definite or striking ensued, to be remembered. The change was hardly
understood, or, at any rate, its importance was not appreciated, by the people concerned.

Perhaps, indeed, its calamitous nature was veiled at first behind some small temporary advantages
which sprang from it. True, I question if the benefits experienced here were equal to those
which are said to have been realized in similar circumstances elsewhere. In other parishes,
where the farmers have been impoverished and the labourers out of work, the latter, at the
enclosure of a common, have sometimes found welcome employment in digging out or fencing in
the boundaries of the new allotments, and in breaking up the fresh ground. So the landowners
say. But here, where there were few men wanting constant labour, the opportunity of work to
do was hardly called for, and the making of boundaries was in many cases neglected. In that
one way, therefore, not many can have derived any profit from the enclosure. On the other hand,
an advantage was really felt, I think, in the opening that arose for building cottages on the
newly-acquired freeholds. Quite a number of cottages seem to date from that period; and I infer
that the opportunity was seized by various men who wished to provide new house-room for themselves,
or for a married son or daughter. They could still go to work almost on the old lines. Perhaps
the recognized price--seventy pounds, it is said to have been, for building a cottage of three
rooms--would have to be exceeded a little, when timbers for floor and roof could no longer
be had for the cutting out of fir-trees on the common; and yet there, after all, were the trees,
inexpensive to buy; and there was the peasant tradition, still unimpaired, to encourage and
commend such enterprise.

There is really little need, however, for these explanations of the people's unconcern at the
disaster which had, in fact, befallen them. The passing of the common seemed unimportant at
the time, not so much because a few short-lived advantages concealed its meaning as because
the real disadvantages were slow to appear. At first the enclosure was rather a nominal event
than an actual one. It had been made in theory; in practice it was deferred. I have just said
that in many cases the boundaries were left unmarked; I may add now that to this day they have
not quite all been defined, although the few spots which remain unfenced are not worthy of
notice. They are to be found only in places where building is impossible; elsewhere all is
now closed in. For it is the recent building boom that has at last caused the enclosure to
take its full effect. Before that began, not more than ten or twelve years ago, there were
abundant patches of heath still left open; and on many a spot where nowadays the well-to-do
have their tennis or their afternoon tea, of old I have seen donkeys peacefully grazing. The
donkeys have had to go, their room being wanted, and not many cottagers can keep a donkey now;
but kept they were, and in considerable numbers, until these late years, in spite of the enclosure.
But if the end could be deferred so long, one may judge how slowly the change began--slowly
and inconspicuously, so that those who saw the beginning could almost ignore it. Even the cows--once
as numerous as the donkeys--were not given up quite immediately, though in a few years they
were all gone, I am told. But long after them, heath for thatching and firing might still be
cut in waste places; fern continued until six or seven years ago to yield litter for pig-sties;
and since these things still seemed to go on almost as well after the enclosure as before it,
how should the people have imagined that their ancient mode of life had been cut off at the
roots, and that it had really begun to die where it stood, under their undiscerning eyes?

Nevertheless, that was the effect. To the enclosure of the common more than to any other cause
may be traced all the changes that have subsequently passed over the village. It was like knocking
the keystone out of an arch. The keystone is not the arch; but, once it is gone, all sorts
of forces, previously resisted, begin to operate towards ruin, and gradually the whole structure
crumbles down. This fairly illustrates what has happened to the village, in consequence of
the loss of the common. The direct results have been perhaps the least important in themselves;
but indirectly the enclosure mattered, because it left the people helpless against influences
which have sapped away their interests, robbed them of security and peace, rendered their knowledge
and skill of small value, and seriously affected their personal pride and their character.
Observe it well. The enclosure itself, I say, was not actually the cause of all this; but it
was the opening, so to speak, through which all this was let in. The other causes which have
been at work could hardly have operated as they have done if the village life had not been
weakened by the changes directly due to the loss of the common.

They consisted--those changes--in a radical alteration of the domestic economy of the cottagers.
Not suddenly, but none the less inevitably, the old thrift--the peasant thrift--which the people
understood thoroughly had to be abandoned in favour of a modern thrift--commercial thrift--which
they understood but vaguely. That was the essential effect of the enclosure, the central change
directly caused by it; and it struck at the very heart of the peasant system.

For note what it involved. By the peasant system, as I have already explained, people derived
the necessaries of life from the materials and soil of their own countryside. Now, so long
as they had the common, the inhabitants of the valley were in a large degree able to conform
to this system, the common being, as it were, a supplement to the cottage gardens, and furnishing
means of extending the scope of the little home industries. It encouraged the poorest labourer
to practise, for instance, all those time-honoured crafts which Cobbett, in his little book
on Cottage Economy, had advocated as the one hope for labourers. The cow-keeping, the bread-making,
the fattening of pigs and curing of bacon, were actually carried on here thirty years after
Cobbett's time, besides other things not mentioned by him, such as turf-cutting on the heath
and wheat-growing in the gardens. But it was the common that made all this possible. It was
only by the spacious "turn-out" which it afforded that the people were enabled to keep cows
and get milk and butter; it was only with the turf-firing cut on the common that they could
smoke their bacon, hanging it in the wide chimneys over those old open hearths where none but
such fuel could be used; and, again, it was only because they could get furze from the common
to heat their bread ovens that it was worth their while to grow a little wheat at home, and
have it ground into flour for making bread. With the common, however, they could, and did,
achieve all this. I am not dealing in supposition. I have mentioned nothing here that I have
not learnt from men who remember the system still flourishing--men who in their boyhood took
part in it, and can tell how the turfs were harvested, and how the pig-litter was got home
and stacked in ricks; men who, if you lead them on, will talk of the cows they themselves watched
over on the heath--two from this cottage, three from that one yonder, one more from Master
Hack's, another couple from Trusler's, until they have numbered a score, perhaps, and have
named a dozen old village names. It all actually happened. The whole system was "in full swing"
here, within living memory. But the very heart of it was the open common.

Accordingly, when the enclosure began to be a fact, when the cottager was left with nothing
to depend upon save his garden alone, as a peasant he was a broken man--a peasant shut out
from his countryside and cut off from his resources. True, he might still grow vegetables,
and keep a pig or two, and provide himself with pork; but there was little else that he could
do in the old way. It was out of the question to obtain most of his supplies by his own handiwork:
they had to be procured, ready-made, from some other source. That source, I need hardly say,
was a shop. So the once self-supporting cottager turned into a spender of money at the baker's,
the coal-merchant's, the provision-dealer's; and, of course, needing to spend money, he needed
first to get it.

The change was momentous, as events have sufficiently proved. In the matter of earning, to
be sure, the difference has appeared rather in the attitude of the people than in the actual
method of going about to get money. To a greater or less extent, most of them were already
wage-earners, though not regularly. If a few had been wont to furnish themselves with money
in true peasant fashion--that is to say, by selling their goods, their butter, or milk, or
pig-meat, instead of their labour--still, the majority had wanted for their own use whatever
they could produce in this way, and had been obliged to sell their labour itself, when they
required money. Wage-earning, therefore, was no new thing in the village; only, the need to
earn became more insistent, when so many more things than before had to be bought with the
wages. Consequently, it had to be approached in a more businesslike, a more commercial, spirit.
Unemployment, hitherto not much worse than a regrettable inconvenience, became a calamity.
Every hour's work acquired a market value. The sense of taking part in time-honoured duties
of the countryside disappeared before the idea--so very important now--of getting shillings
with which to go to a shop; while even the home industries which were still practicable began
to be valued in terms of money, so that a man was tempted to neglect his own gardening if he
could sell his labour in somebody else's garden. Thus undermined, the peasant outlook gave
way, perforce, to that of the modern labourer, and the old attachment to the countryside was
weakened. In all this change of attitude, however, we see only one of those indirect results
of the enclosure of the common which were spoken of above. If the villagers became more mercenary,
it was not because the fencing in of the heaths immediately caused them to become so, but because
it left them helpless to resist becoming so--left them a prey to considerations whose weight
they had previously not so much felt. After all, the new order of things did but intensify
the need of wage-earning; it made no difference in the procedure of it.

But in regard to spending the case was otherwise. Under the old régime, although probably a
small regular expenditure of money had been usual, yet in the main the peasant's expenditure
was not regular, but intermittent. Getting so much food and firing by his own labour, he might
go for weeks without needing more than a few shillings to make up occasional deficiencies.
His purse was subject to no such constant drain as that for which the modern labourer has to
provide. In short, the regular expenses were small, the occasional ones not crushing. But to-day,
when the people can no longer produce for themselves, the proportion has changed. It has swung
round so completely that nearly all the expenses have become regular, while those of the other
sort have wellnigh disappeared. Every week money has to be found, and not only, as of old,
for rent, and boots, and for some bread and flour, but also for butter or margarine, sugar,
tea, bacon or foreign meat if possible, lard, jam, and--in the winter, at least--coal. Even
water is an item of weekly expense; for where the company's water is laid on to a cottage,
there is sixpence a week or so added to the rent. The only important thing which is still not
bought regularly is clothing. The people get their clothes when they can, and when they positively
must.

As a result, the former thrift of the village has been entirely subverted. For earning and
spending are not the whole of economy. There is saving to be considered; and, in consequence
of the turn-over of expenses from the occasional to the regular group, the cottagers have been
obliged to resort to methods of saving specially adapted to the changed conditions. The point
is of extreme importance. Under the old style, a man's chief savings were in the shape of commodities
ready for use, or growing into use. They were, too, a genuine capital, inasmuch as they supported
him while he replaced and increased them. The flitches of bacon, the little stores of flour
and home-made wine, the stack of firing, the small rick of fern or grass, were his savings-bank,
which, while he drew from it daily, he replenished betimes as he planted his garden, and brought
home heath and turf from the common, and minded his pigs and his cow, and put by odd shillings
for occasional need. Notice that putting-by of shillings. It was not the whole, it was only
the completion, of the peasant's thrift. At a pinch he could even do without the money, paying
for what he wanted with a sack of potatoes, or a day's work with his donkey-cart; but a little
money put by was a convenience. When it was wanted, it was wanted in lump sums--ten shillings
now, say, for a little pig; and then fifteen shillings or so in six weeks' time for mending
the donkey-cart, and so on; and, thanks to the real savings in the shape of food and firing
ready for use, the shillings, however come by, could be hoarded up.

But under the new thrift they cannot be so hoarded up; nor, fortunately, are the little lump
sums so necessary as before. The real savings now, the real stores of useful capital, are no
longer in the cottager's home. They are in shops. What the modern labourer chiefly requires,
therefore, is not a little hoard of money lying by, but a regular supply of money, a constant
stream of it, flowing in, to enable him to go to the shops regularly. In a word, he wants an
income--a steady income of shillings. And since his earnings are not steady--since his income
may cease any day, and continue in abeyance for weeks at a time, during which the shops will
be closed against him, his chief economy is directed upon the object of insuring his weekly
income. Most miserably for him, he has never been able to insure it against all reverses. Against
trade depression, which throws him out of work and dries up the stream of money that should
come flowing in, he has no protection. He has none if his employer should go bankrupt, or leave
the neighbourhood, and dismiss him; none against the competition of machinery. Still, the labourers
do as much as they can. Sickness, at least, does not find them unprepared. To cover loss of
wages during sickness, they pay into a benefit society. The more careful, indeed, pay into
two--the Oddfellows or the Foresters, or some such society--and a local "slate-club." I have
known men out of work living on tea and bread, and not much of that, so that they may keep
up their club payments, and be sure of an income if they should fall sick; and I have known
men so circumstanced immediately feel the advantage if sickness should actually fall upon them.

This is the new thrift, which has replaced that of the peasant. I do not say that there is
no other saving--that no little sums are hoarded up; for, in fact, I could name one or two
men who, after illness protracted to the stage when sick-pay from the club is reduced, have
still fought off destitution with the small savings from better times. In most cases, however,
no hoarding is possible. The club takes all the spare money; and the club alone stands between
the labourer and destitution. And let this be clearly understood. At first it looks as if the
member of a club had money invested in his society--money there, instead of perishable goods
at home. Yet, in fact, that is not the case. His payments into the club funds are no investment.
They bring him no profit; they are not a useful capital that can be renewed with interest.
At the Christmas "share-out" he does get back a part of the twenty-six shillings contributed
to the slate-club during the year; but the two pounds a year paid to the benefit society are
his no longer; they cannot be "realized"; they are gone beyond reclaiming. Though he be out
of work and his family starving, he cannot touch the money; to derive any advantage from it
he himself must first fall ill. That is what the modern thrift means to the labourer. It does
nothing to further--on the contrary, it retards--his prosperity; but it helps him in a particular
kind of adversity. It drains his personal wealth away, and leaves him destitute of his capital;
it robs his wife and children of his savings; but in return it makes him one of a brotherhood
which guarantees to him a minimum income for a short time, if he should be out of health.

An oldish man, who had been telling me one evening how they used to live in his boyhood, looked
pensively across the valley when he had done, and so stood for a minute or two, as if trying
to recover his impressions of that lost time. At last, with appearance of an effort to speak
patiently, "Ah," he said, "they tells me times are better now, but I can't see it;" and it
was plain enough that he thought our present times the worse. So far as this valley is concerned
I incline to agree with him, although in general it is a debatable question. On the one hand,
it may be that the things a labourer can buy at a shop for fifteen shillings a week are more
in quantity and variety, if not better in quality, than those which his forefathers could produce
by their own industry; and to that extent the advantage is with the present times. But, on
the other hand, the fifteen shillings are not every week forthcoming; and whereas the old-time
cottager out of work could generally find something profitable to do for himself, the modern
man, having once got his garden into order, stands unprofitably idle.

Perhaps the worst is that, owing to the lowness of their wages, the people have never been
able to give the new thrift a fair trial. After all, they miss the lump sums laid by against
need. If their earnings would ever overtake their expenses and give a little margin, they might
do better; but buying, as they are obliged to do, from hand to mouth, they buy at extravagant
prices. Coal, for instance, which costs me about twenty-six shillings for a ton, costs the
labourer half as much again as that, because he can only pay for a hundredweight or so at a
time. So, too, the boots he can get for four or five shillings a pair are the dearest of all
boots. They wear out in a couple of months or so, and another pair must be bought almost before
another four or five shillings can be spared. In its smaller degree, a still more absurd difficulty
handicaps the people in dealing with their own fruit-crops. To make raspberry or gooseberry
jam should be, you would think, an economy delightful to the cottage women, if only as a piece
of old-fashioned thrift; yet they rarely do it. If they had the necessary utensils, still the
weekly money at their disposal will not run to the purchase of extra firing and sugar. It is
all too little for everyday purposes, and they are glad to eke it out by selling their fruit
for middle-class women to preserve, though in the end they have to buy for their own families
an inferior quality of jam at a far higher price.

Wherever you follow it up, you will find the modern thrift not quite successful in the cottages.
It is not elastic enough; or, rather, the people's means are not elastic enough, and will not
stretch to its demands. There is well-being in it--variety of food, for instance, and comfort
of clothing--as soon as both ends can be made to meet and to lap over a little; but it strains
the small incomes continually to the breaking-point, so that every other consideration has
to give way under it to a pitiful calculation of pence. For the sake of pence the people who
keep fowls sell the eggs, and feed their children on bread and margarine; and, on the same
principle, they do not even seek to produce other things which are well within their power
to produce, but are too luxurious for their means. "'Twouldn't be no use for me to grow strawberries,"
a man explained; "my children'd have 'em." It sounded a strange reason, for to what better
use could strawberries be put? But it shows how tightly the people are bound down by their
commercial conditions. In order to make the Saturday's shopping easier, they must weigh the
shillings and pence value of everything they possess and everything they attempt to do.

These considerations, however, though showing that present times are not good, do not prove
that they are worse than past times. It may be that there was poverty in the valley before
the enclosure of the common quite as severe as there is now; and, so far as concerns mere economics,
that event did but change the mode of the struggle for existence, without greatly affecting
its intensity. People are poor in a different way now, that is all. Hence, in its more direct
results, the loss of the common has not mattered much, and it might be forgotten if those results
were the only ones.

But they are not the only ones. The results have spread from the economic centre outwards until
the whole life of the people has been affected, new influences coming into play which previously
were but little felt. So searching, indeed, has the change been, and so revolutionary, that
anything like a full account of it would be out of the question. The chapters that follow,
therefore, do not pretend to deal with it at all exhaustively; at most they will but draw attention
to a few of its more striking aspects.

X

COMPETITION

When the half-peasant men of the valley began to enter the labour market as avowed wage-earners,
a set of conditions confronted them which we are apt to think of as established by a law of
Nature, but which, in fact, may be almost unknown in a peasant community. For the first time
the importance of a "demand for labour" came home to them. I do not say that it was wholly
a new thing; but to the older villagers it had not been, as it is now to their descendants,
the dominating factor in their struggle for life. On the contrary, in proportion as their labour
was bestowed immediately on productive work for their own uses, the question whether there
was a demand for labour elsewhere did not arise. The common was indifferent; it wanted none
of them. It neither asked them to avail themselves of its resources, nor paid them money for
doing so, nor refused employment to one because another was already engaged there. But to-day,
instead of going for a livelihood to the impartial heath, the people must wait for others to
set them to work. The demand which they supply is their own no longer, and no longer, therefore,
is their living in their own hands. Of all the old families in the village, I think there are
only two left now who have not drifted wholly into this dependent state; but I know numbers
of labourers, often out of work, whose grandfathers were half independent of employers.

In theory, no doubt the advantage ought to be with the present times. Under the new system
a far larger population is able to live in the parish than could possibly have been supported
here under the old; for now, in place of the scanty products of the little valley and the heaths,
the stores of the whole world may be drawn upon by the inhabitants in return for the wages
they earn. Only there is the awkward condition that they must earn wages. Those limitless stores
cannot be approached by the labourer until he is invited--until there is "a demand" for his
labour. Property owners, or capitalists, standing between him and the world's capital, are
able to pick and choose between him and his neighbours as the common never did, and to decide
which of them shall work and have some of the supplies.

And as a consequence of this picking and choosing, competition amongst the labourers seeking
to be employed has become the accepted condition of getting a living in the village, and it
is to a great extent a new condition. Previously there was little room for anything of the
kind. The old thrift lent itself to co-operation rather. I admit that I have never heard of
any system being brought into the activities of this valley, such as I witnessed lately in
another part of England, where the small farmers, supplying an external market, and having
no hired labour, were helping one another to get their corn harvested, all being solicitous
for their neighbours' welfare, and giving, not selling, their labour. Here the conditions hardly
required such wholesale co-operation as that; but in lesser matters both kindliness and economy
would counsel the people to be mutually helpful, and there is no reason to doubt that the counsel
was taken. Those who had donkey-carts would willingly bring home turfs for those who had none,
in return for help with their own turf-cutting. The bread-ovens, I know, were at the disposal
of others besides the owners. At pig-killing, at thatching, at clearing out wells (where, in
fact, I have seen the thing going on), the people would put themselves at one another's service.
They still do so in cases where there is no question of earning money for a living. And if
the spirit of friendly co-operation is alive now, when it can so rarely be put in practice,
one may readily suppose that it was fairly vigorous fifty years ago.

But no spirit of co-operation may now prompt one wage-earner to ask, or another to proffer,
assistance in working for wages. As well might one shopkeeper propose to wait on another's
customers for him. Employers would not have it; still less would those who are employed. A
man may be fainting at his job, but none dare help him. He would resent, he would fear, the
proposal. The job is, as it were, his property; as long as he can stand and see he must hold
it against all comers, because in losing hold he loses his claim upon the world's supplies
of the necessaries of life.

In spite of all the latent good-will, therefore, and in spite of the fact that the cottagers
are all on the same social level, intimacies do not thrive amongst them. If there was formerly
any parochial sentiment in the village, any sense of community of interest, it has all been
broken up by the exigencies of competitive wage-earning, and each family stands by itself,
aloof from all the others. The interests clash. Men who might be helpful friends in other circumstances
are in the position of rival tradesmen competing for the patronage of customers. Not now may
their labour be a bond of friendship between them; it is a commodity with a market value, to
be sold in the market. Hence, just as in trade, every man for himself is the rule with the
villagers; just as in trade, the misfortune of one is the opportunity of another. All the maxims
of competitive commerce apply fully to the vendor of his own labour. There must be "no friendship
in business"; the weakest must go to the wall. Each man is an individualist fighting for his
own hand; and to give as little as he can for as much as he can get is good policy for him,
with precisely the same limitations as those that govern the trading of the retail merchant,
tormented with the conflicting necessities of overcharging and underselling.

It follows that the villagers are a prey to jealousy and suspicion--not, perhaps, when they
meet at the public-house or on the road, but in the presence of employers, when any question
of employment arises. At such times one would think that labouring men have no critics so unkindly
as their own neighbours and equals. It is true those who are in constant work are commended;
but if you ask about a man who is "on the market" and open for any work that may be going,
his rivals are unlikely to answer generously. "So-and-So?... H'm!... He do's his best; but
he don't seem to get through, somehow." "Old Who-is-it? Asked he to come and help me, have
ye? Well, you'll judge for yourself; but I don't hardly fancy he'll suit." Or, again: "Well,
we all knows how 'tis with What's-his-name. I don't say but what he keeps on work right enough;
but he'll have to jump about smarter 'n what I've ever knowed 'n, if he's to work 'long o'
me." So, too often, and sometimes in crueller terms, I have heard efficient labourers speak
of their neighbours. Certainly it is not all envy. An active man finds it penance to work with
a slow one, and worse than penance; for his own reputation may suffer, if his own output of
work should be diminished by the other's fault. That neighbour of mine engaged at hop-drying
doubtless had good grounds for exasperation with the helper sent into the kiln, when he complained
to the master: "Call that a man you sent me? If that's what you calls a man, I'd sooner you
let me send for my old woman! Blamed if she wouldn't do better than that feller!" Detraction
like this, no doubt, is often justified; but when it becomes the rule, the only possible inference
is that an instinctive jealousy prompts men to it, in instinctive self-preservation.

Yet there are depths of dishonour--depths not unknown amongst employers--into which the village
labourers will rarely condescend to plunge, acute though the temptation may be. Not once have
I met with an instance of one man deliberately scheming to get another man's job away from
him. A labourer unable to keep up with his work will do almost anything to avoid having a helper
thrust upon him--he fears the introduction of a possible rival into his preserve. But this
is not the same thing as pushing another man out; it has no resemblance to the behaviour of
the hustling capitalist, who opens his big business with the definite intention of capturing
trade away from little businesses. That is a course to which my impoverished neighbours will
not stoop. The nearest thing to it which I have known was the case of those men mentioned in
an earlier chapter, who applied for Bettesworth's work during his last illness. They came,
however, believing the place to be vacant; and one and all, with a sincerity I never doubted,
deprecated the idea of desiring to take it away from him. In fact, the application was distasteful
to them. Nothing, I believe, would have prevailed upon them to make it, short of that hunger
for constant employment which many of the men feel now, under their new competitive thrift.
That they should have been scrupulous at all was to their credit. All their circumstances constrain
the people to be selfish, secret about their hopes, swift to be first in the field where a
chance occurs. And it is surprising how vigilant a lookout is kept, and how wide a district
it covers. By what routes the news of new employment travels I do not know, but travel it does,
fast and far. Men rise early and walk many miles to be before others at some place where they
have heard of work to be had; and one gets the impression, sometimes, of a population silently
but keenly watching to see what opportunity of well-being may suddenly fall to them, not in
general, but individually.

Do what they will to be neighbourly, competition for the privilege of earning wages separates
them sooner or later. There were two men I knew who maintained a sort of comradeship in work
during several years, so that one of them would not take a job unless there was room for the
other, and if either was paid off, the other left with him. They were amongst the ablest labourers
in the parish, used to working long hours at high pressure, and indifferent to what they did,
provided that the pay was good. I heard of them from time to time--now at railway work, now
at harvesting, now helping where a bridge was being built, and so on. It was the depression
of the winter of 1908-09 that finally broke up their comradeship. During those miserable months
even these two were unemployed, and went short of food at times; and now they are working separately--competing
one against the other, in fact.

XI

HUMILIATION

Still more than the relations of the villagers with their own kind their relations with other
sorts of people have suffered change under the new thrift. To just that extent to which the
early inhabitants of the valley were peasants, they formed, as it were, a separate group, careless
of the outer world and its concerns. They could afford to ignore it, and to be ignored by it.
To them, so well suited with their own outlook and customs, it was a matter of small importance,
though all England should have other views than theirs, and other manners. And the outer world,
on its side, was equally indifferent. It left the villagers to go their own queer way, and
recognized--as it does in the case of other separate groups of folk, such as fishermen or costermongers--that
what seemed singular in them was probably justified by the singularity of their circumstances.
Nobody supposed that they were a wrong or a regrettable type who ought to be "done good to"
or reformed. They belonged to their own set. They were English, of course; but they were outside
the ordinary classifications of English society.

Even towards those of them who went out of the valley to earn wages this was still the attitude.
They went out as peasants, and were esteemed because they had the ability of peasants. In much
the same way as country folk on the Continent take their country produce into town markets
the men of this valley took, into the hop-grounds and fields of the neighbouring valley, or
into its old-fashioned streets and stable yards, their toughness, their handiness, their intimate
understanding of country crafts; and, returning home in the evening, they slipped back again
into their natural peasant state, without any feeling of disharmony from the day's employment.

There was no reason why it should be otherwise. Although, at work, they had come into contact
with people unlike themselves in some ways, the contrast was not of such a kind that it disheartened
or seemed to disgrace them. At the time of the enclosure of the common, a notable development,
certainly, was beginning amongst the employing classes, but it had not then proceeded far.
Of course the day of the yeoman farmer was almost done; and with it there had disappeared some
of that equality which permitted wage-earning men to be on such easy terms with their masters
as one hears old people describe. No longer, probably, would a farmer take a nickname from
his men, or suffer them to call his daughters familiarly by their Christian names; and no longer
did master and man live on quite the same quality of food, or dress in the same sort of clothes.
Nevertheless the distinction between employers and employed--between the lower middle-class
and the working-class--was not nearly so marked fifty years ago as it has since become. The
farmers, for their part, were still veritable country folk, inheritors themselves of a set
of rural traditions nearly akin to those of the peasant squatters in this valley. And even
the townsmen, who were the only others who could give employment to these villagers, were extremely
countrified in character. In their little sleepy old town--not half its present size, and the
centre then of an agricultural and especially a hop-growing district--people were intimately
interested in country things. No matter what a man's trade or profession--linen-draper, or
saddler, or baker, or lawyer, or banker--he found it worth while to watch the harvests, and
to know a great deal about cattle and sheep, and more than a great deal about hops. Some of
the tradesmen were, in fact, growing wealthy as hop-planters; and one and all identified themselves
with the outdoor industries of the neighbourhood. And though some grew rich, and changed their
style of living, they did not change their mental equipment, but continued (as I myself remember)
more "provincial" than many a farmer is nowadays. All their thoughts, all their ideas, could
be quite well expressed in the West Surrey and Hampshire dialect, which the townspeople, like
the village folk, continued to speak.

Meanwhile, the work required by these employers ran, as yet, very much on antiquated lines.
Perhaps it was that the use of machinery had received a setback, twenty years earlier, by the
"Swing Riots," of which a few memories still survive; at any rate haymaking, harvesting, threshing--all
the old tasks, indeed--were still done by hand; thatch had not gone out of use for barns and
stables; nor, for house-roofs, had imported slates quite taken the place of locally made tiles.
The truth is, the town, in its more complex way, had not itself passed far beyond the primitive
stage of dependence on local resources and local skill. It is really surprising how few were
the materials, or even the finished goods, imported into it at that time. Clothing stuffs and
metals were the chief of them. Of course the grocers (not "provision merchants" then) did their
small trade in sugar and coffee, and tea and spices; there was a tinware shop, an ironmonger's,
a wine-merchant's; and all these necessarily were supplied from outside. But, on the other
hand, no foreign meat or flour, or hay or straw or timber, found their way into the town, and
comparatively few manufactured products from other parts of England. Carpenters still used
the oak and ash and elm of the neighbourhood, sawn out for them by local sawyers: the wheelwright,
because iron was costly, mounted his cartwheels on huge axles fashioned by himself out of the
hardest beech; the smith, shoeing horses or putting tyres on wheels, first made the necessary
nails for himself, hammering them out on his own anvil. So, too, with many other things. Boots,
brushes, earthenware, butter and lard, candles, bricks--they were all of local make; cheese
was brought back from Weyhill Fair in the waggons which had carried down the hops; in short,
to an extent hard to realize, the town was independent of commerce as we know it now, and looked
to the farms and forests and the claypits and coppices of the neighbourhood for its supplies.
A leisurely yet steady traffic in rural produce therefore passed along its streets, because
it was the life-centre, the heart, of its own countryside; and the village labourer, going
in and out upon his town tasks, or even working all day in some secluded yard behind the street,
still found a sort of homeliness in the materials he handled, and was in touch with the ideas
and purposes of his employer.

Owing to these same circumstances, the wage-earners of that day enjoyed what their descendants
would consider a most blissful freedom from anxiety. On the one side, the demand for labour
was fairly steady. It was the demand of a community not rapidly growing in numbers, nor yet
subject to crazes and sudden changes of a fashion--a community patiently, nay, cheerfully,
conservative in its ambitions, not given to rash speculation, but contented to go plodding
on in its time-honoured and modest well-being. What the townsfolk wanted one year they wanted
the next, and so onwards with but quiet progress. And as the demand for labour was thus steady,
so on the other side was the supply of it. A dissatisfied employer could not advertise, then,
in a London daily paper, and get scores of men applying to him for work at a day's notice;
nor, indeed, would strangers have been able to do the work in many cases, so curiously was
its character determined by local conditions. Besides, town opinion, still prejudiced by memories
of the old Poor Law, would have viewed with extreme disfavour, had such an experiment ever
been tried, the importation of men and families whose coming must surely result in pauperism
for somebody, and in a consequent charge upon the rates.

So, putting together the leading factors--namely, a steady demand for countrified labour, a
steady supply of it, and an employing class full of country ideas--we get a rough idea of the
conditions of wage-earning in the neighbourhood, when the folk of this valley, fenced out from
their common, were forced to look to wage-earning as their sole means of living. That the conditions
were ideal it would be foolish to suppose; but that, for villagers at least, they had certain
advantages over present conditions is not to be denied. Especially we may note two unpleasing
features of modern wage-earning which had not then made their appearance.

In the first place, the work itself was interesting to do, was almost worth doing for its own
sake, when it still called for much old-world skill and knowledge, and when the praises of
the master were the praises of an expert who well knew what he was talking about. On these
terms, it was no mean pleasure that the able labouring men had in their labour. They took a
pride in it--as you may soon discern if you will listen to the older men talking. I have heard
them boast, as of a triumph, of the fine flattering surprise of some master, when he had come
to look at their day's work, and found it more forward, or better done, than he had dared to
hope. The words he said are treasured up with delight, and repeated with enthusiasm, after
many years.

As for the other point, it has already been touched upon. Harsh the employers might be--more
callous by far, I believe, than they are now; but in their general outlook they were not, as
yet, so very far removed from the men who worked for them. Their ideas of good and bad were
such as the peasant labourer from this valley could understand; and master and man were not
greatly out of touch in the matter of civilization. It made a vast difference to the labourer's
comfort. He might be hectored, bullied, cheated even, but he hardly felt himself degraded too.
It was not a being out of another sphere that oppressed him; not one who despised him, not
one whose motives were strange and mysterious. The cruellest oppression was inhuman rather
than unhuman--the act, after all, only of a more powerful, not of a more dazzling, personage--so
that it produced in him no humiliating sense of belonging to an inferior order of creation.
And, of course, oppression was exceptional. Employers were obliged to get on comfortably with
their work-people, by the conditions governing the supply of labour. I have in my mind several
cases mentioned to me by people long ago dead, in which men for various faults (drunkenness
in one instance, theft in another) were dismissed from their employment again and again, yet
as often reinstated, because the master found it easier to put up with their faults than to
do without their skill. It may be inferred, therefore, that ordinary men got along fairly well
with their masters in the ordinary course.

This state of things, however, has gradually passed away. As I shall show in another chapter,
the labourer may now take but little interest and but little pride in his work; but the change
in that direction is not more pronounced than is the change in the relations between the villagers
and the employing classes. It is a cruel evil that the folk of the valley have suffered there.
No longer are they a group whose peculiarities are respected while their qualities are esteemed.
In their intercourse with the outer world they have become, as it were, degraded, humiliated;
and when they go out of the valley to earn wages, it is to take the position of an inferior
and almost servile race. The reason is that the employing class, as a whole, has moved on,
leaving the labourers where they were, until now a great gulf divides them. Merely in relative
wealth, if that were all, the difference has widened enormously. Seventy or eighty years ago,
I have heard say, the shopkeeper in the town who had as much as a hundred pounds put by was
thought a rich man. There are now many artisans there whose savings exceed that figure, while
the property of the townsmen who employ labour is, of course, valued often in thousands. The
labouring people alone remain without savings, as poor as their grandfathers when the common
was first enclosed.

But it is a question of civilization far more than of wealth that now divides the employing
classes from the employed. The former have discarded much of their provincialism; they are
astir with ambitions and ideas at which the old town would have stood aghast. In beliefs and
in tastes they are a new people. They have new kinds of knowledge; almost one may say that
they use their brains in new ways; and the result is that between them and the village labourer
mutual understanding has broken down. How far the separation has gone is betrayed in the fact
that the countrified speech, common to village and town fifty years ago, has become a subject
of derision to the town-people, forgetful of their own ancestry. So, in field and street and
shop, the two kinds of folk meet face to face, not with an outlook, and hardly with a speech,
which both can appreciate, but like distinct races, the one dominant, the other subject.

And, all but inevitably, the breach is daily widened by the conditions on which the new civilization
of the employing class is based. For, with all its good features, it is rather a barbaric civilization,
in this sense--that it is more a matter of fineness in possessions than in personal qualities.
It cannot be maintained without a costly apparatus of dress and furniture, and of drudges to
do the dirty work; and consequently it demands success in that competitive thrift which gives
a good money-income. Without that the employers are nowhere. They are themselves driven very
hard; they must make things pay; to secure the means of civilization for themselves, they must
get them out of the labourer with his eighteen shillings a week. In vain, therefore, are they
persuaded by their newest ideas to see in him an Englishman as good as themselves: they may
assent to the principle, but in practice it is as imperative as ever to make him a profitable
drudge. Accordingly, those relations of mutual approval which were not uncommon of old between
master and man cannot now be maintained. If it is impossible for the village folk to understand
the town folk, it is equally impossible for the town folk to understand the village folk. They
cannot afford to understand. The peasant outlook is out of date--a cast-off thing; and for
cleaving to it the labourer is despised. If he could be civilized, and yet be made to "pay,"
that is what would best suit the middle-classes; and that is really the impossible object at
which they aim, when they try to "do him good." They want to make him more like themselves,
and yet keep him in his place of dependence and humiliation.

It must be said that amongst a section of the employers there is no desire to "do good" even
on these terms. While the labouring people, on their side, betray little or no class feeling
of hostility towards employers, the converse is not true, but jealousy, suspicion, some fear--the
elements of bitter class-war, in fact--frequently mark the attitude of middle-class people
towards the labouring class. It seems to be forgotten that the men are English. One hears them
spoken of as an alien and objectionable race, worth nothing but to be made to work. The unemployment
which began to beggar so many of my village neighbours after the South African War was actually
welcomed by numerous employers in this district. "It will do the men good," people said to
me; "it will teach them their place. They were getting too independent." The election of 1906,
when the Conservative member for the division was unseated, brought out a large crop of similarly
malevolent expressions. "Look at the class of people who have the vote," said a disgusted villa
lady, with her nose in the air. "Only the low, ignorant people wear those colours," another
lady assured her little boy, whose eyes preferred "those colours" to the favours in his own
buttonhole. More pointed was the overheard remark of a well-to-do employer, irritated by the
election crowds in the town: "As my wife says, it was bad enough before. The children of the
lower classes used, as it was, to take the inside of the pavement, and we had to walk on the
kerb. But now we shall be driven out into the road."

I would not mention these things were it not for their significance to the village folk. By
becoming wage-earners solely, the villagers have fallen into the disfavour of an influential
section of the middle-classes, most of whom have no other desire than to keep them in a sufficient
state of servility to be useful. How else is one to interpret that frequent middle-class outcry
against education: "What are we going to do for servants?" or how else the grudging attitude
taken up towards the few comforts that cottage people are able to enjoy? I listened lately
to two men talking of "Tariff Reform"--one of them a commercial traveller, lofty in his patriotism.
When mention was made of some old man's tale, that in his boyhood be rarely tasted meat, "unless
a sheep died," the commercial traveller commented scornfully, "And now every working man in
the kingdom thinks he must have meat twice a day"--as though such things ought not to be in
the British Empire. The falsehood of the remark enhanced its significance. It was the sort
of thing to say in hotel-bars, or in the offices of commerce--the sort of thing that goes down
well with employers. It indicated that the animus of which I am speaking is almost a commonplace.
In truth, I have heard it expressed dozens of times, in dozens of ways, yet always with the
same implied suggestion, that the English labouring classes are a lower order of beings, who
must be treated accordingly.

And yet employers of this type, representing the wealth, perhaps, but by no means the culture,
of modern civilization, are, in fact, nearer to the unlettered labourers in their outlook,
and are therefore by far less embarrassing to them, than those of another and kindlier type
which figures largely in this parish to-day. Those people for whom the enclosure of the common,
as it has turned out, made room in the valley--I mean the well-to-do residents--employ local
labour, not for profit at all, but to minister to their own pleasure, in their gardens and
stables, and the majority of them would be genuinely glad to be helpful to their poorer neighbours.
The presence of poverty reproaches them; their consciences are uneasy; or, better still, some
kind of regard, some kind of respect, goes out from them towards the toilsome men and the over-burdened
women whom, in fact, they have displaced. Yet compassion is not the same thing as understanding,
and the cottagers know very well that even their best friends of this kind have neither the
knowledge nor the taste to appreciate them in their own way. Sympathy for their troubles--yes,
there is that; but sympathy with their enjoyments hardly any property-owner dreams of cultivating;
and this is the more true the more the property-owner has been polished by his own civilization.
A lady long resident here was quite surprised to hear from me, some months ago, that the cottagers
are ardent gardeners. "Dear me!" she said; "I had no idea of it." And yet one of the ablest
men of the parish had tended her own garden for years.

Hence it is in their intercourse with these--the well-meaning and cultivated--that the villagers
are most at a loss. In those embittered employers who merely seek to make money out of him
the labourer does at least meet with some keen recognition of his usefulness; but with these
others he is all at sea. Non-introspective, a connoisseur of garden crops and of pig-sties,
and of saved-up seeds; cunning to understand the "set" of spade or hoe, and the temper of scythe
and fag-hook; jealous of the encroachment of gravelled walk or evergreen hedge upon the useful
soil; an expert in digging and dunging--he is very well aware that the praises of the villa-people
employing him are ignorant praises. His best skill is, after all, overlooked. The cunning of
his craft excites in them none of the sympathy of a fellow-expert, and is but poorly rewarded
by their undiscriminating approval. At the same time, the things which these people require
of him--the wanton things they ask him to do with the soil, levelling it to make lawns, wasting
it upon shrubberies and drives, while they fence-in the heath patches and fence-out the public--prove
to him more fully than any language can do that they put a different sort of value upon the
countryside from its old value, and that they care not a straw for the mode of life that was
his before they came here. All their ways are eloquent of condemnation of his tastes. And yet
again, while his old skill fails to be understood, and his old outlook to be appreciated, he
finds that the behaviour preferred in him is oftener than not a behaviour which his forefathers
would have thought silly, to say the least--a finikin, fastidious behaviour, such as he would
scorn to practise at home. Thus in all ways the employers most conscientiously humane are those
who can least avoid, in their tastes and their whole manner of living, snubbing him and setting
him down in an inferior place. They cannot help it, now that they have thrust themselves upon
him as neighbours. The more they interest themselves in him, the more glaringly is the difference
which separates themselves from him brought out.

Whether, if the common had remained open, the villagers could still have held aloof, at this
time of day, from the movements of the outer world is a question not worth discussion. The
enclosure was brought to pass; the keystone was knocked out of the arch; and here are some
of the indirect consequences. From a position in which the world's distinctions of class and
caste were hardly noticed--a position which was, so to speak, an island of refuge, where self-respect
could be preserved in preserving the old rough peasant ways--the valley folk have been forced
into such relations with the world outside the valley as we have seen. They are no longer a
separate set, unclassified, but a grade has been assigned to them in the classification of
society at large, and it is wellnigh the lowest grade of all, for only the pauper and criminal
classes are below them. In this sense, therefore, they are a "degraded" people, though by no
fault of their own. Amongst "the masses" is where they are counted. Moreover, since they are
now, as we have seen, competing against one another for the right to live, none of the concessions
are made to them now that were of old made to the group of them, but they count, and are judged,
individually, amongst the millions of the English proletariat. "Inferiority" has come into
their lives; it is expected of them to treat almost everybody else as a superior person. But
the cruellest indignity of all is that, although we regard them as inferiors, we still look
to them to admire and live up to our standards; and they are to conform to our civilization,
yet without the income it requires or the social recognition it should secure. And if they
will not do this willingly, then shall they be coerced, or at least kept in order, by "temperance"
and other "reforming" legislation, and by the police.

XII

THE HUMILIATED

The effects of this "inferiority" which has been thrust upon the villagers are not exactly
conspicuous in any particular direction. As it has been shown already, the people themselves
seem almost unaware of any grievance in the matter, the change having come upon them too gradually
for it to be sharply felt. They bear no malice against their employers. You would hardly learn,
from anything that they consciously say or do, that in becoming so humiliated they have been
hurt in their feelings, or have found it necessary to change their habits.

Indeed, the positive alteration in their manners, by which I mean the adoption of new ways
in place of old ones, has probably not amounted to a great deal. I admit that I have no means
of estimating how much it does amount to. During fifty years, in which every cottager must
now and then have become aware of constraint put upon him or her by the superior attitude of
the employing class, it is quite possible that there have been innumerable small concessions
and adaptations of manner, and that these have accumulated into a general change which would
surprise us if it could be measured. But I incline to think that the effects of class-pressure
have been chiefly negative; that, while employers have been adopting new modes of life, all
that has happened to the labouring folk here in the valley is that this or that habit, found
inexpedient at last, has been quietly dropped. A sort of reserve in the village temper, a want
of gaiety, a subdued air--this, which one cannot help observing, is probably the shadow cast
upon the people from the upraised middle-class. It looks suggestive, too. Yet, upon examining
it, one fails to find in it any definite token that would show exactly how and where the village
temper has been touched, or in what light "superior" persons are regarded in the cottages.
The people appear enigmatic. They keep their own counsel. Whether they are bewildered or amused
at the behaviour of employers, or alarmed or embittered by it, or actually indifferent to it,
no sign escapes them when members of the employing class are by.

In these circumstances, it is instructive to turn aside for a while from the grown-up people
of the village, and to consider their children; because the children do not learn about the
employing class by direct intercourse, but derive from their parents such ideas as they have
of what is safe to do, and what is proper, where employing people are concerned. As soon as
this truth is realized, a curious significance appears in some characteristic habits of the
village school boys and girls. The boys, especially, deserve remark. That they are in general
"rough," "uncivilized," I suppose might go without saying. It might also go without saying,
were it not that the comparison turns out to be useful, that in animal spirits, physical courage,
love of mischief and noise, they are at least a match for middle-class boys who go to the town
grammar-school. I wish I could say that they have an equally good sense of "playing the game,"
an equally strong esprit de corps, and so on. Unfortunately, these traditions have hardly reached
the village school as yet, and perhaps will not easily make their way there, amongst the children
of parents whom the struggle for life compels to be so suspicious and jealous. The question
is, however, beside the point now. Viewed without prejudice, the village boys must be thought
quite as good material as any other English boys; you can see that there is the making of strong
and brave men in them. With similar chances they would not be inferior in any respect to the
sons of the middle classes.

But under existing conditions the two sorts of boys develop some curious differences of habit.
Where those from middle-class homes are self-possessed, those from the labourers' cottages
are not merely shy, not merely uncouth and lubberly; they grow furtive, suspicious, timid as
wild animals, on the watch for a chance to run. Audacious enough at bird's-nesting, sliding,
tree-climbing, fighting, and impertinent enough towards people of their own kind, they quail
before the first challenge of "superiority." All aplomb goes from them then. It is distressing
to see how they look: with an expression of whimpering rebellion, as though the superior person
had unhuman qualities, not to be reckoned on--as though there were danger in his presence.
An incident of a few years ago, very trumpery in itself, displayed to me in the sharpest distinctness
the contrast between the two orders of boys in this respect. In the hedge which parts my garden
from the lane there is a nut-tree, too tempting to all boys when the nuts are ripe. At that
season one hears whispered and exclamatory confabulations going on in the lane, and then large
stones go crashing up into the tree, falling back sometimes within the hedge, where there is
a bit of grass and a garden seat. Occasionally, playing the absurd part of irate property-owner,
I have gone to the gate near by to drive off the offenders, but have opened it only in time
to see a troop of urchins, alarmed by the click of the gate-latch, scurrying away like rabbits
round the bend of the lane. One Sunday afternoon, however, when I looked out after a stone
had fallen nearly on my head, it was to find two boys calmly waiting for me to approach them.
Their school caps showed them to be two boys of the grammar-school. The interview went comically.
Upon being told crossly that they were a nuisance, the boys apologized--an act which seemed
to put me in the wrong. In my annoyance at that, I hinted ironically that, in fact, I was a
benevolent person, quite willing to admit boys inside the hedge to pick up nuts, if nuts they
really must have. Then I turned away. To my astonishment, they took me at my word, followed
me into the garden, and calmly began to pick up nuts; while I withdrew, discomfited. I have
since smiled to think of the affair; but I recall it now with more interest, for the sake of
the contrast it affords between middle-class boys and labouring-class boys in exactly similar
circumstances. Where the former behave confidently, because they feel safe, the latter are
overtaken by panic, and run to cover.

In this light another curious fact about the village boys gains in significance, supposing
it to be indeed a fact. From the nature of the case, proof is not possible, but I have a strong
impression that, excepting to go to the town, the boys of the village rarely, if ever, stray
into neighbouring parishes, or more than a few hundred yards away from their parents' homes.
One exception must be noted. In the lonely and silent fir-woods, which begin in the next valley
and stretch away over ridge and dell for some miles from south-east to south-west, one sometimes
comes upon a group of village children--little boys and girls together--filling sacks with
fir-cones, and pushing an old perambulator to carry the load. But these are hardly voluntary
expeditions; and the boys are always very small ones, while the girls are in charge. The bigger
boys, of from ten to thirteen years old, do not go into the woods. They play in the roads and
pathways, or on the corners of unused land, and as a rule within sight or call of home. I have
never seen any of them, as I have occasionally seen middle-class boys from the town, rambling
far afield in the outlying country, and my belief is that they would be considerably scared
to find themselves in such unfamiliar scenes.

Assuming that I am right, yet another contrast presents itself. It was in this very neighbourhood
that William Cobbett, as a little boy, played off upon the huntsman that trick of revenge which
he bragged about in after-life. For five or six miles across country, over various streams,
through woods and heaths and ploughed upland fields, he made his way all alone, dragging his
red herring, perfectly confident in himself, never at a loss to know where he was, but thoroughly
familiar with the lie of the land most suitable for his game. Of course, not many boys are
Cobbetts. Yet many of the village boys, even now, would be his match at other games. For here,
on the shelving sand-banks beside the stream, I have seen them enjoying rough-and-tumble romps
like those which the little Cobbett lived to think the best part of his education; and they
do it with a recklessness which even he can scarce have surpassed. But in getting about the
country they do not so much as begin to emulate him. Of course, it is true that now they have
to spend their days in school; true, too, that the enclosures of land throughout the neighbourhood
have made wandering less easy in our times; nevertheless, within a few miles there are woods
and heath-lands in plenty for adventurous boys, as those of the middle-class are aware; yet
those of the village never risk the adventure. I can but infer that they are afraid of something,
and a moment's thought discloses what they fear. Just as in meddling with my nut-tree, so everywhere
they are in danger of trouble with people of the propertied or employing kind; and behind these
people stands the policeman, and behind the policeman that dim object of dread called "a summons."
This it is that keeps the village children within the bounds familiar to them, where they know
who is who, and what property belongs to which owner, and how far they may risk doing mischief,
and round what corners they may scamper into safety.

The caution they display is not unnecessary. Somehow, middle-class boys do not get into trouble
with the law; but it happens not infrequently that a few little villagers are "pulled up" before
a magistrate for trivial acts of mischief, and if the worst punishment inflicted upon them
is a shilling fine and costs, which their parents pay, that is enough to make "a summons" a
very dreadful thing to a little boy. Out of eighteen shillings a week, his father cannot afford
"a shilling and costs" for a piece of mischief, as the little boy is but too likely to be shown.

Children's memories are short, however, and it takes more than an occasional punishment of
two or three to inspire in them all a timorousness so instinctive in character as that of these
village boys. At the back of it there must be a more constant and pervasive influence. And,
to come to the point at last, I think that the boys are swayed, unwittingly, by an attitude
in the grown-up people with whom they live--an attitude of habitual wariness, not to say fear,
in regard to everything connected with property and employers. This is what makes the timidity
of the village urchins interesting. We may discern in it the expression of a feeling prevalent
throughout the cottages--an unreasoned but convinced distrust of propertied folk, and a sense
of being unprotected and helpless against their privileges and power. Here, accordingly, is
one direction in which class distinction has seriously affected the villagers. It would be
an exaggeration to say that they feel like outlaws; but they are vaguely aware of constraint
imposed upon them by laws and prejudices which are none too friendly to people of their kind.
One divines it in their treatment of the village policeman. There is probably no lonelier man
in the parish than the constable. Of course he meets with civility, but his company is avoided.
One hears him mentioned in those same accents of grudging caution which the villagers use in
speaking of unfriendly property-owners, as though he belonged to that alien caste. The cottagers
feel that they themselves are the people whom he is stationed in the valley to watch.

They feel it; nor can it be denied that there is some excuse for the feeling. It is true that
they far outnumber the employers, so that, other things being equal, from their more numerous
ranks there would naturally come a larger number of offenders against the law. But other things
are not equal. The proportion is not kept. Anyone who studies the police-court reports in the
local papers will see that, apart from cases of technical offence, like riding a bicycle on
the footpath, or keeping a dog without a licence, practically all the proceedings are taken
in defence of the privileges and prejudices of the employing classes against the employed classes.
Clearly the village idea is not wholly wrong. In theory, the policeman represents the general
public; in practice, he stands for middle-class decorum and the rights of property; and what
the people say is roughly true--there is one law for the rich, and another for the poor.

But it is only roughly true, and one must get it a little more exact to appreciate the position
in which the labouring-folk stand. I am not disposed to say anything here against the administration
of the law by the justices, when offenders are brought before them; but in the choice or detection
of offenders I must point out that a great deal of respect of persons is shown. Remember what
that old man said, who would have liked to see the fir-woods go up in flames: "'Tis all fenced
in, and now if you looks over the fence you be locked up for it." That was an exaggeration,
of course--a sort of artistic licence, a piece of oratory; yet for him the assertion held more
than a grain of truth. The case is that of the two sorts of boys over again. Where a middle-class
man may take his Sunday walk securely, risking nothing worse than being civilly turned back
by a game-keeper, these village men dare not go, unless they are prepared to answer a summons
for "trespassing for an unlawful purpose," or "in search of game." Let it be admitted that
the unlawful purpose is sometimes proved; at least, the trespassers are occasionally found
to have rabbit-wires concealed about their persons. The remarkable thing, however, is that
they should have been searched in order to make this discovery. The searching may be legal,
for all that I know; yet I do not seem to see a middle-class man--a shopkeeper from the town,
or any employer of labour--submitting to the process, as the cowed labouring man apparently
does. It will be said that the middle-class man is in no fear of such an outrage, because he
is not suspect. But that is conceding the greater part of what I wish to demonstrate. Rightly
or wrongly, the labouring man is suspect. A distinction of caste is made against him. The law,
which pretends to impartiality, sets him in a lower and less privileged place than his employers;
and he knows it. In alleging that he might not look over a fence without being locked up for
it my old acquaintance merely overstated a palpable truth. People of his rank--cottage people,
labouring people--do, indeed, not dare to wander in country places anywhere off the public roads.

Much more might be said on the same lines. Whether inevitably or no, at all events it happens
that the march of respectability gives, to regulations which may be quite proper in themselves,
a very strong appearance of being directed against the poorer working people. No doubt it is
right enough that the brawling of the "drunk and disorderly" on the highroads should be checked;
the public interest demands it; yet the impression conveyed is that the regulations are enforced
more for the pleasure of property-owners than anybody else; that, in fact, middle-class respectability
has, so to speak, made this law especially with a view to keeping the working classes in order.
I am not urging that in this there is any substantial grievance; the offence is rarely committed
by others than labourers, and by them too often. Yet it is well known that, while a labourer
roystering along the road is pounced upon and locked up, an employer the worse for drink is
shepherded home from his hotel by the police, and the affair hushed up. From circumstances
like these--and they are very common--a suspicion is bred in cottage people that they are not
in good odour with the authorities. The law rather tolerates than befriends them. They are
not wanted, are not regarded as equal fellow-citizens with the well-to-do, but are expected
to be quiet, or to keep out of sight. English people though they are, yet, if nobody will employ
them so that they can pay rent for a cottage, they have no admitted rights in England--unless
it be to go to the workhouse or to keep moving on upon the public road. In endless ways the
sense of inequality is impressed upon them. I opened the local paper lately, and read of four
of our young labourers accused of "card-playing." The game was "Banker," the policeman told
the magistrates--as if gentlemen were likely to know what that meant!--and he had caught the
fellows red-handed, in some as yet unfenced nook of the heath. That was how they were in fault.
They should not have been playing where they could be seen, in the open air; they should have
taken their objectionable game out of sight, into some private house, as the middle-classes
do--and as, I suppose, the policeman himself must have done in his time, since he knew the
game. Unfortunately for the labouring men, they have no private house available: there is no
room for a card-party in their cottages; and thus they become subject to laws which, as they
do not touch the property-owner, seem designed to catch especially them. For another example
of the same insinuation of inequality, consider the local by-laws, which now forbid the keeping
of pigs within a considerable distance of a dwelling-house. I will not say that the villager
thinks the regulation a wrong one; at any rate he understands that it is excused in the interests
of public health. But he also knows that it has been introduced since the arrival of middle-class
people in the parish. They came, and his pigs had to go; so that in his eyes even the general
public health looks like the health of rich residents rather than of poor ones.

The people display little resentment; they accept their position with equanimity. Nevertheless
it drives them in upon themselves. Observing the conditions, and yielding to them as to something
inherent in the nature of things, they strive to keep out of the way of the superior classes.
They are an aloof population, though not as their ancestors were. They are fenced out from
the country; they cannot with security go into enclosed wood or coppice; they must keep to
the public way, and there they must behave so as not to disturb the employing classes. Accordingly,
all up and down the valley they restrict themselves more and more soberly to their gardens
and cottages, dreading few things so much as a collision with those impersonal forces which
seem always to side with property and against people like them.

XIII

NOTICE TO QUIT

It might be thought that at least when they are at home the people would be untroubled; yet
that is not the case. Influences from the new civilization reach them in their cottages, and
the intrusion is but the more searching for being impersonal.

It is borne in upon the senses in the shape of sights and sounds proclaiming across the valley
that the village is an altered place, that the modern world is submerging it, that the old
comfortable seclusion is gone. Even the obscurity of winter nights does not veil that truth;
for where, but a few years ago, the quiet depths of darkness were but emphasized by a few glimmering
cottage lights, there is now a more brilliant sparkling of lit-up villa windows, while northwards
the sky has a dull glare from new road-lamps which line the ridge on its town side. As for
the daytime, the labourer can hardly look from his door without seeing up or down the valley
some sign or other telling of the invasion of a new people, unsympathetic to his order. He
sees, and hears too. As he sweats at his gardening, the sounds of piano-playing come to him,
or of the affected excitement of a tennis-party; or the braying of a motor-car informs him
that the rich who are his masters are on the road. And though the man should go into his cottage
and shut the door, these things must often have for him a sinister meaning which he cannot
so easily shut out. There is a vague menace in them. They betoken to all the labouring people
that their old home is no longer quite at their own disposal, but is at the mercy of a new
class who would willingly see their departure.

Perhaps the majority do not feel themselves personally threatened; nevertheless, the situation
is disquieting for all. Before the property-owners came, and while still the population was
homogeneous, a sort of continuity in the life of the valley impressed itself upon one's consciousness,
giving a sense of security. Here amidst the heaths a laborious and frugal people, wise in their
own fashion, had their home and supplied their own wants. Not one of them probably thought
of the significance of it all, or understood how the village traditions were his inheritance;
not one considered what it meant to him to belong to the little group of folk and be independent
of the whims of strangers. Yet, for all that, there was comfort in the situation. To be so
familiar as the people were with the peculiarities of the valley, to appreciate the usefulness
of the wide heath-land, to value the weather, to comprehend at a glance the doings of the neighbours,
and to have fellow-feeling with their motives and hopes and disappointments, was to be at home
most intimately, most safely. But all this is a thing of the past. To-day, when the labourer
looks around, much of what he sees in the new houses, roads, fences, and so on, has, indeed,
been produced by his own handiwork, but it is a product in the enjoyment of which he has no
share. It has nothing to do with him and his people; on the contrary, it announces the break-up
of the traditional industries by which he lived, and the disintegration of the society of which
he was a member. It follows that a certain suggestiveness which used to dignify the home pursuits
of the village is wanting to them now. Instead of being a part of the general thrift of the
valley--a not unworthy contribution to that which, in the sum, was all important to the village
life--those little jobs which the labourer does at home, including his garden-work, have no
relation now to anything save his private necessities, because now the dominant interests of
the valley are those of a different sort of people who care nothing for such homely things.
I shall be told that, after all, this is mere sentiment. But, then, half the comfort of life
proceeds from those large vague sentiments which lift a man's private doings up from meanness
into worthiness. No such enrichment, however--no dim sense of sharing in a prosperous and approved
existence--can reward the labourer's industry in this place at the present time. The clever
work which, in the village of his equals, would have made him conspicuous and respected, now
stamps him as belonging to the least important and least considered section of the population.

Still, I will waive this point. Assuming--though it is much to assume--that the cottagers have
no sentiment in the matter, there are other circumstances in the change which cannot fail to
disquiet them. I hinted just now that the "residential" people would not grieve if the labouring
folk took their departure. Now, this is no figure of speech. Although it is likely that not
one cottager in twenty has any real cause to fear removal, there has been enough disturbance
of the old families to prove that nobody is quite safe. Thus, about two years ago, when some
cottage property near to a new "residence" was bought up by the owner of the residence, it
was commonly said that he had bought it in order to get rid of some of the tenants, whom he
disliked for neighbours. Whether or not that was the real reason I do not know; but certain
it is that two of the tenants were forthwith turned out--one of them after twenty-five years
of occupancy. It was not the first case of the kind in the village, nor yet the last. At the
present moment I know of three families who are likely ere long to have to quit. They live
in a block of cottages just beyond the hedge of a substantial house--a block which, it must
be owned, is rather an eyesore from there, but which might easily be turned into a decent villa,
and is actually up for sale for that purpose. And the dwellers in the substantial house are
fervently hoping that a buyer of the cottages will soon come forward. They have told me so
themselves. "Of course," they say, "we shall be sorry for the poor people to be turned out,
but we should like to have nicer neighbours, of our own sort." So in their own valley these
English people are not safe from molestation. With scarce more care for them than would be
shown by a foreign invader, gentility pursues its ungentle aims. No cottager can feel quite
secure. A dim uncertainty haunts the village, with noticeable effect upon everybody's activities.
For a sort of calculating prudence is begotten of it, which yet is not thrift. It dissuades
the people from working for a distant future. It cuts off hope, benumbs the tastes, paralyzes
the aspiration to beautify the home which may any day have to be abandoned.

And in the long run this effect, from which all the people suffer more or less unconsciously,
is more injurious than the actual misfortune of having to move, which, after all, falls upon
the few only. Not that I would make light of that calamity. Men under its shadow lie awake
o' nights, worrying about it. While I am writing here, in a cottage near at hand there is a
man under notice to quit, who is going through all the pitiful experiences--wondering where
in the world he shall take his wife and children, fearing lest it should have to be into some
backyard in the town, dreading that in that case he will be too far away from his day's work
and have to give it up, and scheming to save enough, from the cost of bread and boots, to pay
for a van to move his furniture. It is not for any fault that he is to go. And indeed he is
being well treated; for the owner, who wants to occupy the cottage himself, has waited months
because the man cannot find another place. Nevertheless he will have to go. As a rule, a man
under notice to quit is in the position of standing by and seeing his home, and his living,
and the well-being of his family sacrificed to the whim of a superior whom he dares not oppose;
and I do not dream of arguing that that is a tolerable position for any Englishman to be in.
None the less, it is true that these acute troubles, which fall upon a few people here and
there, and presently are left behind and forgotten, are of less serious import than the injury
to the village at large, caused by the general sense of insecurity.

The people's tastes are benumbed, I said: their aspirations to beautify their homes are paralyzed
by the want of permanence in their condition. To make this quite plain, it would be only needful
to look at the few cottages in the valley still inhabited by their owners, and to compare them
with those let to weekly tenants. It seems to be no question of income that makes the difference
between the two. In several cottages very well known to me, the owners are not earning more
than fifteen shillings a week--or, including the value of the cottage, twenty shillings; yet
the places, in their varied ways, all look comfortable and comely. Fruit-trees, or grape-vines,
or roses, are trained to the walls. The boundary hedges are kept well trimmed; here and there
survives a box border--product of many years of clipping--or even a yew-tree or two fancifully
shaped out. Here and there, too, leading to the cottage door, is carefully preserved an example
of those neat pavements of local stone once so characteristic of this countryside; and in all
these things one sees what the average cottager would do if it were worth while--if he had
the heart. Since none of these things, however, can be had without long attention, or, at any
rate, without skill carefully bestowed in due season, you do not find such things decorating
the homes of weekly tenants. The cottages let by the week look shabby, slovenly, dingy; the
hedges of the gardens are neglected, broken down, stopped up with anything that comes to hand.
If it were not for the fruitful and well-tended vegetable plots, one might often suppose the
tenants to be ignorant of order, degenerate, brutalized, materialized, so sordid and ugly are
their homes.

Yet it is not for want of taste that they endure these conditions. Amidst the pitiful shabbiness
which prevails may be found many little signs that the delight in comely things would go far
if it dared. There is hardly a garden in the village, I think, which does not contain a corner
or a strip given over unthriftily, not to useful vegetables, but to daffodils or carnations
or dahlias, or to the plants of sweet scent and pleasant names, like rosemary and lavender,
and balm, and mignonette. And not seldom a weekly tenant, desirous of beauty, goes farther,
takes his chance of losing his pains; nails up against his doorway some makeshift structure
of fir-poles to be a porch, sowing nasturtiums or sweet-peas to cover it with their short-lived
beauty; or he marks out under his window some little trumpery border to serve instead of a
box-hedge as safeguard to his flowers. One of those families whose removal was mentioned above--turned
out in the summertime they were, with loss of garden crops--found refuge in a hovel which stood
right against a public pathway. And, although it was an encroachment, within a week a twelve-inch
strip of the pathway was dug up under the cottage eaves, and fenced in with a low fencing of
sticks roughly nailed together. Within this narrow space were planted chrysanthemums rescued
from the previous home; and when the fence gave way--as it did before the chrysanthemums flowered--big
stones and brickbats were laid in its place. Considered as decoration, the result was a failure;
it was the product of an hour's work in which despair and bitterness had all but killed the
people's hope; but that it was done at all is almost enough to prove my point. For further
illustration I may refer again to that other man mentioned above, who is now under notice to
leave his cottage. Last year he was happy in tending four or five rose-trees which he had been
allowed to bring home from the rubbish-heap of his employer's garden. I remember that when
he showed them to me, gloating over them, he tried to excuse himself to me for neglecting his
potatoes in their favour, and I did my best to encourage him and puff him up with pride. But
it was of no use. This summer he is neglecting his roses, and is wondering if his potatoes
will be ripe enough for digging before he is obliged to move.

With such things going on, it is not wonderful that the people live shabbily, meanly, out at
elbows. Tastes so handicapped as theirs make no headway, and, though not dying, sink into disuse.
The average cottager learns to despise pleasantness and to concentrate upon usefulness. His
chief pride now is in his food-crops, which, if not eaten, can be turned into money. Of course,
these have their beauty--not undiscerned by the labourer--but they are not grown for that end,
and the thriftier the man, the less time to the consideration of beauty will he give. It is,
besides, an imprudence to make a cottage look comely, now that covetous eyes are upon the valley
and the people's position there has grown insecure.

Does it seem a slight thing? Whatever the practical importance of it, the extent of change
involved in this hopeless attitude of the villagers towards their home-places must not be under-rated;
for if it could be viewed in sharp perspective it would appear considerable enough. Let us
note the transitions. First the straying squatters settled here, to cultivate chosen spots
of the valley and reduce them to order. They were not wedded to the place; only if it gave
them a chance of getting food and shelter were they likely to remain. Soon, however, that first
uncertainty was forgotten. Their peasant customs fitted the environment; there was no danger
of molestation; already to their children the valley began to feel like a permanent home. As
years went on that feeling deepened, wrapped the people round in an unthought-of security,
and permitted them, here and there, to go beyond the necessary peasant crafts and think of
what was pleasant as well as necessary. Gardens were trimmed into beauty, grape-vines were
grown for the sake of wine-making, and bees were kept for the sake of honey and mead. In the
cottages decent furniture and implements began to accumulate; the women decorated their men's
blouses with pretty smocking; the children were taught old-fashioned lore because it was old-fashioned
and their inheritance; time-honoured customs of May-day and of Christmas were not ignored.
So during a few generations the old country thrift and its simple civilization were kept alive,
until the loss of the common made the old thrift no longer possible and introduced the new.
Lastly, and within recent years, a new population has come, taking possession, with a new civilization
which is by no means simple; and now once more a sense of unsettledness is upon the cottagers,
although for the most part they remain here. It is, however, an unsettledness very unlike that
of the earlier time. Instead of hope in it there is anxiety; instead of striking deeper root
in the valley, the people's hold grows shallower. The agreeable peasant arts have faded out
accordingly. The whole peasant mode of life is all but forgotten. To-day we have here not a
distinct group of people living by customs which their singular circumstances justify, but
numerous impoverished families living provisionally from hand to mouth, because of the possibility
of further changes to be thrust upon them. While they wait they still work, yet without pleasantness
in their lives. As their homes by neglect have grown shabby and squalid, so their industry
has become calculating and sordid. Little remains to them now but their own good temper to
keep their life from being quite joyless.

IV

THE RESULTING NEEDS

XIV

THE INITIAL DEFECT

Keeping pace with the alterations in their circumstances, a great mental and spiritual destitution
has made its appearance amongst the labouring people. I say "has made its appearance" because
it cannot be wholly attributed to the changes we have been discussing. Those changes have done
their part, certainly. Obliterating the country crafts and cults, breaking down the old neighbourly
feelings, turning what was an interesting economy into an anxious calculation of shillings
and pence, and reducing a whole village of people from independence to a position bordering
on servility, the introduction of a new system of thrift must bear the greater share of the
blame for the present plight of the labourers. Nevertheless, their destitution--their mental
and spiritual destitution--has its roots deeper down, and springs from a grave defect which
was inherent in the peasant system. It is time to recognize that fact. In many ways the folk-civilization
had served the cottagers excellently. They had grown up hardy and self-reliant under its influence;
clever with their hands, shrewd with their heads, kindly and cheerful in their temper. But
one can see now that all this had been bought very dear. To set against the good qualities
that came to light there was a stifling of other qualities which were equally good, but had
no chance of development at all under the peasant thrift.

Especially on the side of mental activity was the people's natural power cramped. I do not
mean that they were stupid; it would be an error of the first magnitude to suppose anything
of the sort. But the concentration of their faculties on their rural doings left them childish
and inefficient in the use of their brains for other purposes. Mention has been made of the
"fatalism" which still prevails in the village outlook; but fatalism is too respectable a name
for that mere absence of speculative thought which was characteristic of the peasant kind of
people I have known. The interest of their daily pursuits kept their minds busy upon matters
obvious to the senses, while attention to opinions and ideas was discouraged. For this reason
the older men and women had seldom if ever indulged in fancies or day-dreams, or troubled about
theories or first principles; and until lately I might have said the same of the younger ones
too. As for watching themselves--watching and checking off the actions of their own intelligence--it
was what they never did. A sentiment might arise in them and mellow all their temper, and they
would not notice it. The inner meaning of things concerned them very little. Their conception
of cause and effect, or of the constancy of nature, was rudimentary. "Ninety-nine times out
of a hundred," said an old bricklayer of the village, baffled by some error in his work--"ninety-nine
times out of a hundred it'll come right same as you sets it out, but not always." Puzzles were
allowed to be puzzling, and left so; or the first explanation was accepted as final. The "mistis
in March" sufficiently accounted for the "frostis in May." Mushrooms would only grow when the
moon was "growing." Even with regard to personal troubles the people were still as unspeculative
as ever. Were they poor, or ill? It merely happened so, and that settled it. Or were they in
cheerful spirits? Why, so they were; and what more could be said?

It was largely this simplicity of their mental processes that made the older people so companionable.
They were unaccustomed to using certain powers of the brain which modern people use; nay, they
were so unaware of that use as to be utterly unsuspicious of such a thing. To be as little
psychological as possible, we may say that a modern man's thought goes on habitually at two
main levels. On the surface are the subjects of the moment--that endless procession of things
seen or heard or spoken of which make up the outer world; and here is where intercourse with
the old type of villager was easy and agreeable. But below that surface the modern mind has
a habit of interpreting these phenomena by general ideas or abstract principles, or referring
them to imaginations all out of sight and unmentioned; and into this region of thought the
peasant's attention hardly penetrated at all. Given a knowledge of the neighbourhood, therefore,
it was easy to keep conversation going with a man of this kind. If you could find out the set
of superficial or practical subjects in which he was interested, and chatter solely on that
plane, all went well. But if you dipped underneath it amongst fancies or generalizations, difficulties
arose. The old people had no experience there, and were out of their depth in a moment. And
yet--I must repeat it--we should be entirely wrong to infer that they were naturally stupid,
unless a man is to be called stupid because he does not cultivate every one of his inborn faculties.
In that sense we all have our portion in stupidity, and the peasant was no worse than the rest
of us. His particular deficiency was as I have described it, and may be fully explained by
his mode of life. For in cow-stall or garden or cottage, or in the fields or on the heaths,
the claim of the moment was all-absorbing; and as he hurried to thatch his rick before the
rain came, or to get his turfs home by nightfall, the ideas which thronged about his doings
crowded out ideas of any other sort. Or if, not hurrying, his mind went dreamy, it was still
of peasant things that he dreamed. Of what he had been told when he was a child, or what he
had seen for himself in after-life, his memory was full; and every stroke of reap-hook or thrust
of spade had power to entice his intellect along the familiar grooves of thought--grooves which
lie on the surface and are unconnected with any systematized channels of idea-work underneath.

So the strong country life tyrannized over country brains, and, apart from the ideas suggested
by that life, the peasant folk had few ideas. Their minds lacked freedom; there was no escape
from the actual environment into a world either of imagination or of more scientific understanding.
Nor did this matter a great deal, so long as the environment remained intact. In the absence
of what we call "views"--those generalizations about destiny or goodness, or pleasure, or what
not, by which we others grope our way through life--the steady peasant environment, so well
known and containing so few surprises, was itself helpful, precisely because it was so well
known. If a man would but give shrewd attention to his practical affairs, it was enough; a
substitute for philosophy was already made for him, to save him the trouble of thinking things
out for himself. His whole mental activity proceeded, unawares, upon a substratum of customary
understanding, which belonged to the village in general, and did not require to be formulated,
but was accepted as axiomatic by all. "Understanding" is the best word I can find for it. It
differed from a philosophy or a belief, because it contained no abstract ideas; thinking or
theorizing had no part in it; it was a sheer perception and recognition of the circumstances
as they were. The people might dispute about details; but the general object to be striven
for in life admitted of no disagreement. Without giving it a thought, they knew it. There lay
the valley before them, with their little homesteads, their cattle, their gardens, the common;
and connected with all these things a certain old-established series of industries was recognized,
leading up to a well-known prosperity. That perception was their philosophy. The environment
was understood through and through. And this common knowledge, existing apart from any individual
in particular, served every individual instead of a set of private opinions of his own. To
get away from it was impossible, for it was real knowledge; a man's practical thoughts had
to harmonize with it; supported by it, he was saved the trouble of thinking things out in "systems";
and in fact it was a better guide to him than thought-out systems could have been, because
generations of experience had fitted it so perfectly to the narrow environment of the valley.
So long, therefore, as the environment remained unaltered, the truth that the people's minds
held few ideas upon other subjects, and had developed no method of systematic thinking, was veiled.

But it has become plain enough now that the old environment is gone. The new thrift has laid
bare the nakedness of the land. It has found the villagers unequipped with any efficient mental
habits appropriate to the altered conditions, and shown them to be at a loss for interesting
ideas in other directions. They cannot see their way any longer. They have no aims; at any
rate, no man is sure what his own aims ought to be, or has any confidence that his neighbours
could enlighten him. Life has grown meaningless, stupid; an apathy reigns in the village--a
dull waiting, with nothing in particular for which to wait.

XV

THE OPPORTUNITY

Amongst so many drawbacks to the new thrift, one good thing that it has brought to the villagers,
in the shape of a little leisure, gives us the means of seeing in more detail how destitute
of interests their life has become. It must be owned that the leisure is very scanty. It is
so obscured, too, by the people's habit of putting themselves to productive work in it that
I have sometimes doubted if any benefit of the kind actually filtered down into their overburdened
lives. Others, however, with a more business-like interest in the matter than mine, have recognized
that a new thing has come into the country labourer's life, although they do not speak of it
as "leisure." Mere wasted time is what it looks like to them. Thus, not long ago, an acquaintance
who by no means shares my views of these matters was deploring to me the degenerate state,
as he conceived it, of the labourers on certain farms in which he is interested, a few miles
away from this valley. The men, he said, holding their cottages as one of the conditions of
employment on the farms, had grown idle, and were neglecting the cottage gardens--were neglecting
them so seriously that, in the interests of the estate, he had been obliged to complain to
the farmers. Upon my asking for explanations of a disposition so unlike that of the labourers
in this parish, many of whom are not content with their cottage gardens, but take more ground
when they can get it, my friend said deliberately: "I think food is too cheap. With their fifteen
shillings a week the men can buy all they want without working for it; and the result is that
they waste their evenings and the gardens go to ruin."

With this remarkable explanation I am glad to think that I have nothing to do here. The point
is that, according to a business man with lifelong experience in rural matters, country labourers
now have time at their disposal. Without further question we may accept it as true; the cheapening
of produce has made it just possible for labouring men to live without occupying every available
hour in productive work, and in this one respect they do profit a little by those innovations--the
use of machinery, the division of labour, and the free importation of foreign goods--which
have replaced the antiquated peasant economy. It is not necessary nowadays--not absolutely
necessary--for the labourer, when his day's wage-earning is done, to fall to work again in
the evening in order to produce commodities for his own use. Doubtless if he does so he is
the better off; but if he fails to do so he may still live. While he has been earning money
away from home during the day, other men he has never met, in countries he has never seen,
have been providing for him the things that he will want at home in the evening; and if these
things have not been actually brought to his door, they are waiting for him in shops, whence
he may get them in exchange for the money he has earned. Some of them, too, are of a quality
such as, with the utmost skill and industry, he never could have produced for himself. Modern
artificial light provides an example. Those home-made rushlights eulogized by Gilbert White
and by Cobbett may have been well enough in their way, but cheap lamps and cheap paraffin have
given the villagers their winter evenings. At a cost of a few halfpence earned in the course
of the day's work a cottage family may prolong their winter day as far into the night as they
please; and that, without feeling that they are wasting their store of light, and without being
under necessity of spending the rescued hours at any of those thrifty tasks which alone would
have justified peasant folk in sitting up late. They have the evening to use at their pleasure.

If it is said, as my friend interested in land seemed to suggest, that they do not know how
to use it, I am not concerned to disagree. In fact, that is my own text. On an evening last
winter, having occasion to ask a neighbour to do me a service, I knocked at his cottage door,
and was invited in. The unshaded lamp on the table cast a hard, strong light on the appointments
of the room, and in its glare the family--namely, the man, with his wife, his mother, and his
sister--were sitting round the fire. On the table, which had no cloth, the remains of his hot
tea-supper were not cleared away--the crust of a loaf, a piece of bacon-rind on a plate, and
a teacup showed what it had been. But now he had finished, and was resting in his shirt-sleeves,
nursing his baby. In fact, the evening's occupation had begun. The family, that is to say,
had two or three hours to spend--for it was but little past seven o'clock--and nothing to do
but to sit there and gossip. An innocent pastime that; I have no fault to find with it, excepting
that it had the appearance of being very dull. The people looked comfortable, but there was
no liveliness in them. No trace of vivacity in their faces gave the smallest reason to suppose
that my coming had interrupted any enjoyment of the evening. A listless contentment in being
at home together, with the day's work done and a fire to sit by, was what was suggested by
the whole bearing of the family. Their leisure was of no use to them for recreation--for "making
themselves anew," that is--or for giving play to faculties which had lain quiet during the
day's work. At the time, however, I saw nothing significant in all this. It was just what other
cottage interiors had revealed to me on other winter evenings. The surprising, the unexpected
thing would have been to find the little spell of leisure being joyfully used.

Shall we leave the matter there then? If we do, we shall overlook the one feature in the situation
that most particularly deserves attention. For suppose that the cottagers in general do not
know what to do with their leisure, yet we must not argue that therefore they do not prize
it. Dull though they may seem in it, tedious though I believe they often find it, nevertheless
there proceeds from it a subtle satisfaction, as at something gained, in the liberty to behave
as they like, in the vague sense that for an hour or two no further effort is demanded of them.
Yawning for bed, half sick of the evening, somewhere in the back of their consciousness they
feel that this respite from labour, which they have won by the day's work, is a privilege not
to be thrown away. It is more to them than a mere cessation from toil, a mere interval between
more important hours; it is itself the most important part of the day--the part to which all
the rest has led up.

Nothing of the sort, I believe, was experienced in the village in earlier times. Leisure, and
the problem of using it, are new things there. I do not mean that the older inhabitants of
the valley never had any spare time. There were, doubtless, many hours when they "eased off,"
to smoke their pipes and drink their beer and be jolly; only, such hours were, so to speak,
a by-product of living, not the usual and expected consummation of every day. Accepting them
by no means unwillingly when they occurred, the folk still were wont normally to reduce them
to a minimum, or at least to see that they did not occur too often; as if spare time, after
all, was only a time of waiting until work could be conveniently resumed. So lightly was it
valued that most villagers cut it short by the simple expedient of going to bed at six or seven
o'clock. But then, in their peasant way, they enjoyed interesting days. The work they did,
although it left their reasoning and imaginative powers undeveloped, called into play enough
subtle knowledge and skill to make their whole day's industry gratifying. What should they
want of leisure? They wanted rest, in which to recover strength for taking up again the interesting
business of living; but they approached their daily life--their pig-keeping and bread-making,
their mowing and thatching and turf-cutting and gardening, and the whole round of country tasks--almost
in a welcoming spirit, matching themselves against its demands and proving their manhood by
their success. But the modern labourer's employment, reduced as it is to so much greater monotony,
and carried on for a master instead of for the man himself, is seldom to be approached in that
spirit. The money-valuation of it is the prime consideration; it is a commercial affair; a
clerk going to his office has as much reason as the labourer to welcome the morning's call
to work. As in the clerk's case, so in the labourer's: the act or fruition of living is postponed
during the hours in which the living is being earned; between the two processes a sharp line
of division is drawn; and it is not until the clock strikes, and the leisure begins, that a
man may remember that he is a man, and try to make a success of living. Hence the truth of
what I say: the problem of using leisure is a new one in the village. Deprived, by the economic
changes which have gone over them, of any keen enjoyment of life while at work, the labourers
must make up for the deprivation when work is over, or not at all. Naturally enough, in the
absence of any traditions to guide them, they fail. But self-respect forbids the old solution.
To feed and go to bed would be to shirk the problem, not to solve it.

So much turns upon a proper appreciation of these truths that it will be well to illustrate
them from real life, contrasting the old against the new. Fortunately the means are available.
Modernized people acquainted with leisure are in every cottage, while as for the others, the
valley still contains a few elderly men whose lives are reminiscent of the earlier day. Accordingly
I shall finish this chapter by giving an account of one of these latter, so that in the next
chapter the different position of the present-day labourers may be more exactly understood.

The man I have in mind--I will rename him Turner--belongs to one of the old families of the
village, and inherited from his father a cottage and an acre or so of ground--probably mortgaged--together
with a horse and cart, a donkey, a cow or two, a few pigs, and a fair stock of the usual rustic
tools and implements. Unluckily for him, he inherited no traditions--there were none in his
family--to teach him how to use these possessions for making a money profit; so that, trying
to go on in the old way, as if the world were not changing all round him, he muddled away his
chances, and by the time that he was fifty had no property left that was worth any creditor's
notice. The loss, however, came too late to have much effect on his habits. And now that he
is but the weekly tenant of a tiny cottage, and owns no more than a donkey and cart and a few
rabbits and fowls, he is just the same sort of man that he used to be in prosperity--thriftless
from our point of view, but from the peasant point of view thrifty enough, good-tempered too,
generous to a fault, indifferent to discomforts, as a rule very hard-working, yet apparently
quite unacquainted with fatigue.

He gets his living now as a labourer; but, unlike his neighbours, he seems by no means careful
to secure constant employment. The regularity of it would hardly suit his temper; he is too
keenly desirous of being his own master. And his own master he manages to be, in a certain
degree. From those who employ him he obtains some latitude of choice, not alone as to the hours
of the day when he shall serve them, but even as to the days of the week. I have heard him
protest: "Monday you says for me to come. Well, I dunno about Monday--if Tuesday'd suit ye
as well? I wants to do so-and-so o' Monday, if 'tis fine. You see, there's Mr. S---- I bin
so busy I en't bin anear him this week for fear he should want me up there. I knows his grass
wants cuttin'. But I 'xpects I shall ha' to satisfy 'n Monday, or else p'raps he won't like
it." Sometimes he takes a day for his own affairs, carting home hop-bine in his donkey-cart,
or getting heath for some thatching job that has been offered to him. On these terms, while
he finds plenty to do in working intermittently for four or five people in the parish, he preserves
a freedom of action which probably no other labourer in the village enjoys. Few others could
command it. But Turner's manner is so ingratiating that people have a personal liking for him,
and it is certain that his strength and all-round handiness make of him an extremely useful
man. Especially does his versatility commend him. Others in the village are as strong as he
and as active and willing, but there are not now many others who can do such a number of different
kinds of work as he can, with so much experienced readiness.

Among his clients (for that is a more fitting word for them than "employers") there are two
or three residents with villa gardens, and also two of those "small-holders" who, more fortunate
than himself (though not more happy, I fancy), have managed to cling to the little properties
which their fathers owned. Turner, therefore, comes in for a number of jobs extraordinarily
diverse. Thus, during last summer I knew him to be tending two gardens, where his work ranged
from lawn-cutting (sometimes with a scythe) to sowing seeds, taking care of the vegetable crops,
and trimming hedges. But this occupied him only from seven in the morning until five in the
afternoon. In the margin outside these hours--starting at five or earlier and keeping on until
dark--he was helping the two small-holders, one after the other, to make their hay and get
the ricks built. Then the ricks required thatching, and Turner thatched them. In the meantime
he was getting together a little rick of his own for his donkey's use, carrying home in bags
the longer grass which he had mowed in the rough places of people's gardens or had chopped
off in hedgerows near his home. A month later he was harvesting for the small-holders, and
again there was rick-thatching for him to do. "That's seven I've done," he remarked to me,
on the day when he finished the last one. "But didn't the rain stop you this morning?" I asked,
for rain had begun heavily about nine o'clock. He laughed. "No.... We got'n covered in somehow.
Had to sramble about, but he was thatched afore the rain come."

Later still he was threshing some of this corn with a flail. I heard of it with astonishment.
"A flail?" "Yes," he said; "my old dad put me to it when I was seventeen, so I had to learn."
He seemed to think little of it. But to me threshing by hand was so obsolete and antiquated
a thing as to be a novelty; nor yet to me only, for a friend to whom I mentioned the matter
laughed, and asked if I had come across any knights in armour lately.

One autumn, when he was doing some work for myself, he begged for a day or two away in order
to take a job at turf-cutting. When he returned on the third or fourth day, he said: "Me and
my nipper" (a lad of about sixteen years old) "cut sixteen hundred this time." Now, lawn-turfs
are cut to a standard size, three feet by one, wherefore I remarked: "Why, that's nearly a
mile you have cut." "Oh, is it?" he said. "But it didn't take long. Ye see, I had the nipper
to go along with the edgin' tool in front of me, and 'twan't much trouble to get 'em up."

He could not keep on for me regularly. The thought of Mr. S----'s work waiting to be done fidgeted
him. "When I was up there last he was talkin' about fresh gravellin' all his paths. I said
to'n, 'If I was you I should wait anyhow till the leaves is down--they'll make the new gravel
so ontidy else.' So they would, sure. I keeps puttin' it off. But I shall ha' to go. I sold'n
a little donkey in the summer, and he's hoofs'll want parin' again. I done 'em not so long ago...."

So his work varies, week after week. From one job to another up and down the valley he goes,
not listlessly and fatigued, but taking a sober interest in all he does. You can see in him
very well how his forefathers went about their affairs, for he is plainly a man after their
pattern. His day's work is his day's pleasure. It is changeful enough, and calls for skill
enough, to make it enjoyable to him. Furthermore, things on either side of it--things he learnt
to understand long ago--make their old appeal to his senses as he goes about, although his
actual work is not concerned with them. In the early summer--he had come to mow a little grass
plot for me--I found him full of a boyish delight in birds and birds'-nests. A pair of interesting
birds had arrived; at any time in the day they could be seen swooping down from the branch
of a certain apple-tree and back again to their starting-place without having touched the ground.
"Flycatchers!" said Turner exultantly. "I shall ha' to look about. They got their nest somewhere
near, you may be sure o' that! A little wisp o' grass somewhere in the clunch (fork) of a tree
..." (his glance wandered speculatively round in search of a likely place) "that's where they
builds. Ah! look now! There he goes again! Right in the clunch you'll find their nest, and
as many as ten young 'uns in'n.... Yes, I shall be bound to find where he is afore I done with it."

The next day, hard by where he was at work, an exclamation of mine drew him to look at a half-fledged
bird, still alive, lying at the foot of a nut-tree. "H'm: so 'tis. A young blackbird," he said
pitifully. The next moment he had the bird in his hand. "Where can the nest be, then? Up in
that nut? Well, to be sure! Wonders I hadn't seen that afore now. That's it though, 'pend upon
it; right up in the clunch o' that bough." Before I could say a word he was half-way up amongst
the branches, long-legged and struggling, to put the bird back into its nest.

As he has always lived in the valley, he is full of memories of it, and especially early memories;
recalling the comparative scantiness of its population when he was a boy, and the great extent
of the common; and the warm banks where hedgehogs abounded--hedgehogs which his father used
to kill and cook; and the wells of good water, so few and precious that each had its local
name. For instance, "Butcher's Well" (so-called to this day, he says) "was where Jack Butcher
used to live, what was shepherd for Mr. Warner up there at Manley Bridge." At eight years old
he was sent out on to the common to mind cows; at ten he was thought big enough to be helpful
to his father, at piece-work in the hop-grounds; and in due time he began to go "down into
Sussex" with his father and others for the harvesting. His very first experience there was
of a wet August, when the men could earn no money and were reduced to living on bread and apples;
but other years have left him with happier memories of that annual outing. "Old Sussex!" he
laughed once in appreciative reminiscence--"Old Sussex! Them old hills! I did use to have a
appetite there! I could eat anything.... You could go to the top of a hill and look down one
way and p'raps not see more'n four or five places (houses or farmsteads), and look t'other
way and mebbe not be able to see e'er a one at all. Oh, a reg'lar wild, out-o'-th'-way place
'twas." On this farm, to which his gang went year after year, the farmer "didn't pay very high--you
couldn't expect'n to. But he used to treat us very well. Send out great puddin's for us two
or three times a week, and cider, and bread-an'-cheese.... Nine rabbits old Fisher the roadman
out here says 'twas, but I dunno 'bout that, but I knows 'twas as many as seven, the farmer
put into one puddin' for us. There was a rabbit for each man, be how 'twill. In a great yaller
basin...." Turner held out his arms to illustrate a large circumference.

In the time of his prosperity the main of his work was with his own horse and cart, so that
I know him to have had considerable experience in that way; and I recollect, too, his being
at plough in one of the slanting gardens of this valley, not with his horse--the ground was
too steep for that--but with two donkeys harnessed to a small plough which he kept especially
for such work. Truly it would be hard to "put him out," hard to find him at a loss, in anything
connected with country industry. He spoilt some sea-kale for me once, admitting, however, before
he began that he was not very familiar with its management; but that is the only matter of
its kind in which I have proved him inefficient. To see him putting young cabbage-plants in
rows is to realize what a fine thing it is to know the best way of going to work, even at such
a simple-seeming task as that; and I would not undertake to count in how many such things he
is proficient.

One day he was telling me an anecdote of his taking honey from an old-fashioned straw beehive;
another day the talk was of pruning fruit-trees. I had shown him an apple--the first one to
be picked from a young tree--and he at once named it correctly as a "Blenheim Orange," recognizing
it by its "eye," whereupon I asked a question or two, and, finally, if he understood pruning.
There came his customary laugh, while his eyes twinkled, as if the question amused him, as
if I might have known that he understood pruning. "Yes, I've done it many's a time. Grape vines,
too." Who taught him? "Oh, 'twas my old uncle made me do that. He was laid up one time--'twas
when I was eighteen year old--and he says to me: 'You'll ha' to do it. Now's your time to learn....'
Of course he showed me how. So 'twas he as showed me how to thatch.... My father never knowed
how to do thatchin', nor anythink else much. He was mostly hop-ground. He done a little mowin',
of course." Equally of course, the father had reaped and harvested, and kept pigs and cows,
and a few odd things besides; nevertheless, being chiefly a wage-earner, "he never knowed much,"
and it was to the uncle that the lad owed his best training.

From talk of the uncle, and of the uncle's cows, of which he had charge for a time, he drifted
off to mention a curious piece of old thrift connected with the common, and practised apparently
for some time after the enclosure. There was a man he knew in those now remote days who fed
his cows for a part of the year on furze, or "fuzz," as we call it here. Two acres of furze
he had, which he cut close in alternate years, the second year's growth making a fine juicy
fodder when chopped small into a sort of chaff. An old hand-apparatus for that purpose--a kind
of chaff-cutting box--was described to me. The same man had a horse, which also did well on
furze diet mixed with a little malt from the man's own beer-brewing.

To the lore derived from his uncle and others, Turner has added much by his own observation--not,
of course, intentional observation scientifically verified, but that shrewd and practical folk-observation,
if I may so call it, by which in the course of generations the rural English had already garnered
such a store of mingled knowledge and error. So he knows, or thinks he knows, why certain late-bearing
apple-trees have fruit only every other year, and what effect on the potato crop is caused
by dressing our sandy soil with chalk or lime; so he watches the new mole-runs, or puzzles
to make out what birds they can be that peck the ripening peas out of the pods, or estimates
the yield of oats to the acre by counting the sheaves that he stacks, or examines the lawn
to see what kinds of grass are thriving. About all such matters his talk is the talk of an
experienced man habitually interested in his subject, and yet it is never obtrusive. The remarks
fall from him casually; you feel, too, that while he is telling you something that he noticed
yesterday or years ago his eyes are alert to seize any new detail that may seem worthy of attention.
Details are always really his subject, for the generalizations he sometimes offers are built
on the flimsiest foundation of but one or two observed facts. But I am not now concerned with
the value of his observations for themselves; the point is that to him they are so interesting.
He is a man who seems to enjoy his life with an undiminished zest from morning to night. It
is doubtful if the working hours afford, to nine out of ten modern and even "educated" men,
such a constant refreshment of acceptable incidents as Turner's hours bring to him.

He is perhaps the best specimen of the old stock now left in the valley; but it must not be
thought that he is singular. Others there are not very unlike him; and all that one hears of
them goes to prove that the old cottage thrift, whatever its limitations may have been, did
at least make the day's work interesting enough to a man, without his needing to care about
leisure evenings. Turner, for his part, does not value them at all. In the winter he is often
in bed before seven o'clock.

XVI

THE OBSTACLES

Keeping this old-fashioned kind of life in mind as we turn again to the modern labourer's existence,
we see at once where the change has come in, and why leisure, from being of small account,
has become of so great importance. It is the amends due for a deprivation that has been suffered.
Unlike the industry of a peasantry, commercial wage-earning cannot satisfy the cravings of
a man's soul at the same time that it occupies his body, cannot exercise many of his faculties
or appeal to many of his tastes; and therefore, if he would have any profit, any enjoyment,
of his own human nature, he must contrive to get it in his leisure time.

In illustration of this position, I will take the case--it is fairly typical--of the coal-carter
mentioned in the last chapter. He is about twenty-five years old now; and his career so far,
from the time when he left school, may be soon outlined. It is true, I cannot say what his
first employment was; but it can be guessed; for there is no doubt that he began as an errand-boy,
and that presently, growing bigger, he took a turn at driving a gravel-cart to and fro between
the gravel-pits and the railway. Assuming this, I can go on to speak from my own knowledge.
His growth and strength came early; I remember noticing him first as a powerful fellow, not
more than seventeen or eighteen years old, but already doing a man's work as a gravel-digger.
When that work slackened after two or three years, he got employment--not willingly, but because
times were bad--at night-work with the "ballast-train" on the railway. Exhausting if not brutalizing
labour, that is. At ten or eleven at night the gangs of men start off, travelling in open trucks
to the part of the line they are to repair, and there they work throughout the night, on wind-swept
embankment or in draughty cutting, taking all the weather that the nights bring up. This man
endured it for some twelve months, until a neglected chill turned to bronchitis and pleurisy,
and nearly ended his life. After that he had a long spell of unemployment, and was on the point
of going back to the ballast-train as a last resource when, by good fortune, he got his present
job. He has been a coal-carter for three or four years--a fact which testifies to his efficiency.
By half-past six o'clock in the morning he has to be in the stables; then comes the day on
the road, during which he will lift on his back, into the van and out of it, and perhaps will
carry for long distances, nine or ten tons of coal--say, twenty hundredweight bags every hour;
by half-past five or six in the evening he has put up his horse for the night; and so his day's
work is over, excepting that he has about a mile to walk home.

Of this employment, which, if the man is lucky, will continue until he is old and worn-out,
we may admit that it is more useful by far--to the community--than the old village industries
were wont to be. Concentrated upon one kind of effort, it perhaps doubles the productivity
of a day's work. But just because it is so concentrated it cannot yield to the man himself
any variety of delights such as men occupied in the old way were wont to enjoy. It demands
from him but little skill; it neither requires him to possess a great fund of local information
and useful lore, nor yet takes him where he could gather such a store for his own pleasure.
The zest and fascination of living, with the senses alert, the tastes awake, and manifold sights
and sounds appealing to his happy recognition--all these have to be forgotten until he gets
home and is free for a little while. Then he may seek them if he can, using art or pastimes--what
we call "civilization"--for that end. The two hours or so of leisure are his opportunity.

But after a day like the coal-carter's, where is the man that could even begin to refresh himself
with the arts, or even the games, of civilization? For all the active use he can make of them
those spare hours of his do not deserve to be called leisure; they are the fagged end of the
day. Slouching home to them, as it were from under ten tons of coal, he has no energy left
for further effort. The community has had all his energy, all his power to enjoy civilization;
and has paid him three shillings and sixpence for it. It is small wonder that he seems not
to avail himself of the opportunity, prize it though he may.

Yet there is still a possibility to be considered. Albeit any active use of leisure is out
of the question, is he therefore debarred from a more tranquil enjoyment? He sits gossiping
with his family, but why should the gossip be listless and yawning? Why should not he, to say
nothing of his relations, enjoy the refreshment of talk enlivened by the play of pleasant and
varied thoughts? As everyone knows, the actual topic of conversation is not what makes the
charm; be what it may, it will still be agreeable, provided that it goes to an accompaniment
of ideas too plentiful and swift to be expressed. Every allusion then extends the interest
of it; reawakened memories add to its pleasure; if the minds engaged are fairly well furnished
with ideas, either by experience or by education, the intercourse between them goes on in a
sort of luminous medium which fills the whole being with contentment. Supposing, then, that
by education, or previous experience, the coal-carter's mind has been thus well furnished,
his scanty leisure may still compensate him for the long dull hours of his wage-earning, and
the new thrift will after all have made amends for the deprivation of the old peasant enjoyments.

But to suppose this is to suppose a most unlikely thing. Previous experience, at any rate,
has done little for the man. The peasants themselves were better off. Compare his chances,
once more, with those of a man like Turner. From earliest childhood, Turner's days and nights
have been bountiful to him in many-coloured impressions. At the outset he saw and had part
in those rural activities, changeful, accomplished, carried on by many forms of skill and directed
by a vast amount of traditional wisdom, whereby the country people of England had for ages
supported themselves in their quiet valleys. His brain still teems with recollections of all
this industry. And then to those recollections must be added memories of the scenes in which
the industry went on--the wide landscapes, the glowing cornfields, the meadows, woods, heaths;
and likewise the details of barn and rick-yard, and stable and cow-stall, and numberless other
corners into which his work has taken him. To anyone who understands them, those details are
themselves like an interesting book, full of "idea" legible everywhere in the shapes which
country craftsmanship gave to them; and Turner understands them through and through. Nor is
this all. If not actual adventure and romance, still many of the factors of adventure and romance
have accompanied him through his life; so that it is good even to think of all that he has
seen. He has had experience (travelling down to Sussex) of the dead silence of country roads
at midnight under the stars; has known the August sunrise, and the afternoon heat, and the
chilly moonlight, high up on the South Downs; and the glint of the sunshine in apple-orchards
at cider-making time; and the grey coming of the rain that urges a man to hurry with his thatching;
and the thickening of the white winter fog across the heaths towards night-fall, when wayfarers
might miss the track and wander all night unless they knew well what they were about. Of such
stuff as this for the brain-life to feed upon there has been great abundance in Turner's career,
but of such stuff what memories can the coal-carter have?

Already in his earliest childhood the principal chances were gone. The common had been enclosed;
no little boys were sent out to mind cows there all day, and incidentally to look for birds'-nests
and acquaint themselves with the ways of the rabbits and hedgehogs and butterflies and birds
of the heath. Fenced-in property, guarded by the Policeman and the Law, restricted the boy's
games to the shabby waste-places of the valley, and to the footpaths and roads, where there
was not much for a child to do or to see. At home, and in the homes of his companions, the
new thrift was in vogue; he might not watch the homely cottage doings, and listen to traditional
talk about them, and look up admiringly at able men and women engaged upon them, for the very
good reason that no such things went on. Men slaving at their gardens he might see, and women
weary at their washing and mending, amid scenes of little dignity and much poverty and makeshift
untidiness; but that was all. The coherent and self-explanatory village life had given place
to a half blind struggle of individuals against circumstances and economic processes which
no child could possibly understand; and it was with the pitiful stock of ideas to be derived
from these conditions that the coal-carter passed out of childhood, to enter upon the wage-earning
career which I have already outlined.

I need not spend much time in discussing that career as a source of ideas. From first to last,
and with the coal-carting period thrown in, monotony rather than variety has been the characteristic
of it. I do not say that it has been quite fruitless. There are impressions to be derived,
and intense ones probably, from working all day against the "face" of a gravel-pit, with the
broken edge of the field up above one's head for horizon; and from the skilled use of pick
and shovel; and from the weight of the wheelbarrow full of gravel as one wheels it along a
sagging plank. That is something to have experienced; as it is to have sweated at night in
a railway-cutting along with other men under the eye of a ganger, and to have known starlight,
or rain, or frost, or fog, or tempest meanwhile. It is something, even, to see the life of
the roads year after year from the footboard of a coal-van, and to be in charge of a horse
hour after hour; but I am talking now of ideas which might give buoyancy and zest to the gossip
beside a man's fireside in the evening when he is tired; and I think it unnecessary to argue
that, in regard to providing this kind of mental furniture, the coal-carter's experience of
life cannot have done great things for him. It has been poverty-stricken just where the peasant
life was so rich; it has left a great deficiency, which could only have been made good by an
education intentionally given for that end.

But it goes almost without saying that the man's "education" did very little to enrich his
mind. The ideas and accomplishments he picked up at the elementary school between his fourth
and fourteenth years were of course in themselves insufficient for the needs of a grown man,
and it would be unfair to criticize his schooling from that standpoint. Its defect was that
it failed to initiate him into the inner significance of information in general, and failed
wholly to start him on the path of learning. It was sterile of results. It opened to him no
view, no vista; set up in his brain no stir of activity such as could continue after he had
left school; and this for the reason that those simple items of knowledge which it conveyed
to him were too scrappy and too few to begin running together into any understanding of the
larger aspects of life. A few rules of arithmetic, a little of the geography of the British
Islands, a selection of anecdotes from the annals of the ancient Jews; no English history,
no fairy-tales or romance, no inkling of the infinities of time and space, or of the riches
of human thought; but merely a few "pieces" of poetry, and a few haphazard and detached observations
(called "Nature Study" nowadays) about familiar things--"the cat," "the cow," "the parsnip,"
"the rainbow," and so forth--this was the jumble of stuff offered to the child's mind--a jumble
to which it would puzzle a philosopher to give coherence. And what could a child get from it
to kindle his enthusiasm for that civilized learning in which, none the less, it all may have
its place? When the boy left school his "education" had but barely begun.

And hardly anything has happened since then to carry it farther, although once there seemed
just a chance of something better. During two successive winters the lad, being then from sixteen
to seventeen years old, went to a night-school, which was opened for twenty-six weeks in each
"session," and for four hours in each week. But the hope proved fallacious. In those hundred
and four hours a year--hours which came after a tiring day's work--his brain was fed upon "mensuration"
and "the science of horticulture," the former on the chance that some day he might want to
measure a wall for paper-hanging or do some other job of the sort, and the latter in case fate
should have marked him out for a nursery-gardener, when it would be handy to know that germinating
seeds begin by pushing down a root and pushing up a leaf or two. This gives a notion of the
sort of idea the luckless fellow derived from the night-school. I do not think that the joinery-classes
at present being held in the night-school had begun in his time; but supposing that he also
learnt joinery, he might, now that he is a man, add thoughts of mortices and tenons and mitre-joints
to his other thoughts about wall areas and germinating seeds. Of course, all these things--like
Jewish history or English geography--are worth knowing; but again it is true, of these things
no less than of the childish learning acquired at the day-school, that whatever their worth
may be to the people concerned to know them, they were very unlikely to set up in this young
man's brain any constructive idea-activity, any refreshing form of thought that would enrich
his leisure now, or give zest to his conversation. They were odds and ends of knowledge; more
comparable to the numberless odds and ends in which peasants were so rich than to the flowing
and luminous idea-life of modern civilization.

Adequate help having thus failed to reach the man from any source at any time of his life,
it cannot be surprising if now the evening's opportunity finds him unprepared. He is between
two civilizations, one of which has lapsed, while the other has not yet come his way. And what
is true of him is true of the younger labouring men in general. In bread-and-cheese matters
they are perhaps as well off as their forefathers in the village, but they are at a disadvantage
in the matter of varied and successful vitality. The wage-earning thrift which has increased
their usefulness as drudges has diminished their effectiveness as human beings; for it has
failed to introduce into their homes those enlivening, those spirit-stirring influences which
it denies to them when they are away from home doing their work. Hence a strange thing. The
unemployed hours of the evening, which should be such a boon, are a time of blank and disconsolate
tediousness, and when the longer days of the year come round many a man in the valley who ought
to be glad of his spare time dodges the wearisome problem of what to do with it by putting
himself to further work, until he can go to bed without feeling that he has been wasting his
life. Yet that is really no solution of the problem. It means that the men are trying to be
peasants again, because they can discover no art of living, no civilization, compatible with
the new thrift.

Of course it is true that they are handicapped by the lowness of the wages they receive. However
much time one may have, it would be all but impossible to follow up modern civilization without
any of its apparatus, in the shape of books and musical instruments, and the comfort of seclusion
in a spare room; and none of these advantages can be bought out of an income of eighteen shillings
a week. That is plainly the central difficulty--a difficulty which, unless it can be put right,
condemns our commercial economy as wholly inadequate to the needs of labouring people. Supposing,
however, that this defect could be suddenly remedied; supposing, that is, that by some miracle
wages could be so adjusted as to put the labourer in command of the apparatus of civilization;
still, he could not use the apparatus without a personal adjustment. He is impoverished, not
in money only, but also in development of his natural faculties, since the old village civilization
has ceased to help him.

XVII

THE WOMEN'S NEED

If, while the common was still open, very few even of the men of the village troubled about
regular employment, we may well believe that there were still fewer regular wage-earners amongst
the women. I do not mean that wage-earning was a thing they never did. There was not a woman
in the valley, perhaps, but had experience of it at hay-making and harvesting, while all would
have been disappointed to miss the hop-picking. But these occasional employments had more resemblance
to holidays and outings than they had to constant work for a living.

As the new thrift gradually established itself, the younger women at least had to alter their
ways. For observe what had happened. A number of men, once half-independent, but now wanting
work constantly, had been forced into a market where extra labour was hardly required; and
it needs no argument to prove that, under such conditions, they were not only unable to command
high wages, but were often unemployed. Of necessity, therefore, the women were obliged to make
up the week's income by their own earnings. The situation, in fact, was similar to that which
had been produced in earlier times and in other parishes by the old Poor Law, when parish pay
enabled men to work for less than a living wage; only now the deficiency was made up, not at
the expense of employers and ratepayers, but at the expense of women and girls.

But, though becoming wage-earners, the women missed the first advantage that wage-earners should
enjoy--namely, leisure time. After all, the new thrift had but partially freed them from their
old occupations. They might buy at a shop many things which their mothers had had to make;
but there was no going to a shop to get the washing and scrubbing done, the beds made, the
food cooked, the clothes mended. All this remained to the women as before. When they came home
from the fields--at first it was principally by field-work that they earned wages--it was not
to be at leisure, but to fall-to again on these domestic doings, just as if there had been
no change, just as if they were peasant women still.

And yet, though this work had not changed, there was henceforth a vast difference in its meaning
to the women. To approach it in the true peasant or cottage woman's temper was impossible;
nor in doing it might the labourer's wife enjoy half the satisfaction that had rewarded the
fatigue of her mother and grandmother. Something dropped away from it that could not be replaced
when the old conditions died out.

To discover what the "something" was, one need not idealize those old conditions. It would
be a mistake to suppose that the peasant economy, as practised in this valley, was nearly so
good a thing for women as it was for the other sex; a mistake to think that their life was
all honey, all simple sweetness and light, all an idyll of samplers and geraniums in cottage
windows. On the contrary, I believe that very often it grew intensely ugly, and was as narrowing
as it was ugly. The women saw nothing, and learnt nothing, of the outer world; and, in their
own world, they saw and learnt much that was ill. All the brutalities connected with getting
a living on peasant terms tended to coarsen them--the cruelties of men to one another, the
horrors that had to be inflicted on animals, the miseries of disease suffered by ignorant human
beings. Their perpetual attention to material cares tended to make them materialized and sordid;
they grew callous; there was no room to cultivate delicacy of imagination. All this you must
admit into the picture of the peasant woman's life, if you would try to see it fairly on the
bad side as well as on the good side. Still, a good side there was, and that it was far oftener
in evidence than the other I am well persuaded, when I remember the older village women who
are dead now. They, so masculine in their outlook, yet so true-hearted and, now and then, so
full of womanly tenderness and high feeling, could not have been the product of conditions
that were often evil. And one merit in particular must be conceded to the old style of life.
Say that the women's work was too incessant, and that some of it was distinctly ill to do;
yet, taken as a whole, it was not uninteresting, and it was just that wholeness of it that
made all the difference. The most tiresome duties--those domestic cares which were destined
to become so irksome to women of a later day--were less tiresome because they were parts of
a whole. Through them all shone the promise of happier hours to be won by their performance.

For although in this rough valley women might not achieve the finer successes of cottage folk-life,
where it led up into gracefulness and serenity, in a coarser fashion the essential spirit of
pride in capable doing was certainly theirs. They could, and did, enjoy the satisfaction of
proficiency, and win respect for it from their neighbours. If they were not neat, they were
very handy; if there was no superlative finish about their work, there was soundness of quality,
which they knew would be recognized as so much to their credit. Old gossip bears me out. Conceive
the nimble and self-confident temper of those two cottage women--not in this village, I admit,
but in the next one to it, and the thing was quite possible here--who always planned to do
their washing on the same day, for the pleasure of seeing who had the most "pieces," and the
best, to hang out on the clothes-lines. The story must be seventy years old, and I don't know
who told it me; but it has always seemed to me very characteristic of the good side of cottage
life, whether one thinks of the eager rivalry itself in the gardens, where the white clothes
flapped, or of the long record implied in it of careful housewifery and quiet needlework. This
spirit of joy in proficiency must have sweetened many of the cottage duties, and may well have
run through them all. When a woman treated her friends to home-made wine at Christmas, she
was exhibiting to them her own skill; when she cut up the loaf she had baked, or fried the
bacon she had helped to cure, the good result was personal to herself; the very turf she piled
on the fire had a homely satisfaction for her, because, cut as it was by her husband's own
tools, and smelling of the neighbouring heath as it burnt, it was suggestive of the time-honoured
economies of all the valley. In this way another comfort was added to that of her own more
personal pleasure. For there was hardly a duty that the old-time village woman did, but was
related closely to what the men were doing out of doors, and harmonized with the general industry
of her people. She may be figured, almost, as the member of a tribe whose doings explained
all her own doings, and to whose immemorial customs her scrubbing and washing belonged, not
unworthily. Her conscience was in the work. From one thing to another she went, now busily
at a pleasant task, now doggedly at a wearisome one, and she knew no leisure; but at every
point she was supported by what we may call the traditional feeling of the valley--nay, of
the whole countryside--commending her perhaps; at any rate, fully understanding her position.
To be like her mother and her grandmother; to practise the time-honoured habits, and to practise
them efficiently, was a sort of religious cult with her, in the same way as it is nowadays
with women of a certain position not to be dowdy. The peasant-cottager's wife could never think
of herself as a mere charwoman or washerwoman; she had no such ignoble career. She was Mrs.
This, or Dame That, with a recognized place in the village; and all the village traditions
were her possession. The arts of her people--the flower-gardening, the songs and old sayings
and superstitions, the customs of Harvest-time and Christmas--were hers as much as anybody's;
if the stress of work kept her from partaking in them, still she was not shut out from them
by reason of any social inferiority. And so we come back to the point at issue. House-drudgery
might fill the peasant woman's days and years, and yet there was more belonging to it. It was
the core of a fruit: the skeleton of something that was full of warm life. A larger existence
wrapped it in, and on the whole a kindlier one.

In view of all this it is easy to see why the house-duties can no longer be approached in the
old temper, or yield their former satisfaction while they are being done. The larger existence
has been stripped away from them. They do not lead up to happier, more interesting, duties;
they are not preparatory to pleasantness. The washing and scrubbing, the very cooking and needlework,
are but so much trouble awaiting a woman when she gets up in the morning and when she comes
home tired at night; they spoil the leisure that wage-earning should win, and they are undertaken,
not with the idea of getting on to something productive, something that would make the cottage
a more prosperous home, but solely to keep it from degenerating into an entirely offensive
one. There is no hope surrounding these doings.

Nor do they fail only because they have become dissociated from pleasanter work. Even the best
of them are actually less interesting in themselves. Look, for instance, at cooking. That cheap
and coarse food which women now buy because its coarseness makes it cheap is of a quality to
discourage any cook; it is common to the village--the rough rations of the poor; and the trumpery
crocks and tins, the bad coal, and worse fireplaces, do nothing to make the preparation of
it more agreeable. With needlework it is the same story: commercial thrift has degraded that
craft. She must be an enthusiast indeed who would expend any art of the needle upon the shabby
second-hand garments, or the shoddy new ones, which have to content the labourer's wife. And
if the family clothes are not good to make or to mend, neither are they good to wash, or worth
displaying on the clothes-lines in the hope of exciting envy in neighbours.

Not at first, but in due time, inefficiency was added to the other causes which tended to make
housework unpalatable to the women, and of no use to them as an uplifting experience. The inefficiency
could hardly be avoided. The mothers, employed in the fields, had but little chance of teaching
their daughters; and these daughters, growing up, to marry and to follow field-work themselves,
kept their cottages as best they could, by the light of nature. In not a few cases all sense
of an art of well-doing in such matters was lost, and the home became a place to sleep in,
to feed in; not a place in which to try to live well. Perhaps the lowest ebb was reached some
fifteen or twenty years ago. By then that feeling of belonging intimately to the countryside
and sharing its traditions had died out, and nothing had come to replace it. For all practical
purposes there were no traditions, nor were there any true country-folk living a peculiar and
satisfying life of their own. The women had become merely the "hands" or employées of farmers,
struggling to make up money enough every week for a wretched shopping. With health, a joking
humour, and the inevitable habit of self-reliance, they preserved a careless good-temper, and
they had not much time to realize their own plight; but it was, for all that, a squalid life
that many of them led, a neglected life. Only in a very few cottages did there linger any serviceable
memory of better things.

Of late years some recovery is discernible. Field-work, which fostered a blowsy carelessness,
has declined, and at the same time the arrival of "residents" has greatly increased the demand
for charwomen and washerwomen. The women, therefore, find it worth while to cultivate a certain
tidiness in their persons, which extends to their homes. It is true I am told that their ideas
of good housework are often rudimentary in the extreme; that the charwoman does not know when
to change her scrubbing water; that the washerwoman is easily satisfied with quite dubious
results; and I can well believe it. The state of the cottages is betrayed naïvely by the young
girls who go from them into domestic service. "You don't seem to like things sticky," one of
these girls observed to a mistress distressed by sticky door-handles one day and sticky table-knives
the next day. That remark which Richard Jefferies heard a mother address to her daughter, "Gawd
help the poor missus as gets hold o' you!" might very well be applied to many and many a child
of fourteen in this valley, going out, all untrained, to her first "place"; but these things,
indicating what has been and is, do not affect the truth that a slight recovery has occurred.
It is an open question how much of the recovery is a revival of old ideas, called into play
again by new forms of employment. Perhaps more of it is due to experience which the younger
women now bring into the valley when they marry, after being in comfortable domestic service
outside the valley. In other words, perhaps middle-class ideas of decent house-work are at
last coming in, to fill the place left empty by the obsolete peasant ideas.

May we, then, conclude that the women are now in a fair way to do well; that nothing has been
lost which those middle-class ideas cannot make good? In my view the circumstances warrant
no such conclusion. Consider what it is that has to be made good. It is something in the nature
of a civilization. It is the larger existence which enwrapped the peasant woman's house-drudgery
and made it worth while. A good domestic method is all very well, and the middle-class method
is probably better than the old method; but alike in the peasant cottages, and now in middle-class
homes, we may see in domestic work a nucleus only--the core of a fruit, the necessary framework
of a more acceptable life. With the cottage women in the old days that work favoured such developments
of ability and of character as permitted the women to look with complacency upon women bred
in other ways. They experienced no humiliating contrasts. Their household drudgery put within
their reach the full civilization of which it was an organic part. But who can affirm as much
of their household drudgery to-day? Who can pretend that the best accomplishment of it on middle-class
lines admits the cottage woman into the full advantages of middle-class civilization, and enables
her to look without humiliation upon the accomplishments of well-to-do women? I know that villa
ladies and district visitors cling to some such belief, but the notion is false, and may be
dismissed without argument, until the ladies can show that they owe all their own refinement
to the inspiring influences of the washing-tub, and the scrubbing-pail, and the kitchen-range.
The truth is that middle-class domesticity, instead of setting cottage women on the road to
middle-class culture of mind and body, has side-tracked them--has made of them charwomen and
laundresses, so that other women may shirk these duties and be "cultured."

Of course, their wage-earning and their home-work are not the only sources from which ideas
that would explain and beautify life might be obtained by them. The other sources, however,
are of no great value. At school, where (as we have seen) the boys get little enough general
information, the girls have hitherto got less, instruction in needlework and cookery being
given to them in preference to certain more bookish lessons that the boys get. They leave school,
therefore, intellectually most ignorant. Then, in domestic service, again it is in cookery
and that sort of thing that they are practised; there may be culture of thought and taste going
on elsewhere in the house, but they are not admitted to it. Afterwards, marrying, and confronted
with the problem of making both ends meet on eighteen shillings a week, they get experience
indeed of many things, and, becoming mothers, they learn invaluable lessons; yet still the
savoir vivre that should make up for the old peasant cult, the happy outlook, the inspiring
point of view, is not attained. Their best chance is in the ideas and knowledge they may pick
up from their husbands, and if from them they do not learn anything of the best that has been
thought and said in the world, they do not learn it. Of their husbands, in this connection,
there will be something further to be said presently; in the meantime I may leave it to the
reader to judge whether the cottage woman's needs, since the peasant system broke down, are
being well met.

But I must not leave it to be inferred that the women, thus stranded between two civilizations,
are therefore degraded or brutalized. From repeated experience one knows that their sense of
courtesy--of good manners as distinct from merely fashionable or cultured manners--is very
keen: in kindness and good-will they have nothing to learn from anybody, and most of their
"superiors" and would-be teachers might learn from them. Nor would I disparage their improved
housekeeping, as though it had no significance. It may open no doorway for them into middle-class
civilization, but I think it puts their spirits, as it were, on the watch for opportunities
of personal development. I judge by their looks. An expression, not too often seen elsewhere,
rests in the eyes of most of the cottage women--an expression neither self-complacent nor depressed,
nor yet exactly docile, though it is near to that. The interpretation one would put upon it
depends on the phrases one is wont to use. Thus some would say that the women appear to be
reaching out towards "respectability" instead of the blowsy good-temper bred of field-work;
others, more simply, but perhaps more truly, that they are desirous of being "good." But whatever
epithet one gives it, there is the fine look: a look hardly of expectancy--it is not alert
enough for that--but rather of patient quietness and self-possession, the innermost spirit
being held instinctively unsullied, in that receptive state in which a religion, a brave ethic,
would flourish if the seeds of such a thing could be sown there. A hopeful, a generous and
stimulating outlook--that is what must be regained before the loss of the peasant outlook can
be made good to them. They are in want of a view of life that would reinstate them in their
own--yes, and in other people's--estimation; a view of social well-being, not of the village
only, but of all England now, in which they can hold the position proper to women who are wives
and mothers.

And this, vague though it is, shows up some of the more pressing needs of the moment. Above
all things the economic state of the cottage-women requires improvement. There must be some
definite leisure for them, and they must be freed from the miserable struggle with imminent
destitution, if they are to find the time and the mental tranquillity for viewing life largely.
But leisure is not all. They need, further, an education to enable them to form an outlook
fit for themselves; for nobody else can provide them with such an outlook. The middle-classes
certainly are not qualified to be their teachers. It may be said at once that the attempts
of working-women here and there to emulate women of the idle classes are of no use to themselves
and reflect small credit on those they imitate. In this connection some very curious things--the
product of leisure and no outlook--are to be seen in the village. That objectionable yet funny
cult of "superiority," upon which the "resident" ladies of the valley spend so much emotion,
if not much thought, has its disciples in the cottages; and now and then the prosperous wife
or daughter of some artisan or other gives herself airs, and does not "know," or will not "mix
with," the wives and daughters of mere labourers in the neighbouring cottages. Whether women
of this aspiring type find their reward, or mere bitterness, in the patronage of still higher
women who are intimate with the clergy is more than I can say. The aspiration has nothing to
do with that "religion," that new ethic, which I have just claimed to be the thing ultimately
needed, before the loss of the peasant system can be made up to the women.

XVIII

THE WANT OF BOOK-LEARNING

Some light was thrown on the more specific needs of the village by an experiment in which I
had a share from ten to thirteen years ago. The absence of any reasonable pastime for the younger
people suggested it. At night one saw boys and young men loafing and shivering under the lamp
outside the public-house doors, or in the glimmer that shone across the road from the windows
of the one or two village shops. They had nothing to do there but to stand where they could
just see one another and try to be witty at one another's expense, or at the expense of any
passers-by--especially of women--who might be considered safe game: that was their only way
of spending the evenings and at the same time enjoying a little human companionship. True,
the County Council had lately instituted evening classes for "technical education" in the elementary
schools; but these classes were of no very attractive nature, and at best they occupied only
two evenings a week. As many as twenty or five-and-twenty youths, however, attended them, glad
of the warmth and light, though bored by the instruction. They were mischievous and inattentive;
they kept close watch on the clock, and as soon as half-past nine came they were up and off
helter-skelter, as if the gloomy precincts of the shop or the public-house were, after all,
less irksome than the night-school.

There was no recreation whatever for the growing girls, none for the grown-up women; nothing
but the public-house for the men, unless one excepts the two or three occasions during the
winter when the more well-to-do residents chose to give an entertainment in the schoolroom,
and admitted the poor into the cheaper seats. Everybody knows the nature of these functions.
There were readings and recitations; young ladies sang drawing-room songs or played the violin;
tableaux were displayed or a polite farce was performed; a complimentary speech wound up the
entertainment; and then the performers withdrew again for several months into the aloofness
of their residences, while the poor got through their winter evenings as best they could, in
their mean cottages or under the lamp outside the public-house.

It was in full view of these circumstances that an "Entertainment Club" was started, with the
idea of inducing the cottage people to help themselves in the matter of recreation instead
of waiting until it should please others to come and amuse them. I am astonished now to think
how democratic the club contrived to be. In the fortnightly programmes which were arranged
the performers were almost exclusively of the wage-earning sort, and offers of help from "superior
people" were firmly declined. And for at least one, and, I think, two winters, the experiment
was wildly successful--so successful that, to the best of my recollection, the "gentry" were
crowded out, and gave no entertainments at all. But the enthusiasm could not last. During the
third winter decay set in, and early in the fourth the club, although with funds in hand, ceased
its activities, leaving the field open, as it has since remained, to the recognized exponents
of leisured culture.

The fact is, it died of their culture, or of a reflection of it. At the first nobody had cared
a straw about artistic excellence. The homely or grotesque accomplishments of the village found
their way surprisingly on to a public platform, and were not laughed to scorn; anyone who could
sing a song or play a musical instrument--it mattered not what--was welcomed and applauded.
But how could it go on? The people able to do anything at all were not many, and when their
repertory of songs learnt by ear was exhausted, there was nothing new forthcoming. Gradually,
therefore, the club began to depend on the few members with a smattering of middle-class attainments;
and they, imitating the rich--asking for piano accompaniments to their singing, and so on--at
the same time gave themselves airs of superiority to the crowd. And that was fatal. The less
cultivated behaved in the manner usual to them where there is any unwarrantable condescension
going--that is to say, they kept out of the way of it, until, finally, the performers and organizers
had the club almost to themselves. From the outset the strong labouring men had contemptuously
refused to have anything to do with what was often, I admit, a foolish and "gassy" affair;
but their wives and sons and daughters had been very well pleased, until the taint of superiority
drove them away. The club died when its democratic character was lost.

Yet, though I was glad to have done with it, I have never regretted the experience. It is easy
now to see the absurdity of my idea, but at that time I knew less than I do now of the labouring
people's condition, and in furthering the movement I entertained a shadowy hope of finding
amongst the illiterate villagers some fragment or other of primitive art. It is almost superfluous
to say that nothing of the sort was found. My neighbours had no arts of their own. For any
refreshment of that kind they were dependent on the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table,
or on such cheap refuse as had come into the village from London music-halls or from the canteens
at Aldershot. Street pianos in the neighbouring town supplied them with popular airs, which
they reproduced--it may be judged with what amazing effect--on flute or accordion; but the
repertory of songs was filled chiefly from the sources just mentioned. The young men--the shyest
creatures in the country, and the most sensitive to ridicule--found safety in comic songs which,
if produced badly, raised but the greater laugh. Only once or twice were these songs imprudently
chosen; as a rule, they dealt with somebody's misfortunes or discomforts, in a humorous, practical-joking
spirit, and so came nearer, probably, to the expression of a genuine village sentiment than
anything else that was done. But for all that they were an imported product. Instead of an
indigenous folk-art, with its roots in the traditional village life, I found nothing but worthless
forms of modern art which left the people's taste quite unfed. Once, it is true, a hint came
that, democratic though the club might be, it was possibly not democratic enough. A youth mentioned
that at home one evening he and his family had sat round the table singing songs, out of song-books,
I think. It suggested that there might still lurk in the neglected cottages a form of artistic
enjoyment more crude than anything that had come to light, and perhaps more native to the village.
But I have no belief that it was so. Before I could inquire further, this boy dropped out of
the movement. When asked why he had not come to one entertainment, he said that he had been
sent off late in the afternoon to take two horses miles away down the country--I forget where--and
had been on the road most of the night. A few weeks afterwards, turning eighteen, he went to
Aldershot and enlisted. So far as I remember, he was the only boy of the true labouring class
who ever took any active part in the proceedings--he performed once in a farce. The other lads,
although some were sons of labourers and grandsons of peasants, were of those who had been
apprenticed to trades, and therefore knew a little more than mere labourers, though I do not
say that they were more intelligent by nature.

If, however, they were the pick of the village youth, the fact only makes the more impressive
certain truths which forced themselves upon my notice at that time with regard to the needs
of the village since the old peasant habits had vanished. There was no mistaking it: intercourse
with these young men showed only too plainly how slow modern civilization had been to follow
modern methods of industry and thrift. Understand, they were well-intentioned and enterprising
fellows. They had begun to look beyond the bounds of this parish, and to seek for adaptations
to the larger world. Moreover, they were learning trades--those very trades which have since
been introduced into our elementary schools as a means of quickening the children's intellectual
powers. But these youths somehow had not drawn enlightenment from their trades, being, in fact,
handicapped all the time by the want of quite a different education. To put it rather brutally,
they did not understand their own language--the standard English language in which modern thinking
has to go on in this country.

For several of the entertainments they came forward to perform farces. After the first diffidence
had worn off, they took a keen delight in the preparations, working hard and cordially; they
were singularly ready to be shown what to do, and to be criticized. "Knock-about" farce--the
counterpart in drama of their comic songs--pleased them best, and they did well in it. But
"Box and Cox" was almost beyond them, because they missed the meanings of the rather stilted
dialogue. In helping to coach them in their parts I had the best of opportunities to know this.
They produced a resemblance to the sound of the sentences, and were satisfied, though they
missed the sense. Instead of saying that he "divested" himself of his clothing, Mr. Box--or
was it Cox?--said that he "invested" himself, and no correction could cure him of saying that.
When one of them came to describing the lady's desperate wooing of him, "to escape her importunities"
is what he should have said; but what he did say was "to escape our opportunities"--an error
which the audience, fortunately, failed to notice, for it slipped out again at the time of
performance, after having been repeatedly put right at rehearsal. And this sort of thing happened
all through the piece. Almost invariably the points which depended on a turn of phrase were
lost. "I at once give you warning that I give you warning at once" became, "I at once give
you warning. That is, I give you warning at once." Cox (or Box) reading the lawyer's letter,
never made out the following passage: "I soon discovered her will, the following extract from
which will, I am sure, give you satisfaction." It was plain that he thought the second word
"will" meant the same as the first.

As evidence of a lack of "book-learning" in the village, this might have been insufficient,
had it stood alone. But it did not. The misbehaviour of the boys at the night-school has been
mentioned. Being a member of the school managing committee, I went in to the school occasionally,
and what I saw left me satisfied that a large part of the master's difficulty arose from the
unfamiliarity of the scholars with their own language. That initial ignorance blocked the road
to science even more completely than, in the Entertainment Club, it did to art. "The Science
of Horticulture" was the subject of the lesson on one dismal evening, this being the likeliest
of some half-dozen "practical sciences" prescribed for village choice by the educational authority
at Whitehall. About twenty "students," ranging from sixteen to nineteen years old, were--no,
not puzzling over it: they were "putting in time" as perfunctorily as they dared, making the
lesson an excuse for being present together in a warmed and lighted room. When I went in it
was near the close of the evening; new matter was being entered upon, apparently as an introduction
to the next week's lesson. I stood and watched. The master called upon first one, then another,
to read aloud a sentence or two out of the textbook with which each was provided; and one after
another the boys stood up, shamefaced or dogged, to stumble through sentences which seemed
to convey absolutely no meaning to them. If it had been only the hard words that floored them--such
as "cotyledon" and "dicotyledon"--I should not have been surprised; but they blundered over
the ordinary English, and had next to no sense of the meaning of punctuation. I admit that
probably they were not trying to do their best; that they might have put on a little intentional
clumsiness, in the instinctive hope of escaping derision by being thought waggish. But the
pity of it was that they should need to protect themselves so. They had not the rudimentary
accomplishment: that was the plain truth. They could not understand ordinary printed English.

Of science, of course, they were learning nothing. They may have taken away from those lessons
a few elementary scientific terms, and possibly they got hold of the idea of the existence
of some mysterious knowledge that was not known in the village; but the advantage ended there.
I doubt if a single member of the class had begun to use his brain in a scientific way, reasoning
from cause to effect; I doubt if it dawned upon one of them that there was such an unheard-of
accomplishment to be acquired. They were trying--if they were trying anything at all--to pick
up modern science in the folk manner, by rote, as though it were a thing to be handed down
by tradition. So at least I infer, not only from watching this particular class then and on
other occasions, but also from the following circumstance.

At Christmastime in one of these winters a few of the boys of the night-school went round the
village, mumming. They performed the same old piece that Mr. Hardy has described in "The Return
of the Native"--the same old piece that, as a little child, I witnessed years ago in a real
village; but it had degenerated lamentably. The boys said that they had learnt it from an elder
brother of one of them, and had practised it in a shed; and at my request the leader consented
to write out the piece, and in due time he brought me his copy. I have mislaid the thing, and
write from memory; but I recall enough of it to affirm that he had never understood, or even
cared to fix a meaning to, the words--or sounds, rather--which he and his companions had gabbled
through as they prowled around the kitchen clashing their wooden swords. That St. George had
become King William was natural enough; but what is to be said of changing the Turkish Knight
into the Turkey Snipe? That was one of the "howlers" this youth perpetrated, amongst many others
less striking, perhaps, but not less instructive. The whole thing showed plainly where the
difficulty lay at the night-school. The breaking up of the traditional life of the village
had failed to supply the boys either with the language or with the mental habits necessary
for living successfully under the new conditions. Some of these boys were probably the sons
of parents unable to read and write; none of them came from families where those accomplishments
were habitually practised or much esteemed.

The argument, thus illustrated by the state of the boys, extends in its application to practically
the whole of the village. "Book-learning" had been very unimportant to the peasant with his
traditional lore, but it would be hard to exaggerate the handicap against which the modern
labourer strives, for want of it. Look once more at his position. In the new circumstance the
man lives in an environment never dreamt of by the peasant. Economic influences affecting him
most closely come, as it were, vibrating upon him from across the sea. Vast commercial and
social movements, unfelt in the valley under the old system, are altering all its character;
instead of being one of a group of villagers tolerably independent of the rest of the world,
he is entangled in a network of economic forces as wide as the nation; and yet, to hold his
own in this new environment, he has no new guidance. Parochial customs and the traditions of
the village make up the chief part of his equipment.

But for national intercourse parochial customs and traditions are almost worse than none at
all--like a Babel of Tongues. National standards have to be set up. We cannot, for instance,
deal in Winchester quarts and Cheshire acres, in long hundreds and baker's dozens; we have
no use for weights and measures that vary from county to county, or for a token coinage that
is only valid in one town or in one trade. But most of all, for making our modern arrangements
a standard English language is so necessary that those who are unfamiliar with it can neither
manage their own affairs efficiently nor take their proper share in the national life.

And this is the situation of the labourer to-day. The weakness of it, moreover, is in almost
daily evidence. One would have thought that at least in a man's own parish and his own private
concerns illiteracy would be no disadvantage; yet, in fact, it hampers him on every side. Whether
he would join a benefit society, or obtain poor-law relief, or insure the lives of his children,
or bury his dead, or take up a small holding, he finds that he must follow a nationalized or
standardized procedure, set forth in language which his forefathers never heard spoken and
never learned to read. Even in the things that are really of the village the same conditions
prevail. The slate-club is managed upon lines as businesslike as those of the national benefit
society. The "Institute" has its secretary, and treasurer, and balance-sheet, and printed rules;
the very cricket club is controlled by resolutions proposed and seconded at formal committee
meetings, and duly entered in minute-books. But all this is a new thing in the village, and
no guidance for it is to be found in the lingering peasant traditions.

To this day, therefore, the majority of my neighbours, whose ability for the work they have
been prepared to do proves them to be no fools, are, nevertheless, pitiably helpless in the
management of their own affairs. Most disheartening it is, too, for those whose help they seek,
to work with them. In the cricket-club committee, on which I served for a year or two, it was
noticeable that the members, eager for proper arrangements to be made, often sat tongue-tied
and glum, incapable of urging their views, so that only after the meeting had broken up and
they had begun talking with one another did one learn that the resolutions which had been passed
were not to their mind. Formalities puzzled them--seemed to strike them as futilities. And
so in other matters besides cricket. A local builder--a man of blameless integrity--had a curious
experience. Somewhat against his wishes, he was appointed treasurer of the village Lodge of
Oddfellows; but when, inheriting a considerable sum of money, he began to buy land and build
houses, nothing would persuade the illiterate members of the society that he was not speculating
with their funds. Audited accounts had no meaning for them; possibly the fact that he was doing
a service for no pay struck them as suspicious; at any rate they murmured so openly that he
threw up his office. Whom they have got in his place, and whether they are suspicious of him
too, I do not know. My point is that, while modern thrift obliges them to enter into these
fellowships, they remain, for mere want of book-learning, unable to help themselves, and dependent
on the aid of friends from the middle or employing classes. In other words, the greater number
of the Englishmen in the village have to stand aside and see their own affairs controlled for
them by outsiders.

This is so wholly the case in some matters that nobody ever dreams of consulting the people
who are chiefly concerned in them. In the education of their children, for one thing, they
have no voice at all. It is administered in a standardized form by a committee of middle-class
people appointed in the neighbouring town, who carry out provisions which originate from unapproachable
permanent officials at Whitehall. The County Council may modify the programme a little; His
Majesty's inspectors--strangers to the people, and ignorant of their needs--issue fiats in
the form of advice to the school teachers; and meanwhile the parents of the children acquiesce,
not always approving what is done, but accepting it as if it were a law of fate that all such
things must be arranged over their heads by the classes who have book-learning.

And this customary attitude of waiting for what the "educated" may do for them renders them
apathetic where they might be, and where it is highly important that they should be, reliant
upon their own initiative--I mean, in political action. The majority of the labourers in the
village have extremely crude ideas of representative government. A candidate for Parliament
is not, in their eyes, a servant whom they may appoint to give voice to their own wishes; he
is a "gentleman" who, probably from motives of self-interest, comes to them as a sort of quack
doctor, with occult remedies, which they may have if they will vote for him, and which might
possibly do them good. Hence they hardly look upon the Government as an instrument at all under
the control of people like themselves; they view it, rather, as a sort of benevolent tyranny,
whose constitution is no concern of theirs. Commons or Lords, Liberals or Tories--what does
it matter to the labourer which of them has the power, so long as one or other will cast an
occasional look in his direction, and try to do something or other to help him? What they should
do rests with the politicians: it is their part to suggest, the labourer's to acquiesce.

Such are some of the more obvious disabilities from which the cottage people suffer, largely
for want of book-learning. I think, however, that they are beginning to be aware of the disadvantage,
for, though they say little about it, I have heard of several men getting their children to
teach them, in the evening, the lessons learnt at school during the day. Certainly the old
contempt for "book-learning" is dying out. And now and then one hears the most ingenuous confessions
of incompetence to understand matters of admitted interest. An old woman, discussing "Tariff
Reform," said: "We sort o' people can't understand it for ourselves. What we wants is for somebody
to come and explain it to us. And then," she added, "we dunno whether we dares believe what
they says." If you could hear one even of the better-taught labourers trying to read out something
from a newspaper, you would appreciate his difficulties. He goes too slowly to get the sense;
the end of a paragraph is too far off from the beginning of it; the thread of the argument
is lost sight of. An allusion, a metaphor, a parenthesis, may easily make nonsense of the whole
thing to a reader who has never heard of the subject alluded to, or of the images called up
by the metaphor, and whose mind is unaccustomed to those actions of pausing circumspection
which a parenthesis demands.

EMOTIONAL STARVATION

Remembering the tales which get into the papers now and then of riot amongst the "high-spirited
young gentlemen" at the Universities, I am a little unwilling to say more about the unruliness
of our village youths, as though it were something peculiar to their rank of life. Yet it must
not be quite passed over. To be sure, not all the village lads, any more than all undergraduates,
are turbulent and mischievous; yet here, as at Oxford, there is a minority who apparently think
it manly to be insubordinate and to give trouble, while here, just as there, the better sense
of the majority is too feeble to make up a public opinion which the offenders would be afraid
to defy. The disorder of the village lads was noticeable long ago at the night-school; for
example, on an evening shortly after the "Khaki" election, when Mr. Brodrick (now Lord Midleton)
had been re-elected for this division. On that evening a lecture on Norway, illustrated by
lantern slides, could hardly be got through owing to the liveliness of a few lads, who amused
all their comrades by letting off volleys of electioneering cries. I have forgotten who the
lecturer was, but I remember well how the shouts of "Good old Brodrick!" often prevailed, so
that one could not hear the man's voice. Since then there have been more striking examples
of the same sort of vivacity. Not two winters ago the weekly meetings of a "boys' club," which
aimed only to help the village lads pass an evening sensibly, had to be abandoned, owing to
the impossible behaviour of the members. One week I heard that they had run amok amongst the
furniture of the schoolroom where the meetings were held; on the next, they blew out the lamps,
and locked one of the organizers into the room for an hour; and a week or two afterwards they
piled window-curtains and door-mats on to the fire, and nearly got the building ablaze. In
short, to judge from what was told me, there seems to have been little to distinguish them
from frolicsome undergraduates, save their poverty-stricken clothes and their unaspirated speech.
It is true they kept their excesses within doors, but then, they had no influential relatives
to take their part against an interfering police force; and moreover, most of them came to
the meetings a little subdued by ten hours or so of work at wage-earning. Still, their "high
spirits" were in evidence, uncontrolled--just as elsewhere--by any high sentiment. The sense
of personal responsibility for their actions, the power to understand that there is such a
thing as "playing the game" even towards people in authority or towards the general public,
seemed to be as foreign to them as if they had never had to soil their hands with hard work.

Whatever may be the case with others, in the village lads a merely intellectual unpreparedness
is doubtless partly accountable for this behaviour. The villagers having had no previous experience
of action in groups, unless under compulsion like that of the railway-ganger or of the schoolmaster
with his cane, it is strange now to the boys to find themselves at a school where there is
no compulsion, but all is left to their voluntary effort. And stranger still is the club. A
formal society, dependent wholly on the loyal co-operation of its members and yet enforcing
no obvious discipline upon them, is a novelty in village life. The idea of it is an abstraction,
and because the old-fashioned half-peasant people fifty years ago never needed to think about
abstractions at all, it turns out now that no family habit of mind for grasping such ideas
has come down from them to their grandsons.

This mental inefficiency, however, is only a form--a definite form for once--of a more vague
but more prevalent backwardness. The fact is that the old ideas of conduct in general are altogether
too restricted for the new requirements, so that the village life suffers throughout from a
sort of ethical starvation. I gladly admit that, for the day's work and its hardships, the
surviving sentiments in favour of industry, patience, good-humour, and so on, still are strong;
and I do not forget the admirable spirit of the cottage women in particular; yet it is true
that for the wider experiences of modern life other sentiments or ideals, in addition to those
of the peasants, need development, and that progress in them is behindhand in the village.
What the misbehaviour of the village boys illustrates in one direction may be seen in other
directions amongst the men and women and children.

Like other people, the cottagers have their emotional susceptibilities, which, however, are
either more robust than other people's or else more sluggish. At any rate it takes more than
a little to disturb them. During last winter I heard of a man--certainly he was one of the
older sort, good at many an obsolete rural craft--who had had chilblains burst on his fingers,
and had sewn up the wounds himself with needle and cotton. There is no suspicion of inhumanity
against him, yet it seemed to me that in fiercer times he would have made a willing torturer;
and other little incidents--all of them recent ones too--came back to my mind when I heard
of him. In one of these a servant-girl from the village was concerned--a quiet and timid girl
she was said to be; yet, on her own initiative, and without consulting her mistress, she drowned
a stray cat which was trying to get a footing in the household. Again, I myself heard and wondered
at the happy prattle of two little girls--the children, they, of a most conscientious man and
woman--as they told of the fun they had enjoyed, along with their father and mother, in watching
a dog worry a hedgehog. And yet it is plain enough that the faculty for compassion and kindness
is inborn in the villagers, so that their susceptibilities might just as well be keen as blunt.
In their behaviour to their pets the gentle hands and the caressing voices betoken a great
natural aptitude for tenderness. And not to their pets only. All one afternoon I heard, proceeding
from a pig-stye, the voice of an elderly man who was watching an ailing sow there. "Come on,
ol' gal ... come on, ol' gal," he said, over and over again in tireless repetition, as sympathetically
as if he were talking to a child. Where the people fail in sensitiveness is from a want of
imagination, as we say, though we should say, rather, a want of suppleness in their ideas.
They can sympathize when their own dog or cat is suffering, because use has wakened up their
powers in that direction; but they do not abstract the idea of suffering life and apply it
to the tormented hedgehog, because their ideas have not been practised upon imagined or non-existent
things in such a way as to become, as it were, a detached power of understanding, generally
applicable.

But is it to be wondered at if some unlovely features appear in the village character? Or is
it not rather a circumstance to give one pause, that these commercially unsuccessful and socially
neglected people, whose large families the self-satisfied eugenist views with such solemn misgivings,
should be in the main so kindly, so generous, and sometimes so lofty in their sentiments as
in fact they are? With like disadvantages, where are there any other people in the country
who would do so bravely? If it is clear that they miss a rich development of their susceptibilities,
a reason why is no less clear. I have just hinted at it. The ample explanation is in the fact
that they have hardly any imaginary or non-existent subjects upon which to exercise emotional
sensibility for its own sake, so that it may grow strong and fine by frequent practice; but
they have to wait for some real thing to move them--some distressful occurrence in the valley
itself, like that mentioned earlier in this book, when a man trimming a hedge all but killed
his own child, and a thrill of horror shuddered through the cottages. Of matters like this
the people talk with an excited fascination, there being so little else to stir them. Instead
of the moving accident by flood or field, they have the squalid or merely agonizing accident.
Sickness amongst friends or neighbours affords another topic upon which their emotion seeks
exercise: they linger over the discussion of it, talking in moaning tones instinctively intended
to stimulate feeling. Then there are police-court cases. Some man gets drunk, and is fined;
or cannot pay his rent, and is turned out of his cottage; or misbehaves in such a way that
he is sent to gaol. The talk of it threads its swift way about the village--goes into intimate
details, too, relating how the culprit's wife "took on" when her man was sentenced; or how
his children suffer; or perhaps how the magistrates bullied him, or how he insulted the prosecuting
lawyer.

It is natural that the people should be greedy readers (when they can read at all) of the sensational
matter supplied by newspapers. Earthquakes, railway disasters, floods, hurricanes, excite them
not really disagreeably. So, too, does it animate them to hear of prodigies and freaks of Nature,
as when, a little while ago, the papers told of a man whose flesh turned "like marble," so
that he could not bend his limbs for fear lest they should snap. Anything to wonder at will
serve; anything about which they can exclaim. That feeling of the crowd when fireworks call
forth the fervent "O-oh!" of admiration, is the village feeling which delights in portents
of whatever kind. But nothing else is quite so effectual to that end as are crimes of violence,
and especially murder. For, after all, it is the human element that counts; and these descendants
of peasants, having no fictitious means of acquainting themselves with human passion and sentiment,
such as novels and dramas supply in such abundance to other people, turn with all the more
avidity to the unchosen and unprepared food furnished to their starving faculties by contemporary
crime.

There is, indeed, another side to their sensationalism which should be noticed. I was a little
startled some years ago by a scrap of conversation between two women. The papers at that time
were full of a murder which had been committed in a village neighbouring this, the young man
accused of it being even then on his trial. It was in the evidence that he had visited his
home quite an hour after the time when the deed must have been done, and these women were discussing
that point, one of them saying: "I don't believe my boy would ha' come 'ome that Sunday night
if he'd ha' done it." It was surprising to me to hear a respectable mother speculate as to
how her own son would behave in such a case, or contemplate even the possibility of his being
guilty of murder; and I thought it all too practical a way of considering the subject. But
it revealed how appallingly real such things may be to people who, as I tried to show farther
back, have reason to feel a little like an alien race under our middle-class law. Very often
one may discern this personal or practical point of view in their sensationalism: they indulge
it chiefly for the sake of excitement, but with a side glance at the bearing which the issue
may have upon their own affairs. In a foul case which was dealt with under the Criminal Law
Amendment Act, large numbers of our cottage women flocked to the town to hear the trial, attracted
partly by the hope of sensation, of course, but also very largely actuated by a sentiment of
revenge against the offender; for here the safety of their own young daughters was involved.

Be this as it may, still it is true that the two sources I have mentioned--namely, the sensational
news in the papers and the distresses and misdemeanours in the village itself--supply practically
all that the average cottager gets to touch his sentiments and emotions into life; and it is
plain enough that from neither of these sources, even when supplemented by a fine traditional
family life, can a very desirable spiritual nourishment be obtained. "Real" enough the fare
is, in all conscience; but, as usual with realities of that sort, it wants choiceness. It provides
plenty of objects for compassion, for anxiety, for contempt, for ridicule even, but very little
for emulation, for reverence. The sentiments of admiration and chivalry, the enthusiastic emotions,
are hardly ever aroused in man or woman, boy or girl, in the village. Nothing occurs in the
natural course to bring what is called "good form" into notice and make it attractive, and
at the same time the means of bringing this about by art demand more money, more leisure and
seclusion, more book-learning too, than the average labourer can obtain. In the middle-classes
this is not the case. It is true that the middle-classes have little to boast of in this respect,
but generous ideas of modesty and reverence, and of "playing the game," and of public duty,
and of respect for womanhood, have at least a chance of spreading amongst boys and girls, in
households where art and books are valued, and where other things are talked of than the sordid
scandals of the valley and of the police-courts. The difference that the want of this help
may make was brought forcibly home to me one day. I came upon a group of village boys at play
in the road, just as one of them--a fellow about thirteen years old--conceived a bright idea
for a new game. "Now I'll be a murderer!" he cried, waving his arms ferociously.

There are other circumstances that tend to keep the standard of sentiment low. As the boys
begin to work for money at so early an age, the money-value of conduct impresses itself strongly
upon them, and they soon learn to think more of what they can get than of what they can do
or are worth. And while they have lost all the steadying influence that used to flow from the
old peasant crafts, they get none of the steadiness which would come from continuity of employment.
The work they do as errand-boys calls neither for skill in which they might take pride nor
for constancy to any one master; but it encourages them to be mannish and "knowing" long before
their time. Of course the more generous sentiments are at a discount under such conditions.

Then, too, there can be little doubt that the "superior" attitude of the employing classes
has its injurious effect upon the village character. The youth who sees his father and mother
and sisters treated as inferiors, and finds that he is treated so too, is led unconsciously
to take a low view of what is due either to himself or to his friends. The sort of view he
takes may be seen in his behaviour. The gangs of boys who troop and lounge about the roads
on Sundays are generally being merely silly in the endeavour to be witty. They laugh loudly,
yet not humorously and kindly (one very rarely hears really jolly laughter in the village),
but in derision of one another or of the wayfarers--girls by preference. So far as one can
overhear it, their fun is always of that contumacious character, and it must be deadly to any
sentiment of modesty, or honour, or reverence.

It requires but little penetration to see how these circumstances react upon the village girls.
The frolicsome and giddy appear to enjoy themselves much as the boys do, but the position must
be cruel to those of a serious tendency. To be treated with disrespect and be made the subjects
of rough wit as they go about is only the more acute part of their difficulty. One may suppose
that at home they find little appreciation of any high sentiments, but are driven, in self-defence,
to be rather flippant, rather "worldly." The greater number of house mistresses, meanwhile,
if one may judge from their own complacent conversation, behave in a way most unlikely to contribute
to their servants' self-respect. It is hard to believe that any really high sentiment is to
be learnt from women who, for all the world as if they were village louts, make light of a
girl's feelings, and regard her love-affairs especially as a proper subject for ridicule or
for suspicion.

XX

THE CHILDREN'S NEED

As one of the managing committee of the village schools for a good many years, I have had considerable
opportunity of watching the children collectively. The circumstances, perhaps, are not altogether
favourable to the formation of trustworthy opinions. Seen in large numbers, and under discipline
too, the children look too much alike; one misses the infinite variety of their personalities
such as would appear in them at home. On the other hand, characteristics common to them all,
which might pass unnoticed in individuals, become obvious enough when there are many children
together.

In the main the "stock" has always seemed to me good, and to some extent my impression is supported
by the results of the medical inspection now undertaken at the schools by the County Council.
Such defects as the doctor finds are generally of no deep-seated kind: bad teeth, faulty vision
(often due, probably, to improper use of the eyes in school), scalp troubles, running ears,
adenoids, and so on, are the commonest. Insufficient nutrition is occasionally reported. In
fact the medical evidence tells, in a varied form, much the same tale that school managers
have been able to read for themselves in the children's dilapidated boots and clothes, and
their grimy hands and uncared-for hair, for it all indicates poverty at home, want of convenience
for decent living, and ignorance as well as carelessness in the parents. All this we have known,
but now we learn from the doctor that the evil effects of these causes do not stop at the clothes
and skin, but go a little deeper. Yet probably they have not hurt the essential nature of the
children. Congenital defects are rare; the doctor discovers even a high average of constitutional
fitness, due, it may be, to severe "natural" selection weeding out the more delicate. It is
certain that the village produces quite a fair proportion of really handsome children, besides
those of several of the old families, who are wont to be of exceptional beauty. Unhappily,
before the school-years are over, the fineness usually begins to disappear, being spoilt, I
suspect, partly by the privations of the home-life and partly by another cause, of which I
will speak by-and-by.

I think, further--but it is only a vague impression, not worth much attention--that as regards
physique the girls are as a rule more thriving and comely than the boys. The latter appear
very apt to become knottled and hard, and there is a want of generosity in their growth, as
though they received less care than the girls, and were more used to going hungry, and being
cold and wet. But if my impression is right, there are two points to be noticed in further
explanation of it. The first point relates to the early age at which the boys begin to be useful
at work. It has been already told how soon they are set to earn a little money out of school-hours;
but even before that stage is reached the little boys have to make themselves handy. On the
Saturday holiday it is no uncommon thing to see a boy of eight or nine pushing up the hill
a little truck loaded with coal or coke, which he has been sent to buy at the railway yard.
Smaller ones still are sent to the shops, and not seldom they are really overloaded. Thus at
an age when boys in better circumstances are hardly allowed out alone, these village children
practise perforce a considerable self-reliance, and become acquainted with the fatigue of labour.
Some little chaps, as they go about their duties--leading lesser brothers by the hand perhaps,
or perhaps dealing very sternly with them, and making them "keep up" without help--have unawares
the manner of responsible men.

That is one point which may help to account for the apparent physical disparity between the
boys and girls of the village. The other is a subject of remark amongst all who know the school-children.
There is no doubt about it; whether the girls are comelier of growth than the boys or not,
they are in behaviour so much more civilized that one might almost suppose them to come from
different homes. To my mind this might be sufficiently explained by the fact that they are
usually spared those burdensome errands and responsibilities which are thrust so soon upon
their brothers; but the schoolmaster has another explanation, which probably contains some
truth. His view is that at home the girls come chiefly under the influence of their mothers,
whose experience of domestic service gives them an idea of manners, while the boys take pattern
from their fathers, whose work encourages roughness. Whatever the cause, the fact remains:
the boys may be physically as sound as the girls, but they certainly have less charm. It is
not often delightful to see them. They do not stand up well; they walk in a slouching and narrow-chested
way; and, though they are mischievous enough, there is strangely wanting in them an air of
alertness, of vivacity, of delight in life. There is no doubt that their heavily-ironed and
ill-fitting boots cause them to walk badly; yet it is only reasonable to suppose that this
is but one amongst many difficulties, and that, in general, the conditions in which the boys
live are unfavourable to a good physical growth.

As regards intellectual power, in boys and girls too, the evidence--to be quite frank--does
not bear out all that I wish to believe; for, in spite of appearances, I am not yet persuaded
that these cottage children are by birth more dull of wit than town-bred children and those
in better circumstances. It must be remembered that in this village, so near as it is to a
town, there has been little of that migration to towns which is said to have depleted other
villages of their cleverer people. A few lads go to sea, more than a few into the army; some
of the girls marry outside, and are lost to the parish. But it would be easy to go through
the valley and find, in cottage after cottage, the numerous descendants of old families that
flourished here, and were certainly not deficient in natural brain-power, two generations ago,
although it was not developed in them on modern lines. Nor need one go back two generations.
To be acquainted with the fathers and mothers of the school-children is to know people whose
minds are good enough by nature, and are only wanting in acquired power; and when, aware of
this, one goes into the school and sees the children of these parents, some of them very graceful,
with well-shaped heads and eyes that can sparkle and lips that can break into handsome, laughing
curves, it is very hard to believe that the breed is dull. The stupidity is more likely due
merely to imperfect nurture; at any rate, one should not accept an explanation of it that disparages
the village capacity for intelligence until it is made clear that the state of the children
cannot be explained in any other way.

Leaving explanations aside, however, there is the fact, not to be gainsaid, that the children
in general are slow of wit. One notes it in the infant school first, and especially in the
very youngest classes. There, newly come from their mother's care, the small boys and girls
from five to six years old have often a wonderfully vacant expression. There is little of that
speculative dancing of the eyes, that evident appetite for perceptions and ideas, which you
will find in well-to-do nurseries and playrooms. And whereas in the latter circumstances children
will take up pencil or paintbrush confidently, as if born to master those tools, the village
infant is hesitating, clumsy, feeble. Upon the removal of a child to the upper or "mixed" school,
a certain increase of intelligence often seems to come at a bound. The circumstance is highly
suggestive. The "infant" of seven is suddenly brought into contact with older scholars already
familiarized with particular groups of ideas, and those ideas are speedily absorbed by the
little ones, while the swifter methods of teaching also have their quickening effect, for a
time. But after this jump has been made and lost sight of--that is to say amongst the older
scholars, who do not again meet with such a marked change of environment--one is again aware
of considerable mental density throughout the school. The children resemble their parents.
They are quick enough to observe details, though not always the details with which the teacher
is concerned, but they have very little power of dealing with the simplest abstractions. They
are clumsy in putting two thoughts together for comparison; clumsy in following reasons, or
in discussing underlying principles. In short, "thinking" is an art they hardly begin to practise.
They can learn and apply a "rule of thumb," a folk-rule, so to speak--but there is no flow,
nor anything truly consecutive, in the movement of their ideas. Elsewhere one may hear children
of six or seven--little well-cared-for people--keep up a continual stream of intelligent and
happy talk with their parents or nursemaids; but to the best of my belief this does not happen
amongst the village children, at any age.

Observations of them at play, in the cottage gardens or on the road, throw some light on their
condition. It would appear that they are extremely ill-supplied with subjects to think about.
In the exercise of imagination, other children fall naturally into habits of consecutive thought,
or at any rate of consecutive fancy; but these of the labouring class have hardly any ideas
which their young brains could play with, other than those derived from their own experience
of real life in the valley, or those which they hear spoken of at home. Hence in their histrionic
games of "pretending" it is but a very limited repertory of parts that they can take. Two or
three times I have come upon a little group of them under a hedgerow or sun-warmed bank, playing
at school; the teacher being delightfully severe, and the scholars delightfully naughty. And
now and again there is a feeble attempt at playing soldiers. Very often, too, one may see boys,
in string harness, happy in being very mettlesome horses. In one case a subtle variant of this
game inspired two small urchins to what was, perhaps, as good an imaginative effort as I have
met with in the village. The horse, instead of being frisky, was being slow, so that the driver
had to swear at him. And most vindictive and raucous was the infant voice that I heard saying,
"Git up, you blasted lazy cart-'orse!" Other animals are sometimes represented. With a realistic
grunt, a little boy, beaming all over his face, said to his companion, "Now I'll be your pig."
Another day it puzzled me to guess what a youngster was doing, as he capered furiously about
the road, wearing his cap pushed back and two short sticks protruding from beneath it over
his forehead; but presently I perceived that he was a "bullick" being driven to market. Excepting
the case already mentioned, of the boy who proposed to "be a murderer," I do not recall witnessing
any other forms of the game of "pretending" amongst the village children, unless in the play
of little girls with their dolls. There was one very pretty child who used to prattle to me
sometimes about her "baby," and how it had been "bad," that is to say, naughty, and put to
bed; or had not had its breakfast. This little girl was an orphan who lived with her grandfather
and a middle-aged aunt, and was much petted by them. She was almost alone too, amongst the
village children of that period, in being the possessor of a doll, for no more than five or
six years ago one rarely saw such a thing in the village. Christmas-trees have since done something
to make up the deficiency. A month or two ago I saw a four-year-old girl--a friend of mine
from a neighbour's cottage--solemnly walking down a by-lane alone, carrying a rag-doll half
as big as herself. I stopped, and admired; but, in spite of her pride, she took a very matter-of-fact
view of her toy. "It's head keeps comin' off," was all that she could be persuaded to say.

"Matter-of-fact" is what the children are, for the most part. One autumn evening, after dark,
titterings and little squeals of excitement sounded from a neighbour's garden, where a man,
going to draw water from his well, and carrying a lantern, was accompanied by four or five
children. In the security of his presence they were pretending to be afraid of "bogies." "If
a bogie was to come," I heard, "I should get up that apple-tree, and then if he come up after
me I should get down t'other side." An excited laugh was followed by the man's contemptuous
remonstrance, "Shut up!" which produced silence for a minute or two, until the party were returning
to the cottage; when a very endearing voice called softly, "Bo-gie! Bo-gie! Come, bogie!" This
instance of fancy in a cottage child stands, however, alone in my experience. I have never
heard anything else like it in the village. The children romp and squabble and make much noise;
they play, though rarely, at hide-and-seek; or else they gambol about aimlessly, or try to
sing together, or troop off to look at the fowls or the rabbits. The bigger children are as
a rule extremely kind to the lesser ones. A family of small brothers and sisters who lived
near me some time ago were most pleasant to listen to for this reason. The smallest of them,
a three-year-old boy commonly called "'Arry," was their pet. "Look, 'Arry; here's a dear little
flow-wer! A little 'arts-ease--look, 'Arry!" "'Ere, 'Arry, have a bite o' this nice apple!"
They were certainly attractive children, though formidably grubby as to their faces. I heard
them with their father, admiring a litter of young rabbits in the hutch. "O-oh, en't that a
dear little thing!" they exclaimed, again and again. Sunday was especially delightful to them
because their father was at home then; and I liked to hear him playing with them. One particularly
happy hour they had, in which he feigned to be angry and they to be defiant. They jumped about
just out of his reach, jeering at him. "Old Father Smither!" they cried, as often as their
peals of laughter would let them cry anything at all. But it struck me as very strange that
their sing-song derision was not going to the right tune and rhythm; for there is a genuine
folk-tune which I thought indissolubly wedded to this derisive formula. Beginning in a long
drawl, it throws all the weight on the first and fourth syllables: "Old Father Smith-er." But
these children, apparently ignorant of it, had invented a rhythm of their own, in which the
first syllable, "Old," was almost elided, and the weight was thrown on the next. I could not
help wondering at the breach which this indicated with the ancient folk traditions.

If it were necessary, plentiful other evidence could be produced of the children's great need
for more subjects upon which to exercise their thoughts and fancies. For one example: some
years ago a little maidservant from this village was found, when she went to her first "place"
in the town, never to have seen a lamb, or a pond of water. This was an extreme case, perhaps;
but it suggests how badly the children are handicapped. As recently as last year, when a circus
was visiting the town, I asked two village boys on the road if they had seen the procession.
They had not; nor had they ever in their lives seen a camel or an elephant; but one of them
"thought he should know an elephant, by his trunk." He was probably eight years old; and it
is worth noting that he must have owed his enlightenment to books or pictures seen at school;
indeed, there is nothing of the sort to be learnt at home, where there are no books, and where
the parents, themselves limited to so narrow a range of experience and therefore of ideas,
are not apt to encourage inquisitiveness in their children. A man who lived near me a few years
ago could often be heard, on Sundays and on summer evenings, chiding his little son for that
fault. "Don't you keep on astin' so many questions," was his formula, which I must have heard
dozens of times. One can sympathize: it would be so much easier to give the child a bun, or
the cottage equivalent, and order him to eat it; but that does not satisfy the child's appetite
for information. Probably the great difficulty is that the children's questions can hardly
any longer turn upon those old-fashioned subjects which the parents understand, but upon new-fangled
things. And, apart from all this, I suspect that in most of the cottages the old notion prevails
that children should be kept in their place, and not encouraged to bother grown-up people with
their trumpery affairs.

From the contrast between the talk of the village youngsters and that of children who are better
cared for, I inferred just now a want of "flow" in the thoughts of the former, as though the
little scrappy ideas existed in their brains without much relationship to one another. Of course
it is possible that the brain activity is far greater than one would surmise, and that it only
seems sluggish because of the insufficiency of our village speech as a means of expression,
for certainly the people's vocabulary is extremely limited, while they have no habit of talking
in sentences of any complexity. Yet where a language has neither abundant names for ideas,
nor flexible forms of construction to exhibit variations of thought, it is hard to believe
that the brain-life itself is anything but cramped and stiff.

And if the crude phrasing indicates poverty in the more definite kinds of ideas, I cannot help
thinking that another feature of the children's talk betrays no less a poverty, in respect
to those more vague ideas which relate to behaviour and to perception of other people's position
and feelings. It was since beginning this chapter that I happened to be walking for some distance
in front of four children--three girls and a boy--from a comfortable middle-class home. It
was a Sunday morning, and they were chatting very quietly, so that their words did not reach
me; but I found it very agreeable to hear the variety of cadence in their voices, with occasionally
pauses, and then a resumption of easy talk, as if they had got a subject to consider in serious
lights, and recognized each other's right to be heard and understood. Indeed, it bordered on
priggishness, and perhaps over-stepped the border; but nevertheless it made me feel jealous
for our village children, for in the conversation of village children one never hears that
suggestion of a considerate mental attitude towards one another. The speech is without flexibility
or modulation of tone; harsh, exclamatory, and screaming, or guttural and drawling. Rarely,
if ever, does one derive from it an impression that the children are growing to regard one
another's feelings, or one another's thoughts. A further point must be mentioned. I hinted
that there might be an additional cause, besides physical privations, for the loss of the children's
attractiveness in many cases even before they leave school. My belief is that, as they approach
the age when ideas of a sensitive attitude towards life should begin to sway them, unconsciously
moulding the still growing features into fineness, those ideas do not come their way. The boys
of eight begin to look, at times, like little men; and the girls of eleven and upwards begin
to show signs of acquaintance with struggling domestic economies; but neither boys nor girls
discover, in the world into which they are growing up, any truly helpful ideas of what it is
comely to be and to think. Lingering peasant notions of personal fitness and of integrity keep
them from going viciously wrong, so that when they come to puberty their perplexed spirits
are not quite without guidance; yet, after all, the peasant conditions are gone, and seeing
that the new wage-earning conditions do not, of themselves, suggest worthy ideas of personal
bearing, the children's faculties for that sort of thing soon cease to unfold, and with a gradual
slackening of development the attractiveness disappears. The want is the more to be regretted
in that, at a later time of life, when the women have been moulded by motherhood and the men
by all the stress and responsibility of their position, such composure and strength often appear
in them as to justify a suspicion that these uncared-for people are by nature amongst the very
best of the English.

THE FORWARD MOVEMENT

THE FORWARD MOVEMENT

The last twenty years having witnessed so much change in the village, it is interesting to
speculate as to the farther changes that may be looked for in the years to come; indeed, it
is more than merely interesting. Educational enthusiasts are busy; legislators have their eye
on villages; throughout the leisured classes it is habitual to look upon "the poor" as a sort
of raw material, to be remodelled according to leisured ideas of what is virtuous, or refined,
or useful, or nice; and nobody seems to reflect that the poor may be steadily, albeit unconsciously,
moving along a course of their own, in which they might be helped a little, or hindered a little,
by outsiders, but from which they will not in the long run be turned aside. Yet such a movement,
if it is really proceeding, will obviously stultify the most well-intentioned schemes that
are not in accordance with it.

And, if I am not greatly mistaken, it is under way. That seems to me an ill-grounded complacency
which permits easy-going people to say lightly, "Of course we want a few reforms," as if, once
those reforms were brought to pass, the labouring population would thereafter settle down and
change no more. In one respect, no doubt, there is little more to be looked for. The changes
so far observed have been thrust upon the people from outside--changes in their material or
social environment, followed by mere negations on their part, in the abandonment of traditional
outlooks and ambitions; and of course in that negative direction the movement must come to
an end at last. But when there are no more old habits to be given up, there is still plenty
of scope for acquiring new ones, and this is the possibility that has to be considered. What
if, quietly and out of sight--so quietly and inconspicuously as to be unnoticed even by the
people themselves--their English nature, dissatisfied with negations, should have instinctively
set to work in a positive direction to discover a new outlook and new ambitions? What if the
merely mechanical change should have become transmuted into a vital growth in the people's
spirit--a growth which, having life in it, must needs go on spontaneously by a process of self-unfolding?
If that should be the case, as I am persuaded that it is, then the era of change in the village
is by no means over; on the contrary, it is more likely that the greatest changes are yet to come.

As the signs which should herald their approach will be those of recovery from the mental and
spiritual stagnation into which the village has been plunged, and as we may regard that stagnation
as the starting-point from which any further advance will proceed, it is worth while to fix
it in our minds by a similitude. What has most obviously happened to the village population
resembles an eviction, when the inmates of a cottage have been turned out upon the road-side
with their goods and chattels, and there they sit, watching the dismantling of their home,
and aware only of being moved against their will. It is a genuine movement of them; yet it
does not originate with them; and the first effect of it upon them is stagnation. Unable to
go on in their old way, yet knowing no other way in which to go on, they merely wait disconsolate.
