Salt Water, The Sea Life and Adventures of Neil D'Arcy the Midshipman, By W H G Kingston.

One interesting feature of this book is that it must have been one of the earliest to be written
by Kingston.  It does not appear that there was another edition for sixty years, by which time
the author had been dead for 35 years.

It is also a very good book of his genre, with lots of battle, murder, and sudden death.  It
deals with the adventures of a young boy who joins the Royal Navy as a midshipman in the care
of his uncle.  Most of the action takes place in the Mediterranean, even so far as the Ionian
sea, where he visits Zante (now called Zakynthos), Cephalonia, and even Corfu.

Of course practically everybody appearing in the book is slain, except the young hero, who
survives all.

If you want to read, or listen to, a rattling good yarn, try this one.

CHAPTER ONE.

NEIL D'ARCY'S LIFE AT SEA.

MY ANCESTORS--LARRY HARRIGAN, AND MY EARLY EDUCATION--CHOICE OF A PROFESSION--FIRST START IN LIFE.

"The sea, the sea," if not my mother, has been my nurse (and anything but a dry one) from the
earliest days of my recollection.  I was born within the sound of old ocean's surges; I dabbled
in salt water before I could run; and I have floated on salt water, and have been well sprinkled
with it too, from that time to the present.  It never occurred to me, indeed, that I could
be anything but a sailor.  In my innocence, I pictured a life on the ocean wave as the happiest
allowed to mortals; and little did I wot of all the bumpings and thumpings, the blows and the
buffetings, I was destined to endure in the course of it.  Yet, even had I expected them, I
feel very certain they would not have changed my wishes.  No, no.  I was mightily mistaken
with regard to the romance of the thing, I own; but had I to begin life again, with all its
dangers and hardships, still I would choose the ocean for my home--the glorious navy of England
for my profession.

But now for my antecedents.  I will not trouble the reader with many of them.  I was born at
the family seat in the south of Ireland.  My mother died while I was very young, and my father,
Colonel D'Arcy, who had seen much service in the army and had been severely wounded, after
a lingering illness, followed her to the grave.  During this time I was committed to the charge
of Larry Harrigan, the butler and family factotum; and, in truth, I desired no better companion,
for well did I love the old man.  He was a seaman every inch of him, from his cherished pigtail
to the end of the timber toe on which he had long stumped through the world.  He had been coxswain
to my maternal grandfather, a captain in the navy, who was killed in action.  Larry had gone
to sea with him as a lad, and they had seldom been separated.  A few minutes before his commander,
in the moment of victory, lost his life, Larry had his leg shot away; and on being paid off,
he repaired to where my mother's family were residing.  When my father married, he offered
the old seaman an asylum beneath his roof.  He certainly did not eat the bread of idleness
there, for no one about the place was more generally useful.  There was nothing he could not
do or make, and in spite of his loss of a limb, he was as active as most people possessed with
the usual complement of supporters.

Larry had loved my mother as his own child, and for her sake he loved me more than anything
else on earth.  As he considered it a part of his duty to instruct me in his own accomplishments,
which being chiefly of a professional character, I at a very early age became thoroughly initiated
in the mysteries of knotting, bending, and splicing, and similar nautical arts.  I could point
a rope, work a Turk's-head, or turn in an eye, as well as many an A.B.  Not content with this,
he built me a model of a ship, with her rigging complete.  He then set to work to teach me
the names of every rope and spar; and when I knew them and their uses, he unrigged the ship
and made me rig her again under his inspection.  This I did several times, till he considered
I was perfect. He next bought fresh stuff for a new suit of rigging, and made me cut it into
proper lengths and turn it all in correctly before I set it up.

"Now you see, Master Neil," said he, "we've just got the lovely Psyche out of the hands of
the shipwrights, and it's our duty to get the rigging over her mastheads, and fit her for sea
as fast as the work can be done; so let's see how soon we can do the job."

Such were our indoor amusements, and thus I rapidly acquired an amount of knowledge which most
midshipmen take a long time to get stowed away in their heads.  Larry also used to take me
out on the waters of the bay, and taught me to row and to manage the sails of a small boat
with tolerable dexterity.  I learned also to swim; and had it not been for my possession of
that art, I should probably long ago have been food for fishes.  And here I must endeavour
strongly to impress on the minds of my young readers the importance of learning to swim well;
for not only may they thus be enabled to save their own lives, but they may have the happiness
of preserving those of their fellow-creatures.

While my poor father lived, he attended to the more intellectual branches of my education.
My mother taught me to read, and for her sake I loved reading.  She also instilled those religious
principles into me which have been my support through life.  Short and fleeting as was the
time she remained on earth, inestimable were the blessings she bestowed on me.  Whatever of
the milk of human kindness flows round my heart, from her gentle bosom I drew it forth; and
surely I do not err when I believe that her earnest prayers before the throne of mercy have
caused watchful spirits to shield me from the perils of the stormy ocean, and from still greater
dangers, the treacherous quicksands and dark rocks which have laid in my course through life.

I was ten years old before it occurred to any one that a little of the discipline of a school
might be beneficial to me, to prepare me somewhat better than I could be prepared at home to
rough it in the rude world into which I was ere long to be plunged.  To the academy, therefore,
of a certain Doctor Studdert, near Cork, I was sent, where I contrived to pick up a few crumbs
of knowledge and some experience of life.  I had no great dislike to school, but liked home
much better; and no one sung--

  "Packing up and going away,
  All for the sake of a holiday,"

more joyously than did I when my first midsummer holiday came round.

Larry was on the watch for me as I jumped out of the carriage which had been sent over to Kerry
to meet me.  The old seaman had expected me to come back a prodigy of learning; but was horrified
to discover that I was puzzled how to make a carrick-bend, and had nearly forgotten the length
of the Psyche's main-top bowline.

"And that's what the Doctor calls schooling, does he, Master Neil?" he exclaimed, indignantly.
"Now I'll make bold to say that among all the bigwigs he has under him, including himself,
there isn't one on 'em knows how to gammon a bowsprit or turn in a dead-eye.  Now, to my mind,
if they can't give you more larning than you've got since you've been away, you'd better stop
at home altogether."

I agreed with Larry, but the higher authorities ruled otherwise; so back to school I went at
the end of the holidays, having regained all the nautical knowledge I before possessed, with
a little in addition.

I will pass over the sad time of my brave father's death.  I was left to the guardianship of
my uncle, Counsellor D'Arcy, the great Dublin barrister, and of Doctor Driscoll.  I was removed
to the house of the latter, with poor Larry, who threatened to do all sorts of dreadful deeds,
if he were not allowed to accompany me.  My patrimony, which had become somewhat attenuated,
was in the meantime put out to nurse.  I was rather surprised at not being sent back to school,
when one day the Doctor, as he sat cross-legged before the fire after dinner, rubbing his shins,
called me to him.

"Neil, my boy, your uncle, Counsellor D'Arcy, has requested me to speak to you on a very important
subject.  It is time, he thinks, that your studies should be directed to fit you for the profession
you may select. What would you wish to be, now?  Have you ever thought on the matter? Would
you like to follow his steps, and study the law; or those of your honoured father, and enter
the army; or those of your grandfather, and go to sea; or would you like to become a merchant,
or a clergyman; or what do you say to the practice of medicine?"

"That I would never take a drop, if I could help it, Doctor; or give it to others either,"
I answered.  "I fear that I should make a bad minister, and a worse merchant; and as for the
law, I would not change places with the Counsellor himself, if he were to ask me.  I should
have no objection to the army; but if I'm to choose my profession, I'll go to sea, by all means.
I've no fancy for any but a sea life; but I'll just go and talk the matter over with Larry,
and hear what he thinks about it."

The Doctor said nothing.  He considered, I conclude, that he had obeyed my uncle's wishes in
proposing the matter to me, and his conscience was at rest.  I forthwith ran off and broached
the subject to Larry; not that I doubted what his advice would be.  The old seaman gave a hitch
to the waistband of his trousers, as he replied, with no little animation--

"Why, you see, Master Neil, to my mind there's only one calling which a man, who is anything
of a man, would wish to follow.  The others are all very well in their way: the parsons, and
the soldiers, and the big-wigged lawyers, and the merchants, and the doctors, and the `'plomatics'--them
who goes abroad to desave the furriners, and takes up so much room and gives themselves such
airs aboard ship; but what, just let me ax, is the best on 'em when you puts him alongside
a right honest, thorough-bred seaman?  What's the proudest on 'em, when it comes to blow half
a capful of wind?  What's the boldest on 'em in a dark night, on a lee shore?  Not one on 'em
is worth that!" and he snapped his fingers to show his contempt for landsmen of every degree.
"On course, Master Neil, dear, you'll be a seaman.  With my will, the navy is the only calling
your blessed mother's son should follow.  Your grandfather died in it, and your great-grandfather
before him; and I hope to see you in command of one of His Majesty's ships before I die-- that
I do.  But I was forgetting that you were growing so big, and that you would be going off to
sea so soon," continued the old man, in an altered tone.  "You'll remember, for his sake, all
the lessons Larry gave you, Master Neil?  And you'll think of your old friend sometimes in
a night watch, won't you, now?"

I assured him that I would often think of him, and try not to forget any of his lessons.  I
then went back to the Doctor, to inform him that Larry agreed with me that the navy was the
only profession likely to suit me.

My future calling being thus speedily settled, Doctor Driscoll, who was aware that knowledge
would not come by intuition, sent me to an old master in the navy, who fortunately resided
in the neighbourhood, to be instructed in the rudiments of navigation.  As I was as wide awake
as most youngsters of my age, I very soon gained a fair insight into its mysteries; and by
the time the spring came round, I was pronounced fit for duty.

A brother of my mother's, who commanded a large revenue cutter on the south coast of England,
having been applied to for advice by the Doctor, answered by the following short note:--

"Dear Sir,--I'll make a seaman of Neil, with all my heart, if you will send him across to Portsmouth.
Let him inquire for me at the `Star and Garter.'  Should I be away on a cruise, I will leave
word with the landlady what is to be done with him.  My craft is the Serpent.

"I remain, faithfully yours,--

"Terence O'Flaherty."

"What! send the child all the way over to Portsmouth by himself!" exclaimed good Mrs Driscoll,
the Doctor's wife, on hearing the contents of this epistle.  "Why, he might be spirited off
to the Plantations or the Black Hole of Calcutta, and we never hear any more about him.  What
could Mr O'Flaherty be thinking about?"

"That his nephew is about to be an officer in His Majesty's service, and that the sooner he
learns to take care of himself, the better," replied the Doctor.

"Let him begin, then, by slow degrees, as birds are taught to fly," urged the kind dame.  "He
has never been out of the nest yet, except to school, when he was put in charge of the coachman,
like a parcel."

"He will find his way safe enough," muttered the Doctor.  "Won't you, Neil?"

To speak the truth, I would gladly have undertaken to find my way to Timbuctoo, or the Antipodes,
by myself; but I had just formed a plan which I was afraid might be frustrated, had I agreed
with the Doctor.  I therefore answered, "I'll go and ask Larry;" and without waiting for any
further observations, off I ran, to put it in train.  It was, that Larry should accompany me
to Portsmouth; and I had also a notion that he might be able to go to sea with me.  He was
delighted with my plan, and backing Mrs Driscoll's objections to my being sent alone, it was
finally arranged that he should take charge of me till he had handed me over to my uncle. 
Such parts of my outfit as could be manufactured at home, Mrs Driscoll got ready for me, and
Larry was empowered to procure the rest for me at Portsmouth.

I confess that I did not shed a tear or cast a look of regret at my birthplace; but with a
heart as light as a skylark taking his morning flight, I mounted alongside Larry on the top
of the coach bound for Dublin.  While in that city we saw my uncle, the Counsellor.  I do not
remember profiting much by the visit.  He, however, shook me kindly by the hand, and wishing
me every success, charged Larry to take care of me.

"Arrah!" muttered the old man as we walked away, "his honour, sure, would be after telling
a hen to take care of her chickens now."

In London we put up at an inn at the west end, near Exeter 'Change; and while dinner was getting
ready, we went to see the wild beasts which dwelt there in those days.  I thought London a
very smoky, dismal city, and that is all I can remember about it.

Larry was rigged for the journey in a suit of black; and though he would have been known, however
dressed, by every one for a seaman, he was always taken for an officer of the old school, and
was treated accordingly with becoming respect.  Indeed, there was an expression of mild firmness
and of unassuming self-confidence in his countenance, added to his silvery locks and his handsome
though weather-beaten features, which commanded it.

We spent only one night in London; and by five o'clock in the afternoon of the day we left
it we were rattling down the High Street of Portsmouth, on the top of the fast coach, while
the guard played "See the Conquering Hero Comes"--which I had some notion he did in compliment
to me.

I thought Portsmouth a much nicer place than London (in which idea some people, perhaps, will
not agree with me); while I looked upon the "Star and Garter," where we stopped, as a very
fine hotel, though not equal in dignity to the "George."  My chest, made under Larry's superintendence,
showed that its owner was destined for the sea.  Taking my hand, Larry stumped up the passage,
following the said chest and the bag which contained his wardrobe.

"What ship has your son come to join?" asked good Mrs Timmins, the landlady, curtseying, as
she encountered us.

"Faith, marm, it's not after being the son of the likes of me is Master D'Arcy here," he answered,
pleased at the same time at the dignity thus conferred on him.  "This is the nephew, marm,
of Lieutenant O'Flaherty of His Majesty's cutter, the Serpent; and I'll make bold to ax whether
she's in the harbour, and what directions the Lieutenant has left about his nephew?"

"Oh dear, now, the cutter sailed this very morning for the westward," answered the landlady;
"that is unfortunate!  And so this young gentleman is Lieutenant O'Flaherty's nephew.  Well,
then, we must take good care of him, as she won't be back for a week; and you know, mister,
you needn't trouble yourself more about him."

"Faith, marm, it's not I will be after leaving the young master till I see him safe in his
uncle's hands," answered Larry, with a rap on his thigh.  "So I'll just trouble you to give
us a room with a couple of beds in it, and we'll take up our quarters here till the cutter
comes back."

This arrangement of course pleased the worthy Mrs Timmins, as she got two guests instead of
one; and I thus found myself established for a week at Portsmouth.  Having selected our chamber,
we went into the coffee-room and ordered dinner.  There were several youngsters there, and
other junior officers of the profession, for the "Star and Garter" was at that time more frequented
than the far-famed "Blue Posts."  At first some of the younger portion of the guests were a
little inclined to look superciliously at Larry and me; but he stuck out his timber toe, and
returned their glances with such calm independence, that they soon suspected he was not made
of the stuff to laugh at; and they then showed an evident disposition to enter into conversation
with him to discover who he could be.  This, for my sake, he did not wish them to do; for,
as he was to act the part of guardian, he thought it incumbent on him to keep up his dignity.

We passed, to me, a very interesting time at Portsmouth.  We constantly visited the dockyard,
which was my delight.  He took me over the Victory, and showed me the spot where Nelson fell;
and with old associations many a tale and anecdote which, long since forgotten, now returned
to his memory, he poured into my eager ear.

Some people declare, and naval men even do so, that there's no romance in a seafaring life--that
it's all hard, dirty, slaving work, without anything to repay one, except prize-money in war
time and promotion in peace.  Now, to my mind, there's a great deal of romance and chivalry
and excitement, and ample recompense in the life itself; and this Larry, who ought to have
known, for he had seen plenty of hard service, had himself discovered.  It is that some do
not know where to look for the romance, and if found, cannot appreciate it.  The stern realities
of a sea life--its hardships, its dangers, its battles, its fierce contests with the elements,
its triumphs over difficulties--afford to some souls a pleasure which ignobler ones cannot
feel: I trust that my adventures will explain what I mean.  For my own part, I can say that
oftentimes have I enjoyed that intense pleasure, that joyous enthusiasm, that high excitement,
which not only recompenses one for the toil and hardships by which it is won, but truly makes
them as nothing in comparison to the former.  All I can say is, let me go through the world
sharing the rough and the smooth alike--the storms and sunshine of life; but save me from the
stagnant existence of the man who sleeps on a feather bed and always keeps out of danger.

CHAPTER TWO.

DON THE TRUE BLUE--ROMANCE OF THE SEA--LARRY AND HIS WIFE.

My uniform was to be made at Portsmouth.  Of course I felt myself not a little important, and
very fine, as I put it on for, the first time, and looked at myself in the glass, with my dirk
buckled to my side, and a round hat with a cockade in it on my head.  We were sitting in the
coffee-room, waiting for dinner, on that eventful day, when a number of youngsters belonging
to a line-of-battle ship came into the inn.  They had not been there long, when the shiny look
of my new clothes, and the way I kept handling my dirk, unable to help looking down at it,
attracted the attention of one of them.

"That's a sucking Nelson," he exclaimed, "I'll bet a sixpence!"

"Hillo, youngster! to what ship do you belong?" asked another, looking hard at me.

"To the Serpent cutter," I answered, not quite liking the tone in which he spoke.

"And so you are a cutter's midshipman, are you?" he asked.  "And how is it you are not on board,
I should like to know?"

I told him that the cutter was away, and that I was waiting for her return.

"Then I presume that you haven't been to sea at all yet?" observed the first who had spoken,
in a bland tone, winking at his shipmates, with the intention of trotting me out.

I answered simply that I had not.  Larry, I must observe, all the time was sitting silent,
and pretending not to take any notice of them, so that they did not suspect we belonged to
each other.

"Poor boy, I pity you," observed the young gentleman, gravely, and turning up his eyes.  "I'd
advise you seriously to go back to your mamma.  You've no idea of all the difficult things
you'll have to learn; of which, how to hand, reef, and steer isn't the hundredth part."

"In the first place, I have not a mamma to go to," I replied, in an indignant tone; for I did
not like his mentioning her, even.  "And perhaps I know more about a ship than you think of."

"You! what should you know about a ship, I should like to know?" exclaimed the midshipman,
contemptuously.

"Why, I know how to gammon a bowsprit," I replied, looking at him very hard.  "I can work a
Turk's-head, make a lizard, or mouse a stay--can't I, Larry?"  I asked, turning to the old
sailor.  "And as for steering, I've steered round Kilkee Bay scores of times, before you knew
how to handle an oar, I'll be bound--haven't I, Larry?"

The old man, thus appealed to, looked up and spoke.  "Faith, you may well say that same, Master
Neil; and proud am I to have taught you.  And I'll just tell you, young gentlemen, I'll lay
a gold guinea that Master D'Arcy here would get the rigging over the mastheads of a ship, and
fit her for sea, while either of you were looking at them, and thinking how you were to sway
up the topmasts.  No offence, you know; but as for gammoning--I don't think any one would beat
you there."

Several of the midshipmen muttered murmurs of applause at what Larry and I had said, and in
a very short time we were all excellent friends, and as intimate as if we were shipmates together.
They at once respected him, for they could not help recognising him as a true sailor; and they
also saw that, young and inexperienced as I appeared, I was not quite as green as they had
at first supposed.  And we all parted excellent friends.

We had been waiting some time at the "Star and Garter," and there were no signs of the Serpent,
and from the information Larry gained from those who were likely to know, he was led to believe
that several days more might elapse before her return; so he proposed that we should look out
for lodgings, as more economical, and altogether pleasanter.  I willingly agreed to his plan,
so out we set in search of them.  We saw several which did not suit us.  At last we went to
Southsea, which we agreed would be more airy and pleasant; and seeing a bill up at a very neat
little house, we knocked at the door, and were admitted.  There was a nice sitting-room and
bed-room, and a small room which Larry said would do for him.  The landlady, who was a pleasant-looking,
buxom dame, asked only fifteen shillings a week, including doing for us; so we agreed to take
it.  By some chance we did not inquire her name.

"Good-bye, Missis," said Larry.  "I'll send the young gentleman's traps here in half an hour,
and leave him mean time as security.  I suppose you'll have no objection to stay, Master D'Arcy?"
he added, turning to me.

I had none, of course, and so it was arranged.  While Larry was gone, the good lady took me
into the sitting-room, and begging me to make myself at home, was very inquisitive to know
all about me.  I had no reason for not gratifying her, so I told her how my mother and then
my father had died and left me an orphan, and how I had come all the way from Kerry to Portsmouth,
and how I belonged to a cutter which I had not yet seen, and how I intended one day to become
a Nelson or a Collingwood.  Of my resolution the kind lady much approved.

"Ah, my good, dear man, if he had lived, would have become a captain also; but he went to sea
and died, and I never from that day to this heard any more of him," said she, wiping the corner
of her eye with her apron, more from old habit than because there were any tears to dry up,
for she certainly was not crying.  "Those things on the mantel-piece there were some he brought
me home years and years ago, when he was a gay young sailor; and I've kept them ever since,
for his sake, though I've been hard pushed at times to find bread to put into my mouth, young
gentleman."

The things she spoke of were such as are to be found in the sitting-rooms of most sailors'
wives.  There were elephants' teeth, with figures of men and women carved on them, very cleverly
copied from very coarse prints; and there were shells of many shapes, and lumps of corals,
and bits of seaweed, with the small model of a ship, very much battered, and her yards scandalised,
as if to mourn for her builder's loss.  She was placed on a stand covered with small shells,
and at either end were bunches of shell flowers, doubtlessly very tasteful according to the
widow's idea.  The room was hung round with coloured prints, which even then I did not think
very well executed.  One was a sailor returning from a voyage, with bags of gold at his back
and sticking out of his pockets.  I wondered whether I should come back in that way; but as
I did not know the value of money, there was nothing very exciting in it to me.  There were
two under which was written "The lover's meeting."  In both cases the lady was dressed extravagantly
fine, with a bonnet and very broad ribbons; and the lover had on the widest trousers I ever
saw.  Another represented a lady watching for her lover, whose ship was seen in the distance;
and one more I remember was a seaman cast upon the shore, with a female bending over him; while
there were several pictures of ships, some of which were on the tops of waves running truly
mountains high, and curling over in a very terrific way indeed.  I had time to inspect all
these things while my landlady was getting my bed-room ready.  I had not dined; and when Larry,
who was rather longer than I had expected, returned, I found that he had purchased all sorts
of necessary provisions, and that they only wanted cooking for me to eat them.  While he laid
the cloth, the landlady performed the office of cook; and in a little time a very nice dinner
of veal cutlets, ham, and fried potatoes made its appearance.  When Larry had nothing to do
but to look about him, I observed him fix his eyes in a strange sort of way on the model of
the ship, and then at the shells and the other things in the room.  At last he turned to the
landlady.

"Please, marm," said he, "where did you get all them things from?"

"Oh, sir," answered the landlady, "they were given to me by my poor dear man, who has been
dead and gone this many a long year."

"May I be bold to ask, and no offence, what is your name, marm?" said Larry.

"My husband was an Irishman, like you, and my name is Harrigan," answered the landlady, who
held at the moment a jug of beer, from which she was going to pour me out a tumblerful.

"Faith, you may well say that he was like me, marm, for, curious enough, that's my name too,"
answered Larry.

"Your name!" exclaimed the landlady, standing still and looking doubtfully at him.

"Yes, my name--it is, indeed," said Larry.  "And may I ask what is your Christian name, marm?"

"Jane is my name, and yours is Lawrence!" shrieked Mrs Harrigan, letting fall the jug of beer,
which was smashed to pieces, and rushing towards him.

"By the pipers, you're right now; but if you're yourself--my own Jane Harrigan, whom I thought
dead and buried, or married long ago to another man, it's the happiest day of my life that
I've seen for a long time," cried Larry, throwing his arms round her and giving her a hug which
I thought would have squeezed all the breath out of her body.

I looked up at the pictures on the wall, and fancied he was imitating one of the persons there
represented; though, to be sure, my friends were rather aged lovers.

"And I thought you were lost at sea long, long ago," cried Mrs Harrigan, now sobbing in earnest.

"Faith, so I was, Jane, and it's a long time I've been being found again," said Larry; "and
how we've both come to life again is more than I can tell."

"Oh, I never forgot you, and wouldn't listen to what any other man had to say to me," said
Mrs Harrigan.

"Nor I, faith, what the girls said to me," returned Larry.  "But for the matter of that, my
timber toe wasn't much to their liking."

"I see, Larry, you've lost your leg since I lost you, and it was that puzzled me, or I should
have known you at once--that I should," observed Mrs Harrigan, giving him an affectionate kiss
on his rough cheek.

They did not mind me at all, and went on talking away as if I was not in the room, which was
very amusing.

Larry afterwards confessed to me that he should not have recognised his wife, for when he went
to sea and left her for the last time, she was a slim, pretty young woman; and though she was
certainly not uncomely, no one could accuse her of not having flesh enough.  Larry, as many
another sailor has done, had married at the end of a very short courtship, his wife, then a
nursery-maid in an officer's family at Portsmouth; and a few weeks afterwards he had been pressed
and sent out to the East Indies.  While there, he had been drafted into another ship, and the
ship in which he had left home had been lost with all hands.  Of this event his wife became
acquainted, and having come from an inland county, and not knowing how to gain further information
about him, she had returned to her parents in the country.  They died, and she went again into
service.

Meantime, Larry, having lost his leg, came home, and notwithstanding all his inquiries, he
could gain no tidings of her.  At last he came to the conclusion that she must have married
again, probably another sailor, and gone away with him--no uncommon occurrence in those days;
so he philosophically determined to think no more about her, but to return to the land of his
birth to end his days.

She had gone through the usual vicissitudes of an unprotected female, and at last returned
to Portsmouth with a family in whose service she acted as curse.  Here, having saved up a little
money, she determined to settle as a lodging-house keeper, and she had taken the house in which
we found her.

This event, caused me very great satisfaction, for it had occurred to me that Larry would find
himself very forlorn going back to Ireland without me to look after, and no one to care about;
and now, instead, he would have a good wife, and a comfortable house to live in.  She also
would be the gainer, for he had saved some money when in our service; and as he was a sober,
temperate man, he would be able to assist her very much in her business.  On my own account
also I was very glad, because I should now have many opportunities of seeing him whenever I
returned to Portsmouth.

Several days passed away after this, during which time I must say no one could have taken better
care of me than did good Mrs Harrigan; and I felt convinced that my old friend would likewise
be well looked after during my absence.

CHAPTER THREE.

LIEUTENANT O'FLAHERTY--MY SHIP AND SHIPMATES--THE PILOT'S BOAT--RESULTS OF DRUNKENNESS--MY
FIRST COMMAND.

One day, on going with Larry, according to custom, to the "Star and Garter" to learn tidings
of the cutter, I saw a fine sailorlike-looking man, with an intelligent and good-humoured expression
of countenance, talking to the landlady.

"There's the young gentleman himself," she exclaimed, pointing at me.

"What, my lad, are you indeed my nephew?" said the officer, kindly, putting out his hand and
pressing mine warmly.  "Faith, I needn't ask that, though; you are the very picture of your
poor mother.  Well, Neil, the sooner you get on board and begin learning your duty, the better."

I answered that I was perfectly ready, for I at once took a great fancy to him, and thought
I should be very happy in the cutter.

He now observed Larry for the first time.

"What! old shipmate," he exclaimed, shaking him warmly by the hand, "are you the trustworthy
person Dr Driscoll told me he would send to look after the youngster?  I'm delighted to see
you again, and wish I could give you a berth on board my craft, but I'm afraid the service
won't permit that.  You must, however, come and take a cruise with us, and talk over old times."

"Faith, your honour, I'm not much fit for duty, I own, with my timber toe, afloat, and I've
just found a snug berth on shore, which I intend to keep till Master D'Arcy settles down in
the halls of his fathers, and wants my services; but I'll gladly take a cruise with your honour,
and just see how he practises all I've taught him.  You'll find him in a few days, I'll warrant,
as smart a seaman as many who've been two or three years afloat."

To make a long story short, while Larry remained on shore with his new-found wife, I went on
board the cutter; and the following day we ran out of harbour, round by Saint Helen's, and
stood down Channel in search of a smuggling craft, of whose movements the Commander had received
notice.

I found my uncle, on further acquaintance, to be what his looks betokened him, a thoroughly
honest, hearty sailor.  His first officer was a very old mate who had long given up all hopes
of promotion in the service.  He was married; and his wife and family lived near Portsmouth.
His name was John Hanks.  There was a second master and a clerk in charge; so that, for a cutter,
we made up an unusually large mess.  We had no surgeon, as we could always run into harbour
if any of us required doctoring.

My uncle, who was a poor man, had taken the command of the cutter for the sake of his wife
and family; and when I came to know my sweet young aunt, I felt, with her smiles to welcome
him when he got home, Lieutenant O'Flaherty was a happier man far than many who roll in their
easy carriages about the streets of smoky London.

Mrs O'Flaherty, with the two children she then had, lived in a pretty little cottage near Ryde,
where he was able every now and then to go and see her.  Of course he was never wanting in
an excuse, when duty would allow him, to be off Ryde; and on one of these occasions he first
introduced me to his wife.  I loved her at once, for she was a thoroughly genuine, graceful
woman, young and pretty, with a kind, warm heart, and a sweet expression of countenance, which
her character did not belie.  My little cousins and I also became great friends, and I confess
that I felt I would much rather stay with her than have to go to sea and knock about in all
weathers in the cutter; but duty sent us both on board again, and it was a long time before
I had another opportunity of paying a visit to Daisy Cottage.

But I have been going ahead of my narrative.

We were standing down Channel in the Serpent.  Our cruising ground was chiefly from Saint Helen's
to the Start; but we were liable to be sent elsewhere, or might go wherever our Commander had
notice there was a chance of catching a smuggler.

We had been out some days, keeping a sharp look-out off Portland Point for a noted fellow,
Myers by name, the owner of a fast lugger, the Kitty, who was expected to try and run a cargo
of tubs in that neighbourhood.

The smugglers played us all sorts of tricks, and I must own we were more than once taken in
by them.  On one occasion, while it was blowing very fresh, a cutter hailed us and told us
that she had just passed over a number of tubs, pointing out the direction where we should
find them. While we were engaged in picking them up, she made sail for the shore; and we afterwards
learned, to our mortification, that she had run a very large cargo of contraband goods.

Thanks to Larry's instructions, as I was very handy in a boat, and understood the duties of
a midshipman tolerably well, I was, to my great delight, soon placed in charge of one of the gigs.

A few days after the occurrence I have described, when we were about mid Channel, we observed
a vessel whose appearance was suspicious.  It had just gone two bells, in the forenoon watch.
It was blowing pretty fresh from the south-west, and there was a lop of a sea, but not enough
to endanger a boat.  We made sail towards the stranger, and as we neared her we perceived that
she was veering about, apparently under no control.

"Her main-boom has gone," observed Hanks, "and there doesn't seem to be a soul on deck; her
crew have been knocked or washed overboard, I suspect."

"I am afraid so," said the Commander.  "She looks to me like a pilot-boat.  She was probably
struck by a squall, with only a couple of hands left in her."

"Lubberly work somehow, at all events," remarked Hanks.

In another ten minutes we were close to the pilot-boat, and the cutter being hove-to, a boat
was lowered, and Hanks and I were ordered to go in her and see what was the matter.  When we
gained the deck, we found that the boom had knocked away part of the bulwarks and companion-hatch,
and committed other damage.  The first thing we did was to lower down the mainsail and to secure
the boom, which task, after some difficulty, we accomplished.  We next set about searching
the vessel, thinking that no one was on board.  The main hatch was on, but there was a little
cabin aft, with a small stove in it, and six berths, in which the crew lived. There was a table
in the cabin, and on it were a couple of tumblers, a thick-necked, square-sided glass bottle,
on its side, a broken pipe, and wet marks, and ashes of tobacco, as if people had very lately
been drinking there.

"What's wrong here?" said Hanks.  "It could not have been long ago since some one was on board."

Our eyes soon began to get accustomed to the sombre light of the cabin, which was darkened
by the mainsail hanging over it.  I happened to stoop down, and my eyes glanced under the table,
where we had not before looked.

"Hillo," I exclaimed, "why here are a man's legs."

"There seems to be two brace of them," said Hanks, laughing.  "Come out, my hearties, and give
an account of yourselves."

Saying this, he began to drag towards the companion-ladder one of the men; I following his
example with regard to the other.

"Why, Jim, we ain't got in yet; so let us alone, will ye," grunted out one, as he turned on
his side, without opening his eyes.

The other was too drunk to speak; indeed, had we not loosened his neckcloth, I believe he would
have died of apoplexy, for he was already getting black in the face.  We placed them near the
companion-ladder, where they could obtain some air; and then, getting off the main hatch, we
proceeded to search the vessel.  In the hold were several casks of French brandy, immensely
strong spirit, intended to be diluted before being sold.  From one of these the crew had evidently
been helping themselves, and not being accustomed to so potent a liquid, fancying it of the
ordinary strength, it had overcome their senses before they were aware of what was happening
to them.  We found, also, Dutch drops, several bales of tobacco, and sundry other things, amply
sufficient to condemn the craft as a smuggler, but which also proved that it was an unusual
venture, and that the people were not adepts in the contraband trade.  We searched the vessel
throughout, but no one else was discovered.

"Who, then, could Jim be?" we asked ourselves.

The drunken men were still too fast locked in a state of stupor to answer.  When nothing more
could be done, Hanks sent me back to the cutter, to report proceedings, hoping to be ordered
to take the prize in himself.

When I had made my report, "Very well," said the Commander, "I wish to try what amount of discretion
you possess, Neil; so you shall take the prize up to Portsmouth, and deliver her and the people
over to the proper authorities.  Take Thole and four hands with you.  Look out that the prisoners
do not escape, and I dare say you will do well.  I shall be up at Portsmouth in a day or so,
to take you off.  Now get on board, and assume your command as fast as you like.  Send Mr Hanks
on board again."

A change of things was soon put up in a bundle, and I and it bundled on board the prize.

"And so you are to go, youngster, are you?" remarked Hanks, as I got on board.  "It's all my
ill luck, for I thought to go myself; but good-bye, youngster, and a pleasant trip to you."

Saying this, he stepped into the boat alongside, and returned to the cutter, leaving me in
possession of my new-fledged honours.  The pilot-boat belonged to some place on the Dorsetshire
coast, and had drifted up off Saint Alban's Head, where we found her.  The Needles were just
in sight ahead, or rather the end of the Isle of Wight, off which they extend, so it seemed
an easy matter to run in; but I suspect, without Thole I should have made some slight mistake
or other, which might have laid my charge on the rocks.  Thole showed me the proper marks,
and by keeping the two lighthouses on Hurst Point in one, we ran in between the Needles and
the shoal of the shingles.  I felt very grand, as I walked the deck with my spy-glass under
my arm, and watched the chalk-white cliffs of Alum Bay rising high above us on the right, and
the curiously-coloured strata of sand at the eastern end of it, the wood-covered heights of
Freshwater, and the little town of Yarmouth; on the left, the old castle of Hurst, and the
long extent of the forest shores of Hampshire, with the picturesque town of Lymington rising
among the green trees and green fields.  I had, I confess, a feeling--grand as I had to appear--that
I knew less than anybody else on board about affairs nautical; but modesty is the frequent
companion of merit, and though I was very little, I might have been remarkably good.

By this time one of the prisoners began to come to himself, and his astonishment was only equalled
by his alarm when, on sitting up and rubbing his eyes, he found himself surrounded by strange
faces, and discovered that the craft was running up the Solent Channel.  My uniform at once
told him the truth.

"Where's Jim?" he asked, on seeing only his drunken companion near him.

"Jim--I don't know who you mean," answered Thole.  "If it was any one you left on deck, master,
why, all I can say is, he wasn't there when we boarded you."

On hearing this announcement, he started to his feet, instantly throwing off all appearance
of drunkenness, except that his eye was haggard and his cheek discoloured.  He was a man of
about fifty, of a stout build and a weather-beaten, bronzed face, rather full and good-humoured,
certainly not giving one the notion that he was an habitual drunkard. His hair was somewhat
long, and dishevelled and grizzled, from exposure to the atmosphere.

"What!  Jim not on board?" he exclaimed, rushing on deck.  "Where is my boy--what has happened
to him?"

He stood for a few seconds leaning against the companion-hatch, while his eye scanned the condition
of the vessel, and he seemed instinctively to comprehend what had happened.

"Where is Jim?" he repeated, in a hollow voice.

"I don't know, master," answered one of our men, whom he seemed to address.  "We only found
you two below.  If there was another of you, he must have been washed overboard while you lay
drunk in the cabin."

"Drunk!" he ejaculated; "then, my son, I've murdered you."  As he uttered these words he sprang
to the side, and would have thrown himself overboard, had not Thole, who just then came on
deck, caught him by the legs and dragged him forcibly back.  The unhappy man struggled violently
in his endeavour to perpetrate his intention.  "Jim, Jim, my son! you gone--gone for ever;
how can I go home and face your mother, my boy?" he cried, his bosom heaving with the passion
raging within.  Then he turned frantically to us, swearing oaths too frightful to repeat. 
"You've been murdering him, some of you, you bloody-handed king's officers.  I know you of
old.  It's little you care for the life of a fellow-creature. Where is he, I say?  I left him
on deck sound and well, as fine a lad as ever stepped.  How could he have gone overboard? 
He hadn't touched a drop; he was as sober as any one of you; but I know how it was, you chased
him and he wouldn't give in--he stood at the helm like a man; so you, you cowardly hounds,
shot him down as if he were a brute.  There's his blood on the deck--the brave lad's blood,
and you dabbling your feet in it--you, his murderers,--and laughing at me, his father."

Thus the unhappy man went raving on, conjuring up, in his excited imagination, scenes the most
dreadful.  Of course we heeded not his raving abuse, for we pitied him most sincerely.  There
was now no doubt that, while the father and his smuggling companion were drunk below, the son
had been knocked overboard.  In vain had the voice of the poor lad implored aid from those
whose brutal intoxication prevented them even from hearing his death-shriek ere he sunk for
ever.  It was with the greatest difficulty we could hold the wretched man as we dragged him
below and lashed him into one of the standing bed-places.  He there still continued raving
as before, now calling on his son to come to him, and then accusing us of his murder.  His
cries and groans at last awoke the other man out of his drunken trance, but it was some time
before he could comprehend what had happened.  He was not a father, and when at length he came
to his senses, he, with brutal indifference abused his companion for disturbing him.  As I
stood over the skylight which had been got off to give air to the little stifling cabin, I
heard him growl out, "Jim's gone, has he? his own fault then, not to keep a better look-out.
It's he, then, who's brought us into this scrape; and I don't see why you should make such
a jaw for what can't be helped.  There now, old man, just belay all that, and let me finish
my snooze.  We can't hang for it, you know; there, there, now,"--and he actually turned on
his side and went off to sleep again.  At length the father of the drowned lad wore himself
out and fell off, it seemed, into a sort of stupor.

"I never knew no good come of smuggling," observed Thole, rather sententiously.  "What they
makes they spends as fast as they gets, and no one's the better for it."

Nobody had a better right than had he to know this, for he had been somewhat addicted to the
practice in his youth, and had in consequence been sent on board a man-of-war.  The flood and
fair wind carried us right into Portsmouth Harbour, where I dropped my anchor and pulled on
shore to report my arrival to the custom-house authorities.  I was in one respect sorry that
my cruise was over, because I was obliged to descend from my rank as commander to that of midshipman;
but as I hoped some day to regain it, I did not grieve much about it, especially as I expected
to be soon able to set off and pay Larry a visit.  The two smugglers were sent to prison; one
afterwards entered on board of a man-of-war; the unhappy father died raving mad in the hospital,
calling himself the murderer of his son.

Thus ended what I may consider my first cruise.

CHAPTER FOUR.

MYERS THE SMUGGLER--I LEARN TO PLAY THE FIDDLE--SMELL GUNPOWDER--ACTION WITH A LUGGER--LEFT
IN THE LURCH.

The cutter soon after came in, and after seeing my men safe on board her, I got leave for a
day to pay a visit to Larry.  On ringing, I heard him stumping downstairs to open the door.
When he saw me, he could scarcely contain his delight; and forgetting etiquette and all rules
and precedents, he seized me in his arms as if I had been a baby, and almost squeezed the breath
out of my body.  Though I had not been away six weeks, he vowed that I had grown wonderfully,
and looked like a man already.  Mrs Harrigan was equally complimentary, and I could not help
feeling myself a person of mighty importance.  I was very glad to find that my old friend was
perfectly contented with his wife, and that he made himself very useful to her, so that there
was every prospect of their being comfortable together.  The house was full of lodgers; but
there was a little room which they insisted on my occupying.  They themselves lived in a back
parlour, where I spent the evening with them. I slept at their house, and the next morning
returned on board the cutter.  We were ordered to keep an especial look-out for Myers, whose
lugger was reported to have run more cargoes than any free-trader among the vast numbers engaged
in the illicit traffic.  She belonged to Beere, a small town on the Dorsetshire coast, in West
Bay.  It is a pretty, quiet little place, and consists of one long, broad street, built in
the centre of a valley reaching close down to the water's edge, with white cliffs on either
side of it.  The lugger was often seen off there; but we could not then touch her, as she was
never found with anything in her to enable us to prove that she was engaged in smuggling. 
Myers, whenever on these occasions we paid him a visit, was always the politest of men; and
a stranger might suppose that he had a vast regard for all king's officers, and for us especially;
and yet in reality no man hated us more cordially, or would more readily have worked us harm.

Cruising after smugglers is not the noblest work, perhaps, in which one can be engaged; but
it is necessary, not altogether unprofitable, and at times highly exciting.  In the war time,
the smugglers had large armed vessels, which set the king's cruisers at defiance, and seldom
failed to show fight.  When I was in the Serpent, they were frequently armed; but their business
was to run, and they never fired unless in hopes of knocking away the spars of a pursuer, or,
at the last extremity, to defend themselves.

I should be very ungrateful to old Hanks if I omitted to mention his kindness to me, and the
pains he took to give me instruction in my profession.  Among other accomplishments, he taught
me one of which he was not himself a little proud.

"D'Arcy," said he one day to me, "I've a regard for you, and I'll put you in the way, my lad,
of gaining your bread, should other trades fail."

"What is it, Hanks?"  I asked.  "I am glad to learn anything you will teach me."

"It is to perform on the violin, my boy," he answered.  "I learned the art for the reason I
mention.  I have never yet been called upon to gain a livelihood by it; but I do not know how
soon I may be, if things don't mend with me."

"Is it to learn the fiddle you mean?" said I.  "Faith, with all my heart, Hanks; and the sooner
I begin then, the better."

Hanks was delighted at gaining so willing a scholar, though I suspect our shipmates would rather
have had us both securely moored at the bottom of Fiddler's Race, off Yarmouth.  Whenever duty
permitted us, our fiddles were never idle.  My performance was not very scientific, certainly;
but I learned to play, after some months' scraping, many a merry tune, such as would make the
men kick up their heels irresistibly when they heard it.

"There, D'Arcy," said my kind instructor, at the end of the tune; "now, my boy, whatever happens,
and wherever you go, provided you can save your arms and your fiddle, you'll be a welcome guest,
and will never want a morsel to put in your mouth."

I found his words true; and on parting, he gave me one of his two fiddles, which he valued
as much as any piece of property he possessed.--But I am forestalling events.  We had been
cruising about for several days in search of Myers, when one morning at daybreak, we found
ourselves in the midst of a dense fog.  It was literally so thick that one could not see from
one end of the cutter to the other.  Just the sort of weather, indeed, when, without unusual
care, vessels are apt to run into each other.  There was about wind sufficient to send us gliding
through the water at the rate of three to four knots an hour; but the sea was perfectly smooth,--kept
down, it seemed, by the very weight of the fog.  One hand was stationed forward on the look-out,
and two others on either quarter, to guard against our being run into, or our running into
something else.  The wind was about west, and our whereabouts was as nearly as could be half-way
between Portland Bill and Berry Head.  We were all on deck in our thick Flushing coats, for
the fog in its effects was nearly like a shower-bath in regard to wetting us, and it hung in
large drops like heavy dew on many a tarpaulin hat, bushy whisker, and shaggy jacket; while
the sails were stiff and wet as if it had been raining hard all night.  It was not a pleasant
morning, but it might certainly have been very much worse in a hundred ways.  We ran on for
a couple of hours, with our main-boom over the larboard quarter, the tack triced up, and the
peak-halyards eased off, for we had no reason to hurry.  It was just about striking five-bells
in the morning-watch, when, as I happened to cast my eyes ahead, I thought I saw a dark object
looming through the mist.  The look-out saw her at the same moment.  "A sail on the starboard
bow," he sung out in a low voice--for revenue men learn to be cautious.  On hearing this, the
Commander stepped forward, and I followed him.  We could just distinguish through the mist
the three sails of a long, low lugger, standing close-hauled to the northward.

"By Jupiter, there's the Kitty at last!" exclaimed my uncle, rubbing his hands.  "We'll have
her this time, however."

There could be little doubt that if she was the Kitty, her people would be keeping too bright
a look-out not to have seen us; but probably they fancied we had not observed them, for they
did not alter their course, which would have carried them clear across our bows.  For another
minute we stood on as before, thus rapidly drawing nearer the stranger.  During this time,
our guns were cast loose, loaded and primed, ready to fire, in case she should prove to be
the smuggler, and refuse to heave-to.

"Let the mainsail jibe over; down with the tack; hoist the foresail," sung out the Commander
in a brisk tone.  "Be smart, my lads; set the gaff-topsail.  Stand by, to haul in the mainsheet."

These orders were issued just as the lugger was about to cross our bows; but our helm being
put down, prevented her from accomplishing this purpose; and a shot, sent skimming along the
sea ahead of her, showed her that we were wide awake.  All hands who had time to turn their
heads in her direction, were peering at her through the fog; and the general opinion was that
she was no other than the long-sought-for Kitty.  To the shot she paid not the slightest attention,
hoping to forereach us, probably, and to get away in the fog.  The chances were much in her
favour, unless we could wing her, for some little time to come; but after that, we should get
her into the bay, and then we might jam her down into the bight, and catch her.

"Give her another shot across her fore-foot, Mr Waddilove," cried the Commander.  "If she does
not pay attention to that, fire right into her, and we will try to knock away some of her spars."

"Ay, ay, sir," answered the gunner, right willingly, as he hurried to perform his duty.

She did not seem to regard the second shot with more respect than the first.  There was now
no doubt that she was a smuggler, and that she knew her to be a royal cruiser, but whether
the Kitty or not still remained to be discovered.  We accordingly, without ceremony, set to
work in earnest to make her a target for our shot; but though we believed that we hulled her
several times, we could not manage to knock away any of her rigging or spars.  Fast as we fancied
the Serpent, the chase, whatever she was, could, we soon found, show as fleet a pair of heels;
and this made us doubly anxious to wing her, lest, by the fog coming down thicker, she might
disappear altogether.  Not a sound was heard from her except the sharp pat as our shot at intervals
struck her; nor did she offer other than the passive resistance of refusing to heave-to.  At
last, so faint was her outline as she glided onwards on our starboard bow, that I could scarcely
help fancying that we were attacking a mere unsubstantial phantom.  It was only from the large
size she appeared to be, that one could judge of her nearness to us.  For some minutes we ran
on without a syllable being uttered, except the necessary words of command for loading and
firing the guns.

"Now let me see if I can hit the fellow," exclaimed Hanks, growing impatient at our want of
success; and stooping down and taking a steady look along the gun, he fired.  A fearful shriek
was the answer sent back from the lugger's deck.  She was standing on as before, her rigging
untouched, and her hull apparently unharmed.  That sound must have been the death-cry of some
of her crew.  An almost solemn silence followed, and then, as if slumbering hitherto, the fury
of the smugglers burst forth, and a shower of shot from great guns and musketry came flying
about us.  It was evident that she was prepared to resist to the last. We now found that we
had been under-rating her strength.  Our two other guns were run over to the starboard side,
the small-arms were got up on deck and loaded, and cutlasses were buckled on, and all hands
not required to work the guns began blazing away with the muskets.

"How do you like the smell of gunpowder, my boy?" asked Hanks, as he was driving down his ramrod.

"As for the smell, I can't say that I have any objection to it," I replied, laughing; "and
for the shot, they don't seem likely to do us much harm."

"Don't be too sure of that till the guns of the enemy are silenced," he replied.

Scarcely had he spoken, when I heard a deep groan; and oh, how my heart turned sick within
me, as I saw a poor fellow writhing in agony on the deck.  A round-shot had torn away his chest
and ribs.  He gave a few convulsive struggles, and all was over.  It was the first time I had
ever seen death in any form, or even blood spilt, and for the moment I felt so faint that I
thought I should have fallen; but Hanks roused me by calling for a loaded musket, and in a
few moments those dreadful sensations went off, never again to return.  Two of his messmates
drew the dead body out of the way, and then returned to their gun without apparently taking
further notice of the matter.  Our Commander was all life and ardour, urging on the men to
activity, while he kept a watchful eye on our opponent, to take advantage of any accident which
might happen to her, or to follow any change in her course.  It is difficult to describe the
scene our decks presented.  Though our guns were light, the men, from habit, had stripped themselves
to the waist, and each one had bound a silk handkerchief round his loins and another round
his head; their figures, even at a little distance, being obscured by the thick fog and smoke
from their guns and the small-arms.  All the guns were over on the starboard side, and those
not required to work them or tend to the sails were either loading or taking aim over the bulwarks
at our phantom foe.  I did not dare to look at the dead body which lay near me, and was praying
that no one else might be hit, when I heard a sharp tap, and old Thole, who was standing with
his musket at his shoulder by my side, fell to the deck.  I stooped down, shuddering, for I
expected to see such another ghastly spectacle as the other poor wretch had presented; but
he looked as calm as possible, as if nothing was the matter with him, and I began to wonder
why he had fallen.  He had not even uttered a cry or groan.

"What is the matter, Thole; are you hit?"  I asked.

Hanks heard me speak, and seeing Thole on the deck, he knelt down by his side and took his hand.

"There's no use, my lad, in talking to the poor fellow, for he'll never speak another word,"
he said, in a calm tone, as if nothing strange or awful had occurred; and rising quickly, he
seized a musket and recommenced firing away at the lugger with renewed earnestness.

"Come, my lads, fire away; we must put a stopper on this work as soon as possible," he exclaimed.

"Hurrah! see, we've shot away his mizen-halyards."

I did not see it, for I could make nothing out through the fog but a dark mass moving along
on our beam.  The order had been given to keep the helm up and to stand by the mainsheet, in
expectation of the lugger's running off the wind, when, quick almost as thought, the mizen-halyards
were spliced, and the sail was again hoisted up.

"Never mind, my lads; try and wing him again," cried my uncle.

The men answered with a cheer, and several of our shot told.  Unhappily, two more of our people
were wounded, though not badly; and as yet we were no nearer victory than we had been at the
commencement of the fight.  I heard my uncle tell Hanks that he had some hopes that the smugglers
were not aware how deep we were running into the bay.

"I'm afraid, sir, those fellows are far too wide awake not to know exactly where they are,"
answered Hanks.

"I rather am inclined to think that they have some dodge or other they intend to practise if
they can; and if we don't soon manage to stop them, they will be wishing us good morning without
our leave."

For an instant after he spoke there was a cessation of firing, and then came a whole broadside
of great guns and small-arms concentrated in one focus, crashing among our rigging.  Several
of the shot told--the head of the mainsail was riddled, and down came our peak, the halyards
shot away in two places.  The smugglers were not long in discovering our disaster and the advantage
they had gained, and a loud derisive cheer showed us the triumph they felt.  Without the loss
of a moment, hands were sent aloft to reeve fresh halyards; but before the peak could be got
up, the lugger had shot ahead of us, and was rapidly edging up to windward.  Every exertion
was made again to set the mainsail; but as we were swaying up the peak, another iron shower
came rattling among us. One of the hands aloft was hit, and would have fallen on deck, had
not another caught him and helped him down the rigging.  It was the last broadside the smuggler
fired, and the next instant we saw him shoot by our bows, and before we could get a gun over
to bear on him, he disappeared in the fog to the northward.  Once well to windward he would
have a decided advantage over us on a long stretch.  Luffing as close to the wind as we could,
we stood on for a few minutes in the hope of again seeing him; and then we tacked, on the chance,
should he also have tacked, as he probably would do, of overhauling him on the other board.
We now more earnestly than ever wished the fog to clear away to give us a wider view; but yet
minute after minute passed away, and still it would pertinaciously hang down over us like a
thick canopy, shutting out the surrounding world.  My uncle and Hanks, who both had seen much
of gun-shot wounds, did their best to doctor the poor fellows who had been hit; the bodies
of the two men who were killed, were placed side by side abaft the mast, and covered up with
a union jack; and we then piped to breakfast.  I had not recovered my appetite, which the scenes
I had witnessed during the morning had taken away.  Hanks rallied me on my sensibility.  "Why,
my boy, you should get over all those sort of feelings at a leap, or you'll never be fit for
the service.  I remember once upon a time having some of the queer sensations you talk of;
but now, whatever happens, I never let it interfere with my meals, provided I can get the food
to make them of."  Instigated by his example and remarks, I took a little tea, and then a slice
of beef and bread; and I confess that in a few minutes I began to experience my usual midshipman-like
state of perfect health, with perhaps a little weight about the region of the heart, as if
some calamity had happened to me, but that very soon wore off.  We were speedily on deck again,
looking out for the chase; while in the meantime the carpenter and most of the crew were busily
employed in repairing damages.  The sun as he rose higher in the sky, was every instant gaining
power, and in almost an hour after we lost sight of the smuggler, he victoriously darted through
the mass of vapour which in thick wreaths rolled away before it, our hitherto confined horizon
every instant increasing, while the bright beams of the luminary struck down on our blood-stained
deck.  No vessel, however, appeared in the direction we expected; but as Hanks was glancing
round the horizon, his eye fell on a sail, hull down to the eastward.  "There she is," he exclaimed;
"I should know her among a hundred other craft.  D'Arcy, run below and tell the Commander that
to my belief the Kitty is in sight down to leeward."

My uncle had gone to take his breakfast.  I descended to the cabin.  I found him sitting with
his face resting on his hands on the table.  He did not notice my entrance.  I heard him groan
deeply.

"I hope, sir, you are not ill or wounded," said I; for I thought he must be hurt.

"No, lad, no," he answered; "but it's a sad thing to have so many of one's men killed and hurt
by a rascally smuggler.  But we must try and catch the fellow, and then get the doctor's aid
as fast as we can for those to whom it may yet be of use.  But what do you come for?"

I made my report.  In an instant he shook off the feeling which was oppressing him, and springing
on deck, he ordered the helm to be kept up and the mainsheet eased off till we were standing
after the supposed smuggler.  This was our best point of sailing, and probably the lugger's
worst; at all events that rig of vessel has generally the greatest advantage on a wind.  Our
square-sail, square-topsail, and every sail the cutter could carry was now set, to overtake
the chase; and the breeze freshening as the day advanced, we bowled away at a famous rate.

"Do you think, Hanks, we have a chance of catching her?"  I asked, as the old mate and I were
intently watching her.

"As to catching her, depends upon circumstances.  If we get the strength of the breeze before
her, and she doesn't hide away in another fog; but she has a long start, and we are out of
luck this time, to my mind. However, why is it, D'Arcy, you are so anxious to have another
brush with the chap?  I thought you had had sufficient taste of his quality."

"To punish him for killing poor Thole there," answered I, for I felt very bitter against the
smugglers for the harm they had done.

"I thought so," answered Hanks.  "It's the way with most people.  Before a blow is struck,
they are all peaceable enough; but the moment blood is drawn, they are all as blood-thirsty
as a savage."

"I hope you don't think me a blood-thirsty savage," said I.

"I wouldn't trust you, D'Arcy, my boy," he replied.  "When the blood boils, all the ferocity
of the heart bubbles up to the top, and we feel more like wild beasts than men."

"Are we gaining on the chase, Mr Hanks, think you?" sung out my uncle at this moment.

"A little, sir; but the sky has got so much clearer thereaway in the last half-hour, that perhaps
she only appears nearer," was the answer; and then Hanks went aft, to walk the quarter-deck
with his Commander.

There is off Portland Bill a race, or overfall of water, caused by a shallow and rocky bottom,
where the sea at times breaks so violently that vessels have been known to be swamped, and
to go down amid the turmoil, with scarcely a possibility of any of the hapless crew escaping.
During south-westerly gales, and with an ebb tide, the race runs the highest; but sometimes,
even in moderate weather, without any apparent cause, there is a strange chopping and leaping
of the sea, which makes it dangerous for a small vessel to pass through.  The faint outline
of the well-known headland was now seen on our larboard bow, and it was pretty evident that
the lugger was getting her starboard tacks aboard, to haul off round the outside of the race,
if not to stand away towards the French coast.  We, accordingly, had to alter our course after
her; but I suspected that there was no very great chance of our being able to overtake her.
Still we stood on, our main hope being that another cruiser might fall in with her, and turn
her again towards us. After the fog had disappeared, the sky overhead became beautifully clear;
but, as the day drew on, clouds began to gather, and by the time I went down to dinner they
were coming up pretty thick from the south-west and south, rather an unusual circumstance after
the sort of morning we had had.  While we were discussing our meal, the cutter heeled over,
and nearly sent our scanty dinner-service away to leeward.

"Hillo, what's the matter now?"  I asked.

"Matter! why the breeze is freshening, to be sure," said old Growl, our acting master.  "Look
out for your plates, and when you go on deck it will be time enough to learn all about it."

Old Growl was in many respects not dissimilar to Hanks.  He was of the same age, if not older;
as fond of spirits, if not fonder; and as addicted, indeed I think more so, to grumbling. 
He was not a gentleman by birth, education, or manners; but he was kind of heart, and I liked
him very well.  I think I remarked that all the officers were very old for their standing.
Growl's hair was white, and so was Scriven's, the clerk in charge.  I was young enough to be
the son of any of them, in fact, and was treated almost as such.  Fortunately, my uncle did
his best to throw responsibility on my shoulders, so that, in spite of the pains they took
to spoil me, I gradually learned to think and act for myself.  Dinner was over, for the best
of reasons--that we had eaten up all our boiled beef and potatoes, and the greater portion
of our last cheese, and I was thinking how much pleasanter it was to be sitting there quietly,
and nibbling biscuit and sipping my glass of grog, than standing up to be shot at, as I had
to do all the morning, when Hanks, whose watch it had been on deck, came below.  His eye immediately
fell on my tumbler of grog, which was, I own, stiffer than usual; and without saying a word,
he emptied half the contents into another, and drinking them off, filled my glass with water.
I dared not remonstrate, for I had been transgressing his orders in taking more than the quantity
he allowed me.

"Neil, my child," he used to say, "drink is a bad thing; and it grows upon a fellow.  If you
were to take your full allowance now, by the time you grow up you would be a drunkard, so for
your sake I shall swallow your grog; besides, you know, what is bad for a little chap like
you, is good for an old worn-out follow like me, who wants something to keep his soul alive
in his body."

I did not exactly understand his reasoning; but as, notwithstanding his peculiarities, I was
fond of my old messmate, I was well content to yield him up part of my allowance, for the sake
of keeping him alive.

"Well, Hanks, are we gaining on the chase?"  I asked.

"No, boy; but our ill-luck has gained upon us," he replied.  "The wind has taken it into its
head to veer round to the south-west, and given the rascally lugger an advantage she doesn't
deserve.  Boy, bring me dinner."

The boy who acted as steward brought him in his portion of beef, which had been saved, and
I followed Growl, whose watch it was on deck.  The sea had got up considerably, and the cutter
was heeling over to the rapidly increasing breeze.  An exclamation from Growl made me look
anxiously ahead for the lugger.

"Where is she?" he asked of the quartermaster, who had charge of the deck.

"Just slipped into that bank of clouds gathering in the southward, sir," was the answer.

"Can any of you see her," he inquired of the people on deck.

"No, sir, no; not a sign of her," said several voices.

"Then we shan't see her again this cruise," he exclaimed.

No more we did.  We followed her, notwithstanding, for some hours, when darkness approaching
and the wind increasing, we were obliged to bear up and run into Weymouth, where we anchored
at a late hour in the night. The next day we buried our two shipmates, and a surgeon came off
to attend to the wounded ones, whom he took on shore with him.  A gale got up, which lasted
three days, during which time we remained at anchor, ready, as soon as it should moderate,
to put to sea again in quest of Myers.  The engagement with the smuggler made a good deal of
noise, we heard.  Some said that we ought to have taken her; others, that our Commander was
not a man to leave undone what could have been done. However, as no one had any doubt that
Myers was in command of the lugger, a large reward was offered to whoever would give information
that might lead to his apprehension, and a still larger to the person who should place him,
bound, in the hands of justice.  One evening, after dark, a small boat came alongside, with
a single man in her.  I was on deck.

"Is Lieutenant O'Flaherty on board?" asked the man.

I told him he was.

"Then," said the stranger, springing on board, "take this note to him, young gentleman, and
say the bearer waits to see him."

The stranger was of a strongly-built, stout figure, and had the appearance of a rough seafaring
man.  I took a paper he handed me into the cabin.  My uncle read it attentively two or three
times over, as if puzzled to comprehend its meaning.

"I must see the rascal, and hear what he has to say," he muttered.  "But I never like to trust
a traitor.  Show the man below, D'Arcy."

I did as I was ordered.  The man bowed as he entered, and then I saw him take a chair and seat
himself, without being asked to do so.  I longed to hear what he had to say, so I lingered
in the cabin, as if waiting for orders.  The stranger looked at me hard.

"What I have to say is for your ear, Lieutenant; so I can't speak with another present, though
he is but a little one," he remarked, in a tone I thought remarkably impudent.

"Neil, go on deck," said my uncle.

In about half an hour the stranger appeared on deck, and without saying a word, jumped into
his boat and pulled away.  I observed that he did not pull directly for the shore, but that
he steered for a considerable distance to the northward before attempting to land, thus not
allowing any one who might meet him to suspect that he had visited us.  The mysterious stranger
afforded considerable matter for surmise among all on board, the general opinion being that
he had brought off some important information, which might lead to the capture of Myers or
of some of his smuggling confederates.

CHAPTER FIVE.

EXPEDITION ON SHORE--THE INFORMER'S FATE--THE SMUGGLERS CAVE--JACK STRETCHER--THE SMUGGLER'S
REVENGE--OUR DREADFUL POSITION.

The Serpent was again in West Bay, just near enough to Portland Bill to be distinguished by
any one looking out for her; and she was standing with a light breeze from the north-east,
as if bound across Channel.  We stood on till dusk, and then tacked and worked back into the
bay, till we got close in with the Dorsetshire coast.  The cutter was now hove-to, and the
boats were lowered and manned, all hands being well-armed.

"Mr Hanks," said my uncle, as he came on deck, "you will take charge of the ship, and keep
her as near as possible to where she now is: I expect to be absent about an hour."

Hanks gave the usual "Ay, ay, sir," and then continued the duty he was about in superintending
the lowering the boats.  I seized the opportunity, while he was waiting for the final preparations,
to go up and speak to my uncle.

"May I go, sir?"  I asked.  "If there is anything to be done, I should like to see it."

"We shall only find hard knocks and little glory," he replied. "However, a midshipman should
see everything.  Can you spare Mr D'Arcy, Mr Hanks?"

"Oh yes, sir, if you please," said Hanks, laughing.

I had at first felt very grand at the way my uncle spoke of me; but there was something in
Hanks' tone of voice which considerably lowered my pride.  However, I gained my object, and
jumping into the first gig with my Commander, the order was given to shove off, and away we
pulled towards the shore.

There was no moon, but the sky was clear, and the stars overhead shone brightly forth into
the calm, silent water beneath them.  I never saw the water smoother; and the little wind there
was came off the shore, gently sighing as it passed over the dry grass and low bushes which
fringed the edge of the cliffs above our heads.  Not a word was spoken, and our oars were muffled,
as we pulled along shore, a considerable distance to the westward of where we left the cutter.
There were three boats, so we all knew it was possible some considerable opposition might be
expected.

After we had pulled about three or four miles, our Commander ordered two of the boats to remain
off shore, the crews resting on their oars, till they should see a blue light burned; they
were then to give way as fast as they could, and support us if necessary.  We then pulled slowly
in, our people being told to make as little noise as possible on beaching the boat.

"Neil," said my uncle, "we have a chance of catching that accomplished rascal, Myers, through
the means of another rascal, who has offered to betray him, and who is to meet us off that
point yonder, and to conduct us where Myers and his gang are to be found.  If we come to blows
at any time, just keep behind me, boy, and don't be after getting yourself killed or hurt,
or I'll never take you to see any more fun, remember that."

It was clear, by this remark, that my uncle had not forgotten the old country; and I promised
to obey his directions.

In a few minutes the bow of the boat touched the shore, and we, by aid of a boat-hook, jumped
on the sand.  Ordering two of the men to accompany him, and giving directions to the others
to keep silence, and on no account to quit the boat, our commander advanced towards the foot
of the cliff.  We went on some little way without meeting anybody.

"It is very extraordinary," he observed, in a low voice.  "I cannot have mistaken the spot
or the hour.  It was just here the man Langdon appointed to meet me."  We halted for some minutes
and listened attentively, but not a sound was to be heard except the low, soft, and musical
lap of the tide as it glided by the shingly beach.  Above us was the lofty cliff beetling over
our heads, its dark outline well-defined against the brilliant sky.

"Something, I'm afraid, is wrong," remarked my uncle; "or can the fellow have been imposing on me?"

Having waited for some time in vain, we again advanced.  We had not gone many paces when a
figure was seen leaning against the cliffs.  The person, apparently, from his not moving at
our approach, was fast asleep.

"That must be the fellow Langdon," said my uncle.  "Why, what can he be about?"  On this he
whistled twice, very softly, but there was no answer.  We then hurried up to the spot where
the figure was observed. It was no optical illusion; there certainly was a person, but he took
no notice of our presence.  Our two men then went up to him, thinking to awake him; but as
they took him by the arms he slipped from their grasp, and fell to the ground.  An exclamation
of horror made us hurry up to them.  It was a corpse we saw.  A dark spot on the forehead,
from which a stream of blood, rapidly coagulating, oozed forth.  His singed hair, and the black
marks on one side of his face, showed how the deed had been done.  It was evident that he had
been shot by a pistol placed close to his head.

"He hasn't been dead above a quarter of an hour," observed Stretcher, one of the men, feeling
his heart.  "He is still warm, sir."

"Then his murderers cannot be far off," said my uncle.  "I'll land our people, and we will
hunt them down.  The poor wretch could scarcely expect any other fate were he discovered."

"What--do you know the man, sir?"  I asked.  "Yes, he is the informer, Langdon; the very man
who was to have conducted us to Myers' retreat," was the answer.

"Here, sir, is a bit of card tied round the man's neck, and close to him was this pistol and
handkerchief," said Tomkins, who had placed the body on the sands, bringing him the articles.

"Very well; do you take charge of those things, Tomkins, and on no account lose them.  D'Arcy,
do you go back with Sims to the boat; burn a blue light close down to the water, shade it by
the boat's side so that it may not be seen from the cliffs above; and then, as soon as the
boats come in, order two hands to remain in each, and bring the rest up here."

"Ay, ay, sir," I replied with alacrity, for I was always proud of having any orders given me
by my uncle; and away I and Sims hurried towards the boat.  We had not got many paces before
a shout from Jack Stretcher made us turn back, and at the same moment several men came leaping
down by a narrow path in the side of the cliff.

"Run in--they are smugglers--run in!" cried Sims, setting the example, and shouting to our
people in the boat.  It was the wisest thing he could do to get help, for the man was no coward;
but before I had time to think whether or not I could run down to my uncle, I found myself
knocked down by one of the foremost of the new comers, with a not very complimentary remark
to midshipmen in general, and to me in particular. What became of Sims I could not tell, for
the blow on my head made me feel inclined to keep my eyes shut.  When, after a moment or so,
I attempted to rise, I found myself seized by a couple of men.  My arms were lashed behind
me in a very uncomfortable way, and which reminded me of the necessity of not tumbling down,
if I was anxious to preserve the regular outline of my nose; while a handkerchief was secured
tightly over my eyes.  Directly afterwards I heard a scuffle, and my uncle's voice among that
of many others; blows were struck, and two or three pistols were fired; and then there appeared
more scuffling, and all was quiet except the suppressed murmur of apparently many voices as
I was dragged forward by the people who held me.  We went along the seashore for some way,
and then up the cliffs; and next we descended, and I was led along what seemed a narrow path
by the careful way in which my conductors stepped.  We went over certainly more than a mile
of ground, and then we halted till other parties came up, and I was led down a gentle declivity
on a soft, sandy soil; but I no longer felt the light cool wind blowing on my cheek, from which
I conjectured we were leaving the open air.

Scarcely a word had been spoken to me the whole of this time by any one of the party.  I once
ventured to ask my conductors where they were going to take me; but the answer I got in a low
growl--"Hold your tongue, you young whelp!" and the click of a pistol lock--made me unwilling
to enter on another question.  I was more seriously alarmed about my uncle.  For myself I feared
nothing, as I did not think that the smugglers would hurt a young boy like me; but from the
manner of their proceeding, and the few words they let fall of concentrated hate and anger,
I was afraid that, supposing they were the crew of the Kitty, they might wreck their vengeance
on his head and murder him.  I had become deeply attached to him.  I felt miserable at the
thought of his danger, and I earnestly, though silently, prayed for his preservation.  After
we had gone a little way, I was almost convinced, from the damp, stagnant feel of the atmosphere,
that we were in a cavern or a large vault of some sort or other.  I was confirmed in this opinion
by hearing a voice before me say, "Stoop down your head or you will hit the rock."

I thought he addressed me, so I bent down as if I were passing under a very low archway, when
my conductors laughed, and one observed to the other, "The youngster thinks himself a giant;
howsomever, he won't ever be much bigger than he now is, will he, Jim?"

"No; he's nibbled his last biscuit," growled out his companion.  "Come, heave ahead, master."

On hearing these last observations I had stopped, scarcely able to make my feet move on; for
I thought the villains were going to treat me as they had treated the poor wretch we had just
found, for I had no doubt they were his murderers.  They again urged me forward, and I presently
found myself in a place surrounded by a number of people--at least so I judged by the suppressed
hum of voices which I heard.

"Cast off the handkerchiefs from the prisoners' eyes," said a voice in an authoritative tone.

I felt a fellow fumbling at the handkerchief round my head; but pretending, I suspect, that
he could not undo it, he forced it down over my face, to the considerable damage of my nose,
and then, giving his knuckles a turn with the dexterity of a Thug, very nearly throttled me.
When I had somewhat recovered, and the stars had done flying about before my eyes, I perceived
that I was in a large cave, standing at the foot of a rude table, at the further end of which
sat a powerfully-built, bold-looking man, dressed in a nautical costume, while a number of
other men, mostly seamen, sat on either side of him.

I looked anxiously round for my uncle, and my mind was much relieved to see him standing, unhurt
apparently, a few paces from me.  However, my satisfaction was much mitigated when, being able
to distinguish objects more clearly, I perceived that there were two men standing on either
side of him, with pistols in their hands; and it instantly occurred to me that they were there
to act the part of executioners, and to blow his brains out, at the command of the ruffian
I saw sitting as judge in this lawless court.  We recognised each other at the same moment;
and if I could judge by the expression of his countenance, he had more compassion for me than
fear for himself.  He made no attempt to speak to me, but instantly resumed his former undaunted
attitude, with his arms folded on his bosom, and his eye resting on the leader of the smugglers.

But there was another object which was, indeed, well calculated to fill me with horror.  It
was the corpse of the murdered man, stretched out on some rough planks, resting on four casks
placed on end; the face uncovered and bloody; the eyes staring wide open, for no one had taken
the trouble to close them; and the features distorted by the wound or, perhaps, by fear of
the fate which he saw prepared for him when his murderers appeared.  The corpse was close to
me, and I could not keep my eyes from it, dreadful as it was.  It seemed to possess a terrible
fascination; and every time I turned my eyes away, it attracted them back again; so that, wild
and remarkable as was the whole scene, that horrible object is to this day the most prominent
to my mental vision, and all the rest is but an indistinct background to the picture.

I found that Jack Stretcher was close to me, on my left side, also in custody of two smugglers.
The cave itself was a complete storehouse of goods of every description.  There were arms--swords,
pistols, and muskets; and bales of silks, boxes of laces and ribbons, and casks of spirits:
indeed, everything with a high duty on it was here collected, ready to be sent up to London
or through the country, to the highly respectable shops which dealt in such things.  I had
not time, however, to make many observations, when the fierce ruffian at the head of the table
commenced the proceedings by inquiring who we were and what was our object in coming on shore
that night.

"You know perfectly well who we are, and with regard to our object on shore, you certainly
are not qualified to question me," answered my uncle, with a firm voice.

"Then I must answer for you," replied the smuggler.  "You came, instigated by a wretch whose
body lies there, under the hopes of taking me and my men in our nest.  He has received his
reward.  The very moment he was thinking he had got us secure, a pistol bullet went through
his head.  What do you think you deserve?"

My uncle did not answer.

"Speak, and answer me!" exclaimed the ruffian, levelling a pistol at him.

I tried to spring forward to throw myself before him, but the smugglers held me back, though
the action, instead of making them angry, seemed to gain we more respect from them, as they
held me less rudely than before, and no longer amused themselves by twisting the handkerchief,
Thug fashion, round my gullet.

My uncle looked calmly at the smuggler and answered, "I came on shore in pursuit of my lawful
duty, to apprehend you, or any others, breaking the revenue laws.  Further than that, I have
no feeling of ill-will against you, or any of those connected with you."

"Very fine talking, Mr Lieutenant; but that won't do here.  You came to injure us; there's
no doubt about that, from what you own yourself; and you must take the consequences."

"You will suffer for it, if you injure me or any of my people!" exclaimed my uncle, indignantly.

"We don't want to hurt any of your people; but you and that young cub of an officer must be
prepared to die this very night.  Your man there we don't intend to hurt; and he may, if he
likes, join us, which he probably will be glad enough to do; if not, we carry him away over
the water, far enough from this."

"No, that I won't, you cold-hearted scoundrels, you!" exclaimed Jack Stretcher, vehemently.
"My Commander there, I tell you, is a truer and braver man than any one of you; and you to
think of murdering him because he is doing his duty, and that young innocent boy, his nephew--a
mere baby to any of you,--it just shows what a white-livered crew you smugglers are; but, howsomdever,
if you'll let them go without harm, you may make a shot fast to my feet and heave me over the
cliffs outside here, or do what you like with me; you can but kill me, and I don't fear you--so
heave ahead, my hearties."

This address of Jack Stretcher created some considerable sensation among the smugglers; but
their chief seemed immovable.  What surprised me most was, that they were not in the slightest
degree enraged at the abuse showered so liberally on their heads; but, on the contrary, they
infinitely admired him for his fearlessness and fidelity to his superior.

"What you say, my man, can't be done; those two die, for conspiring with a traitor to betray
us.  We shall keep you shut up for some time, and then carry you over to America, perhaps,
or some distant part; but we shan't take your life; so now you know what you have to expect.
Take those two off, and heave them over High-Peak Cliff.  Be sharp about it, now."

Before my uncle could speak a word or attempt to free himself, he was dragged back and pinioned,
and I was treated in the same way; our eyes were tightly bandaged, as before; and we were forced
out of the cavern by a large body of the smugglers.

"Never fear, sir," shouted Stretcher.  "They'll hang for it yet, and I shall live to see you
revenged."

Extraordinary as it may appear, I had no particular dread of the fate which was awaiting me.
Perhaps it was a presentiment that I should escape.  I cannot now explain the cause of the
feeling; indeed, at the time, I could not probably have done so.  I thought much more of my
brave uncle being thus brought to an untimely end, and of the grief of my sweet young aunt
at Ryde, when she should hear of his barbarous murder.  The atrocity of the deed was increased
by the cold-blooded manner in which the wretches proceeded, by dragging us to their pretended
court, and then condemning us, with scarcely even the mockery of a trial.  Indeed the affair
seemed so unusual, that I could hardly believe in the reality.  My most absorbing feeling was
bitter indignation, and a burning desire to break from my guards, and to rescue my uncle. 
However, as I wriggled about helplessly in their grasp, I must own that I was very like an
unhappy cockchafer stuck through with a pin by a cruel schoolboy, without the remotest chance
of escaping.  My uncle was dragged away first, and I followed him closely, as I judged by the
voices of the villains who had him in charge.  What became of Stretcher I could not learn,
though I supposed that he was detained in the cavern.  Even now, I could scarcely have believed
that the smugglers were going really to put their threat into execution, had it not been for
their acknowledgment of the murder they had committed, and the perfect confidence with which
they exhibited their cavern, and the smuggled goods it contained; for, though taken blindfold
to the place, we could, of course, have little difficulty in finding it again; and they must
have been well aware that, if we escaped, we should do our best to discover them and bring
them to justice.  They appeared to me to be dragging us for a very long distance.  We went
up and down hill, and along the seashore, and then we again mounted, it seemed, to the top
of the cliffs, and went over several miles of ground.  I thought we should never get to High-Peak
Cliff.  I cannot say that I was in any hurry to get there, which is not surprising, considering
the pleasant prospect which I had before me.  At length we ascended a considerable height,
it seemed; and I concluded, from what I heard some of the smugglers remark, that we had reached
the place of the intended murder.  I shuddered as I felt that I was standing at the edge of
the precipice from which I was in a few minutes to be hurled; a cold perspiration burst out
over me, and I felt an awful horror, such as I had never before experienced.  I was aware that
any instant, without a moment's preparation, a shove might send me rolling over and over down
to the rocks below, where I must instantly be dashed to pieces, as I judged that I was standing
close to the very edge of the precipice; and I even fancied that I could hear the sound of
the water breaking on the sands, many hundred feet beneath, borne upward on the calm night
air.  Still, there I stood, as yet unharmed, and I found the delay was caused by some of the
party, whose voices I could hear at a little distance, holding a consultation in a whisper.
I was hoping that they, more merciful than their leader, were proposing not to execute his
directions, when I was undeceived by their return.  One of them then addressed us.

"We give you and the youngster, Lieutenant, three minutes more to prepare for death," said
the villain, in a diabolically cold tone; "after that, we intend to hang you over the cliff
by your hands, and when you can't gripe on any longer, you may let go.  Just understand, now,
we do this in mercy to you, that you may not say we sent you out of the world without warning.
Youngster, you hear what is said, so just make ready, for you haven't many moments of life in you."

To appeal to the mercy of the wretches was, I knew, hopeless; so I did my best to prepare for
the fate awaiting me.

"The time's up," said a voice, and I found myself urged back a few paces, and my feet lifted
over the edge of the cliff.  It is impossible to describe my sensations of horror at this moment.
I was then lowered down, every instant expecting to be let drop, till I found my hands clutching
the grass, and my nails digging into the uncertain soil which fringed it.  I judged that my
uncle had been treated in the same way, from what the smugglers said.  They then left us, satisfied
that we could not release ourselves.  Bad as they were, perhaps they did not wish to witness
our death, though I could hear their mocking laughter as they quitted the spot.  I was light,
and I held on for dear life.

"Uncle, are you there?"  I exclaimed.

"Yes, Neil, I am," he answered; "but I am afraid of using any exertion to lift myself up, lest
the earth should give way.  You are light, though; so try to drag yourself slowly up by your
arms, then get your elbows on the turf, and tear the bandage from your eyes, and come to my
assistance."

"Oh, I cannot, uncle, I cannot!"  I cried, in an agony of fear; for I found it impossible to
move without almost a certainty of missing my hold altogether.  Again I tried all I could to
lift myself up, but it would not do.  I shouted at the top of my voice.  Every instant my strength
was failing me.

"I must let go, uncle, indeed I must," I exclaimed.  "Good-bye, uncle."

"So must I, my boy," he answered.  "Good-bye, if we do not succeed; but make a final effort,
and spring up.  So now--"

I tried to spring up, and so did he, I conclude.  Alas! the earth crumbled beneath his hands;
a deep groan escaped his bosom--not for himself, but for his wife and children, and all he
held dear in the world.  He could hold on no longer.  I also failed in my attempt to spring
up.  Down I went; but what was my surprise, instead of being dashed to pieces, to find that
I had reached a bottom of some sort, rather splashy certainly, only a few feet below where
I had been hanging.  An exclamation at the same moment from my uncle reached my ears.  I tore
off the bandage from my eyes, and looking round, I saw him but a short distance from me, and
discovered that we were at the bottom of a chalk-pit, with all our limbs safe and sound, instead
of being both of us mangled corpses at the foot of High-Peak Cliff.  Our position was not dignified;
and certainly, though it was much less romantic and full of horror than it would have been
had the catastrophe we expected really occurred, and had we figured in the newspapers as the
subjects of a dreadful accident, it was, I must own, far more agreeable to my feelings.

"Uncle," I sung out, "are you hurt?"

"No, Neil, my boy; but rather wet, from a puddle I've fallen into," he answered.  "So those
confounded rascals have been playing us a trick all the time.  However, it's better thus than
we expected, and it proves that they are not as bad as we thought them."

"So I was thinking," I replied, moving up to him.  "But, I say, uncle, how are we to get out
of this?"

He was sitting down on a ledge of the chalk rock, endeavouring to recover from the shock which
his nervous system had received.

"Why, as I have not a notion where we are, we had better wait till daylight, or we shall run
a great chance of going over the cliffs in reality," said he.  "The sun will rise in little
more than an hour hence, I hope, and then we shall be able to ascertain whereabouts we are."

In accordance with his advice, I sat myself down by his side, and remained silent for some
time, while I watched the stars glittering overhead.  At length I remarked, "It is very odd,
uncle, that Myers did not murder us, as he did the poor wretch we found under the cliff."

"I fully expected he would; but, after all, there are several reasons against such an act,"
he answered.

"He put the spy to death, both for the sake of vengeance and that he might not betray any more
of his secrets, or show us the smugglers' hides.  Myers, however, knew that if he murdered
a king's officer, the Government authorities would not rest till they had brought him to punishment.
There is also a wild notion of justice among these outlaws; and as they know we are but doing
our duty in pursuing them, they have not the same bitter feeling towards us as they have towards
any of their companions who turn traitors.  Myers, perhaps, might have wished to secure a friend,
in case of need.  The fellows who had charge of us, however, could not resist the temptation
of playing us a trick, and trying to frighten us out of our wits.  Some years ago, also, Myers
was in my custody, and I treated him, as I should any fellow-creature, with some kindness and
consideration.  I spoke to him seriously, and endeavoured to win him from his evil courses.
I did not consider myself either as his judge or executioner.  Perhaps, therefore, gratitude
may have induced him to spare our lives."

"I have no doubt of it," said I.  "I have to thank you, therefore, uncle, for my life."

"I don't suppose they would have hurt you, Neil, had you been alone," he observed, laughing.

"Do you think that we shall be able to discover the cavern?"  I asked.

"I fear not," he replied.  "Even if we did, it would be emptied of its contents.  Depend on
it, the smugglers were prepared to carry off everything into the interior, and all the valuable
goods are by this time a long way on their road to London.  At all events, whatever were the
motives of the smugglers, let us offer our thanks to God for the preservation of our lives,
for they have been in great peril."

We knelt and prayed.  I hope I did so sincerely.  What other remarks he made I do not remember,
for I soon after this felt very drowsy, and quickly fell asleep.  I dreamed all the time that
I was tumbling head over heels down precipices, but never reached the ground.  So I shall end
this chapter at the bottom of a chalk-pit.

CHAPTER SIX.

WE GET OUT OF THE PIT--JACK STRETCHER'S ADVENTURE--SEARCH FOR MYERS-- HANKS' ADVICE--LOSE OUR
SHIP IN A FOG--MINUTE-GUNS HEARD.

I was awoke by my uncle, and looking up, I saw that the stars had grown dim, and that the rosy
dawn was rapidly spreading over the sky.  When there was sufficient light to enable us to see
distinctly, we discovered that we were in an unusually large and deep chalk-pit.  We had, however,
but little difficulty in climbing out of it, and in reaching the top of the down in which it
was situated.  What was our surprise, on looking seaward, to discover the cutter riding at
anchor below us, and the boats just going off to her!  We therefore went to the most conspicuous
height, and waved our caps and handkerchiefs, in the hopes that some one might by chance be
on the look-out with a telescope, and perceive us. We waited for some time, and were just giving
up the case in despair, when one of the boats put off from the cutter, and pulled directly
for the beach, above which we were standing; so we hurried down by a rough zigzag path cut
in the cliff, and were ready on the shore to receive her when she pulled in.  Who should we
see in the boat but Stretcher, whom we fancied all the time held in durance vile by the smugglers.
The honest fellow's satisfaction at seeing us was even greater than our surprise; for he had
fully believed that we had been murdered, and had reported our death on board.  The boat's
crew gave three cheers as they ran up on the beach; and in their delight they almost lifted
my uncle and me into the boat.  We were not long in getting on board again, when the cheers
were repeated by all hands; and I must do honest old Hanks the justice to say, that, though
he had doubtless begun to indulge in dreams of getting his promotion and the death vacancy,
his pleasure was as genuine as that of the rest.  He had, we found, been already arranging
a plan to search for us, and to discover and capture the smugglers.  The latter part of it,
our Commander determined forthwith to execute.  Before we went to breakfast, Stretcher was
sent for to make his report--a proceeding of which I did not approve, for I was very sharp-set;
but midshipmen's appetites are seldom much thought of on such occasions.  Jack soon made his
appearance, with his hat in one hand, while he smoothed down his hair most pertinaciously with
the other.

"Well, Stretcher, my man; I wish to know how you managed to escape so well out of the fangs
of those rascals," said my uncle.

"Why, your honour," he answered, "I scarcely know how it all happened myself, for after the
blackguards dragged off you and Mr D'Arcy, I was in such a taking, thinking that they were
going to heave you over the cliff, that I didn't seem to know where I was or what I was doing.
At last they made the handkerchief fast round my eyes again, so that I couldn't see a wink;
and they began to haul me along, till I found that I was out of the cave and in the open air.
On I went, up and down hill, some way inland, it seemed; and then back again through a chine
down to the seashore.  After a bit they led me up hill, and making me sit down on a rock, they
told me that if I stirred an inch before daylight, I should meet with the same fate my master
had done.

"`How am I to tell when daylight comes, you lubbers, if you leave me with my eyes blinded,' said I.

"No one answered, but I fancied I heard some one laugh close to me. They then lashed my arms
behind me, so that I could not cast off the bandage from my eyes.

"`So you are not going to carry me to foreign parts,' said I, for I thought, as they didn't
mind killing my officer, they would think nothing of sending me over the cliffs also.

"`We've changed our minds,' said they, `and can't be troubled with you; so ask no questions.'

"I didn't like the answer at all, for I made sure they was going to do away with me somehow;
but, as I couldn't help myself, I was not going to show them what a funk I was in; so I pretended
to whistle, quite happy like.  I had been whistling away some time, when I thought I heard
their footsteps moving off; and so it proved; for when I next sung out to them, no one answered.
I called them all manner of names, and blackguarded them like fun; but it didn't make them
angry, because, you see, there was no one there to hear me.  At last, when I'd grown hoarse
with hallooing after them, I thought I might as well go to sleep a bit, seeing as how I couldn't
manage to move, or to cast off the lashings round my arms.  How long I slept I don't know;
but I was woke up by hearing some one hail me, and I soon knew that they were some of the cutter's
people.  When they got up to me, and cast off the handkerchief from my eyes, then I found I
had been sitting not ten feet above the beach, and directly opposite where the cutter is brought
up.  That, your honour, is all I know about it; but who the people are who played us the trick,
or whereabouts the cave is, is more than I can say."

"Do not you think that we might manage to discover the cave, though?" asked the Commander.

"No, sir, certainly not," answered Stretcher, positively.  "It may be close to us, or it may
be five miles off.  To my mind, it's some very clever hide; and those who took us there knew
very well we should never find it again."

"We must see about that," observed my uncle.  "By-the-bye, Stretcher, I gave you some things
to take charge of; where are they?"

"Here, sir; they never overhauled my pockets, which shows that they have some manners, at all
events," said Jack, producing a pistol, a handkerchief, and a card.  My uncle took the card,
and on it were written the words, "This is the way we punish informers and traitors."

"Perhaps, sir, you don't know who the man was who took the lead of the rest in the cave," said
Stretcher.

"Who was he?" asked the Commander.

"No other than Bill Myers himself," answered Jack.  I knew him directly, and several of those
with him; but I thought it better to keep a silent tongue in my head, so they didn't suspect
me.  To my mind, Myers murdered the man as a warning to others not to attempt to play a like
trick upon him.  From what I happened to hear, I suspect the lugger has run her cargo, and
is by this time off again; for I am certain some of the people we saw belonged to her, and
they wouldn't be likely to stay in this place after the work which has been done.

Nothing more of importance being elicited from Jack, he was dismissed; and my uncle arranged
with Hanks that all the boats should visit the shore, and that a strict search should be made
to discover the cave; while we should communicate with the authorities, and state what had
occurred.  The mist of the morning having cleared off, a look-out was kept at the masthead
for the lugger, should she be in sight, but not a sign of her appeared; and as soon as breakfast
was over, a large party of officers and seamen went on shore to hunt for the cave.  My uncle,
Stretcher, and I, meantime, went off to the nearest magistrate, to make our depositions.  Mr
Gibson, the magistrate, received us very politely, and expressed his anxiety to sift the affair
to the bottom, and to bring the offenders to justice.  He took charge of the things we had
found; and while he entertained us at luncheon, he sent about to make inquiries on the subject.
The man, whose corpse we believed we had seen, was found to be missing, and we learned that
he was well-known to be connected with the smugglers; but of the cave, and the cargo which
we suspected to have been run, no one could, or rather would, afford any information.  When,
however, it was known that murder had been committed, several persons, who had no objection
to assist in simple smuggling, but had a prejudice against murdering people, came voluntarily
forward to state all they knew and suspected about the matter.  By several, Myers had been
seen on shore during the previous day; and, what is extraordinary, one of the witnesses, an
alehouse-keeper, swore that he had seen him use the very handkerchief we had found to sweep
the crumbs off a table at which he had been eating bread and cheese, in order to have it clean
for writing.  He had also given him a letter to post, which he had forgotten to do.  The handwriting
was exactly like that on the card.  Another witness said that he knew Myers by sight perfectly;
that later in the day, as he was taking a cut across some fields near the cliffs, he had seen
him seated under a tree, and that he was either loading or cleaning a pistol of the size and
shape of the one now produced.  Indeed there was ample circumstantial evidence to enable Mr
Gibson to issue a warrant for the apprehension of Myers on a charge of murder, whenever and
wherever he could be found.  A reward was afterwards offered to whoever should capture him.
It is very extraordinary that the cave could not be discovered, nor could we gain any information
about the goods which had been seen.  Of Myers himself no tidings could be obtained.  There
was no doubt that he had committed the murder, and he must have been aware that many of his
old friends might be tempted by the prospect of the reward to deliver him up, should he venture
again among them.  The general opinion was, therefore, that we should hear nothing more of
him.  We, however, continued cruising in search of his lugger; but, though we chased at different
times several craft which we thought might be his, we never got them within range of our guns.
We, however, captured several other smuggling vessels, and made prize of a considerable number
of tubs.  The latter we picked up, either floating out at sea, or we got them by groping after
they had been sunk.  Smuggling vessels carry a considerable portion of their cargo lashed along
outside, just above the water.  When hard pressed these are cut away, and the rest are thrown
overboard, so that when overhauled, nothing contraband may be found on board.  When within
a short distance of land, so that marks on the shore can be seen, weights are attached to the
tubs, which are all fastened together; and the marks being observed, so that the spot should
be known again, they are sunk.  Sometimes we saw them being hove overboard and sunk; and then,
of course, we did our best to get them again.  We at length took a longer cruise than usual,
and were for some time knocking about in the longitude of Plymouth, and that turbulent portion
of the aqueous world--the Chops of the Channel.  There was a light wind and a smooth sea, and
we were dodging along under easy sail, being in no hurry to get anywhere.  I was walking the
deck with Hanks, talking on matters doubtless very erudite and abstruse; but I now forget what
they were. Scriven was casting up his accounts--literally, not metaphorically, be it understood;
Growl was endeavouring to forget his cares, with eyes fast closed, on two chairs in the gun-room;
and our Commander was below, reading.

"D'Arcy, I have taken a fancy to you, and I want to give you some good advice," remarked my
companion, after some time.  "Just remember what I say, and it will be useful to you in elbowing
your way, as you must, through this crowded world.  First, then, keep that potato-trap of yours
shut, except when you want to catch potatoes in it; and your eyes and ears open on all occasions.
There is little harm in knowing a thing, but there is a very great deal in repeating it; and
much harm often in letting others be aware that you do know it.  Then, my boy, always remember
to look before you leap, and not to let go one rope before you have a firm gripe of another.
You pretty boys from green Erin's Isle are too apt to do things in a hurry--to knock a fellow
down, and then to ask his pardon, on finding that he wasn't the man you intended to floor;
like the Irish soldier officer who declared that anchovies grew on the walls of Gibraltar,
and when he had shot his friend for doubting his statement, recollected that it was capers
he meant."

I laughed at Hanks' old story, though it was a hit against my countrymen; for I have always
found it far better to laugh off anything said against one's self, than to put on the dignities
and to look grand. Laughter and good humour are like polished shields, which make the shafts
of satire glance off on either side; but sulkiness and dignity are sure to bring them thick
around them.

Our conversation was interrupted by the cry of "A sail on the weather bow!"  The wind was about
south-east, and the cutter's head was up Channel.  I went to report her to the Commander, who
immediately came on deck, and, looking at her attentively through his glass, ordered a boat
to be lowered.  He then returned below, and brought up a package.

"Mr D'Arcy," said he--and I felt very grand to be so called,--"take this parcel on board yonder
ship.  I think I know her.  If she is bound to ---, leave it with the master, to be delivered
immediately on his arrival; if not, bring it back."  I forget now the name of the place he
mentioned.

"Ay, ay, sir," I answered; and jumping into the boat, shoved off.  Jack Stretcher, who, in
consequence of his behaviour with the smugglers, had gained the estimation of all on board,
was with me in the boat.  Away we pulled towards the ship with rapid strokes, for we knew that
the faster we pulled the less distance we should have to go.  We were about half-way between
the cutter and the ship, when a bank of mist came rolling slowly along from the southern horizon,
the opposite extremities seeming to close in, till a circle was formed around us, still, however,
having the cutter and the ship within its confines.  On we rowed, the circle growing smaller
and smaller, till, by the time we reached the ship, our own vessel was completely shrouded
from view.  As I knew exactly where she was, that did not trouble me.  The ship proved to be
the one I was sent to board--the Ajax, I think, was her name.

I delivered my despatches.  The master asked me down into the cabin to take a glass of wine,
which it would have been against the principles of a midshipman to refuse.  I took two or three,
and ate some cold chicken and ham into the bargain.  There were, I remember, a number of passengers,
who were very civil, and some gave me letters to take on shore; indeed it is just possible
that one of the reasons why I was so hospitably entertained was that time might be obtained
to finish and close the said letters.  At last the package of farewells, last words, and before-forgotten
directions, being ready, I tumbled with it into the boat, and shoved off to return to the cutter.

I calculated that she bore about north-north-west from the ship; and not having a compass,
the last thing I did was to take a careful glance at the one on board.  I then pulled away,
thinking that I should not lose sight of the merchantman before we got hold of our own craft.
In about ten minutes I found that I was not a little mistaken.  I had told Stretcher, who was
pulling stroke-oar, to keep his eye on the ship, while I, meantime, was looking out for the
cutter.  Every moment I expected to see her; but, as we advanced, the fog appeared to rise
up with redoubled thickness around us; and my difficulty was still further increased when Jack
Stretcher exclaimed--

"I can't see the ship nowhere, sir!  She was there not a moment ago, and just as I passed my
hand over my brow, she was gone."

"Well, we must pull on," I exclaimed.  "If we keep the breeze on the starboard quarter, we
cannot be far wrong."

However, not many minutes afterwards, the wind, true to its proverbial character of fickleness,
died away, and we were left without any guide by which to steer our course across the trackless
deep.  Still we pulled on, I fancied, in the direction of the coast.  We should have been wise
had we laid on our oars, and gone to sleep.  As I could not see ahead, I steered by the wake
astern, and was under the impression that I was keeping a wonderfully straight line.  How long
we had gone on I can scarcely tell, when we heard the sound of a gun booming along the water;
but, instead of coming from the direction in which we were steering, it seemed to be astern
of us.  Still we thought it must be the cutter firing.  The men even declared that they knew
the sound of the gun.  The probability was, certainly, that it was her gun, as she would be
sure to fire to show her whereabouts to us; and it was not likely that any other vessel near
us would be firing for a similar purpose.  Although I was very confident, from the straight
wake I fancied I had kept, that Jack was mistaken, and that the sound of the gun had come from
some other vessel, yet I yielded to his opinion, and pulled in the direction whence we thought
it proceeded.  We had not made good a quarter of a mile when we again heard the sound; but
still, to our surprise and vexation, it was indubitably right astern.

"That gun's from the cutter, sir," said Jack; "but I can't make it out how it comes from away
there."

No more could I; but determined this time, at all events, not to miss our vessel, we pulled
away directly towards the spot whence we were certain the sound proceeded.

"Give way, my lads, we shall soon be up with her," I shouted; and the crew sent the boat flying
through the smooth water.  I kept looking out on either bow for the cutter, expecting every
instant to see her looming through the fog; when, for the third time, a gun was heard, but
in spite of all our hopes and expectations, and almost against our belief, it also sounded
right astern, and further away than any of the others.  I was ready to cry with vexation. 
It seemed like the work of magic, and as if a set of mischievous imps or spirits, like those
on Prospero's island, were employed in trying our tempers and patience.  There seemed no use
in going on thus, to be constantly baulked; so I ordered the men to lay on their oars, resolved
to wait either till the mist cleared off, or till we could devise some better means of finding
our way to the shore than we now possessed.  Thus for an hour or more we floated listlessly
on the water.

CHAPTER SEVEN.

FALL IN WITH A WRECK--DREADFUL SCENE ON BOARD--MR. MARLOW AND HIS DAUGHTER--ALICE MARLOW'S
ACCOUNT OF THE VOYAGE--BRING THE SHIP INTO HARBOUR.

"Hillo! where does that come from?"  I exclaimed, as the low deep boom of a gun came rolling
over the calm water.

Another and another report followed, and then, as if affected by the concussion, the mist on
a sudden lifted a few feet from the surface, and revealed, about three miles off, the hull
of a large ship on which the rays of the now setting sun glittered brightly for an instant,
ere she sank beneath the wave.  It was sufficient to show us our position, and we might easily
have found our way towards the shore; but, as I was about putting the boat's head in that direction,
Jack observed--

"There's something wrong with that ship yonder, sir, or she wouldn't be firing in the way she
does."

I listened attentively.  There could be no doubt--those were minute-guns, the well-known signal
of distress at sea.  We could do but little good, probably; but what good we could do I determined
to attempt.  My men needed no encouragement.  The fact that fellow-creatures wanted help was
sufficient to nerve their arms.  Had an enemy been in sight, and had there been heads to be
cracked, it would have been much the same.  Round spun the boat, and away they pulled as hard
as they could lay their backs to the oars.  The breeze which had cleared off the mist, had
likewise got up the sea a little, and the spray flew over our bows as we dashed through the
dancing waves.  Away we went; the big sea-serpent could not have beaten us.  Every minute the
low, dull sound of the gun reached our ears, growing louder and louder as we drew nearer the
ship.  Her distress was evidently great.  From the somewhat irregular way the gun was fired,
and from its tone, Jack pronounced the ship to be a merchantman, as he remarked that minute-guns
from a man-of-war would have been far louder and more regular.  The mist, fortunately, did
not again settle down thickly over the ship, so that, although twilight was coming on, we could
still distinguish her whereabouts.  As we drew near, we saw that she was of considerable size,
and that all her masts had gone by the board.  We were evidently not perceived, even though
we had got close up to her, for she continued firing as before.

"Now, my lads, we'll let the poor fellows know that we are at hand to help them," I exclaimed;
and on this my men joined me in raising a right hearty cheer, which must have given the people
on board no unpleasing notice of our approach.  There was a pause, as if they were recovering
from their surprise; and then it was answered by a shout so feeble, that it sounded more like
the sighing of the wind among the crumbling walls of some old building, than a cheer of welcome.
It was now too dark to distinguish any one, but I fancied that I saw the heads of several people
over the taffrail, as if eagerly watching us.  We were soon alongside, when some one attempted
to heave us a rope, but it fell short of the boat.  We, however, hooked on to the main-chains,
and, followed by Jack, I was not long in scrambling on board.  A seaman stood there, holding
a ship's lantern, which shed a feeble light around, where all was wreck and confusion; and
it besides exhibited more strongly his own countenance, which looked haggard and emaciated
in the extreme.  The greater part of the bulwarks, the spare spars, the caboose, and the boats
had been carried away,--indeed, the sea must have made a clean sweep over her; and it seemed
not a little surprising, from the appearance of the deck, that any human beings should have
remained, and that the ship herself should have escaped foundering.  Besides the man who held
the lantern, three equally wretched-looking beings came to meet us.  I observed that some others
were lying on the deck, round one of the chain-pumps, as if they had sunk down with fatigue;
while two more were stretched out alongside the only remaining gun, the report of which we
had heard.  I thought to myself, Can those poor fellows be dead? but I dared not ask the question.

"You seem in a bad plight," I observed, as I looked round.

"Bad enough," answered one of the seaman; "and if you don't bear a hand, we shall have the
ship sinking under us."

"We'll do our best for you; but how can our boat carry all your ship's company?"  I asked,
for I thought I saw other people moving aft, and fancied that some must be below.

"Oh, she'll carry all of us that's alive," returned the same rough-spoken seaman.  "But, sir,"
he continued, "we have two aboard here whom we must get out of harm's way before we look after
ourselves."

"Where are they?"  I asked.

"Right aft, sir," he answered, leading the way along the deck.

As I followed him, I passed two bodies stretched out at full length.

"They'll never break biscuit again," observed one of the men.  "We were near thirty souls in
all, and this night there only remain six of us alive."

There was no time just then to ask questions.  The companion-hatch had not been washed away,
and as the seaman held up the lantern, its light fell on the figure of a man kneeling on the
deck, bending over the fair face of a young girl, who reclined on a seat by the side of it.

"Rouse up a bit, sir; there's help come when we didn't expect it," said the seaman.

The gentleman, for such I saw that he was, had not his voice proved it, rose from his knees.
"Heaven be praised, my child may yet be saved!" he exclaimed, clasping his daughter in his
arms, and scarcely appearing to notice my presence.  "Alice, dearest, bear up but a little
longer; we may once more hope to reach the shore."

The young girl endeavoured, to raise herself, and feebly returned his embrace.

Then turning to me, he said, "You have arrived most opportunely.  We had well nigh abandoned
all hope of escaping death.  What do you propose we should do?"

"As the people on board seem to say that the ship may go down any moment with slight warning,"
I replied, "I think, sir, the sooner you and the young lady get into the boat, the better.
We will follow you when it becomes absolutely necessary.  Meantime we must see what can be
done on board."

I then told him that I belonged to a cutter, which could not be far off, and that I hoped by
daylight we should see her, and that she would come to our assistance.

The gentleman, on this, took his daughter in his arms and carried her to the gangway.

"How are the poor men who were so ill?"  I heard her ask.

"They are free from all pain," was the evasive answer; but it seemed to satisfy her.

We soon got them safely placed in the boat, in which I left two boat-keepers, with orders to
be ready to shove off at a moment's notice. The rest of the boat's crew came on board to lend
a hand to what might be required.

I then set to work to see what was best to be done.  There was no time to ask questions as
to how the ship had got into her present condition. My first care was to attend to the wants
of the sick.  The seaman who had received us and my own people went round with me.  Unhappily,
we found that most of the other poor fellows were beyond human aid.  Three only were still
alive, verging on the portals of death.  We fortunately had a flask of spirits, a keg of water,
and some biscuits in the boat; of these I served out sparingly among the crew.  The food had
the effect of speedily reviving them.  I next took a lantern, and, accompanied by Jack, went
below to discover, if I could, how much water the ship had in her.  I was not quite comfortable
during the time, for I thought she might take it into her head to go down before we could regain
the deck. The water we found was over the cabin floors; but, as far as we could judge, it was
not gaining on her.  Half of it might have got in while the sea broke over the ship.  The contents
of the cabin, bedding, and tables, and chairs, and crockery, and books, and clothing, were
washing about together.  Returning on deck, we went forward.  The forepeak was much in the
same condition.

"She'll not sink yet awhile, sir," said Jack.  "Hark, now! don't you hear a bubbling sound
right forward, there?  Now, to my mind, if we were to get a sail thrummed and brought across
her bows, we might carry her into harbour yet."

"If you think so, we'll try it, by all means," I answered, feeling no little pride at the prospect
of saving the ship.

No time was to be lost in setting about the work, if it was to be done. I had only three men;
and the four we found able to move about on board were still too weak to be of much use.  Officers
there were none.  I shall have to tell a sad tale on that subject, by-and-by.  We had no little
difficulty in getting at the sail-room; but, after much rummaging about, we discovered a spare
topsail, with which we set to work as we proposed.  What with searching for the ropes and getting
the sail ready, it took us an hour before it was brought under the ship's bows. Meantime the
water gained very slowly on us.  It was nervous work, for we could not tell at what moment
the last bucketful might come in which would send her to the bottom.

"That will do, sir, I think," said Jack Stretcher, who, I must own, was the prime mover.  "The
leak seems to suck in the sail, and we may now try to clear her of the water."

With a will we manned the chain-pumps, and after an hour's hard work it became evident that
we had materially lessened its depth.  In the meantime the little girl and her father, with
the weakest of those we found on board, had remained in the boat.

"You may come on board again, sir; I don't think the ship is going to sink this time," I sung
out, as I looked down on them.

At first the gentleman would not venture to quit the boat, for he could not believe that the
ship was not on the point of sinking.  After some persuasion, however, I got him and his daughter
on deck, and we wrapped her up comfortably, and placed her on the seat by the companion-hatch,
for the cabin was too damp for her to occupy.  The sick men we placed on the poop, with a sail
stretched over them, to shelter them somewhat from the night air.  The dead were carried forward.
We had no time, however, to spare from the pumps; but, with the aid of the fresh hands, we
again set to for a spell, the gentleman helping, as far as his strength would allow him.  As
may be supposed, I was curious to know who he was; and while we were pumping away, I bethought
me I would ask him his name.

"You may call me Marlow," he answered.  "I ought to have mentioned that before."

The reply made me fancy that there was some mystery or other, and my imagination conjured up
all sorts of romantic stories.  "And that young lady," thought I, "is Miss Alice Marlow." 
"Alice Marlow--Alice Marlow; what a very pretty name," I kept repeating to myself, while my
arms were aching with the exertion of pumping.  Fortunately it remained very calm, or I suspect
we should not have gained on the leak.  Mr Marlow was anxious to get on shore for the sake
of his daughter, and would willingly have abandoned the ship; but at the same time he was glad
to save some valuable property he had on board.  All hands worked with a will, spelling each
other, till we were almost knocked up.  I thought the night the longest I had ever spent. 
We had no time for conversation, so I was still ignorant of how the ship had been brought into
her present condition.  At last the cold grey light of the coming day appeared.  I looked out
in the hope of discovering the blue line of the land on the northern board; but the dull, leaden
sea surrounded us on every side, fortunately, unruffled as a looking-glass.  Neither the cutter
nor any other sail was in sight.  We had given our own provisions to the half-famished crew,
and were becoming very sharp-set ourselves. Some nutritious food had, I found--much to the
credit of those on board,--been reserved for the exclusive use of the little girl, and this
had been the means of preserving her life, notwithstanding all the hardships she had undergone.
Mr Marlow, overcome with fatigue, had wrapped himself in a cloak, and lay asleep at his daughter's
feet.  Two of the ship's crew had fairly given in, and dropped off also; but my own fellows,
urged on by Jack, worked away like Trojans at the pump.

"Do ye see, lads, if we get this here craft into harbour, we shall make a better job of it
than of any prize we are ever likely to pick up in the whole course of our lives; but if she
sinks, why, do ye see, we shall get nothing," he remarked, whenever he saw them inclined to
flag in their exertions; and each time he spoke, the water always seemed to flow faster than
before out of the scuppers.

Our prospect was not a very pleasant one.  We had a boat certainly; but with any sea running
she would scarcely carry the remnant of the crew and passengers; and while the ship floated
I would on no account desert her.

The beams of the sun, as he rose out of the ocean, fell on the little girl's face.  I had fancied
her rather pretty at night, but I now thought her very lovely.  While my arms were resting
I stood watching her, when the dazzling light of the sun aroused her from her sleep, and opening
a very bright pair of blue eyes, she fixed them on me with a look of extreme surprise.  It
may be laid down as a general rule that a midshipman, especially an Irish one, does not take
a long time to fall in love, nor, it must be confessed, to fall out again--which latter, taking
all things into consideration, will be considered a very fortunate circumstance.  I, accordingly,
instantly conceived a very ardent affection for Miss Alice Marlow, and felt ready to go right
round the world, and to perform all sorts of prodigies for her sake.  She looked at me, and
then around her, as if trying to collect her scattered senses.

"Where are we--where are we going?" she asked, in a very sweet and musical voice.

"We are in the Chops of the Channel; and we are going nowhere at present, but we hope soon
to be," I answered.  "We must try to rig a sort of a jury-mast, and if we get a little breeze
from the southward, we may hope to fetch Plymouth."

The idea of getting up a jury-mast had only just occurred to me.

Her voice aroused Mr Marlow.  It was pleasant to see the way in which the father and daughter
greeted each other.  I left them together, offering up their thanks to Heaven for having preserved
them to see another day, while I went forward to propound my idea to Jack.  He was about to
propose the same to me, the only want being the spars with which to make the mast.  A few remained,
certainly, on deck, but they were short and broken.  On putting them, however, together, we
found that we might splice them so as to form a mast and a yard of sufficient length to answer
our purpose.  All hands set to with a will, in the hopes that a breeze might spring up from
the southward or westward, and blow us on to the English coast.  The ebb, I found, had drifted
us down Channel, and the flood, now again making strong, sent us the way we wished to go. 
As the sun also rose, and the mist which had so long hung over the sea cleared off somewhat,
we at length made out the land to the northward, which we had no doubt was the coast of Cornwall.

Things now began to wear a much more cheering aspect.  We had to knock off mast building, however,
every now and then, to take a spell at the pumps.  Mr Marlow assisted us at either work to
the best of his power; and even little Miss Alice seemed very anxious to lend a hand, and,
though I own she could have been but of slight use, her presence encouraged us to perseverance.
It did me at all events.  I have all my life felt doubly energetic in the presence of a lady,
and fancy, at all events, that there is not a deed which I would not dare for the sake of winning
the smile of an amiable girl.

At last we got something like a mast built, and lashed to the stump of the foremast.  We stayed
it up, got a yard across it, and bent a topsail to it, which we fortunately found below.  This
was but very little sail: but it was all we could hope to be able to set, and without a wind
even that was of no use to us.

The pumps, in the meantime, kept us fully occupied; clang--clang--clang they went, till I thought
I never should get the sound out of my ears. Jack every now and then turned his eye over the
smooth, glassy sea to the northward, as if he observed some sign which I did not.  Before long
he gladdened our ears by exclaiming, "Here it comes!  We'll stand by, sir, if you please, to
hoist the sail."  I went aft to the helm.  A nice fresh, laughing breeze came rippling and
curling up briskly the hitherto sullen waters.  It struck us abeam on the larboard side.  The
sail was hoisted, the ship answered her helm, and I steered her in the direction in which I
believed that Plymouth was to be found.

As the binnacle had been swept off the deck, and the only compass I could find in the cabin
had been so damaged by water as to be of no use, I had only the distant blue land to steer by.

Our sail, fortunately, required but little attention, so that my whole ship's company were
at liberty to work at the pumps, which was very necessary, as, whenever they relaxed in their
efforts, the water again rapidly gained on us.

Miss Alice, being of no assistance to them, came and stood by me to help me to steer the ship,
which, I assured her, was very kind of her.

As all danger appeared past, and the sun shone forth bright and warm, her spirits revived.
Her voice was very sweet and low, and I thought that I had never heard anything more musical.

"What is your name, little officer?" she asked, putting her hands on the spokes of the wheel,
and imitating my attitude as I stood on the other side of it.

"Neil D'Arcy, little lady," I answered, not quite liking the epithet she bestowed on me.

"Oh, I so much wished to know it; for papa and I are so very, very grateful to you for coming
to save our lives, and we can never thank you enough," said she.

"Oh, I have done nothing at all to be thanked for; I wish that I had," I replied.  "I wouldn't
mind any trouble or danger to serve you; and I would go right round the world for your sake,
that I would."

"It's very kind of you to say so," said Miss Alice.  "And I know that I shall like you some
day very much--indeed I do so now--for the service you have been to us; but tell me, Mr Neil
D'Arcy, are you a captain of a ship?"

"No, I am a midshipman," I replied, modestly.

"Is a midshipman higher than a captain?" she inquired, innocently.

"Sometimes; when he's mast-headed," I answered.  This seemed to satisfy her; and I, not wishing
to be lowered in her estimation, was anxious to change the subject.  I therefore said, "It
seems very odd that though I've been on board so many hours, and seem to be so well acquainted
with you, I do not know where you have come from, or how you got into this terrible plight."

"Oh, I will tell you all about it, then," she replied.  "You must know that papa has been a
great merchant in the Brazils, where we have lived almost since I can remember.  Dear mamma
died there; and if it had not been for my sake, I believe papa would have died too.  You cannot
tell how fond he is of me, for I have no brothers or sisters, and there was no one else in
that country for him to love.  At last the doctor told him he must come to England, so he took
a passage in this ship, which is called the Poictiers.  There were some other passengers, and
I had an old black nurse to take care of me.  At first we had fine weather, and things seemed
to go pretty well; but, sad to say, the captain was a very tipsy man, and we, I believe, lost
our way, and the wind blew against us and kept us back a long time."

"Oh, I see! the master got out of his reckoning, and met with a succession of foul winds,"
I remarked.

"I don't know, but I know we were very uncomfortable, and had very little to eat, and what
we had was very bad," she continued.  "It was very horrid, was it not?  A fever also, which
one of the passengers had brought from Rio, spread among the people on board.  Several of the
other passengers and many of the crew died of it, and among others, my poor nurse Josefa. 
God was very kind, and saved dear papa and me.  I do not think the captain caught it; but he
was always very tipsy, and now was worse than ever.  One night he fell into the sea and was
drowned."

"Drinking brought on delirium tremens, and in his madness he jumped overboard probably," I
remarked.  "No wonder his ship was in so bad a condition; but go on."

"Both the mates died, and we were left without any officers. Fortunately the crew were very
steady, and behaved well; and at last the fever went away, and those who were sick recovered.
The carpenter was the only person on board who had any idea how we should steer, so the rest
made him act as captain."

"It was a mercy, under such circumstances, that you found your way into the Chops of the Channel."

"Where is that?" asked Miss Alice, naively.

"Where we now are," said I; and I should probably have gone on to explain the reason of the
name, but that I was very anxious to hear more of her account.  As far as I could make out,
three very anxious weeks passed by while the ship remained in this condition, when, as they
were getting near soundings, a gale sprang up and drove her furiously before it.  "One evening,"
continued the little girl, "papa and I were in our cabins, when suddenly the ship rolled over
dreadfully on her side, and-- most horrible!--the water came rushing down into them.  At the
same time there was a frightful crash, and we heard sad shrieks and cries.  Poor papa flew
into my cabin, and seized me in his arms, for he thought the ship was sinking, so did I, and
we wished to die together."

"The ship had broached to, and had been thrown on her beam-ends, and the masts had gone by
the board," I remarked.  "It was fortunate they did so, or she would have been sent to the
bottom to a certainty.  When the masts went the ship righted, and you saw there was a chance
of escape."

"I was too frightened to think anything just then," said she.  "All I know is, that papa, carrying
me in his arms, found his way in the darkness to the companion-ladder, and then up on deck.
When we got there, I wished that we were in our cabin again.  We were in the midst of high,
black, foaming waves and bright flashes of lightning; and when I looked up, there were no masts
and no sails, but the deck was covered with their broken remains.  It was so very dreadful,
I cannot talk more about it now.  I did not cry or faint, but I felt my heart beat very quick
as I clung to papa, while he held tight to the companion-hatches, which, as you see, still
remain firm."

"But where have you lived all the time you have been on the wreck?"  I asked.

"Oh, I remained where you first found me," she answered.  "At night they covered me up with
cloaks and a sail, and in the daytime I was able to walk about, for the sea, fortunately, was
tolerably smooth.  The kind sailors also, though suffering much from hunger, I heard papa say,
brought me all I required to eat, which was not much, you may suppose."

This was all about the shipwreck I heard from Miss Alice at the time. It appeared that when
the masts had been carried away, the mizen-mast had hung on by some of the rigging, and by
dragging astern had assisted in making the head of the ship pay off.  This caused her to drive
before the gale, and saved the decks from being swept by the seas, which would otherwise have
cleared them of every human being.  As soon as all the damage had been committed, the wind
and sea began to go down, and by the morning there was only a moderate breeze.  The carpenter,
however, discovered that the ship had sprung a leak, and all hands were now summoned to work
the pumps; but weakened by disease and famine, and overcome with fatigue, they were soon obliged
to give up the almost hopeless task.  Three days of horror passed away without any ship coming
near them, while several of them died from sheer starvation. Fortunately, at last they discovered
some gunpowder which, being in tin cases, was not spoilt, and with it they managed to fire
the guns which had attracted our attention.

Miss Alice told me many more incidents, which I now forget.  Our conversation was interrupted
by Jack Stretcher, who came aft.

"Sir," said he, touching his hat, "I'm afraid we shall have to take to the boat, for the people
are almost all knocked up; and, do all we can, the ship won't float much longer."

"I'm sorry to hear that, for I should have liked to have got her safe into harbour," I answered.
"But I suppose there is no help for it."

"We'll take another spell at the pumps before we give in," he replied. "But I wanted to tell
you, sir, that to my mind that poor gentleman will be killing himself if he works away as he
does; and as he is of no great use to us, it would be better if he sat down and rested himself."

On hearing this, Miss Marlow darted forward to her father, and seizing him by the arm, tried
to force him away from the pumps.  He soon yielded to her entreaties, and almost fainting with
fatigue, came and sat down aft.

"Now, my lads," cried Jack to the men, who, one after the other, had thrown themselves down
on the deck, "we'll see if we can't keep the old craft afloat till we get her into harbour."

But no one responded to his summons.  Just then my eye fell on the white sail of a vessel appearing
above the dark horizon right ahead of us.  I pointed it out to Jack.

"It's the cutter, sir, to a certainty," he exclaimed, after scrutinising it attentively.  "Huzza!
my lads, there's help at hand, if you will but hold out an hour longer."

The men, encouraged by his words and example, resumed their labours, and again sent the water
gushing through the scuppers.  It was an anxious time; for after all I felt that the sail in
sight might not prove to be the cutter, or she might be crossing our course and not see us.
Our last remnant of food and water had been served out, with the exception of a biscuit, which
I had kept for the little girl and her father; so that all hands were very hungry as well as
fatigued.  I had tightened my belt round my waist to serve me for my breakfast.  I watched
the vessel as she rose higher and higher above the horizon; and, to my great joy, I at length
saw that she was, at all events, a large cutter, beating up towards us.  I called Jack to look
at her again.

"She's the Serpent, and no mistake," he exclaimed.  "She'll be down to us in another hour,
if the wind holds.  My doubt is if the ship will swim as long," he added in a whisper to me;
"but we'll do our best, sir."

"Let me know in time if the water gains much on us, that we may get the young lady and the
gentleman into the boat," said I.

"Ay, ay, sir," he answered, as he went forward, and with a loud cheer, resumed his labours.

The minutes dragged slowly on; for, though I had no fear for our lives, I was anxious to get
fresh hands to keep the ship afloat.

"Is that little vessel yours?" asked Miss Marlow, pointing to the cutter as she approached.

"Yes," said I.  "I hope before long to take you on board her."

"That will be very nice; for dear papa and I want to leave this dreadful ship.  You will carry
us home to Old England, will you!" she said.

"If the cutter makes us out, I hope to get you on shore this evening or to-morrow," I replied.
"But I am not quite certain that she sees us."

She had just then tacked, and was apparently standing away from us.  I watched her eagerly.
Again she tacked, and I was certain she saw us.  I steered towards her, and now, the breeze
freshening, we rapidly neared each other.  She stood on, and passing under our stern, kept
alongside of us.

"Hillo, D'Arcy, my boy, how did you get there?" hailed my uncle, as he recognised me at the helm.

"Fell in with her, sir.  Pray send some fresh hands, for we are sinking; and some prog, for
we are starving," I shouted, in return.

The cutter flew by us, and hove-to a short distance ahead.  A boat was lowered, and as we came
up, she hooked on to our main-chains, and my uncle stepped on board.  I was thus speedily shorn
of the honour of command.  As soon as I had introduced Mr Marlow and his daughter to him, and
given him a brief account of what had occurred, he invited them on board the cutter, ordering
me to take charge of them, and to send Hanks with another boat's crew to assist in working
the ship.  He had brought some provisions, which very soon restored my hungry people, and enabled
them to pull me and my charges on board the cutter, while the fresh hands took their places
at the pumps.  Even when Miss Alice discovered my unexalted position, she did not seem to esteem
me the less, for I had already, I rather fancy, established myself in her good graces.  I did
my best to make her and her father comfortable in my uncle's cabin; and Flitch, his steward,
soon placed before them such a breakfast as they had not seen for many a long day, to which
I, at all events, did not fail to do ample justice.  The young lady appeared to think that
naval officers were very hungry mortals, as she saw numberless slices of bacon and eggs disappear
down my throat.

"We have no lady's maid on board to attend on you, Miss Marlow," said I, as I got up to leave
the cabin; "but Flitch will put your berth to rights; and if you'll follow my advice, you'll
turn in and take a good snooze, for you want it, I think."

The poor little girl was almost falling asleep at table.  Mr Marlow thanked me for my good
advice, which he said he and his daughter would follow.

When I went on deck I found that the cutter had taken the ship in tow, and that we were running
up Channel.  My uncle soon came on board, and praising me for my behaviour, said he should
try and carry our prize into Portsmouth.  He was in high spirits, for he expected to get a
good round sum for salvage.  The breeze held favourable, and in two days we were steering safely
through the Needles passage.

CHAPTER EIGHT.

ALICE AT DAISY COTTAGE--A BOAT'S CREW CAPSIZED--PICK UP DICKY SHARPE-- OUR FRIENDSHIP COMMENCED.

I may as well say that my uncle got a fair round sum for the salvage of the good ship the Poictiers,
and a very welcome addition to his year's pay.  Our passengers went on shore at Portsmouth,
and as soon as we arrived there, I thought I was to see no more of them, when, having accompanied
them to the door of the George Hotel, I was about to bid them farewell.

"What! we are not going to part yet," said Mr Marlow.  "Come in, young gentleman--come in."

There was the usual bustle consequent on the arrival of a party at an inn.  It soon subsided.
Rooms were selected, and we found ourselves seated in a parlour, which looked doubly comfortable
after the deck of the dismasted ship and the small cabin of the cutter.

"You will come and dine with us to-day, Mr D'Arcy; and I must beg you to convey an invitation
to your uncle," said Mr Marlow.

As midshipmen are not always their own masters, I had to explain that I would, if I could;
though I did not think my uncle would refuse me leave.  I was not disappointed; and at six
o'clock I found myself seated at Mr Marlow's dinner-table, and opposite my Commander.  I thought
the little lady, Miss Alice, still looked very much fatigued.

"She is scarcely yet fit to perform the journey to London," observed her father.  "Still I
am anxious to be there, and must also visit Liverpool in the course of a few days."

"If you will allow her to remain with Mrs O'Flaherty, I can answer for my wife being most happy
to receive her," said my uncle.

To my great joy, though I was afraid of showing if, Mr Marlow at once acceded to the proposal.

"I will, then, bring Mrs O'Flaherty over to fetch her," added my uncle. "You will, I suspect,
agree very well, Miss Alice."

"Indeed, my dear sir, you are laying me under a tenfold obligation," said Mr Marlow.  "All
our connections are, I believe, in the North, and in dreary London there is no one with whom
I could leave the dear child."

I don't remember the rest of our conversation.  I know that I discussed a very good dinner;
and that same evening we got under weigh and ran over to Ryde, and my uncle went up to Daisy
Cottage.  The next morning my aunt accompanied him on board, and we returned to Portsmouth.
She received little Alice, as I knew she would, most kindly, and before many hours had passed
they became great friends; and, to make a long story short, Miss Marlow became an inmate for
several weeks of Daisy Cottage.

We were lying one day soon after this in Portsmouth Harbour, off Haslar Creek, ready to start
for the westward.  It was Sunday.  My uncle had gone over to Ryde, and I was in hopes of getting
across in the afternoon to visit my aunt and her guest.  I had turned out in full fig; and
while all the people were below dressing for muster, I walked the deck as officer of the watch,
with my spy-glass under my arm, looking out for the signal from the flag-ship to make it eight-bells.
I felt very important, but I have reasons to doubt whether I looked proportionably consequential.
All the ships in the harbour and at Spithead ran up their bunting at the same moment; and I
had just belayed our signal halliards when I saw a boat, crowded with seamen and marines, putting
off from a frigate lying right ahead of us.  The tide was running strong out of the harbour.
A young midshipman was at the helm, and he did not seem to have made due allowance for the
strength of the current.  The consequence was that the boat drifted down some way below the
intended place of landing, and while he was putting her head up the harbour to regain his lost
ground, her keel struck the mast of a barge which had sunk the day before, and which scarcely
showed above the water.  In an instant over she went, and the people in her were spilt out
into the eddying, rushing tide-way.  Some struck out for the shore, a few clung on the boat,
and others came drifting down helplessly with the current.

So suddenly had the accident occurred, that I had not a moment to consider what was best to
be done, nor to call any one from below. Fortunately we had a punt alongside.  Casting off
the painter, I jumped into her, and shoved off to where three men were struggling, close ahead
of the cutter.  I caught hold of one who was just sinking, and hauled him over the bows, while
the other two got in without my help.  I looked round to see what had become of the rest of
the people.  Two marines were clinging to the keel of the boat, and she was on the point of
striking our stern, by which she would have been carried under our bottom, when I sculled alongside
and got the two jollies on board.  By the glance I had had at her just before, I observed that
another person had been with them, while, as I was getting in the three first men, a cry for
help had reached my ears.

"Oh! sir, there's Mr --- gone, poor fellow!" exclaimed one of the marines saved.  "There he
is, though!"

Directly under the water, where he pointed, I saw a head of hair or a bunch of seaweed, I could
not tell which; but, on the chance of its being the former, I sculled up to it.  The sun shone
forth brightly, and I caught a glimpse of a human face convulsed with agony beneath the tide.
Twice it eluded me; but stretching out my arm, and almost going overboard and capsizing our
already over-crowded boat, I got firm hold of a person by the hair, who, I saw, had a midshipman's
patch on the collar of his jacket.  I had some difficulty in getting the seemingly lifeless
body of my brother officer into the boat.

Seeing that there was no one else to be saved--for several boats had shoved off from the shore
and vessels at anchor near at hand to pick up the rest of the people--I paddled my nearly sinking
boat alongside the cutter.  Hearing my hail as I jumped into the punt, the crew had rushed
on deck, and were standing ready to hand on board the half-drowned midshipman and the men I
had been the means of saving.  The latter were none the worse for their ducking, except that
their clothes were wettish.

"You'll want a clean shirt, mate," said one of our people to a Patlander from the frigate.

"Arrah! now didn't I put a dry one in my pocket this blessed morning; so it will be all handy
for me," he exclaimed, diving into the recesses of his dripping peacoat.

The midshipman, who was still insensible, was, by Hanks' advice, carried down into the gun-room.
We were unwilling to run the risk of the delay which must have occurred had he been conveyed
on board his own ship.

"Bring a glass of hot grog; and let it be pretty stiff, steward!" said Hanks, as we were engaged
in stripping our patient and putting him into my berth between the blankets.

We then set to work to rub his body with a coarse worsted sock, the first suitable thing which
came to hand.  Having got some of the salt water he had swallowed out of his mouth, Hanks poured
a little warm grog into it instead.  This, with the rubbing, had the effect of speedily restoring
animation.  In a few minutes he opened his eyes, and tried to sit up and look about him.

"Hillo! where am I?  I say, are the poor fellows all picked up?" he asked, in a weak tone.

I liked him at once for thinking of his men.

"All right, mate," I answered; "no harm has come of the capsize, except a few wet jackets."

Just then, on looking round, I saw a man, who by his uniform I knew to be a naval surgeon,
standing near me.  "So I see you've saved me my work, gentlemen," he said, smiling.  "You could
not have acted better than you appear to have done; and, thanks to you, we shall soon have
him all right again."

"Thank'ee, Doctor, I've come round pretty well already," sung out the midshipman.  "But, I
say, mate, I just want another glass of your stuff. It's prime physic."

The medico smelt the tumbler, which stood on the table full of grog, and then felt the youngster's
pulse and looked at his tongue.

"You may take half a glass--it's quite enough for you, and then we'll have you wrapped up in
blankets, and carried on board," he answered.

"Oh, thank'ee, Doctor, I'm very comfortable where I am, and my clothes ain't dried yet; so
if you'll let me stay here, I think it would be the better for me," said the midshipman.

The Doctor's objections, if he had any, were soon overruled; and, telling the midshipman to
return on board the frigate as soon as his clothes were dry, he quitted the cutter.

"What's your name, mate?" asked my new friend, as he was sipping his glass of grog.

I told him.

"Mine's Richard Sharpe; but I'm mostly called Dicky Sharpe," he answered.  "Some of my messmates
give me all sorts of names; but I don't mind them.  As long as they don't cob me, it's all
very well.  I'm a happy fellow, and ready for all the ups and downs of life.  I'm pretty well
wide awake, and know my duty, so I don't often get mast-headed.  If I happen to get a fall,
I generally manage to pitch on my feet; and as I'm some day or other to come into a fortune,
I'm not troubled about the future.  If the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty give me my
promotion, it will be all very well; if not, why they'll have to dispense with my valuable
services, and the country will be the loser."

I was highly edified by Master Dicky's philosophy, and I at once conceived a great regard and
respect for him.

"Now, D'Arcy, my boy," he continued, in his free and easy tone, "it's stupid work lying here
between the blankets; so if you'll just give me the loan of some of your toggery till mine
are dry, I'll sit up at table and crack a bottle of wine with you."

I had to remind him of the early hour, and to confess that wine our mess did not possess, but
that he should have some breakfast and hot tea, which would be better for him, and that he
should be welcome to my clothes.

While he was seated at table, Hanks, who had gone on deck to see the medico off, returned.
"Well, D'Arcy, I told him how you had saved the youngster and the other men," he said.  "It
will be a feather in your cap, my lad, and you deserve to wear it."

"What!" exclaimed my volatile young friend, grasping my hand, while the tears came into his
eyes, "you saved me from drowning.  On my word, I'm very much obliged to you.  I shouldn't
like to have become food for fishes just yet.  I'd rather eat a few dinners off them first."

"Oh, faith, I could not have done less if you'd been only a sheep or a pig," I answered, laughing;
"so you've little to thank me for."

"I suppose, though, even a sheep or a pig would have tried to show their gratitude, unless
you had intended to turn them into mutton and pork directly afterwards," replied Dicky Sharpe.
"So, D'Arcy, I must look upon you as my friend and preserver; and I just wish, when you can
get leave, that you would come down and see my governor and mother and sisters.  They won't
make much of you, won't they, that's all."

I told him that I should be very glad to accept his invitation if I could; but at the time
I was thinking that my aunt and Miss Alice would admire the feather Hanks said I might wear
in my cap more than anybody else.  I never met a merrier or more contented fellow than Dicky
Sharpe. I was quite sorry to lose him when his clothes were dry and a boat came alongside to
take him on board his ship, the Cynthia, What was my surprise to receive by her, at the same
time, a note from the captain of the frigate, inviting me to dine with him on the following
day, stating that he wished to thank me for the presence of mind I had displayed in saving
the lives of one of his midshipmen and several of his people.

"I'm glad to hear it," exclaimed Hanks.  "It shows your talents are not hid under a bushel;
and now get away over to Ryde with that note in your pocket, and explain its meaning in the
best way you can."

I jumped into a wherry just then passing, and in less than an hour landed at Ryde Pier, whence
I found my way up to Daisy Cottage.  My aunt was delighted to hear my story, which, I flatter
myself, I told with all the innate modesty of an Irishman.  Alice, I thought, blushed her approval
most sweetly; and my uncle congratulated me warmly.  I spent a very pleasant evening, some
of the time walking with Alice on the shore, and resting under the trees, which come almost
close down to the water's edge.  I found that I could not dine with Captain Bruff, as we were
to sail next morning for the westward; so I was obliged to be content with the empty honour
of the invitation; and, I dare say, my absence did not break his heart.  I was more sorry to
miss seeing Dicky Sharpe again, as I should have liked to have had another palaver with him;
and before our return the Cynthia would probably have sailed.

CHAPTER NINE.

A CHASE--A PRIZE--CAPTURE A FRENCH SMUGGLER--OUR PRISONER'S POLITENESS-- DO NOT TRUST A GREEK,
EVEN WHEN POLITE.

At the hour I was asked to dine with Captain Bruff we were running out at the Needles, with
a fresh breeze and a thick, drizzling rain, which called pea-coats and sou'westers into requisition.
We cruised about for three or four days without seeing anything suspicious; not a tub afloat,
nor a craft with a smuggling look about her.  At last we found something to give us employment.
One evening a mist settled down over the water, which, though there was a good breeze, was
perfectly calm.  Although the night was in no ways dark, yet the density of the fog prevented
our seeing beyond the bowsprit end, or even so far.  It was just such a night as a smuggler
delights in.  The cutter was on her old ground, off Portland Bill.  We were slipping through
the water at the rate of some five or six knots an hour, when Stretcher, who was standing close
to me, exclaimed, "Ah! see there, sir; there's a craft of some sort right away to leeward,
trying to steal off from us."  I looked, and could just distinguish the shadowy form of a sail
through the mist.  The Commander was called, and the cutter was instantly kept away in chase.
Jack pronounced her to be a wherry; but I thought her something much larger. The wind was from
the southward, and she, choosing what was probably her best point of sailing, made for the
English coast.  She sailed well; but we kept her in sight, for daylight had just broke, and
the mist had partially cleared away.  As soon as my uncle came on deck he ordered a shot to
be fired wide of her, to make her heave-to.  She paid no attention to it.

"Fire another, Stretcher, right into her this time, and we will make her show her quality,"
said he.

The mists had now cleared off sufficiently to show that she was a wherry, though rather a small
one.  The shot went through her foresail, but still she held on.  She was heavily laden, and
her crew must have seen that her chance of escape was small, if not impossible.  To render
this still more difficult, it was every instant growing lighter and lighter.  There were numerous
sharp eyes on board the cutter fixed on her, and we now perceived her crew heaving the tubs
overboard as fast as they could.  They fancied, probably, that we could not see them.  There
were no weights attached to them, so they floated; but as we had no time to stop and pick them
up, we noted carefully our course as we passed them, so as to be able to find them again.

"Fire away at her, my lads, till she heaves-to," cried my uncle, seeing that she still held on.

"Surely she'll not get away from us," I remarked to Jack.

"Not so sure of that, Mr D'Arcy," he answered.  "Now she's got her cargo out of her, should
the wind fall on a sudden, and the fog come on thicker, she may contrive to hide herself away
in it before we can get our boats out."

The fog deceived us as to her true distance from us, for after the first, none of our shot
struck her, though that mattered nothing, for the breeze freshening, we were now coming up
with her hand over hand.

"Lower your canvas!" shouted my uncle, as we got near.

Her people thought it wise to obey, to avoid the shot, which could not now well miss its aim.
She was next ordered to pull alongside, which she immediately did; but there was not a symptom
of a cask or keg of spirits in her.  She had five hands in her.  They were desired to come
on board.  One of them acknowledged himself the skipper.

"We want to know why you chased and fired at us, sir," he said, in the most innocent manner
possible, addressing my uncle.

"For having contraband goods on board," he answered.

"Lord love ye, sir--we have contraband goods aboard, sir!" replied the skipper, with a feigned
look of surprise.  "We was just taking our pleasuring, and didn't know but what you was an
enemy, or a pirate, or some chap of that sort, so we runned away, sir, do ye see."

"Very well; you'll remain on board the cutter for the present, and perhaps I may prove to the
contrary," said my uncle.

The smugglers were compelled, with a very bad grace, to go below; the wherry was dropped astern,
and the cutter stood back over the ground we had before crossed.  Before eight-bells we had
picked up fifty tubs of brandy.  As plenty of our people could swear that they saw a number
of tubs thrown overboard from the wherry, there was no doubt of her being condemned.  When
our prisoners perceived that their escape was impossible, they seemed to screw themselves up
to bear their reverses like brave men.  Though somewhat down in the mouth, they apparently
felt no ill-will, but were obedient and respectful.  Luck was against them. They had tried
to smuggle, and we, as in duty bound, had stopped them. The worst they had to expect was a
few months' residence in Winchester gaol.  My uncle had each of them down separately in his
cabin, to try and obtain any information they might be inclined to give, especially about Myers,
whom he was most anxious to get hold of.  From one of them he learned that a large lugger was
to run across the following night but one, from Cherbourg; and he resolved to intercept her.
A course was immediately shaped for that port.  He had explained his plan to Hanks, who was
to take the wherry with four hands and to keep a bright look-out for the lugger, and to board
her if he met her, as soon as she was half-way across Channel.  I obtained leave to accompany
him, for though I could not be expected to do much while blows were being given and taken,
I was considered a good hand at steering; and my uncle was glad to let me see as much service
as possible, holding the opinion that in that way only could I become a good practical officer.

When we had got about mid Channel between Saint Catharine's and Cherbourg, the cutter was hove-to
and the wherry hauled up alongside.

"Success attend you," said my uncle, as Hanks and I stepped into the wherry.  "Mind, Mr Hanks,
keep a sharp look-out for the lugger; but do not let anything else with a smuggling air about
her escape unexamined."

"Ay, ay, sir," answered Hanks, as we shored off.  "I hope to get hold of the lugger, and Myers
in her."

We had in the boat provisions for four or five days; cloaks, blankets, a compass, and lantern;
with three muskets, and pistols and cutlasses for each person.  Our directions were to cruise
about for three days, should the weather remain moderate, and then to rejoin the cutter off
the Needles.  We started away with a light breeze and a smooth sea, and stood for a short way
towards Cherbourg, while the cutter returned over part of the course she had come.  The weather
was very pleasant, and the sunbeams sparkled cheerily on the rippling wavelets caused by the
meeting of the tide and wind, as we ran through the water at the rate of some five or six knots
an hour.  Hanks lighted his favourite short black pipe, such as in Ireland we should call a
"dodeen."  He never indulged in a cigar, except one was given him.  While he leaned back, with
his legs stretched along the seats, I steered.  I used to think it very hard that he would
never let me smoke, but I have since been much obliged to him.

"This is what I call comfort, Neil," said he.  "One of the smooths of life; but it won't last,
so let us enjoy it while we can.  Before long we may be getting broken heads, with a gale of
wind into the bargain."

So he smoked his pipe, took ever and anon a sip from the rum-bottle, sang a snatch from a song,
and joked and talked away till the sun began to hasten his descent into the ocean.  We were
all the time keeping a look-out for any suspicious craft.

At last the sails of a lugger appeared against the evening sky as she got clear of the land.
We made sure it was the vessel we were in search of, and prepared for action.

"D'Arcy, do you stay at the helm, and keep the wherry alongside, while the rest of us jump
aboard," said Hanks.  "Stretcher, you must knock down the fellow at the helm; I'll grapple
with the skipper, if they show fight."

On came the lugger.  I thought it very unlikely if Myers was on board, from his well-known
character, that he would fail to show fight; indeed, it seemed much more probable that he would
do his best to knock us all on the head, and heave us overboard again, should we manage to
set foot on his deck.  However, I said nothing, and felt just as eager for the fray as if such
an idea had not crossed my mind.

Hanks had been taking a steady look at the lugger through his spy-glass. "Well!" he exclaimed,
"hang me if I don't think, after all, that she's one of those French chasse marees.  Our lugger
hasn't yet come out."

"D'ye think, sir, that they chaps was deceiving of us?" said Jack. "They be up to all sorts
of dodges."

"Oh, hang it, no; I hope not," answered Hanks, with considerable doubt, notwithstanding, in
his tone.  "The Commander cross-questioned them a great deal too close for them to deceive
us.  We shall see the right craft by-and-by."

We were soon convinced, however, that the lugger in sight was a chasse maree.  She hauled her
wind, and stood along shore.  Had she observed us she would probably have had no little suspicion
of our business out there.

After watching for the lugger to no purpose for three hours or more, the moon rose out of the
dark water, and gave us a wider range of vision. Hour after hour passed away, and still she
did not appear.  We began at last to be afraid either that the smugglers had deceived us, or
that she had slipped out and passed us unobserved.  As our blockade might be somewhat long,
Hanks divided the crew into watches; he taking command of one, and I of the other.  When it
was my turn to sleep, I rested as soundly as I usually did in my own berth, though I dreamed
that I had caught sight of Myers, and that I was chasing him round and round the world with
a pair of ten-league boots on my legs.  How he kept ahead of me I could not tell.  Hanks awoke
me to take some breakfast, and then let me go to sleep again, for I was so drowsy that I could
not keep my eyes open.  While I was still more asleep than awake, I heard Jack's voice exclaim--

"That's her, sir, I'll take my davy."

"Yes, that's her, and no mistake, this time," added Hanks.

I was on my feet in a moment, and looking towards the French coast, I saw a lugger about two
miles off, running down to us.  All hands were on the alert, and every preparation was made
to ensure the success of our enterprise.  We hauled our wind, and steered a course so as to
intercept her, without, if possible, exciting the suspicion of the smugglers till we were alongside.
As the sea was perfectly smooth and the wind light, we should have no difficulty in getting
on board.  Hanks, Jack, and I alone showed ourselves; the rest were ordered to lie down in
the bottom of the boat.  The lugger, we could see, was heavily laden, and her general appearance
betokened her to be French.

"Remember, my lads, we shall have to give and take some hard blows; but sharp's the word, and
she'll be ours before her people know what we are after," exclaimed Hanks, in an inspiriting
tone.  It was an exciting moment.  As we drew near, we could count some twelve men or more
on her deck.  We were by this time well over on the British half of the Channel.

"Keep her away a little, D'Arcy," said Hanks.  The smugglers had been watching us without apparently
suspecting our intentions.  "Now, hard up!--ease off the mainsheet!--hook on!--follow me, my lads!"

As Hanks uttered the last words we had run alongside.  The next moment he leaped over the bulwarks
of the lugger on to her deck, and grappling with her captain, a Frenchman, tripped him up.
Jack at the same time knocked down the man at the helm with a boat's stretcher.  There was
a mighty deal of jabbering and swearing in French, and some round oaths uttered in English,
when, as Hanks was working his way forward, some of the crew, plucking courage, made a rush,
and, seizing him, bore him overboard, fortunately on the larboard side, on the same which the
wherry was: small thanks to the smugglers on that account.  We were going through the water,
it must be remembered, though not very quick. Hanks made a desperate attempt to clamber on
board again by the lugger's forechains, but missed his aim; then, giving a glance of defiance
at the rascals, he kept himself afloat while he sung out, "Hillo, D'Arcy, lend me a hand here!"

Directly I saw what had happened I seized an oar, and thrust it out towards him.  He grasped
it as we passed by, and quickly clambered into the wherry.  The moment after, with the stretcher,
which he had never let out of his grasp, he was again on the lugger's deck, belabouring both
right and left those of the crew who still resisted.  As none of the smugglers had seen him
get out of the water, they were completely taken by surprise, and without striking another
blow, sung out for quarter.

"You don't deserve it, you blackguards, for daring to resist a king's officer in the execution
of his duty," cried Hanks, flourishing his stretcher.  "But, forward with you, there, and don't
move till I give you leave."  The Frenchmen did not understand him, but the English smugglers
did, and his action showed what he desired.  The crew were soon penned up in the fore part
of the vessel, with the exception of the captain and the man Jack had knocked down, who were
sitting on deck rubbing their eyes, hardly yet recovered.  Scarcely three minutes had passed
since we ran alongside, and the lugger was ours.  I was still in the boat, waiting for orders.

"Come on board, D'Arcy," said Hanks at length, looking over the side. "We'll lower the wherry's
sails, and tow her astern."

I gladly jumped out of her when we had stowed her canvas and made fast the painter.  Our prize
turned out to be a valuable one, for she had not only spirits, but silk and lace on board.
Her papers clearly proved also that these goods were intended to be smuggled, so I remember
Hanks saying; but how that was I did not trouble myself, nor do I to this day know.  The smugglers,
as well as they might, were certainly sulky; and Hanks, as a gentle hint for them to behave
themselves, stationed a man with a double-barrelled pistol in his hand close to them, while
they stood huddled together on the little forecastle.  I took the helm, while the sails were
trimmed and a course shaped for the Needles.  In a short time a breeze sprang up, and we spanked
along at a furious rate.  The French skipper had now recovered, and getting on his legs, with
a polite bow, expressed a hope, in tolerable English, that we would make ourselves at home
on board his vessel.

"No fear of that, monsieur," answered Hanks.  "Cool, is he not, D'Arcy?"

"You no have taken dinner, sare," continued the skipper.  "I will tell de cook to make dinner
ready."

"Not a bad idea, monsieur," said Hanks.  "Which of you chaps is cook?"

The Frenchman pointed to the fellow whose head Jack had nearly broken. He spoke a few words
to him, and the man--having got up and stretched himself to ascertain, I suppose, that no bones
were broken--dived below, and presently returned with a white cap and apron, and several pans
and dishes, and began busying himself in the mysteries of his art.  Again he dived, the fire
in the forepeak burned up brightly, and savory smells began to ascend therefrom.  In about
an hour the skipper, with another bow, invited us into his little well-like cabin aft, where
a collation, such as an epicure might envy, was placed before us.  What were its component
parts I did not inquire.  They may have been cats and frogs, but neither Hanks nor I were in
any way particular, and no dreadful surmises crossed my mind.  An Englishman would have broached
a keg of brandy, but our friend, Monsieur Didot, placed a bottle of fine-flavoured claret and
a variety of first-rate liqueurs before us, not that either Hanks or I was well able to appreciate
the former.

"Come, monsieur, hand us out a bottle of some real stuff or other; I'm not fond of your pink
vinegars," exclaimed Hanks, as he tossed off a tumbler of the claret.  "This isn't bad for
washing the dust out of a fellow's throat on a hot day, but there's no life-blood in it."

The skipper, with a twinkle of his eyes which betokened mischief, though unfortunately Hanks
did not perceive it, produced a large square bottle, thick at the top, from which he poured
out a glass of first-rate Scheidam.  Hanks smacked his lips as he tasted it.

"Take care, Neil, my child," said he, "you don't swallow much of that stuff; it's too good.
I'll just smack at another glass, and then we'll go on deck out of the way of temptation."

The Frenchman looked mightily disappointed when he saw that Hanks was not so easily taken in
as he doubtless expected he would be.  I happened to look round as we left the cabin, and saw
him shrugging his shoulders and making hideous grimaces, and no very complimentary gestures
at us. Before this little incident I had thought him the pink of politeness. He wore love-locks
and rings in his ears, and was dressed with the most accurate French nautical precision; in
fact he looked thoroughly unlike an English seaman.  In his manners he was a very mild man,
and certainly he had nothing of the ruffian about him.  I cannot say as much for his crew,
some of whom were very ill-looking dogs.  It would have been wiser in Hanks to have handcuffed
them all, including the skipper and cook (though we should thereby have gone without a good
dinner), and stationed a sentry with a loaded musket over them, with orders to shoot the first
who should attempt to escape.

The French skipper, when he found that his plan to obfuscate the brains of the knowing old
Hanks had totally failed, went and sat himself down forward among his people, apparently in
a fit of the sulks.

Hanks, who was in high spirits at the success of our enterprise, walked the deck with me, looking
out for the high land of the Isle of Wight above the Needle rocks, which we were approaching.
The breeze had increased and kicked up a little sea, and we were running fast through the water.

"D'Arcy, my boy, this is a fine haul, isn't it?" exclaimed my superior, rubbing his hands.
"Credit and prize-money together.  Both good things. When I was a youngster I thought something
about the first; but now, do you see, Mrs Hanks and I have a fancy for t'other.  It keeps the
pot boiling, do ye see?  I should think your uncle, by this time, was much of my way of thinking,
though he's a round number of years younger than I am."

"I'm not so sure of that," said I.  "My uncle thinks a good deal of gaining honour, and I believe
he'd rather take an enemy's frigate after a hard-fought action, than capture a Spanish galleon
without a blow."

"Well, it's the proper spirit," said Hanks, with a sigh.  "The revenue service don't nourish
it much, though.  Take my advice; get out of it as soon as you can; or," he continued with
much feeling, "it will spoil you otherwise, depend on it."

We continued walking the deck for some time longer.  We then sat down to rest, watching the
coast, from which we were about three miles distant.

Jack was at the helm, and the rest of our people were giving a hand to the sheets, as the wind
had veered a little to the westward.

The smugglers were seemingly fast asleep, with the exception of the skipper, who had lighted
a cigar to console himself under his mishap.

CHAPTER TEN.

THE TABLES TURNED--CONSOLE MYSELF WITH THE FIDDLE--SET THE FRENCHMEN DANCING--CAPTAIN DIDOT--MY
PLACE OF IMPRISONMENT--ESCAPE--GREATER DANGER--FRIGHTEN MY FRIENDS.

Everything was going on as tranquilly as possible.  Hanks was sweeping the horizon with his
glass, looking out for the cutter, when suddenly, without the slightest warning, I saw the
sentry's pistol knocked out of his fist, and he himself hove headlong into the sea.  Away flew
the skipper's cigar, and up he jumped as lively as a cricket, and, with two of his men, threw
himself upon Hanks, who, taken unawares (his eyes engaged in his telescope), was bundled overboard.
I tried to catch him by the leg, but his old blue trousers tore in my grasp, and a big Frenchman
dealt me such a blow on the head that I was for an instant stunned.

When I came to my senses, I saw the wherry dropping astern, and the Frenchmen, with pump-handles
and boat-hooks, striking at the poor fellows they had hove overboard, with the foul intent
of drowning them. I observed that somebody was in the wherry, for her sails were being hoisted,
and I was bolting aft for the purpose of jumping into the water and swimming to her, when the
skipper caught me by the arm.  "Stay, my little fellow," he exclaimed; "we don't want to hurt
you, and don't want witnesses to this work.  You must go with us."

While he was speaking, some of the smugglers had got hold of the muskets which our people had
brought on board, and presenting them at the wherry, snapped the locks.  Fortunately they were
not loaded, or the priming had fallen out, and the villains were saved from the perpetration
of further crimes.

The men in the water swam towards the wherry, and I judged from her movements that those in
her were engaged in picking them up.  I sang out and struggled in vain; but the Frenchman held
me fast, and finally, to save himself further trouble, lifted me up by the collar and shoved
me down the companion-hatch into the cabin, closing the slide over me. There was I, like a
mouse caught in a trap.  At first I burst into a fit of tears, more from rage and indignation
at being outwitted and surprised by the Frenchman than from the prospect in store for me, which
was not, however, very pleasant.  I might expect to be kept a prisoner in some out-of-the-way
place in France, or perhaps, to be shipped to the other side of the globe and to be unable
to return home for years to come.  I made ineffectual attempts to get on deck to see what had
become of Hanks and our men; but as I could not move the slide, I was obliged to sit down quietly
in the cabin.  My melting mood was soon over. "Better now," thought I to myself.  "I won't
let these big blackguards of Frenchmen see me down-hearted, any how.  For the honour of old
Ireland and the name of D'Arcy, I'll put a bold face on the matter," and I began to sing.

There was a row on deck, and a great deal of jabbering; and the little vessel heeled over to
the breeze; but I had no means of discovering what was taking place, nor where we were going.

The only light let into the vessel was through a bulls-eye in the deck, so that at first I
thought I was shut up in darkness.  As, however, my sight got accustomed to the glimmer, I
discovered a fiddle and bow hung up against the bulkhead.

"Come," thought I, "I'll show the froggies that, though they may shut me up, they can't damp
my spirits in a hurry," and seizing the instrument, I struck up an Irish jig.  It was the most
jolly tune I could recollect, and seldom failed to move the heels of all who heard it.  I played
away for some time without any notice being taken of my music; then I heard one fellow begin
to shuffle away overhead, and then another, and presently it appeared as if the whole crew
were toeing and heeling it in fine style.  Then there were loud fits of laughter; and afterwards
the slide was withdrawn and the skipper descended into the cabin.

"Vell, you are, bon garcon, one merry fellow," he said, laughing. "You make good use of my violin."

"I am fond of music, and play when I can," I answered in an indifferent tone; "but I'm tired
now, and intend to go to sleep."

"Well, but I have come to take you on deck to play to my people," said he.  "They are pleased
with you, and it will be better for you if you do."

"What! you ask me to play for the amusement of the men who have been ill-treating my shipmates,
and murdering them, for what I know to the contrary," I answered, indignantly.  "No!  I played
for my own amusement, and do not intend to play any more."

"Your shipmates attacked us first; and besides, my little man, we have not murdered them, or
done them much harm either, except depriving them of your company, and of a few muskets and
pistols," he answered.  "Take my advice: be as obliging as you can; they will be civil to you
in return."

"Well, monsieur, I believe you are right," I replied.  "If they really have not hurt my brother
officer and our men, I will fiddle for them as long as they like."

Saying this, I followed him on deck, where I seated myself on the companion-hatch; and as I
played away, in spite of the tumbling of the little vessel in the heavy sea running, all the
Frenchmen, including Monsieur Didot, kept skipping, and jumping, and whirling about, hugging
each other like bears, and shouting with glee at having saved their cargo from the clutches
of the revenue people.  We were standing, close-hauled, towards the French coast.  I looked
anxiously for the wherry, for I thought Hanks would have followed; but she was nowhere in sight.
One of the Englishmen was at the helm, and the other two were forward.  They were sulky brutes,
and seemed much more bitter against me than were the Frenchmen.  Whenever I ceased playing,
the skipper gave me a hint to go on again; and there sat I, one of His Majesty's officers,
scraping away on an old Cremona for the amusement of a set of smugglers and outlaws.  The scene
struck me as so ludicrous that I burst into a loud fit of laughter till the tears began to
stream down my cheeks.  I fiddled all the faster, till the delight of the Frenchmen knew no
bounds; and as a proof of their regard, some of them came up and actually almost hugged the
breath out of my body, calling me a brave garcon, a jolly garcon and an ornament to my country.
This fun continued till we made the land, about dark.  Some time afterwards, I found that we
were running into a small harbour, with a pier on one side and a lighthouse on it.  Its name
I could not learn; but I supposed it was somewhere to the eastward of Cherbourg.  I was trying
to make out the look of the place, when the captain, touching me on the shoulder, said, "Go
down below, my boy; when I want you I will come for you." There was that in his tone which
showed me that it would be useless to dispute his orders; so I returned to the cabin.  Finding
a berth with some bed-clothes in it, I crept in, and coiling myself away, was soon, fast asleep.
I was awoke after some time by the skipper's voice.  He was holding up a lantern, and looking
round, seemingly much surprised at not seeing me.  He laughed as I poked my head out of my crib.

"Ah, mon petit, you make yourself at home wherever you go," he exclaimed.  "But get up; you
must come with me, and I will find a worthy lady who will take good care of you for some time
to come."

I answered that I was very much obliged to him, but that I wanted to return home as soon as
possible.

"Ah, that cannot be," said he, in a quiet tone.  "I am sorry to inconvenience you; but you
will allow that it is better to be kept a prisoner than to have been thrown overboard as food
for the fish."

"Much obliged to you, monsieur," I replied.  "I cannot dispute your reasoning; so just be good
enough to tell me what you want me to do."

"To get up and come with me," said he; "and listen, my young friend,--if you attempt to run
away, I will simply blow your brains out.  I don't wish you any harm, as I have proved; but
necessity compels me to be explicit."

I did not know whether or not he was in earnest; but as it is dangerous to trifle with a man
who has the power to put so unpleasant a threat in execution, I thought it wisest to obey him.
I accordingly followed him on deck, when he took my hand and led me along a plank which was
thrown from the vessel to the shore.  We walked through the narrow street of a village odoriferous
of fish, and then out into the country, which in agreeable contrast smelt of fresh grass and
flowers.  Proceeding along a road which, by looking at the stars overhead, I judged ran inland,
we reached a farm-house, standing a little back from the road.  The smuggler knocked with his
fist at the floor, but no one answered, nor was any light seen through the windows.  We waited
some further time without receiving any answer to our summons.

"Morbleu!  I forgot the hour; they have all gone to bed.  I must knock again," said he, giving
several thundering blows on the door.

At length a female voice asked who was there.

"It is Captain Didot and a friend; open quick, good Madeleine," he said in French.  "We are
tired and hungry and sleepy, and wish to be inside instead of outside your door."

"Ah! it is you, Monsieur Didot, I know full well," answered the voice. "I will let you in."

We were, however, kept some time longer, and at last the door opened, and a young woman made
her appearance, dressed in a high white cap and short petticoats, dark woollen stockings, and
wooden shoes, but very neat and trim.  I had never before seen a woman in so odd a rig.  She
smiled a welcome to my companion, and shutting the door behind us, a good deal of talking took
place; but though I could manage to make out Captain Didot's French, I did not understand a
word she said.  We then went into a nice clean parlour, with a red-brick floor, and sat down
and talked again.  Suddenly, up jumped the lady in the high cap, and after an absence of ten
minutes or so, returned with a tray covered with eatables and drinkables.  I instinctively
drew my chair to the table at the sight without waiting to be bid, whereat our hostess smiled,
and observed that the pauvre enfant was hungry.  Captain Didot took the hint and helped me;
nor did he forget himself; and setting to work, we made a very capital supper.

"I must now be off," observed Monsieur Didot, as he came to an anchor; "but before I go, I
must give you a caution, Monsieur Englishman.  You are not to make your appearance outside
these garden walls for the next fortnight.  If you attempt to get away, ill-will come of it.
Remember that madame here will take care of you, and you may have as much fruit to eat and
wine to drink as you like; and now, good night, my friend. You hear, do you not?"

I did hear; but I was so very sleepy that I could not recollect enough French to answer him.
While he continued talking to madame, I dropped off asleep in my chair, and for long in my
dreams I heard the buzz of their voices.  When I was at last awoke, by feeling a hand placed
on my shoulder, the smuggling captain was gone.

"Come," said the good-natured woman; "you want rest, my boy;" and taking a candle, she led
me into a neat little room with a comfortable bed in it, where I very soon forgot myself in
slumber.

The next morning, when I turned out, I found that I was an occupant of a comfortable farm-house,
with a garden attached, full of fruit-trees and vegetables.  An old man and his wife made their
appearance, and I discovered that the young woman who had received us the previous night was
their daughter.  While we were at breakfast, I heard the old couple complaining of Captain
Didot for having brought me there.  They evidently fancied that I did not understand French.

"He will be getting us into trouble with his tricks, one of these days," remarked the old lady.
"Ah!  Madeleine, my daughter, it would be much wiser in you to have nothing more to say to him."

Mademoiselle looked very glum, as if she did not like the counsel.  I pretended to be deeply
absorbed, discussing the fresh eggs and other eatables placed before me.

"Ha, ha!" thought I to myself; "I see how the wind blows.  They will not dare, then, to keep
me a prisoner longer than I like to stay.  Well, I'm very comfortable here at present; so I
will spend a day or so with the good people."

I saw that I was narrowly watched wherever I went; but I did not forget the French skipper's
advice to take advantage of the fine fruit with which the garden abounded.  When Madeleine
saw that I was apparently contented, we became very good friends; and I must own that I spent
the day not unpleasantly.  I began, however, to reflect that I had no business to remain where
I was if I had the power of getting away; so I turned in my mind how I could best make my escape.
I guessed that to do so would not be quite so easy as at first appeared; for I had observed
a labourer continually near me, and I remarked that whenever I went to a distant part of the
garden his occupation invariably took him in the same direction.

"Somehow or other I must manage to make a run for it," thought I to myself; but when I came
to examine the locality, I found that the garden was surrounded with fields and ditches; and
though I might swim across the latter, I should certainly have been caught and made very uncomfortable
and dirty into the bargain.  I therefore gave up that idea, and amused myself in the best way
I could.  I helped Mademoiselle Madeleine in her poultry-yard and dairy, looked in on the old
lady employed in her culinary affairs, walked over the farm with the old man, and chatted in
my somewhat unintelligible French, with every one I met. Happening to go into my own room in
the evening, I found the window open, and looking out, I saw that the height from the sill
to the ground was not more than from twelve to fifteen feet.

"Ho, ho!" thought I; "it will be a foolish bird which can't get out of a cage like this; but
I will bide my time."  I hurried away, and ran downstairs, where I was soon after summoned
to supper.  I made myself quite at home, and did not fail to do justice to the meal.  The household
went to rest early, and as soon as I fancied every one was asleep I got up from my bed, where
I had thrown myself, and reconnoitred the ground.  To avoid the risk of laming myself by a
jump, I tied my sheets together, and secured them to the leg of a table, which I managed to
jam between the shutter and the wall so as to prevent its slipping; and placing my hat tightly
on my head, and buttoning up my coat, I let myself quietly down to the ground.  I was afraid
of awakening some one in the house should I run, as I felt inclined to do; so I crept softly
away, till I had got to some distance, and then took to my heels, as fast as I could go, in
the direction of the town or fishing village where I had landed.  After going for some distance,
I thought that I must have missed my way; but the murmur of the water on the beach assured
me that I had taken the right direction.  At last I found myself among some straggling cottages,
my nose helping me to find the locality I was in search of.  My first care was to look out
for the lugger, to avoid her.  Much to my satisfaction, she was not there, neither was any
one moving on the quay; so I walked about till I found a shed somewhat less odorous than its
neighbours, where I determined to take up my abode till daylight.  Here I quickly made myself
a nest with some ropes and spars--albeit not a very soft one,--and fell fast asleep.  Having
the necessity of being alert on my mind, I awoke just as dawn was breaking, and, jumping up,
I ran down to the quay.  The flapping of a sail told me that some one was astir, and, looking
round, I saw at the end of the quay a cutter preparing to get under weigh.

"Cutter ahoy!"  I sung out, running the chance of anybody understanding me.  "Where are you
bound for?"

"Hillo; who are you?" asked a voice in English.

"I want a cast across the Channel," I answered.

"Well, come aboard, and we'll see what we can do for you," said the same speaker.

I accordingly ran along the quay, and jumped on the cutter's deck just as her last warp was
cast off.  I had a rough Flushing coat buttoned up close round me; and as I had on also a low
tarpaulin hat, I thought I looked the character I wished to assume.  The people on board were
likewise too busy to afford me more than a passing glance as I sprung on deck.  A rough, weather-beaten
old fellow, with one eye, who, from the orders he issued, I knew to be the master, stood at
the helm.  His crew consisted of seven hands--strong, active-looking fellows,--many more than
the craft required to work her.  This circumstance at once made me suspect that she was not
over honest.

"Faith," thought I to myself, "this isn't the best place in the world for a revenue officer
to find himself in."

But it was now too late to get oh shore again.  The headsheets were let draw, the main eased
off a little, the peak hoisted up, and, with a fair breeze, the cutter glided out of the harbour.

"Well, youngster, you were not long in making up your mind about coming," said the old skipper,
scrutinising me, I thought, pretty narrowly from head to foot.  "What place are you bound for, eh?"

I told him Ryde, in the Isle of Wight.

"Well, we'll put you ashore at the back of the Wight; I suppose that will do for you?" he answered,
in a good-natured tone.

I thanked him for his offer; and we went on talking very amicably for some time, till we had
run some fifteen miles from the coast.  I think, from the first, the old man had some suspicions
of me; but I had acted my part well, and I fancied that I had succeeded in lulling them.

Just as I thought all was right, as ill-luck would have it, I happened to want to use my pocket-handkerchief,
and in searching for it I incautiously threw open my jacket and exposed my uniform buttons to view.

In the first place, the sort of boy I pretended to be would not have possessed such an article
as a pocket-handkerchief; and I ought to have remembered that the sight of the crown and anchor
would not be acceptable to persons of my friends' vocation.

"Why--hullo, youngster! who are you, I should like to know?" exclaimed the old skipper, seizing
me by the arm, and giving me no gentle shake.

"He's a spy, surely, and no mistake," cried several of the crew.  "Heave the young shrimp overboard."

"Overboard with him!" exclaimed the rest in chorus.  "We'll teach the Government to send their
whelps to hunt us out in this fashion."

I own that I began to feel very uncomfortable; for the threatening looks of the fellows were
in no way calculated to lessen my apprehensions. Now my feelings always prompt me to try and
escape from a dilemma by at once candidly confessing the truth.  I therefore acknowledged that
I belonged to a revenue cutter, and explained what had occurred.

"I only obeyed the orders of my superior officers in attacking the lugger," I observed, in
as bold a tone as I could manage to muster. "Her people carried me off against my will; and,
as I wanted to get home, I came aboard you; but I never thought of doing you or any of your
friends harm, if I could help it.  How am I to blame, then?"

"Never listen to his chaff; heave him overboard, I say," growled out one of the men.

"Thank you all the same, master," said I, looking him as boldly as I could in the face; "but
I'd rather stay aboard till I can get put decently on shore, and not have to swim there, as
you would have me do."

"Swim!  By God, you wouldn't swim long, I expect," said the ruffian.

"Faith, I've no fancy for trying, either," I answered.  "If I intended treachery, do you think,
masters, I should have put myself in your power as I have done? just answer me that."

"Well, now, I don't think as how you would," exclaimed the old skipper. "You're a brave lad
anyhow, and deserve a better calling than trying to injure poor fellows who are just doing
their best to make a honest livelihood for their families."

"Well," said I, seeing the favourable impression I was making, "I'm going soon to be appointed
to a frigate on a foreign station, so there's little chance of my falling in with you again.
If you kill me you will be hung, that's certain, for murder is always out some day or other."

"Don't be coming any of your Irish blarney over us," growled out a sour-looking ruffian.  "If
you're a spy, overboard you go, that's all."

"I'm no spy," I answered in an indignant tone.  "All I ask of you is to put me on shore anywhere
at the back of the Wight, and I'll give you my word none of you will be the worse for my being
here."

The skipper gave an approving nod as I pleaded for my life.  Some of the ruffians seemed to
give way.

"Just tell me, then, what harm can a small chap like me do you?"  I continued.  "How do I know
what you've got on board, or what you're going to do with it.  Be good-natured fellows now,
and if I can ever do you a good turn, I will."

"Oh, come, let the little chap alone; there's no harm in him, I'm sure!" exclaimed one of the
smugglers, slapping me on the shoulder.  "Cheer up, my lad; we'll do you no harm."

The others soon came round, and shaking me by the hand, declared that I was a brave little
cock, and they only wished I was one of them.

A coarse but plentiful dinner was soon afterwards placed on the deck, the chief part of it
appearing in a square iron pot, round which we sat as merry as crickets; and there was I hob-nobbing
with a band of smugglers as if we were the best friends in the world.

Towards evening we made the land, no cutter being in sight.  I had a sovereign and a few shillings
in my pocket, which I offered the old skipper, but he would receive nothing; and, as good as
his word, as soon as it was dark, he ran in and put me on shore not far from Shanklin.  As
there was some sea on the beach, all hands got not a little wet, but they took it in good part,
and wished me a hearty good-bye as I set off to clamber up the cliffs.  I at length found a
path which took me into the high road; as soon as I reached it I began to make the best of
my way towards Ryde.  My legs ached, but I ran and walked as fast as I could.  I had not proceeded
far when I heard the sound of wheels coming along the road.  A cart soon overtook me.

"Is this the road to Ryde?"  I asked.

"Yes, it be," said the driver.  "Be you going there?"

"If I can manage to get as far," I answered.

"Well, if you be tired, jump in, and I'll gie ye a lift; I be going most of the way," replied
the good Samaritan.  I obeyed with alacrity, and took my seat by his side.  He was one of the
substantial farmers who abound in the island.  I gave him an account of my adventures, at which
he was much amused; nor did he seem to have any very great antipathy to my smuggling friends.

"Lord bless 'e! they wouldn't have hurt your little fingers," he remarked, when I told him
how the crew of the cutter had threatened my life.  He would not part from me till he had deposited
me at the gates of Daisy Cottage.  The lights were shining through the drawing-room windows.
My aunt was sitting working, and sweet Alice Marlow had a book before her.  They both looked
very sad, I thought.  I tapped at the window, which opened to the ground, to call their attention,
and grinned a "How-d'ye-do" through the glass.  No sooner did Alice see my face, than letting
her book fall, she gave a loud scream, as if she had seen a spectre.

"Hillo! what's the matter?"  I exclaimed, shaking the handle of the window.  "Let me in, aunt,
please; I'm not a thief or a ghost, on my word."  My aunt, more courageous than the little
girl, had risen from her seat, and my voice assuring her of my identity, she opened the door,
and I very soon convinced her and Alice that I was a living being by kissing them both, and
then devouring every scrap of supper she set before me.  I found that, from Hanks' report,
they had been led to believe that the Frenchmen had knocked me on the head; and were mourning
for me accordingly.  My aunt was, I verily believe, employed in making a black gown to put
on for my sake.  My uncle had sailed again to look after the lugger, so that I was able to
enjoy the height of a midshipman's felicity, a holiday on shore.  Three days afterwards the
Serpent came back, having re-captured the lugger and two hundred tubs. I saw Captain Didot,
who was very angry at finding that I had escaped, and vowed he would pay me off in a different
coin, if he ever caught me again.  I told him he might, if he ever did.

CHAPTER ELEVEN.

HANKS AND MY GHOST--HANKS' LEARNING--MYERS AGAIN--ESCAPES ONCE MORE-- APPOINTED TO A FRIGATE--PREPARE
FOR SEA--MY SHIPMATES--SAIL FROM ENGLAND--MESSRS. TRUNDLE AND CHISSEL--DICKY SHARPE AND A TALE
OF A BEEF-BONE.

On reaching Portsmouth, I took a boat and pulled off to the cutter, which was lying out in
the middle of the harbour.  Hanks was walking the deck as I came alongside, but something having
attracted his attention in the direction of Gosport, he did not observe me.  Handing the boatman
a shilling, I jumped on board unnoticed, and just as Hanks turned round, I stood before him,
with my hand out ready to grasp his.  For an instant the colour forsook his cheeks, and he
stared at me without speaking, rolling his eyes round as if he saw my wraith.

"Why, Hanks, old fellow! don't you know me?"  I exclaimed, bursting into a loud laugh at his
extraordinary way of receiving me.  My voice convinced him that it was not my ghost which was
offering to shake hands with him.

"What, D'Arcy, my boy! is it you, indeed, come back to us after all?" he cried, seizing both
my hands in his own well-hardened paws.  "I'm glad to see you, that I am, lad; we thought those
scoundrel smugglers had done for you.  It would have been just like them, to kill the smallest
of the lot.  But how did you escape?  Come, tell us all about it.  We've had another brush
with that rascal Myers: we are certain it was him.  He had the daring to fire into us; killed
one of our people, poor Tom Darling, and wounded two, getting off into the bargain.  But we
will be even with him before long, and when we do catch him, we'll pay him off, that's all.
Well I'm glad you escaped, that I am; but come below, and let us hear the whole story."

In this way the kind-hearted fellow ran on.  Having been welcomed by Growl, Scriven, and the
rest of my shipmates, I went to report myself to my uncle, who was in his cabin.  He seemed
truly glad to find that I had not become food for fishes, though he did not exhibit his pleasure
exactly in the same way Hanks had done.  When I was dismissed by him, I dived down into our
berth, and there, over a glass of his too-favourite beverage, old Hanks listened to an account
of my adventures.  "It was the Cremona did it, after all!" he exclaimed, slapping my shoulder.
"I told you it would stand you in good stead.  Stick to it, my lad, and you'll become as great
a man as that old chap Orpheus, I've heard tell of, who made the beasts jig when he fiddled.
Who the gentleman was, I can't say, except that he was one of Julius Caesar's generals, wasn't he?"

I must observe that Hanks' knowledge of history, both ancient and modern, was somewhat limited
and confused; indeed he was impressed with a notion that Julius Caesar, for whom he had a high
respect, came over to England somewhere in the last century, and having taken possession of
the country, was in his turn thrashed by William the Conqueror.  Of all subsequent events till
the time of Nelson, he professed total ignorance.

"Ah, Nelson was the chap who made the English!" he used to exclaim in triumph; "and as for
Nap, whom they talk so much about, what was he to him, I should like to know.  Why, the little
Frenchman couldn't put a ship about in a steady breeze, I'll warrant; and as for handling her
in a gale, I doubt if he could have done it even if his crown depended on it."

Hanks had no very great respect for science either.

"What do I care for your algebra and your trigonometry?" he one day observed.  "I take my John
Norie and my Gunter's Scale, and I work out my day's work as well as any man; and what more
should I want to know, tell me?  Your mathematicians are all humbugs in my opinion, and that's
a fact."

I mention these little traits in Hanks' character, because I shall now have to bid him farewell
for a season.  He was a worthy fellow, nevertheless; not without sense of a practical sort;
a curious specimen of a school now rapidly becoming obsolete.

Soon after this we were once more on our old cruising ground, to the westward.  We had been
a week or more knocking about, when it came on to blow very hard from the south-west.  My uncle
was not a man to be frightened by a capful of wind; so, getting our storm-sails, we stood off
shore, and faced the gale like men; for this was just the weather smugglers would choose to
run across Channel, when they think no one will be on the look-out for them.  When it cleared
somewhat, we found close to us another revenue cutter.  Her commander, Lieutenant Simmons,
came on board and told my uncle that he had been directed to cruise in search of the Kitty
lugger, commanded by the notorious smuggler Bill Myers.  "He has been adding wholesale murder
to his other performances," observed the lieutenant.  Two weeks ago, a boat from the Hawk cutter
fell in with him at night.  He gave her the stem and cut her in two.  Three of her crew climbed
up the lugger's bows, but were instantly knocked on the head and hove overboard.  The rest
were drowned, with the exception of one who clung to the wreck and was picked up by the cutter
the next morning.  This account made us more eager than ever to catch Myers.  Another cruiser
was sent down to assist us in our search; but, though for several weeks we kept a sharp look-out
after him, he managed to escape us; and neither he nor the Kitty was again heard of on that
coast.  I was destined, however, to fall in with him again in another clime.

We were not sorry to get back to Portsmouth after all this knocking about.  The first person
I met on going on shore was Larry Harrigan.  He had seen the cutter coming in, and had hurried
down to the Point to meet me.

"Oh, Master Neil, I've good news for you," he exclaimed, as I jumped out of the boat and found
myself in his arms, for he still looked on me as the baby he had so carefully watched over.
"You are no longer to be kept in that tub-hunting service, saving his honour your uncle's pardon;
but you are to go to sea in reality, in a fine, smart frigate, which won't be letting the grass
grow under her keel, I'll warrant."

"That's good news, indeed, Larry; where did you learn it?"  I asked.

"From no less a man than the Captain himself, and that's good authority, you'll allow," he
answered, in a tone of no little satisfaction.  "He's a friend of your honoured grandfather's,
and was a midshipman and lieutenant on board two ships I served in.  He has been lodging in
my house for some months back; and when he heard who you were and who had brought you up and
given you your sea-learning, says he, `Larry, you've made a seaman of him, that I'll answer
for.  The lad shall go along with me when I get a ship, for his grandfather's sake and yours
too, old friend.'  Those were his last words, Master Neil, they were indeed; and he's kept
his promise, as I knew he would."

This very satisfactory information Larry communicated on our way to Southsea.  It was confirmed
soon afterwards by my uncle, who followed me up to Larry's house.  He, as I suspected, had
also made an application in my favour, and had just received a letter from Captain Poynder--which
was, I found, my future commander's name,--desiring me forthwith to join his ship, the Harold,
which was, however, still in the hands of the dockyard people.  Though I would rather have
gone afloat at once, this was, I found, a great advantage, as I had thus an opportunity of
seeing her masted, rigged, and fitted for sea.  Officers are often glad to shirk this, for
it is far from pleasant work, and Portsmouth is not the most delectable of residences.  I should
advise all midshipmen not to miss an opportunity of seeing a ship fitted out, if they possibly
can. They will find it will save them an immense deal of after trouble, and prove the quickest
way of gaining a knowledge of their future home. Meantime Larry was as busy as a bee in getting
my kit in order, aided by his better half; and few midshipmen ever obtained so good an insight
at so cheap a rate.  I got leave to run over to Ryde for a couple of days to wish my aunt and
young cousins good-bye.  I asked after Alice Marlow. I was in hopes of hearing that she was
coming back to Ryde, that I might see her before I sailed.  I blushed as I mentioned her name,
and had a curious palpitation about the region of the heart.  My aunt smiled as she replied,
"I am afraid, Neil, that I shall not be able to get my young friend to come here again for
a long time.  Mr Marlow writes me word that he proposes going abroad and taking her with him.
But cheer up; she will return here some day, I hope; and when you came back from one of your
voyages, you will find her with us, perhaps.  I should be, indeed, very sorry if I did not
expect to see the dear little girl again."

My aunt was the kindest creature alive; and I was very certain that she regretted that Alice
was not there to bid me farewell.  I wished her and my cousins good-bye.  They all cried a
little, and so, in truth, did I; for they were the only creatures I had to love in the world.
I, however, quite recovered my spirits before I got half-way across to Portsmouth.  My uncle
came several times on board the frigate, and, had I been his own son, he could not have taken
more interest in me than he did.  As for Larry Harrigan, he was on board every day, and all
day long, following me about to show me how everything was done, and why it was done.  The
first-lieutenant was a very worthy, kind man; and as soon as he had heard Larry's history,
he used to talk to him and encourage him to come on board.  Greatly to Larry's delight, he
gave me leave to spend an evening sometimes at his house, and very pleasant evenings they were.
The officers now began to join fast.  Lieutenants, mates, and midshipmen were every day arriving.
We soon had our full complement of men, and having got clear of the dockyard people, were ready
to go out to Spithead.

I was now to turn over a new page in the history of my career.  Although I had gained a considerable
amount of nautical knowledge, my experience of life was somewhat limited; but henceforth it
was to be enlarged and extended, I trusted, over the greater part of the surface of the globe.
For the present, the lands of the myrtle and vine were to be our destination--the shores of
the Mediterranean; and the man must indeed be difficult to satisfy who is not pleased with
their varied and glowing beauties.  Our gallant ship; our berth, so long our home; my messmates,
as well as our superior officers and men, merit description.  I will touch on each of them
in their turn.  First I will speak of our berth, which was in truth somewhat different to the
abodes of the naval heroes of Great Britain of the rank of midshipmen, with which the public
are familiar.  Few, perhaps, are like it, though after we had been a year or two at sea it
had sadly been shorn of its glory.  Its brilliancy had departed, and its polish was no more.
We happened to have a caterer, who liked to have everything very natty about him, and who had
accordingly taken on himself to spend a few pounds in having our berth neatly done up.  The
bulkheads were painted of a salmon colour; there was a gilt and blue moulding; a neat oilcloth
over the table and lockers; and at one end a buffet filled with plated dish-covers and dishes,
tumblers and wine-glasses, forks and spoons, and China teacups; while two swing-lamps hung
from the deck above.  It afforded a contrast, certainly, to the times of the old school, when
a purser's dip was stuck in a black bottle, and battered tin cups served alternately for grog
and tea and soup; but though the language of the occupants of our berth was somewhat more refined,
and our opinions more liberal, I will venture to say that the spirit to will and to do deeds
of daring burnt not the less brightly in our bosoms than in those of midshipmen of former times.
While I was at Ryde the ship's company moved out of the old Topaze, alongside of which we were
lashed, into the frigate; and the day after several mates and midshipmen, with somewhat aristocratic
pretensions, joined us.  I got a hint, when I came back from Ryde, that they were rather inclined
to look down upon me as having been a cutter's midshipman.

"They shan't cut me, at all events," said I to myself.  So as soon as I got on board I went
below, and taking the fiddle old Hanks had given me, I sat myself down on my chest, and began
playing away with all my might a merry Irish jig.

"Hillo; who is the jolly fellow out there?" asked one of the new mates from the berth.

"Oh, that's the Irish midshipman, D'Arcy," answered Onslow, a mate who had sometime joined.
"Give us another tune, Paddy, that's a good boy."

On this I forthwith struck up "Saint Patrick's Day in the Morning," and half a dozen other
Irish airs.

"If no one objects, I'll sing, too, mates," said I, when I had played out my tunes.

Without waiting for an answer, I locked up my fiddle, and taking my seat at one end of the
berth, I trolled out, with a very fair voice, several songs which used to delight old Hanks
and my other shipmates in the cutter.  The effect was evidently good.  I showed my wish to
please; and though afterwards a few attempts were made to snub me, I took them all in good
humour, as if they were intended as jokes, and finally established myself as a favourite with
the mess, and I may, I believe, honestly say, with nearly everybody on board.

As soon as possible we went out to Spithead, and joined a large squadron under command of Sir
Peppery Portfire.  We mustered altogether some eighteen sail of vessels or more, and a very
warlike appearance we made. We were bound, we knew, for the Mediterranean; and we all looked
forward with no little satisfaction to our visit to that most favourite of stations.

Our powder was next taken on board, with a further supply of stores, and more midshipmen. 
Among the latter, who should climb up the side but my quondam friend Dicky Sharpe.  He did
not see me, as I was aloft at the time, and before I came on deck, he and his traps had gone
below.  When my watch on deck was over, I descended to our berth, where I found him busily
employed in cramming his new messmates, and endeavouring to raise himself to a high position
in their estimation.

"You see, my good fellows, it isn't everybody has got a Minister for a cousin, and a Lord of
the Admiralty for an uncle," he remarked in a consequential tone, as I got to the door of the
berth.

"And I don't think you have either, Dicky, my boy," said I, laughing. "But I am very glad to
see you, notwithstanding; but don't be after bamboozling us jolly greens now."

At first he attempted to look very indignant at the attack made on his veracity; but no sooner
did he recognise me than his good feelings got the better of his love of trying to make himself
of importance; and jumping up, he seized my hand and wrung it warmly.

"Why, D'Arcy, is it you yourself, indeed?" he exclaimed.  "I am delighted to find you here,
I am indeed.  Why, messmates, if it hadn't been for D'Arcy I should have been food for fishes;
I should, on my word.  Think what a loss the service would have had."

A loud laugh from all hands followed this remark, though I verily believe Dicky spoke in all
gravity; but the fact that I had been the means of saving his life thus came out.  It raised
me, I had afterwards reason to know, in the good opinion of all on board; and Dicky himself
gained many friends by the feeling way in which he spoke of it.  I was very soon seated alongside
him in the berth, and our tongues were rattling away as fast as they could wag.

Dicky's propensity to brag, amusing as it was to others, was continually getting him into scrapes.
We had an old mate, Adam Stallman by name, who was proportionably as tall, grave, and silent,
as Dicky was little, merry, and loquacious.

One day Dicky having thrown a biscuit at me, which, unfortunately, hit Adam's nose, the latter
looked at him sternly.

"Sharpe, you are small," he exclaimed; "but cobbing was invented to make midshipmen grow, and
I intend to make you grow."

"Then, faith, Stallman, I suspect your mother began cobbing you as soon as you were born,"
answered the undaunted Dicky.

Adam's hands had been busy under the table with his handkerchief; now, suddenly leaning forward,
he grasped Dicky by the crop of the neck, and before he had time to expostulate, he had him
in such a position that he could apply with the greatest effect the instrument of torture he
had manufactured.  As all the oldsters sided with Adam, the youngsters dared not interfere;
and poor Dicky was held in that undignified position while other handkerchiefs were knotted,
and before he was cast loose he received a cobbing which made him treat ever afterwards all
the oldsters with abundant respect.  But Dicky, if he did not forget, did what was as wise,
he forgave; and I do not think he nourished the slightest ill-will against his cobbers.

Of Captain Poynder I have spoken.  He was a worthy man and a good officer; and if he had a
fault, it was not being sufficiently strict.

Then comes Johnny Du Pre, our gallant First.  I have still an affectionate regard for Johnny,
though many an hour have I spent at our masthead at his instigation; while Dicky, promoted
by the like authority, was taking sights at me from another.  We were sent there not without
cause, I own, and still the amount of moral turpitude which gained us that elevated distinction
was not such as to make me blush as I think of it, or to make me anxious to conceal it from
the public. Neither as a first-lieutenant nor as a man was Lieutenant Du Pre perfect; but who
is there with whom one cannot find a fault.  He was kind-hearted, a fair seaman, and anxious
to do his duty.

But our second lieutenant, Basil Vernon, was still more worthy of notice.  Refined and elegant
both in person and manners, he appeared, at first sight, to be what is called a fine gentleman;
but kind-hearted, brave, and generous almost to a fault, a first-rate seaman and officer, a
better fellow never stepped, nor one more beloved by all classes afloat, as well as by all
who knew him on shore.  I soon became very much attached to him, and would have gone round
the world to do him a service.  Many times did he save me from punishment when I specially
deserved it.  He was indeed very far from being one of those fine fellows whom no ordinary
mortals can approach; for he had a heart tender as a woman's, and he would as readily sympathise
with the grief of the smallest middy, as with the sorrow or suffering of the roughest tar on
board.  He was a sincere Christian too, and, what was more, was not ashamed of his Christianity.
He exhibited his principles in his practice--in the daily duties of life,--till he taught the
most profane and profligate to respect him, if not to adopt them.  I wish there were more Basil
Vernons in the service.  Thank Heaven! there are some shining lights to lighten us in our darkness--leaven,
which gradually, though slowly, may, by God's providence, leaven the whole mass.

Our third lieutenant, Hugh Summers, wrote poetry, talked sentiment, and dreamed dreams, and
required a flapper to remind him when to put the ship about at times; but when once aroused
into action, he was as energetic as any one, and had plenty of resources on an emergency.

The master, surgeon, and purser, were also very good fellows in their way, and if not shining
ornaments, were no disgrace to His Majesty's service.

At last the pay-clerks came on board, and paid the ship's company.  A fine bright morning saw
the signal flying from the admiral's ship for the fleet to weigh and work out to Saint Helen's.
There was a nice working breeze, a blue sky, and the water just rippled enough to reflect with
more dazzling splendour the rays of the glorious sun, as he shed them almost along the path
we were to pursue.  It was, in truth, a beautiful sight; and considering the number of ships--some
eighteen sail or more, all beating out together within so narrow a channel,--it was surprising
that much damage was not done, especially when it is remembered that the crews of half the
ships had never been to sea before, and that the ropes were stiff and new, and did not work
well. One ship, I believe, carried away her flying jib-boom against the stern of another; and
with that slight loss, and a small expenditure of abuse from the respective crews, who thought
each other to blame, we reached Saint Helen's.  The next day we were fairly off to sea; the
fleet formed in two lines, the White and the Blue Squadrons, which Sir Peppery manoeuvred with
much skill, to the no small trouble of the signal midshipmen.  The second day, Ned Lenny, the
young gentleman on board the Harold who held that office, vowed he must leave the service and
go into the Dragoons, if it was to be carried on in that way; though the following morning
he thought better of it.  He gained, however, the sobriquet of the Heavy, which, as he was
a cocksparrow of a fellow, he retained ever afterwards.  Captain Poynder was not inclined to
save either officers or crew till we got into good order, which we accordingly did our best
to accomplish.

After cruising for six weeks, we were ordered to Spithead to complete our provisions, water,
and stores; and then, having taken some passengers on board, made all sail for our station
in Mediterranean.

We had not been long at sea when Dicky and I, wearying of the daily routine of duty, began
to play pranks which were calculated to bring us into trouble.  The boatswain, who rejoiced
in the name of Timotheus Trundle, was one of the most extraordinary of his class, though not
a bad boatswain for all that.  His appearance in foul weather was that of a short lump of big
coats and trousers, with a small red pumpkin growing out of them.  On a nearer approach, one
discovered in the said pumpkin a pair of red, ferrety eyes, an excrescence for a nose, and
a hole into which his whistle fitted for a mouth, and on either side of it, on a Sunday morning,
two very high shirt-collars, they towards the end of the week gaining a darker hue and an outward
curve.  On the top of the pumpkin was a round Spanish hat, the fluff of the catskin which composed
it being long enough to make a dozen beavers.  He wore, with considerable pride, round his
neck a handsome silver call and chain. But with all his oddities, his enemies--and he had a
few--were obliged to confess that he knew and did his duty as well as any man in the ship.
Among his other qualifications, he was a bit of a sea-lawyer; not of the cantankerous sort,
however, for it might be more justly said that he preferred sitting on the judicial bench,
and he was ever ready to settle all disputes either by arbitration or the rope's-end; indeed,
in most cases he had recourse to the latter, as being the most summary mode of proceeding.
When his duty did not require his presence on his own territory, the forecastle, he was fond
of taking a walk on the main-deck, alongside the carpenter's bench, for he was of a social
disposition, and delighted in what he called `rasheral' conversation.

Now, Ichabod Chissel, our carpenter, was another of those heroes of the tongue, who pretend
to know everything, and never fail in a story for want of a little invention.  By his own crew,
who looked up to him and esteemed him for his sterling qualities, he was considered a first-rate
politician.  The two officers were tolerably good friends in general; but a very slight thing
would make them fall out, though they as speedily patched up their quarrels again.

One day there was a light breeze and a smooth sea, and Trundle, not expecting to be wanted,
had repaired to the main-deck, where Chissel was superintending his crew at work.  Dicky Sharpe
and I happened to be near, and observing that they were both more than usually excited, we
drew closer to see the fun going forward.

"Well, that was a storm as fierce as ever I did see," remarked Chissel. "Why, there was a thunderbolt
as big as six of my fists put together, fell right through the decks, and out through the ship's
bottom; and if I hadn't been there to plug the hole, we should all have gone to Davy Jones'
locker, as sure as fate.  You was there, Trundle, and you know, old ship, that I speak true."

"I was there!  Yes; but I know you speak a hanged lie, if you say that," exclaimed Trundle.

"What's that you say?" shouted Chissel, highly indignant at being told he lied before all his
crew, though he doubtless would have cared very little about the matter, had the polite remark
been made when the two were alone.

Just then Mr Summers, who was the officer of the watch, sung out, "Hands about ship!  Where's
the boatswain?"

"Never in his station," observed Chissel, as Trundle, call in mouth, was making his way forward.
"And very little use when he is there," he added, either thinking the boatswain would not hear
him, or caring very little if he did.

Trundle caught the words just as he was going up the fore-ladder, and though he could not just
then take his pipe from his mouth to utter a retort, he gave a fierce look with one of his
ferrety eyes, which showed that he acknowledged himself deeply in his messmate's debt.  His
pipe sounded more shrill than usual, as he could not give any other vent to his feelings.

"There'll be a row before long between those two heroes, just you mark that," said I to Dicky,
as we both hurried off to our stations.

"Ay," said he, giving me a wink; "and I think I can put a spoke in their wheel to help them along."

It was near twelve o'clock, the ship being put about, the decks cleared up, and grog served
out preparatory to dinner, when the boatswain made his appearance before the carpenter, his
anger in no way appeased.

"What's that you were saying about me, Mr Ichabod Chissel, I should like to know?" he exclaimed,
in an irate tone.

"Why, Mr Trundle, no man likes to have his ferocity (veracity?) doubted, and if you goes for
to affirm that I'm a liar--I don't mince matters, you'll understand me,--why, all I've got
to say is, that you're the biggest speaker of untruths as ever was born, whoever the mother
was who got you.  Put that in your pipe, Mr Trundle, and smoke it."

This most insulting of all remarks increased tenfold the boatswain's rage, and the two would
have come instantly to fisticuffs, but that, fortunately, at that moment the order to pipe
to dinner was given.  The boatswain's call came into requisition, and all hands, except the
watch on deck, were soon busily employed in discussing the contents of a cask of beef, boasting
of but a small proportion of fat or lean and a considerable superfluity of bone.

Now it happened to be Dicky Sharpe's watch on deck while dinner was going on, and at one o'clock,
being relieved, he came down to his own repast, which he was not long in discussing.  While
he sat turning a large rib-bone over and over, in disgust at finding so little meat on it,
and waiting for the boy to clear away, the boatswain, whose cabin could be seen from the berth
on the larboard side, roused up from a nap, and began to contemplate his visage in his glass,
to discover if he looked in any way as if he had been asleep.  It must be understood that it
is contrary to the principles of a boatswain worthy of the rank ever to require sleep.  He
would consider himself disgraced in the eyes of the whole crew, if he were caught taking a
wink.  A regular-built boatswain is often on deck from half-past three in the morning till
eleven at night, and should it be bad weather, or from any other cause, frequently two or three
times during the night also; and as to his cabin, he merely looks in occasionally and keeps
his donnage there.

Now, to do him justice, Trundle was a thoroughgoing boatswain.  While he was rubbing his eyes,
to get the sleepiness out of them, pulling up his shirt-collar, and brushing back his hair,
the demon of mischief put a thought into Dicky Sharpe's head.  To conceive, with Dicky, was
to execute.  I happened to be descending from the main-deck, when I saw Dicky standing at the
door of the berth, with the rib-bone in hand, and a wicked look in his eye.  I instantly perceived
the state of affairs, and divined what was to happen.  Away flew the bone across the deck,
with so good an aim that it made a cannon against the boatswain's nose and his glass, breaking
both one and the other with a loud crash, which was followed by a volley of oaths.  The steerage
of a frigate, even when a sunbeam penetrates through a scuttle, is not over and above brilliantly
lighted; and on the present occasion a purser's dip here and there just enabled us to grope
our way about the deck.  Now it happened that the carpenter at that moment was coming out of
his berth, which was nearly opposite the boatswain's.

"Oh! you blessed Chissel; I saw you heave that, you aggrawating so-and-so," exclaimed Trundle,
in a towering rage, exhibiting his bleeding nose and broken glass.

"I never hove anything, and that you know, you so-and-so," answered Ichabod, drawing near to
his adversary.

"You did, though, you so-and-so," cried Trundle, doubling his fist, and dealing Ichabod a hit
on the eye which almost stove it in.

The blow was given back, and returned with interest, with expressions not fit for ears polite,
till the noses of both heroes were streaming with blood, and their voices were hallooing away
at the highest pitch. Dicky was rubbing his hands in high glee at the successful result of
his experiment, when the captain, aroused by the hubbub, rang his bell to know what was the
matter.  This sound, like that of Oberon's magic horn, instantly paralysed the combatants;
and the sentry having put his head into the cabin, and made some report which apparently satisfied
the skipper, the two warriors, like a couple of lions growling defiance at each other, retired
to their berths, to staunch their bleeding wounds, and wash away the stains of the fight from
their faces.

Here the first thing which met the eye of the boatswain, as he stooped to pick up the fragments
of his glass, was the missile which had inflicted the injury.  Now, as the officers generally
choose the long ribs of beef for roasting, for which they pay one pound in six for the good
of the ship's company, and the boatswain had actually seen the carpenter's servant carrying
a piece of rib-beef for his master's dinner, he felt perfectly satisfied who had thrown the
bone.  Seizing it, therefore, in his hand, with the fragments of his glass, and his nose still
bleeding, he rushed on deck, and halted, quivering with rage, on the quarter-deck, in presence
of the first-lieutenant.

"By Jupiter, what a wigging I shall get," whispered Dicky, in a terrible funk.  "I say, D'Arcy,
my boy, don't 'peach, though."

I cocked my eye, and, pointing to the masthead,--"Six hours a day for the next week, eh!--pleasant,
Dicky," I answered.

Master Dicky dared not show his face, lest his consciousness of guilt might betray itself;
for, though unable to resist doing a piece of mischief when the temptation came in his way,
he had not got the brazen front of a hardened sinner.  I also, anxious as I was to learn the
result of the trial, was afraid of showing too great an interest in it, lest suspicion should
fall on me, and therefore walked the quarter-deck at a respectful distance, picking up what
information I could on the way.

"What is this you have to complain of, Mr Trundle?" asked the first-lieutenant, as he stood
at the capstern-head, with the enraged boatswain before him.

"Why, sir, as I was a-cleaning myself just now in my cabin, a-thinking no harm of nobody, Mr
Ichabod Chissel, the carpenter of this here ship, sir, and my brother officer, thinks fit to
heave this here rib-bone right across the steerage against my nose and my glass, and breaks
both on 'em.  If that ain't enough to aggrawate and perwoke and--and-- and--(he stopped for
a word) flabbergast any one, I don't know what is, sir, you'll allow."

"Very much so, I grant," observed Mr Du Pre, taking the bone between his fingers and holding
it behind his back.  "Send Mr Chissel here."

The carpenter soon made his appearance.

"Pray, Mr Chissel, what part of the meat had you for your dinner, to-day?" asked Mr Du Pre.

"The tail, sir," said the carpenter.

"What became of the bone after dinner?" asked the first-lieutenant.

"The boy cleared it away with the rest of the things, sir," was the answer.

"Let the boy be sent for," said Mr Du Pre.

Bobby Smudge soon came rolling along, hitching up his trousers as he approached the capstern.

There was a wicked look in the young rascal's eye, which made me suspect he knew all about
the matter.  He was the most complete little Pickle in the ship, and was continually getting
punished, and most deservedly too, by his master.  The very day before, the carpenter had reported
him, and he had got eleven finnams on the hand for having, in conveying Mr Chissel's grog from
the tub to his cabin, being detected in the very act of taking a hatchway nip--the said hatchway
nip, let it be understood, being a sip snatched furtively by the bearer of a glass of grog
on the ladder descending from the main to the lower deck.  A finnam, I must also explain, is
a blow inflicted on the hand, with a cane generally, by the master-at-arms or the ship's corporal.
To the said finnams poor Bobby Smudge's black paws were well accustomed.

"Boy, what was done with the bone after your master's dinner?" asked Mr Du Pre, in a severe tone.

"I'm sure I don't know, sir," replied Bobby Smudge, in a long drawl, worthy of a London professional
street-beggar.

"Should you know it again if you saw it?" asked the first-lieutenant.

"Oh yes, sir; I'm sure I should," replied Master Smudge, brightening up and looking the picture
of innocent simplicity.

"Well, my boy, what do you say to this?" said Mr Du Pre, producing the bone from behind his back.

All eyes turned towards Bobby Smudge: the carpenter's fate hung on his decision.  The young
monkey felt his importance, and determined to exert it.  Chissel knew it was the very sort
of bone he had scraped not an hour before.  Bobby took it, and, turning it round, examined
it narrowly.

"Oh yes, sir; I'll swear to it, that I will," he exclaimed, holding up his blistered hand behind
his back so that the carpenter might observe it.  "As I was a-trying to get my dinner off it,
I notched it with my knife, I knowed I did, 'cause there was so little meat on it."

"Oh, you wretched young liar," muttered the carpenter, for he dared not speak aloud; "won't
I pay you off, that's all?"

The boy heard him, and gave a grin of defiance.

"Mr Chissel, go to your cabin, and consider yourself under arrest," said the first-lieutenant;
"I must report this affair to the captain. The discipline of the ship cannot be thus trifled
with; and officers especially, who ought to know better, must not be allowed to set the men
so bad an example with impunity."

Saying this, Mr Du Pre resumed his walk on the quarter-deck, and I hurried down to report what
had occurred, to my chum Dicky.  At first he was highly delighted at having escaped detection.

"Stop a bit, Dicky," said I; "I don't think you are quite out of the fire yet.  It will never
do to let the carpenter be disrated or dismissed the ship for conduct of which he is innocent.
The truth must come out; and, to my mind, honesty is the best policy."

"Well, but don't you see, D'Arcy, I shall get mast-headed and have my leave stopped, and I
don't know what else--all for shying a bone across the steerage," argued Dicky.  "What business
had the boatswain and carpenter to hit each other, I should like to know.  If that stupid Trundle
had taken the joke in good part, there wouldn't have been all this row."

I laughed outright at Master Richard's style of reasoning.

"That argument won't stand good with the skipper," said I.  "Now, come, let me do the only
thing which can set matters to rights; because it is the right thing.  I'm a bit of a favourite
with Mr Du Pre, I suspect; and I'll go up to him at once, and tell him the truth.  If anything
can get you off, that will; and if the affair reaches the ears of the captain, there will be
a very serious row, I'm certain."

At last Dicky consented to my plan, and without waiting to let him change his mind, I went
on deck, where I found the first-lieutenant.

"I've got something to say about that beef-bone, sir," I began.

"What's that, Mr D'Arcy," he exclaimed, turning sharp round.  "When am I to hear the last of
that beef-bone?"

"Why, sir, it wasn't the carpenter threw it, but one of the midshipmen; he couldn't help it,
though.  No one could, I'm sure," I rapped out.

"Why, Master D'Arcy, I verily believe you're the culprit," he exclaimed, looking at me steadfastly.

I detected, however, a smile in his eye, which showed that his anger was not very serious;
so I at once told him exactly how the matter had occurred, and that Dicky had begged me to
come and confess the truth and intercede for him.  Master Sharpe was therefore sent for; and
having been severely reprimanded, was told that as soon as we got into harbour his leave would
be stopped, and was then ordered to the masthead for a couple of hours, to sit there instead
of on the stool of repentance. The carpenter was released from arrest, on condition that he
should keep the peace.  The boatswain's nose mended in the course of a few days; and though
reminded of the outrage every time he attempted to shave before his broken bit of looking-glass,
he and Chissel soon patched up their quarrel and resumed their former intimacy.  The person
who fared worst was Bobby Smudge, who, never a favourite with his master, now obtained a double
allowance of finnams, and a sly rope's-ending whenever opportunities offered.  Bobby began
to discover that revenge, though sweet, may recoil on the head of the avenger, and become very
bitter. More ultimately came out of the beef-bone affair.

CHAPTER TWELVE.

REACH THE MEDITERRANEAN--MALTA--A RIDE ON SHORE--A BALL--A HEROINE--OUR PARTNERS--MR. NIP AND
HIS PARTNER--AN ODD EGG HATCHED--ADAM STALLMAN'S ADVICE--THE RIGHT THING THE BEST THING.

Nothing of importance occurred that I remember during our passage across the Bay of Biscay.
We had the usual heavy swells (though I have found it as level as a fish-pond), a stiffish
breeze for a day or so, which gave us a cheery shove on our way, and light and variable winds
and calms, which latter let us roll till our yard-arms almost touched the water, and effectually
turned the landsmen inside out.  Ten days after leaving Plymouth, we were in the latitude of
Lisbon.  It was early morning, and the land we were approaching was shrouded to common eyes
by a soft silvery haze, which allowed only a circle of blue sea to be perceived round the ship,
and a patch of about the same size of clear sky overhead.  On the larboard bow was perceived
a darker mass of mist, which after some time resolved itself into the well-known form of the
Rock of Lisbon.  The wind being light and variable, we drew very gradually inshore, till the
mist suddenly lifting, as if at the command of a magician, disclosed to us the splendid and
fantastic scenery of those rocky heights, as they rose proudly from the glittering ocean, which
was dotted with numerous sails of fishing-boats and coasters, and here and there the canvas
of some loftier merchantmen, making for the mouth of the Tagus.  On the lower land, to the
north of the Rock, was seen the royal palace of Mafra--a curious huge pile, imposing from its
height and the large extent of ground it covers.  I do not, however, intend to bother my readers
with accounts of places and scenery, which they may find much better described in numberless
books of voyages and travels.  The wind freshening and coming fair, we continued our course,
and, passing the Capes of Ortegal and Finisterre on the second day after leaving the Rock,
were off Cape Saint Vincent, immortalised in naval memories by Sir John Jervis' great action,
and since then, by the way, by a very pretty bit of fighting under Charlie Napier, when he
took possession of Don Miguel's fleet with one half its size.  Cape Trafalgar next came in
sight, and was eagerly viewed by all hands, for, often as one may gaze on its dark blue cliffs,
the deep interest they inspire can never fail; one is reminded that in their neighbourhood
the glorious navy of England, under the greatest of its chiefs, secured the freedom of the
world, and struck the blow which stopped the victor of continental Europe in his wild career
of conquest.  Peace to the names of England's gallant defenders, who died for their country
off Trafalgar's Cape! and sacred be the memory of the immortal Nelson, our meteor-flag of victory!--But,
little Neil D'Arcy, where are you steering for?  Has the sight of Trafalgar made you fancy
you can do a bit of fine writing?  Just get back, boy, to your usual style, and leave such
attempts to the pens of novelists and travellers.

It was near nightfall when we made the Rock of Gibraltar; and as we passed through the Straits
when I was snug below in my hammock, my journal contains no description of that wonderful fortress.
When the morning dawned, the high mountains of Spain were just visible in the horizon; and
the next land we sighted was the coast of Barbary, somewhere to the westward of Tunis.  Six
days after that we were in sight of Sicily, when, after hauling off the coast, a gale sprung
up, and such thick and cloudy weather came on, that we could take no observations.  The ship
was therefore hove-to; and while sail was being taken off her I got an ugly fall, which laid
me up in my hammock for several days.  During my illness, Dicky Sharpe was constantly with
me, whenever he was off duty, and we became greater friends than ever.

"Do you know, D'Arcy, I am really very much obliged to you for having got me so well out of
that scrape with the boatswain and the beef-bone!" he said to me in a tone of confidence one
day, after we had reached Valetta harbour.  "I have not ventured to ask Mr Du Pre leave to
go on shore.  Do you think he would give it me?"

"I rather think not, Dicky," said I.  "Don't say a word about it for some time to come, and
then you can begin to look dull and melancholy, and to pine for the shore; and perhaps his
heart will soften with compassion, and he will give you leave."

"Capital advice!  Won't I look melancholy, that's all, when the time comes?" he exclaimed.
"How soon ought I to begin?"

"Not till I'm well and can go on shore to look after you," I answered.

The fact was, I wanted Dicky's company when I could go on shore myself, which the surgeon told
me I might do in a few days; and when asking for myself, I intended putting in a word with
Mr Du Pre in his favour. When I crawled on deck I found the ship had taken up her moorings
in Dockyard Creek, a branch of the Grand Harbour, from which it runs at right angles, on the
opposite side to Valetta.  Most deservedly is the Grand Harbour so called, for in beauty, size,
and security it is unsurpassed; and it is singular that it should exist in an island of dimensions
so limited.  Malta has an individuality of its own.  It is like no other spot in the world;
and when one looks at the magnificent lines of batteries, bristling with cannon, and the mass
of churches, monasteries, and houses, which towers above them, one can scarcely believe that
the whole has been hewn out of the solid rock of which the island is composed.  But I am not
going to describe Malta.  In three or four days more I was quite well, and having succeeded
in obtaining leave from Mr Du Pre for Dicky to accompany me on shore, we landed at the Nix
Mangiare steps, and took our way through the town.  The first thing we did was to hire horses
to take a ride into the country.  Both of us could stick on pretty well (what midshipman cannot?);
but as for science, we had none of it.  At first we trotted on gaily enough, and then our horses
broke into a gallop, which we enjoyed very much.

"Capital goers, these!" exclaimed Dicky.  "If they keep up at this rate, I vote we take a regular
circuit of the island."

"Faith, then, I'm ready for that same," said I; and on we galloped.

So delighted were we at the way our steeds went, that we sat the saddles and held our reins
rather loosely.  On a sudden they both came to a full stop, and up simultaneously went their
heels in the air.  Over their heads we flew, and alighted some dozen yards off; while the well-trained
beasts, with neighs of derision which were truly provoking, galloped back to their stables,
leaving us to find our way into Valetta as best we could.  By-the-bye, the horse-master had
taken very good care to get paid first.  Dicky sat up on the ground and rubbed his head, to
discover if it was broken.  I followed his example, and finding no bones dislocated, my spirits
rose again.  We looked at each other, when there appeared something so ludicrously forlorn
in the expression of our countenances, that we both burst out into fits of laughter.  We indulged
in our mirth for some time, and then got up and commenced our walk back into the town.  Fortunately
we had not got any very great distance from the walls, so the walk was easy of accomplishment.
We had proceeded about a mile or so, when two midshipmen hove in sight, galloping along in
high glee on the very horses which had just disburdened themselves of us.

"Hillo! you fellows, those are our horses," sang out Dicky; "just get off now, will you?"

But he might as well have called a whirlwind to halt; for helter-skelter, past us they dashed,
without minding us a bit.  Dicky was highly indignant.

"Well, I never was so treated in my life!" he exclaimed.

"Wait a bit," said I; for I had a shrewd suspicion that the horses would play their present
riders the same trick they had served us; and sure enough, in about ten minutes, we heard a
clattering of hoofs behind us, and, looking round, saw the knowing old steeds coming, galloping
along by themselves.

"Now, now's the time, Dicky," I sang out.  "You catch one and I'll catch the other, and we'll
still have our ride out.  The horses are ours, there's no doubt of it."

Sooner said, however, than done.  The beasts came on very steadily till they got close to us,
and then they began rearing and frisking, and kicking up such a dust that it was impossible
to catch hold of their bridles; and, it must be confessed, we were glad enough to get out of
their way without being trampled over.

"Where are the brutes?"  I asked, feeling very foolish.

"Where are they?" echoed Dicky, looking the same.  "There they go, as steady as cart-horses.
Hang it! they knew we were midshipmen."

Our only satisfaction was to see a third set of riders come out on the same brutes, and to
be able to laugh in our sleeves, while we wished them a pleasant ride across the island.  What
became of all the riders I don't know.  The steeds again passed us just before we reached the
gates.--Three or four evenings after this, the officers of the ship were asked to a ball, and
the captain took Dicky and me.  We did not know anybody, and were hard up for partners, till
the skipper introduced us each to a Maltese girl.  They were both very short, though that was
a fault on the right side; but they were also very fat and very dark, and could not speak a
word of English; and one squinted, and the other had lost an eye.  Their noses turned up, and
their lips were thick and large.  They were not beauties, certainly; but we danced with them
all the evening, changing every now and then for variety, though I had to look hard to make
out which was my original partner, as I only knew them apart by the defect in their eyes. 
Dicky asked me if I didn't think them as pretty as Alice Marlow, at which I very nearly knocked
him down in the ball-room.  But he appeased me by assuring me with the greatest gravity, that
he admired the squinting one very much, and should certainly, if he were older, make her Mrs
Sharpe.  He did nothing but talk about her for two days afterwards; and, as we did not know
her real name, we called her Miss Smaitch, which, though not euphonious, did as well as any
other.  On the third day he dined with an officer in the dockyard who had a numerous family
of daughters, to one of whom he transferred his affections, and they remained steady for nearly
a week, about which time we left Malta.  To return to the ball, however.  When Dicky and I
were not dancing, we amused ourselves by watching what was going forward, especially in observing
the occupations of our superior officers.

"I say, D'Arcy, who is that young lady Mr Vernon is dancing with, I wonder?  She is a stunner,
isn't she, my boy?" said Dicky, sidling up to me, and pointing with his chin towards a very
beautiful girl, to whom our second lieutenant had just then given his hand, and was leading
up to form a quadrille.

There was a roseate blush on her cheek, and a brightening glance in her eye, as she looked
up at the gallant officer, which betokened more than ordinary satisfaction at being chosen
his partner in the dance.  The colour increased, and the eyes brightened still more, while
a smile played round her ruby lips, as Mr Vernon uttered, in a low tone, a few words in her ear.

Dicky observed it.  "I twig something there," he whispered.  "What will you bet me, D'Arcy,
that Mr Vernon doesn't splice that same young lady, now?  It's a regular case, depend on it.
I thought there was something going on, he's been so constantly on shore since we came into
harbour. He's a right good fellow, and I wish him joy."

"I hope, if it is a case, that he'll not marry till the ship is out of commission," I remarked.
"I should be sorry indeed to lose him.  But we must not talk so loud, or we shall be overheard."

Just then the captain came up, to make Dicky dance with Miss Smaitch.  I was left alone to
watch proceedings.  From what I saw, I was fully convinced that Master Sharpe's conjectures
were well founded, and that Mr Vernon and the fair unknown were certainly deeply in love with
each other, and most probably engaged.  She certainly, as far as I could judge from mere appearance,
was well worthy the love of any man.  Young as I was, she made a deep impression on me; and
even at this distance of time I can bring her Hebe-like figure before me, with almost the vivid
colours of reality.  She was not tall, but her figure was full of grace and life.  Her complexion
was beautifully fair; her eyes were blue; and the expression of her countenance was soft, feminine,
and full of sweetness; at the same time, the arch smile which occasionally played over it showed
that she was not destitute of sense and wit.

While I was looking on, I was joined by Adam Stallman, one of the senior mates of the Harold.
I have slightly mentioned him before.  He was of a somewhat grave and taciturn disposition,
but generous and kind, and as brave and honourable as any knight sans peur et sans reproche.
He read much and thought more, and was ready to give good advice when asked for it; but innate
modesty prevented him from volunteering to afford it, except on rare occasions, when he saw
that it was absolutely necessary to preserve a person from following a path which might lead
him to ruin.

Dicky and I were favourites of his; for though he kept us in order, and more than once had
inflicted a sound cobbing on my chum (certainly well deserved), he was very kind to us.

"I say, Stallman, can you tell me who the young lady is with whom Mr Vernon is dancing?" said I.

"Why do you ask?" he inquired.

"Because she is very beautiful," I replied.

The colour heightened on his generally impassive, well-bronzed features, as his eye fell on
the lady whom I indicated.  "Yes," he answered, with a firm voice, "that lady is Miss Blanche
Norman, the daughter of Major Norman, who is out here for his health.  But wouldn't you like
to dance, youngster?"

I told him that I had been engaged by the captain to dance with Miss Smaitch Number 2.

"Well, come to me if you want a partner," he said, and moved on.

I saw him soon afterwards go up and shake hands with Miss Norman.  His lip momentarily quivered,
I saw; but his countenance otherwise remained firm.  She received him as an old acquaintance,
and seemed glad to see him.

I took it into my head that Adam was in love with her, or had been; but that, as he had little
besides his pay to depend on, he could not indulge a dream of marrying.  From what I afterwards
learned, I was right in this conjecture.  Poor fellow! he had loved her well and deeply, but
he had never told his love.  She might have suspected his attachment, but with the tact and
delicacy of a right-minded woman, she did not allow him to discover that she did so, but endeavoured,
by the frank kindness of her words and manner, to take away the bitterness from the wound she
was inflicting.  I do not mean to say, however, that at the time I knew this, but I made a
pretty shrewd guess at the truth.

In a little time Dicky came hurrying up to me with a look full of importance.

"I say, D'Arcy, I've found out all about it.  I heard our medico tell Old Nip (meaning the
purser) that Vernon proposed a few days ago to Miss Norman, and was accepted; so they are regularly
engaged, you know, and he has a right to dance with her as often as he likes.  What fun for
him!  I know that I should like to be in his place.  That's her father: not the tall man with
the white hair, but the shorter one next him.  He looks almost too young to be her father,
doesn't he?  Perhaps his being ill makes him look so.  They are soon going home; but they are
to stop at Gibraltar, so the doctor says."

"I am afraid you've been an eavesdropper, Dicky, to hear all this," I observed; "and that,
you know, is not a very creditable character."

"I know that as well as you do," he answered; "but I could not help myself, for I was jammed
up in the refreshment room between two fat Maltese ladies and the supper-table, and I couldn't
have moved without the risk of staving in their sides with my elbows.  Old Nip and the medico
were on the other side of them, sipping their negus, and didn't see me."

"That's all right; and small blame to you, Dicky," said I.  "Well, I heartily wish Mr Vernon
joy; and if his love don't run smooth, and he ever wants a helping hand, I only hope he'll
let me give it him."

"There's nothing I should like better too, independent of my regard for Mr Vernon," observed
Dicky, pompously.

I remember that we long discussed the probabilities of Mr Vernon's requiring our services;
and we came to the conclusion that, though we should be delighted to help him to obtain the
lady's hand in any way he might require, in principle the running away with a lady was decidedly
wrong.

The subject was changed by our seeing the purser lead out one of the fat ladies, behind whom
Dicky had been hid, to attempt a waltz.  Never was there a more extraordinary performance.
Neither of them had a notion of the dance.  They floundered and flolloped, and twisted and
turned, and tumbled against all the other couples, till they spread consternation around; and
at last found themselves the sole performers in the room. As poor Nip went twirling round,
much in the way that a child's humming-top does when it begins to stagger preparatory to stopping,
he perceived a suppressed laugh on the lips and in the eyes of the surrounding spectators;
and suspecting that he might be the cause of it, gave a convulsive gripe at his partner's waist,
or at the part where her waist should be, in order to bring himself to an anchor.  The effort
was too great for his powers, and both he and she came with a run to the floor, close to where
Dicky and I were standing.  There they kicked and struggled in vain efforts to rise.  At this
Dicky could no longer contain himself, but, regardless of the purser's anger, burst into a
loud fit of laughter.  However, we ran forward to do our best to get the hero and heroine on
their legs again, though we were too much convulsed to be of much assistance.

"I'll pay you off for this, Master Sharpe," whispered the purser, looking up fiercely.

"I couldn't help it, indeed I could not," answered Dicky in an apologetic tone; "you did look
so funny."

"I'll wring your ears off, you young puppy," cried poor Nip, rising and shaking himself, in
his rage forgetting the fair sharer of his misfortune.

"Look to your partner, Mr Cheesnip," said Captain Poynder, coming up, and guessing the cause
of the purser's anger.  "Here, Sharpe, help me to put the lady on her legs."

By some pulling and hauling, and by others shoving behind, we got Madame Cheesnip, as we ever
after called her, into a perpendicular position; but she was too much shaken to dance again,
especially with the cause of her misfortune.  Indeed, for the rest of the evening the ladies
fought very shy of poor Nip, and we took good care to keep out of his way. Dicky and I stayed
to the last, spending our time very satisfactorily between our two partners and the refreshment
and supper rooms; and I am afraid to mention the vast amount of sandwiches, cakes, and bonbons
which Dicky consumed, washed down by cups of coffee, lemonade, and negus.  At length, when
nearly everybody was gone, with the exception of a few other midshipmen, and the musicians
could no longer wag their bows, we deemed it time also to retire.  We had got leave to stay
on shore, but it just then occurred to us that we had forgot to order our beds.

"Never mind," said Dicky; "we are certain to find them at some hotel or other."

As we were putting on our cloaks, we found that there were five or six more midshipmen belonging
to other ships in the same predicament as ourselves.  To get beds at that hour of the morning,
we discovered was not so easy, as all the Hotels, from some cause or other, were full.  We
hunted about for some time, and were proposing trying to get on board our ships,--though Dicky
Sharpe declared he should take up his berth inside one of the casks generally found down on
the shore of the harbour, with their heads off; but we advised him not, as they are the usual
abode of the beggar boys who infest Nix Mangiare stairs, and would be apt to have more inhabitants
than one,--when some of the party who were on ahead, shouted out that they had found as cozy
a place of shelter as they could wish.  We were in the upper part of the town, which, as most
of my readers probably know, is at a considerable elevation above the water.  As it had lately
begun to rain hard, and we had no desire to wander farther, there was a general rush made to
the front.  The cozy place to which we were invited, turned out to be an old family coach,
which was standing at the top of a narrow lane intended to be used only by foot passengers.
However, it was a place where some midshipmen had lately amused themselves by galloping up
and down; but, to prevent such an exhibition of horsemanship, a guard had been stationed at
the bottom, to prevent any similar attempt for the future. But to return to the coach.  The
first comers had taken possession, and one after the other the rest scrambled in, till by the
time Dicky and I, who were rather behind, got up, it could hold no more: at all events those
inside decided that such was the case.  This was not what we had bargained for, and neither
of us was inclined to yield his right to a share and shelter without a struggle.  The doors
had not been shut; and while Dicky boarded on one side, I tried to get in on the other.  Wet
caps and fists were dashed in our faces, but, undaunted, we strove on. I had actually forced
my way in, and was stretching over my hand to my chum, who had got his feet on the step, when
some one exclaimed, "By Jupiter! she is under way."  And, sure enough, our struggles had set
the lumbering old vehicle moving.  On it went, rolling and rattling down the steep pathway,
which we had totally forgotten.  To get out was impossible, without the certainty almost of
knocking our heads against the walls of the houses on either side, of being jammed between
them and the wheels, or of being run over.  We hauled Dicky in to save his life, and away we
all went together, the vehicle every moment increasing its velocity.  The path, from sloping
from each side to the centre, kept her on a straight course, or we should have brought up against
some steps, or a kerbstone, and been saved from the approaching catastrophe.  But no such good
fortune was in store for us.  Rolling and rattling, and screeching and creaking, and bumping
and thumping, downward went the carriage, we inside keeping up a chorus of shouts and shrieks.
Most of us laughed; but one or two, who were strangers to the place, were in a mortal fright,
not knowing whether we might find a precipice at the bottom, and be shot over, perhaps into
the sea.  Very soon, too, we reached some steps, down which we went, of course faster than
ever, with terrific bounds, till the cranky old vehicle could no longer stand the unusual movement.

"Who goes there?" shouted the sentry at the bottom of the steps.

"Turn out the guard," echoed the sergeant, not able to make out the cause of the unusual commotion.
Just then the carriage split asunder, and sent us flying, with swords, dirks, and hats, in
different directions.

"Arrah, was ever such an egg hatched before?" exclaimed the sergeant, who was an Irishman,
running up and seizing hold of the first he could lay hands on.  "Come, young gentlemen, I
must march you off to the guard-house."

"March the coach off, if you please, sergeant; but we are innocent, like the new-hatched babes
which we are," cried Dicky Sharpe, who was one of those in custody.  "The order is against
people on horseback coming this way: we hadn't even horses to our egg-shell."

The sergeant, amused by the way Dicky took up his joke, and seeing there was no use detaining
us, consented not to molest us.  We then invited ourselves to go to the guard-house, where
we passed the remainder of the night, with our cigars to comfort us.  I am sorry to say that
we did not go back to try and find the owners of the coach, that we might apologise to them
for having inflicted so much injury on their property, which we ought certainly to have done.
We none of us thought anything more would come of it.

"Oh!" said Dicky Sharpe, rubbing his hands, "the owners will think that the old coach grew
tired of waiting all by itself, so ran down the hill to get warm."

We resolved therefore to say nothing about the matter.  The next day, while it was my watch
on deck, we were ordered to send a boat to bring off a party of ladies from the shore.  Dicky,
who belonged to the boat, went in her.  As they reached the ship, and the sides were manned
to receive them, I saw that Mr Vernon was in the boat, accompanied by Major and Miss Norman,
and several other ladies and gentlemen.  The care with which he handed her up the side, and
the attention he paid her, as he showed the party round the decks, convinced me still further
that what I had heard last night was the truth.  Adam Stallman accompanied them; he was grave,
but kind and courteous as usual, and seemed to take great pains to answer all the questions,
some of them not a little ridiculous, which were put to him.  Mr Vernon invited him to join
the luncheon-party in the ward-room, so I did not see what followed.

As soon as the boat was hoisted in, Dicky came up to me.

"I say, D'Arcy," said he, "it's all blown, and we are in for it, I guess."

"What's blown?"  I asked.

"Why, the coach affair, of course," he replied.  "As we were coming off they were all talking
of it, and Mr Vernon said he was very sure I was one of the chickens, so there was no use denying
it.  If it gets to the captain's ears we shall have our leave stopped, and I shan't have a
chance of seeing little Miss Smaitch again."

We consulted long what was to be done, but could come to no decision on the subject.  After
the guests were gone, Adam Stallman came down into the berth.

"Youngsters," said he, "I suspect both of you were engaged in the destruction of the coach
last night.  Is it not so?"

We confessed the truth, and told him exactly how it happened.

"Did you endeavour to find out the owners, and to make them all the amends in your power for
the mischief you had committed?"

We owned that we had not.

"You neglected your bounden duty, then," he observed.  "You should recollect that every act
of meanness committed by a British officer brings discredit on the cloth.  When a man is guilty
of a fault, he but increases it if he neglects to make reparation for it.  Now, if I get leave
for you to accompany me on shore, will you follow my directions?" We promised we would.  "Well
then, we will find out the owners of the coach, and you must go and tell them that you are
very sorry for the mischief you committed, explain how it happened, and beg their pardon. I
do not think you can exactly offer to give them a new coach; nor would they expect it, probably."

At this Dicky looked very blue; but he could not escape from his promise, and he soon mustered
a sufficiency of moral courage to carry him through the work.  I was, I own, very glad in being
thus supported in doing what I felt was right.

In the afternoon we went on shore, and set off at once to the scene of our adventure: The fragments
of the coach had been removed.  Climbing up the lane, we made inquiries at the top--at least
Adam, who spoke Italian, did--for any family from the country who might be stopping at a house
near at hand.

"Oh, you want Signora Faranelli, whose coach was run away with last night by some ragamuffins!"
said the master of a small shop where we inquired.

"The same," answered Adam.

"She and her daughters are staying with Signor Bianconi at the big house, there."

Adam led us to the house indicated.

"I feel in a great funk," whispered Dicky; "don't you, D'Arcy?  What shall we say?"

"The truth," said I.  "It's the only thing we can say.  Tell our tale from beginning to end."

We sent in our cards, with a message to say that two naval officers wished to speak to Signora
Faranelli.  Adam said he should wait outside for us, and told us to make haste.  We were speedily
requested to walk upstairs, and were ushered into a room full of company, when a very pleasing,
kind-looking lady came forward and inquired to what cause she was indebted for the honour of
our visit.  As I knew Sharpe would make some mistake, I had offered to act as spokesman, and
at once told the whole of our tale.

"Oh, it was very naughty in the carriage to run away with you," she replied, in a good-natured
tone, in somewhat broken English; "and it was very stupid in my servants to leave it standing
on the top of the hill, though but natural that you, on a rainy night, should take shelter
within it.  I had been told that it was purposely sent rolling down the hill by a party of
tipsy naval officers, and I was resolved to complain of them; but the frank way in which you
have come forward to explain the matter removes all disagreeable feeling on the subject, and
I am very happy to make your acquaintance."

Dicky Sharpe drew a deep breath, as if some dire forebodings were removed.  I don't know what
he thought was going to happen to us.

"I must now introduce you to Signor Bianconi, and I am sure he will have great pleasure if
you can remain and spend the evening with us," continued the lady.  "I shall hope also to see
you shortly at my house in the country."

We thanked Signora Faranelli very much for her kindness, but explained that we had a friend
waiting outside for us, who had, however, nothing to do with the carriage affair.  Of course
Adam Stallman was requested to come in, and, to my surprise, he consented.

"I like what you tell me of the people, D'Arcy, and their acquaintance must be worth making,"
he observed.

We spent a very pleasant evening, got on board in good time, and the next day, meeting some
of our companions in the carriage adventure, were able to relieve their minds from certain
apprehensions of the consequences, and to tell them of the satisfactory results; nor did we
fail to give Stallman credit, which was his due.  They, the rogues, were now in a great hurry
to go and apologise also; but their impudence, for a wonder, would not carry them up to the
point for action.

Whenever we put into Malta, Dicky and I did not fail to call on Signora Faranelli and Signor
Bianconi: and many a happy day we spent at their houses.  Often and often I have since seen
that, by acting with truthfulness and candour, very much inconvenience, and even misery and
suffering, might have been saved, and much good obtained.  There is a golden rule I must urge
on my young friends ever to follow: Do right, and leave the result to God.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN.

SAILING OF THE ARIADNE--CHISSEL'S CRUELTY--LOSS OF BOBBY SMUDGE--A HEAVY SQUALL--BOBBY SMUDGE'S
GHOST--REFLECTIONS THEREON.

Shortly after this we were ordered to get ready for sea, though our destination was not known.
Before we sailed, Major and Miss Norman again came on board, and we heard that, his health
being re-established, they had taken their passage in a brig bound for England.  We were very
sorry for this, as we feared that Mr Vernon would be wishing to go home to marry, and that
we should thus lose him.  The next morning the Ariadne, the brig in question, a remarkably
fine vessel for an English merchantman of those days (for a more detestable fleet of tubs were
never sent afloat), was seen to be getting up her anchor and loosing topsails.  Mr Vernon had
gone away in the second gig at an early hour; and she was now alongside, while he, with his
boat's crew, were on board.  We could see him standing with Miss Blanche Norman on deck.

"More gallant knight or fairer lady never trod this mortal world," quoth our poetical Third,
as he took a sight at his brother officer through his spy-glass.

I heard a deep sigh, and looking round, I saw Adam Stallman standing near me; but his countenance
was unmoved, and turning on his heel, he continued pacing the deck as if he had been an unconcerned
spectator of what was going on.  The anchor of the brig was run up to the bows and catted;
sail after sail was dropped from its brails and quickly sheeted home; and under a wide spread
of canvas the gallant craft came standing out of the harbour.

"A prosperous voyage to you," shouted Mr Du Pre through his speaking-trumpet, as she passed us.

He and all the officers took off their caps.  Major Norman and the master of the Ariadne did
the same, and Miss Norman bowed.  It was a trying moment for her, poor girl; for in a few minutes
he whom she had so lately learned to love must quit her for an indefinite period, to buffet
the rude winds and waves of the ocean, or, perchance, to endure the dangers of the fight,--so
said our third lieutenant, or something to that effect.  We watched the Ariadne, as long as
her topsails appeared above the horizon, with no little interest, for Mr Vernon's sake.  He
at length came back, after a long pull, and was for several days somewhat grave and abstracted
at times; but that mood wore off by degrees, and there was a buoyancy in his step, and a light
in his eye, which showed that he loved, and was conscious of being beloved in return.

It would be impossible to give an account of all the minor adventures I met with in the Mediterranean;
but such as I can I will narrate. Captain Poynder was very anxious to make his midshipmen gentlemen,
and to give us a knowledge of polite literature, as well as to instruct us in navigation and
seamanship.  Accordingly he got a Maltese on board to teach us Italian.  Poor Signor Mezzi
had never, I believe, been at sea before; and though we tried to make him comfortable, and
Dicky Sharpe generally resisted the temptation to play him tricks--for he was certain to be
cobbed by the oldsters if he did,--I fear that his life was far from a pleasant one.  When
we had completed our refit, and had stowed away a supply of provisions, despatches were sent
on board, and we were ordered to proceed to Tripoli and Tunis.  We made a very quick passage
to Tripoli, which is the capital of the most easterly of the Barbary States.  It boasts of
a castle and port, and has a large harbour, defended by a moat and batteries, capable of containing
a considerable fleet of merchantmen.  We remained there a very short time, so I do not remember
much about the place, nor exactly for what purpose we went there.  There is another town of
the same name in Syria, and they are often confounded.  Leaving Tripoli, we made sail for Tunis.
It was on this trip, if I remember rightly, that a circumstance occurred, which for some time
appeared wrapped in mystery.  The adventure of the rib-bone, in which Dicky Sharpe played so
prominent a part, will be remembered.  Since that time, Ichabod Chissel, the carpenter, had
led his unfortunate boy, Bobby Smudge, a very dog's life.  I fully believe, however, that Master
Smudge richly deserved every rope's-ending he got. He was always dirty: he loved dirt, and
nothing could keep him clean. His honesty also was doubtful.  While in Malta harbour, some
of our plate had disappeared.  Our boy accused Bobby of taking it, though he denied this, and,
to our surprise, confessed that he knew where it was.

"Why, do you see, sir," he said to Stallman, who sat as judge on his trial, "it somehow or
other got into my tub of hot water, and I never knowed it; and when I went to heave the water
overboard, I then see'd the glitter of it in the sea, as it sunk to the bottom."

The defence was ingenious, and as there was no witness to prove to the contrary, Bobby escaped
punishment on that occasion; though, as he had been seen in deep confabulation with an ill-looking
Jew a short time afterwards, suspicion went much against him.  From bad, things grew to worse
with Bobby Smudge.  Not a day passed, scarcely an hour, that he did not taste the flavour of
a rope's-end--most frequently bestowed by his master, the carpenter.

"You will be the death of me, I know you will, Master Chissel," he groaned out one day, when
his castigator was even severer than usual. "I'll go and drown myself, that I will, if this
goes on much longer-- you'll see if I don't.  I won't stand it, that I won't;" and he blubbered
as few have blubbered before.

"You will, will you, you young scamp?" exclaimed the carpenter, seizing a rope's-end.  "Take
that, then, and remember, when you come back from the drowning of yourself, I'll give you six
times as much."  And poor Bobby got it worse than ever.

I think Chissel was very wrong in the way he treated the poor wretch. Had he been tolerably
kind and considerate, he might, I am certain, have worked on his good feelings, and certainly
have improved him; but the unhappy lad had from his earliest days been so constantly knocked
about, and so accustomed to receive more kicks than halfpence, that all his better feelings
had been pretty well beaten out of him.

It so happened that one evening, as the ship was running pretty fast through the water, and
as darkness was coming rapidly on, a loud splash was heard alongside, and that cry, so startling
to a seaman's heart, was raised--"A man overboard!"

"Silence, fore and aft," sang out Captain Poynder, who at the same moment appeared on deck.
"Does anybody see him?"

There was no answer.

"Does anybody hear him?"

There was an ominous silence.  A pin might have been heard to drop on deck.  The life-buoy
had been let go at the first by the officer of the watch.  Its signal fire now burned bright
astern, but no one was seen clinging to it.  There could be little doubt that the poor fellow,
whoever he was, had sunk at once.  The ship had been running at the time a few points off the
wind.  She was now brought close on a wind, and then the helm was put down, and she was hove
about with her head towards the life-buoy.  While she was in stays, the two quarter-boats were
manned and lowered.  Mr Vernon jumped into one of them, and the master into another; and as
the frigate lost her way, they shoved off and pulled in the direction of the spot where the
man was supposed to have fallen.

"Who can it be?  Who is missing?" was asked by all hands, while we were anxiously looking out
towards the boats, to see if they were picking up anybody.

When the ship reached the same locality, she was hove-to, and there we remained till the boats,
having picked up the life-buoy, returned on board.  They brought, however, too probable a sign
of some one having been lost--a boy's hat.  It had been picked up exactly at the spot where
the ship was supposed to have been when the alarm was first given.  The ship's muster-roll
was now called over, to ascertain who of the ship's company was missing.  One after the other
had answered to their names, and it had so nearly reached the end, that we began to hope there
might be some mistake after all, when that of Bobby Smudge was called.  There was no answer.
Poor Bobby!  There could be but little doubt that the unfortunate wretch had put his threat
of making away with himself into execution, rather than longer endure the tyranny of Mr Chissel.
I hoped that the carpenter's accusing conscience would make him repent of his cruelty.  This
surmise as to the poor boy's fate was confirmed the next morning, when some of his clothes
were discovered under the forechains.  The next day the chief conversation among the men was
about Bobby Smudge's suicide, and of the threats he had uttered of haunting the ship.  This
led to the recounting of similar circumstances; and many a forecastle yarn was spun that evening,
abounding in horrors sufficient to make the hairs of a less stout-hearted auditory stand on
end.  From the extraordinary remarks I heard as I passed about the decks, I declared, when
I went to the berth, that I believed that some of the men fully expected to see poor Bobby
Smudge come in at one of the ports and drive all hands out of the ship.  A seaman will encounter
anything living and tangible with a hearty good-will; but he has a mortal antipathy to meet
any spirit, black, blue, white, or green, from the nether world.

"I say, D'Arcy, it would be great fun if we could just manage to give some of these fellows
a fright," whispered Dicky Sharpe.  "A white sheet and a howl would do it.  I could manage
to imitate Bobby Smudge's voice, and I should just like to look in on old Chissel when he is
taking his first snooze.  I'd just mutter, `Bobby Smudge's ghost come to fetch you away, you
old sinner,' and his villainous conscience would do the rest."

"Don't play any such foolish trick, Dicky," said I.  "You would certainly be found out in the
first place, and get severely punished into the bargain.  Besides, the matter is too serious
to be turned into a joke.  Think of that poor unfortunate wretch, driven to despair, and plunged
suddenly into another world, through the cruelty and tyranny of one who ought to have protected
him, and tried to make him better!"

"But he was plunged into the sea," said Dicky, interrupting me; "and as for the cruelty he
received, I don't think he was so very much worse off than numbers of other fellows in his
position."

"I tell you, it is not a subject for joking on.  Perhaps poor Bobby Smudge had a mother and
sisters who will mourn bitterly when the ship returns home, and they find he is not in her."

"Dirty drabs, in all probability, who won't care a rap what has become of him," persisted the
incorrigible Dicky.

"For shame, Sharpe--for shame," said I; thinking how my cousins would grieve for me if I were
to be lost overboard.  I began to feel a strange sort of satisfaction at the idea.  Sentiment,
or whatever it might be called, was very quickly put to flight by the shrill sound of the boatswain's
whistle, and the hoarse cry of "All hands--shorten sail!"

We were hurrying to our stations aloft as fast as our legs could carry us--for the tones in
which the order was issued showed us that there was not a moment to be lost,--when, just as
we were springing into the rigging, a squall, which had but the moment before been perceived
by the officers of the watch, struck the ship.  As ill-luck would have it, it was the third
lieutenant who had the first watch, and he happened to be in a poetical mood, and deeply absorbed
in composing an ode to Queen Dido, or the Dodo--I don't remember which it was reported was
the case-- one or the other, I know.  The squall was a very heavy one: if not a white squall,
not inferior to it in strength and suddenness.  The ship rushed through the water, which was
lashed in an instant into a sheet of foam; the masts bent like wands, and looked as if they
would instantly go by the board.  The helm was ordered to be put up; but before she could answer
it--stiff as she generally was--over she went, as if she had been a mere skiff, till her yard-arms
almost touched the water.  It appeared as if she would never right herself again.  Then many
a stout heart quailed, and many a brave man gave himself up for lost; but, dreadful as was
the scene, discipline triumphed speedily over all unworthy fears.  Some of the ports were open,
and the water rushed through them in torrents.  Such was the case with the one in our berth.
Poor Signor Mezzi, our Italian master, was sitting there.  Never was a poor wretch more completely
horrified.  He gave up all for lost, and fancied that every moment the ship, and all in her,
were going to the bottom.  The assistant-surgeon and captain's clerk, who were at the time
in the berth, each seized a pillow from the hammocks, which had just before been piped down,
and cramming them into the port with tolerable effect, stopped the gush of water; but terror
had too completely mastered the poor dominie to allow him to observe what was going forward.
He shrieked out for mercy from every saint in the calendar, and entreated one or all of them
to carry him on shore, even if it was but to the sandy coast of Africa.  "Ah! misericordia,
misericordia, misericordia!" was the burden of his plaint.

"E impossible, signor.  If you do go to the bottom, heretics though we are, you will be in
very goodly company," exclaimed Tourniquet.  "And then think of the magnificent feast we shall
make for the fishes.  Let that be your consolation."

But poor Signor Mezzi refused to be comforted even by such a prospect; and even our medico
himself, when he found the ship still remaining in her unusual position, and heard the uproar
going on overhead, began to entertain some very disagreeable doubts as to the possibility of
the event to which he was alluding actually occurring, and looked very blue about the gills;
whereat little Scribble, the clerk, laughed heartily at him, and seated himself on the table,
with his feet on the side of the ship, affirming that he was not afraid, and was as contented
and happy as ever--the truth being, not that the young donkey was a bit more brave than the
other two, but that he had not the sense to know the danger he was in, and that not a seaman
on board but saw that the next moment might be his last.  Tourniquet had not the heart to move
and give Scribble a thrashing, or he would have done so.  But to return on deck. The instant
the squall struck the ship, Captain Poynder hastened from his cabin, and, seizing his speaking-trumpet,
in a calm tone issued the necessary orders.

"Down, every youngster, from the rigging.  Clue up--haul down--let fly of all!"

It was too late.  Before the words were out of his mouth, the ship was over on her beam-ends,
and lay like a log, neither sails nor rudder having longer power over her.  To describe the
wild horror of the scene would be almost impossible.  The rent sails flashing and flapping
in the gale; the ropes lashing furiously, as if in an attempt to seize some one within their
deadly coils; every timber quivering and groaning; the wind roaring; and the foam in thick
sheets flying over us.  Though the helm, as I have said, was hard up, still she lay in the
trough of the sea, without a hope of once more rising.

"Send the carpenter and his crew aft, with their axes," shouted the captain.

Chissel and his mates quickly obeyed the summons, for he had seen from the first that his services
would too probably be required.

"Stand by, to cut away the masts," added Captain Poynder.

It was a melancholy alternative, but the only one to save the ship from foundering.  Afterwards
we must trust to our anchors; and if they failed to hold with the wind as it then was, we could
not fail of being driven on the inhospitable coast of Africa.  And who could tell how many
might reach the shore alive!--perhaps none.  The uplifted axes gleamed in the hands of Chissel
and his mates, as they stood round the mizen-mast; others were sent to cut away the shrouds,
and clear the wreck of the mast as it fell.  Once more Captain Poynder raised his trumpet to
his lips.  It was to give the dire orders to cut, when, at that moment, the ship with a violent
jerk righted herself, and, speedily answering to the helm, away she flew before the wind. 
As such a course would very quickly have brought us up, sail was taken off her; and then, merely
under her spanker and fore-staysail, she was brought to the wind, for it was discovered that
the bowsprit was badly sprung, and that the topsail sheets were carried away.  Happily the
squall, having vented its fury on our heads, quickly passed over, and we were left with much
less wind than before.

"This is all that young beggar Bobby Smudge's doing, I'll warrant," I heard Ned Grummit, a
topman, exclaim, as he came down from aloft.  "I never knowed a chap of that sort who went
for to go for to drown hisself, if he threatened to do mischief, but found means to do it.
I knowed it would be so from the first, and we shall be lucky if worse doesn't come of it."

I tried to expostulate with the man, for whom I had a liking, for he was an honest fellow;
but to no purpose.  He still persisted in the belief that poor Bobby, who, while alive, had
never done anybody harm, was destined to work us all sorts of mischief.

Everything had been made as snug as circumstances would allow.  The watch below had been piped
down, and had turned in; and silence reigned on board, and on the face of the ocean around
us.  It had been my watch on deck, and I was just about being relieved, when the silence was
broken by a loud, unearthly cry; and the carpenter rushed on deck in his shirt, his hair standing
on end, and his eyeballs starting from their sockets.  Had not several men laid hold of him,
I believe he would have thrown himself overboard.  He was carried back to his cabin, and the
doctor was summoned.  All Chissel could say was, "Bobby Smudge!  Bobby Smudge! you young villain,
be off with you!"  The doctor gave him some stuff or other, and the carpenter went off into
a sound sleep; but a man was ordered to sit up by his side, and watch him.

"Now," thought I, "this has been one of Dicky Sharpe's tricks, and all my good advice has been
thrown away."  But when I looked into Dicky's hammock, he was sleeping away with such unfeigned
soundness that I could scarcely fancy that he had played any trick; and the next morning he
assured me, on his word of honour, that he knew nothing whatever about the matter.  I had never
known Dicky to tell an untruth, and I felt very sure that he would not conceal anything he
had done from me; indeed, the great pleasure he had in playing any mischievous prank was, to
tell me of it afterwards, if I happened not to be a partaker of it,--a very rare occurrence,
by-the-bye.

"Suppose you had played your trick on old Chissel, and what he has seen was really an evil
spirit, how very dreadful it would have been for you to have met the unnameable thing at his
bedside!" said I.

"Oh! don't talk of such a thing," exclaimed Dicky, shuddering.  "I am sure I will never again
think of carrying out such a joke as I contemplated.  The idea is too frightful."

I advised him not; and, after talking the subject over, and turning it in every way, we came
to the conclusion that, as no one else was likely to have tried to frighten old Chissel, if
he had not really seen a ghost, his terror had been the result of his own evil conscience.

"Yes, it is a dreadful thing to have a bad conscience," said Dicky, with a sigh.  "Do you know,
D'Arcy, I sometimes wish that I had not played so many wild pranks in my life.  I know that
they will some time or other bring me into trouble; and yet, when the fit seizes me, I cannot
help it.  I wish that you would remind me of my good resolutions when I next propose anything
of the sort."

I promised that I would, but suggested that unless he had some higher motive than the fear
of being brought into trouble, he would in all probability continue as great a pickle as ever,
if he did not go on from bad to worse.  Indeed I read my chum a very severe lecture, which
he took with perfect composure, feeling at the time that he fully deserved it; though I fear
that he was not in the end very much the better for my sage advice.

We were busy all day repairing damages as well as we could at sea; but it was found that they
were so considerable that the captain resolved to return to Malta, instead of pursuing our
course to Tunis.  While the work was going forward, a man in the forechains discovered a jacket
and waistcoat, which were known to have belonged to Bobby Smudge.  This was considered still
stronger proof that the poor lad had destroyed himself, as no doubt he had hung them there
before jumping into the sea.  Seamen are certainly the most superstitious beings alive, for
this trifling matter made them talk the whole evening after they had knocked off work about
Bobby and his ways; and scarcely one but believed that his spirit would haunt the ship as long
as she remained in commission.  The crippled state of the ship prevented our making much sail
on her, and as we had frequently baffling winds, our voyage to Malta was considerably prolonged.

Dirty Bob, as poor Bobby Smudge was generally called, excited far more interest after his death
than he had done during his lifetime, as is not unfrequently the case with much greater men.
The night succeeding the squall passed off, as far as I know, quietly enough; but the next
morning I saw several groups of men talking together, as if something mysterious had occurred.

"I knowed it would be so," said Ned Trunnion, as I passed by.  "He was as bold a topman as
ever stepped.  I knowed the little chap wouldn't let us alone, after he'd given Mr Chissel
a taste of his quality.  No, no; depend on't he'll haunt the ship for many a long day, if he
don't manage to run her ashore, or to send her to Davy Jones' locker outright."

"What's that about?"  I asked, for I suspected the observation was intended for my ears.

"Why, sir," said Tom Barlow, another topman, "Dirty Bob (saving your presence) has been aboard
again, a playing off his pranks, and many of us see'd him as clear as we see you."

"Nonsense, man," said I.  "If you mean Bobby Smudge, he's snug enough at the bottom of the
sea, fifty miles astern of us, by this time; besides, if any of you saw him, why did you not
catch him?"

"It wasn't 'xactly him we saw, sir," blurted out Ned.  "It was his spirit or ghost like; and
a chap might just as well try to catch one of them things as to grip an eel with greased fingers."

"How do you know it was his spirit, though?"  I asked; for I suspected that the men had been
working on each other's imagination till all fancied they had seen what perhaps only one had
dreamed of.

"Why, sir," replied Tom Barlow, with a hitch to his waistband, "we knowed it was him, because
it was as like him as he could stare, only a good deal blacker and dirtier even than he was
in his lifetime.  It had just gone two bells in the middle watch, when three or four of us
who was awake saw him as plainly as we do you, sir, now--creeping about for all the world like
a serpent, in and out among the hammocks.  It was more, just then, than any one of us wished
to do, to speak to him; but, thinks I, there can't be any harm telling him to cut his stick,
just civilly like; so I lifts up my head, and sings out, `Be off, you dirty son of a sea cook!'
But scarcely was the words out of my mouth, than he was away like a shot up the main-hatchway,
and through one of the ports, or right through the bottom of the ship, for what I knowed; for
I couldn't see, you may suppose.  All the others who saw him said, too, there was a strong
smell of sulphur, wherever he'd been, and that he vanished away in a flame of fire; but I can't
'xactly swear to that myself."

I laughed outright at the absurdity of the story, and was more convinced than ever that the
men had allowed their imaginations to be worked up to a pitch which would make them believe
anything.

Dicky Sharpe and I talked the matter over, and agreed not to say anything about it, as were
the circumstances to get to the ears of the captain, it would certainly make him very angry.

I thought we should hear no more about the matter; but two days after this I found the people
more busy than ever talking about Bobby Smudge's ghost.  Numbers declared they had seen it.
Some described it as having one shape, some another.  Not a few gave it a tail, and horns,
and fiery eyes.  All described it as black; and several were ready to affirm on oath that it
smelt strongly of sulphur and other horrible odours.  At length many of the men showed a great
unwillingness to go below, and to turn into their hammocks.

Old Chissel had become a completely altered character.  His conscience told him that he was
the cause of poor Bobby's death.  He grew thin and pale; his voice was no longer heard in loud
dispute with his brother officer, the boatswain; and even his manner was softened towards his
inferiors.  The men remarked the change; and all argued that the ghost had done him some good
at all events, though it certainly confirmed them in their belief of its existence.  Night
after night, no sooner was it dark, and the watch below turned in, than Dirty Bob's ghost was
sure to appear to some one or other; till at length the gun-room officers heard of the matter,
and ultimately the captain himself was informed of it.

At the same time a curious circumstance occurred.  Every morning one or other of the messes
had to complain that their bread-bags had been rifled, and different sorts of eatables had
disappeared in a most unaccountable manner.  None of the men suggested for a moment that the
ghost had anything to do with the matter--for what could a ghost want with biscuit, bacon,
or cheese; but Captain Poynder, who at length heard of this also, had, it appeared, formed
a different notion on the subject.

Two of the marines--steady old hands--who were ready to believe or disbelieve in ghosts or
spirits, and to fight carnal or spiritual enemies in any shape or of any colour, as their superior
officers might command them, were sent for into the cabin.  What their orders were I do not
know; but one of them, Jabez Cartridge, was placed that night as sentry on the lower deck.

The first watch had nearly run out, and Jabez, who had his eyes about him in every direction,
had seen nothing of the ghost, when, as it had just gone seven bells, he fancied that he observed
a dark object gliding about under the hammocks.  He stood as upright and stiff as his own ramrod.
So immovable was he, that any one might have supposed him asleep on his post; but his little
black eyes were not the less vigilant.  The dark object moved slowly and cautiously on till
it reached the lockers, where the men's mess things were kept.

Jabez saw that it had hands, and, by the peculiar movement of those hands, he came to the conclusion
that it had pockets.  Still a ghost might have hands, and trousers too, for what he knew to
the contrary. To convince himself, he sprang forward, and the ghost, with an unearthly shriek,
took to flight; but Jabez was too quick for the phantom, and grasping him tight, he sung out,
"I don't care if you be a ghost or not, but I've got you, at all events."

"Oh, let me go, let me go! and I'll lie snug and quiet till we get into harbour, and then I'll
leave the ship and never come back--that I won't," answered the ghost, in piteous accents.

But Jabez was inexorable, and dragging him to the sentry's lantern, by its sickly light discovered
features which belonged to no other than Bobby Smudge.

"Why, where have you been, you young scoundrel, all the time?" asked Jabez.

"In the coal-hole," blubbered out poor Bobby.  "I never thought of doing harm to no one; but
I can't live without eating.  Oh! let me go back,-- oh! do, now."

"My order is to take you to the captain," replied Jabez, unmoved; and forthwith to the captain's
cabin the unhappy Smudge was led captive.

He was soon, however, sent out again under charge of the sentry, and kept in durance vile till
the next morning.

After breakfast the men were called aft; and the captain appeared on the quarter-deck with
Bobby, in the same garb and condition in which he had been captured.  He was truly a wretched
object, as he stood trembling, and blubbering, and covered with coal dust and dirt, before
all the crew.

"I have called you aft, my men, to show you how foolish you have been to allow yourselves to
be frightened by the equally foolish trick of this miserable lad," said Captain Poynder.  "I
am not angry with you; but I wish you to learn, from this event, that all the ghosts you are
ever likely to see will turn out to be no more ghosts than is this poor fellow at the present
moment.  He confesses that to avoid punishment, and in the hopes of ultimately escaping from
the ship, he devised the scheme for making it appear that he had destroyed himself.  He managed,
it seems, to get a lump of coal in the forechains, and after heaving it into the water, and
crying out that a man was overboard, to get in at a port, and to stow himself away in the coal-hole.
Trusting to the superstition and folly which the people have exhibited, he thought he might
venture out at night to supply himself with food.  His plan succeeded; and had the story not
come to my ears, I conclude he would have kept up the farce till the ship got into port.  I
ask, my men, do you think it possible that God, who made this mighty universe, and governs
it by just and wise laws, would allow a mischievous imp, who could do no harm while alive,
to return to earth, merely for the sake of wreaking his own petty malice, or for troubling
and frightening a number of grown men such as you are.  To believe such a thing is both wicked
and absurd, for it is mistrusting God's wisdom and providence; and I hope, when you come calmly
to consider the matter over, you will think as I do.  I have another word to say, both to petty-officers
and men. The lad must have received much cruel treatment to make him attempt to escape from
it by the expedient he followed.  Remember, for the future, I will have no bullying.  The discipline
of the ship will be kept up far better by strict justice.  Had it not been for this, I should
have punished the lad severely for the prank he has played.  As it is, he has pretty well suffered
already.  But beware.  If anybody attempts to imitate his example, he will find I do not overlook
the matter so easily.  Now pipe down."

The captain's speech did much good in several ways.  It put a stop to any outrageous bullying
for some time; for the men knew perfectly well that what he threatened he would effectually
carry out.  It also tended to cure some of them of their superstitious belief in ghosts and
goblins.

"Well, I never heard the like afore," said Tom Barlow, as he and his messmate, Ned Trunnion,
were talking over the affair of the previous day.  "The skipper says as how there is no such
thing as ghosts; and I suppose, seeing as how he has as much larning as a parson, he knows
all about it.  It don't come within my category, though."

"What he says is all shipshape," replied Ned.  "I never yet met the man who really did see
a ghost, though I've met scores who've heard of some one who's seen them, and for that matter
come to fisticuffs with them; and certain sure I never see'd one myself till that young cheese-nibble
made himself into one.  Then, if he hadn't been found out, I'd have staked my davy that he
was one in reality."

"That is what the captain says," I remarked, as I stopped a moment. "All the ghosts which have
been seen will turn out to be only shams after all."

But enough of Bobby Smudge and his ghost.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN.

LETTER FROM MY UNCLE--CHASE OF MYERS--SUPPOSED LOSS IN PORTLAND RACE-- GOOD ADVICE--THE ARIADNE
MISSING--MR. VERNON'S ANXIETY.

Two days after this, much shorn of the pride and beauty with which we left it, we entered Malta
harbour.  As may be supposed, Mr Vernon hastened to the post-office as soon as he could get
on shore.  I accompanied him, with a note Captain Poynder had to send to the governor.  His
eye brightened as it glanced at the superscription of a letter which was handed to him.  He
read it over eagerly.

"I hope, sir, that you have good accounts from your friends," I said.

"They have had most provoking light winds and calms; and, when this letter was written, had
not made good half the distance.  Heaven grant that the Ariadne may have escaped any squall
such as crippled us."

"Indeed, sir, I trust so," I replied; but as he again turned to his letter, I made no further
remark.  I found a letter also for myself, to my no little surprise, for I thought no one would
take the trouble of writing to me.  I did not deserve a letter, I felt, for I had not written
a line to any one since I left England.  It was from my uncle. I put it in my pocket, to read
at my leisure when I returned on board. It ran as follows:--

"My Dear Nephew,--As a word or two now and then from those who are deeply interested in your
welfare, will but tend to keep them in your remembrance, and to cheer your spirits, should
you find yourself surrounded by troubles or hardships, your aunt and I hope occasionally to
send you a sheet of paper, with an account of what is going on at home; and I must beg you
in return to let us know how the world speeds with you.  Your aunt and cousins are well, and
one day passes with them so like another, that I have little to tell of them.  Terence grows
apace, and seems resolved to go to sea.  I will not baulk the lad of his wish when he is big
enough; and I hope better times will come in the navy, both for you and him, than I have seen
for some time past.  I have given the cutter plenty of work, and have made several captures;
but the prize I most covet, that villain Myers, has again slipped through my fingers.  I must
tell you all about it.  It is supposed, indeed, that he has at length gone to render up his
final account in another world; but even now I can scarcely believe but that he will yet turn
up somewhere or another in this.  I had received notice that he had been again seen in England,
and that he had got command of a cutter of about sixty tons,--a very fast craft, which nothing
could come up to; so, of course, I resolved to try and catch him.  I soon found that he was
visiting his old haunts.  I conclude that he fancied no one would believe he would have the
audacity to go there after all the crimes he had committed, and that therefore no one would
be on the watch for him.  He had succeeded in running two cargoes, and all the goods were got
up to London.  He had gone away for a third, and I learned that preparations were made to receive
it in West Bay, not far from Beere.  For two days and nights we had been cruising about, just
far enough out not to be seen from the shore, in the best spot for cutting him off, when it
came on to blow very hard from the north-west.  It had blown long enough to kick up a heavy
sea, when, just as it had gone three bells, in the middle watch, we caught sight of a cutter
standing in for the shore, and going along at a tremendous rate, not the eighth of a mile to
the eastward of us. We were on the larboard tack; but we were instantly about, and in chase
of her.  We could just make her out through the darkness; but I do not think many eyes could
have seen her, but those long accustomed to such work as ours.  It was some time before she
perceived us; for, from the way we were standing, we were end on to her.  As soon, however,
as she saw us, she kept away, and off she went like a shot before the wind.  We packed everything
on the cutter she could carry, and rather more canvas, as you may suppose, than under ordinary
circumstances I should like to set; but the stranger, at all events, seemed resolved not to
be outdone; and though by this time it was blowing half a gale of wind, had not only his whole
mainsail, but his square-sail and gaff-topsail all set.  This circumstance made me pretty certain
that Myers was on board, for he knew well that a halter would be his lot if he was caught.
I think he would have done better by keeping on a wind, for before the wind her larger size
gave the Serpent a decided advantage over him.  After an hour's chase, if we had not overhauled
him, he certainly had not increased his distance from us; and we had great hopes, should the
wind increase, or the sea get up any more, that we should at last catch him.  It was a trial
of the strength of our sticks, and the goodness of our rigging.  I had every confidence in
ours; but I also knew that the smuggler would not fail to have got a tough stick for a mast,
and sound rigging also. Another half-hour passed, and Hanks agreed with me that we were certainly
gaining on the chase.  To give us a chance of winging him, we now ran a gun forward; but with
the heavy sea there was, and the way both vessels were pitching into it, there was very little
probability that we should do so.  We, however, fired several times; but with no effect.  Only
think! the fellow had the audacity to run out a couple of guns, and to return the fire.  To
be sure, it was his only chance of escaping; for if he could manage to knock away any of our
spars, he would, he thought, show us a clean pair of heels.  His practice was not a bit better
than ours; indeed, it would only have been by chance that a shot could have hit its mark. 
However, we both of us kept blazing away at each other with hearty good-will.  In the meantime
the wind and sea, already high, were getting up very much.  At any other time I should have
hove the cutter to; but now, follow I must; and I hoped, from our greater power, we should
be able to hold out the longest, and that at last the smuggler must give in.  We were now nearing
Portland Race, and never in my life had I observed the sea running higher on it than it now
did.  `The fellows will never attempt to cross it,' observed Hanks: `they'll be swamped if
they do; and if they haul up to round it, we shall catch them to a certainty.'  `Cross it they
will try, at all events,' I replied; `they can never carry canvas on a wind, in a breeze and
with a sea like this.  See, they are standing into the very thickest of the breakers.'  Sure
enough, there was the cutter approaching the most dangerous part of the Race.  The spring-tide
was making down, and the wind, meeting it, threw the foaming breakers higher up than usual.
Still it was possible, if everything was battened down, that the cutter might shove through
them.  We all held our breath.  If she got through, we also must follow.  We had everything
secured, and were better prepared than she was.  On she went--her white sails appearing against
the dark sky--her whole hull enveloped in foam.  For some seconds she pushed on bravely.  I
never took my eye off her.  Suddenly the white canvas seemed to bend low down--the breakers
danced on as before.  I rubbed my eyes, but without avail: the sail had disappeared.  There
was a cry of horror on board the cutter, but no shout of triumph, though our long-sought-for
foe was no more.  He and everybody on board must have been swallowed up in those foaming billows.
We had barely time to shorten sail and to haul off, to avoid sharing the same fate; for I scarcely
think, on that day, that even we could have run through the race.  Some days after this I was
on shore on Portland Bill, and the lighthouse-keeper told me that he had witnessed the catastrophe.
He told me, also, that several planks and spars had shortly after come on shore, and with these
the body of a man.  When, however, he went down to the beach to look for the body, he could
nowhere find it; so he concluded that it had been swept away by the tide.  Such is the fate
of the smuggler Myers, and certainly no one ever deserved it more richly. I have no other events
to narrate.

"I should like to give you some good advice, Neil; but I am so little accustomed to lecture
others, I cannot find words to do it.  I will try, however.  Never forget that you were sent
into this world to do your duty to Heaven and to man; not to amuse yourself, but to obey God's
laws,--to prepare for another world, which will last for ever.  Remember always that this world
is only a place of trial--of probation.  Trials of all sorts are sent on purpose to prove us.
When man, through disobedience, fell, and sin entered the world, the devil was allowed to have
power over him.  He would have gained entire power, and man in his fallen state would have
been inextricably lost for ever; but Christ in his mercy interfered, and by His obedience,
His sufferings on earth,--by His death on the cross,--was accepted by God as a recompense for
all sinners who believe in Him.  By His resurrection, He became a mediator for us, showing
us also that we too shall rise, like Him, from the dead, in the bodies in which we died.  Thus
a pure and just God, who cannot otherwise than hate sin, was able at the same time to show
forth his justice and his mercy,--to punish those who go on in their wickedness, but to pardon
those who believe in their great Mediator, and repent of their sins.  I remind you of these
important truths, Neil, because I know all men are too apt to forget them.  Endeavour always
to remember them, and I am sure that they will keep you from evil more than any other safeguards
which I can offer you.  I do not tell you, my boy, not to do this, or not to do that; but I
remind you that Christ came down on earth, on account of the sins of mankind, to teach men
His laws; that He suffered pain, toil, and disgrace, and a dreadful death; and that, in gratitude
to Him, we are bound to do our utmost to obey Him.  Read your Bible constantly--not now and
then, but every day; learn what His will is, and do your best to follow it.  Remember, also,
that the devil is ever at your elbow, endeavouring to persuade you not to follow it,-- telling
you that sin is sweet and pleasant; that God will not be angry with you if you sin a little;
that hell is far off; that God would not be so cruel as to send you there; and that it is cowardly
to be afraid. Oh, my boy, let me entreat you to pray to God for grace to enable you to resist
those temptations.  Come they will, assuredly; and never trust in your own strength to resist
them.  Christ will give you strength.  Fly to Him in prayer.  Go to your Bible,--read that,
and you will be strong to resist all temptations.  Of course, never mind what your companions
may say or think on the subject.  I ask, are you to be biassed by the opinions of poor, weak,
sinful mortals; or to obey the laws of the great all-powerful God, who made the whole universe--the
innumerable globes you see in the sky--the world we inhabit, with all its wonders--man, with
his proud intellect--the animals of the forest, the birds of the air, the creeping things innumerable,
scarcely the nature of one of which you can comprehend,--of the merciful Saviour, who died
for you, and who is eager to preserve you and all who believe on him?  Still I know that, with
a full consciousness of God's greatness and goodness--of Christ's mercy--man is so weak that
nothing but constant prayer for grace will enable him to keep in the right way.  I feel, my
dear nephew, that I could not write too much on this all-important subject; but still I must
conclude.  Keep my letter by you, and look at it at times when you are inclined to forget its
advice.  Your aunt joins me in earnest prayer for your welfare.

"Your affectionate uncle,--

"Terence O'Flaherty."

I am most grateful to my kind uncle for having sent this letter to me. It had a very beneficial
effect on my mind.  I do not mean to say that at the time I received it I thought as seriously
of its contents as I did afterwards; yet I tried somewhat to follow its advice,--not as I might
have done; but I read my Bible more frequently, and prayed more earnestly than I had ever done
before.  I do not mean to say that I knelt down by the side of my hammock to pray, as those
on shore are able to do by the side of their beds; but I found many an opportunity to offer
up my prayers during a watch on deck at night, and on those occasions I felt more freedom and
earnestness.  Also I often would do so after I had turned into my hammock, and before I turned
out in a morning.  I own that when I was first observed to read my Bible I was frequently called
by my messmates a Methodist and a saint, and Dicky Sharpe was especially liberal in his application
of such epithets to me; but Adam Stallman soon silenced him as well as others.

"Let me ask you, Master Dicky, what you mean by a Methodist?" he inquired.  "If it is applied
to a man who acts the part of a consistent Christian, and does his duty methodically--with
system, and not by fits and starts,--it is a very high compliment you pay him; and as for the
term saint, let me assure you that those who do not become saints have their souls in a very
perilous condition."

These remarks of Stallman's, though my young messmate tried to look unconcerned and indifferent
to them at the time, had, I believe, a very beneficial effect on him.  I will not, however,
dwell longer on this subject, important though it is, or my readers may declare that, instead
of writing my adventures for their amusement, I am giving them a book of sermons.  I will not
do that; but still I must urge them to pay attention to what I have said--never to be ashamed
of their religion; far, far rather to be proud of it, and ever to make God's word the rule
of their conduct.--To return to my narrative.  The repairs of the frigate having been completed,
we once more put to sea, and made sail for Tripoli and Tunis.  Our poor Italian master, Signor
Mezzi, had declared most positively that nothing would ever again tempt him to venture on the
treacherous ocean; but a few weeks on the smooth water of Malta harbour had wonderfully reassured
him, and he continued therefore with us, to our somewhat problematical benefit.  Nothing occurred
on our passage to and from those places.

We were once more entering Malta harbour.  Mr Vernon at once went on shore, and I again accompanied
him.  He repaired to the post-office, but there were, to his evident disappointment, no letters
for him.  He considered for a moment.  "We'll go to the agents of the Ariadne; she must have
arrived at Gibraltar long before the last mails left."

The agent's office was close to the harbour.  We threaded our way to it among bales, and casks,
and packages.

The senior partner, Mr Dunnage, received us very politely; and when Mr Vernon inquired for
the brig, his countenance assumed a grave look.

"We must hope for the best," he replied; "but she is, I own, very long overdue, and we have
had no tidings whatever of her.  She may have put into some little-frequented port, with the
loss of her spars or masts, and the master may not have been able to communicate with us."

"Nay, I am sure it must be so," he continued, seeing the agitation into which the information
had thrown my lieutenant.

"Was the master a steady and good seaman?" asked Mr Vernon, in a voice husky with emotion.

"Not a steadier man nor a better seaman comes to this port," replied Mr Dunnage.  "If his craft
was caught by a squall, or got into any other difficulty, I am sure he would have done all
that could be done for her."

"We fell in with a terrific squall soon after she was at sea," mused Mr Vernon.  "Heaven grant
that she was not exposed to it."

"It is impossible to say," answered the merchant in a kind tone.  "I feel more than usually
anxious, on account of her passengers, I own. Sailors are accustomed to hardships; they expect
to meet them in their career; and they are aware, when they go afloat, that they must be prepared
to lose their lives in the gale or the battle."

Mr Vernon shuddered.  He began to realise the possibility of the loss-- the dreadful death
of her he loved.  Still he was a right-minded, brave man, and what is more, a sincere Christian;
and he resolved not to give way to despair.

Mr Dunnage perceived, at length, the effect his information had produced, and he now did his
best to mitigate the anxiety of my lieutenant, entering warmly into all his plans for gaining
information as to the fate of the brig.

It was agreed that he should write round to all the ports on the shores of the Mediterranean,
near which it was possible the Ariadne could have been driven; and that his correspondents
there should send boats along the coast from port to port, so that no part should remain unexplored.

"I should advise you also to see the Admiral; he will, I am sure, take a warm interest in the
matter."

No sooner said than done.  When sensible men are in earnest about an affair, they do not lose
time by talking, the plan of action being at once decided on.

Mr Dunnage having penned the draft of a circular letter to be sent to the ports, left it to
be copied by his clerks, while we set forth to see the Admiral, who was, fortunately, at Malta.

The worthy old man at once entered into all the proposed plans for searching for the brig,
and suggested others.

"We'll send the Harold to sea at once; and I'll despatch all the small craft I can spare on
the search.  Stay,--you shall take an order to Captain Poynder to sail forthwith.  I suppose
he's ready to go?" said he to Mr Vernon.

"We are well supplied with provisions, and can soon fill up with water; we can be off this
evening, I know," replied Mr Vernon.

"Away with you! and may your search be prosperous," said the Admiral, with much feeling.

The order to go to sea again was at first received with no little surprise on board; but the
fact that the Ariadne was missing being generally known on shore, and the blue-peter being
hoisted, the officers who had gone on leave came hurrying back.

That night, with a fine breeze we had run Malta out of sight.

CHAPTER FIFTEEN.

SAIL IN SEARCH OF THE ARIADNE--FALL IN WITH A BOAT AND CREW--THE MASTER OF THE HELEN--HIS NARRATIVE--ATTACK
OF PIRATES--CAPTAIN DELANO--CAN HE HAVE SEIZED THE ARIADNE?

"Something black and low over the starboard bow," sung out the man stationed on the main-topgallant-masthead.

"How far off is it?" hailed the first-lieutenant.

"Two miles or thereabout, sir," was the reply.

"What does it look like?" was again asked.

"A boat, I think, sir, as much as anything," answered the look-out.

Scarcely had the seaman aloft hailed the deck, than Mr Vernon, his countenance paler than usual,
showing the agitation within, had slung his glass over his shoulder, and was on his way up
the rigging.  At the topgallant-masthead he now sat, eagerly looking out towards the point
indicated.  The ship's course was instantly directed towards it.  It was an exciting moment.
It might prove to be a boat, keel uppermost, and have no tale to tell, except to let us surmise
that she had proved no ark of safety to those who had trusted to her; or she might have living
beings on board, whom our discovery of her might rescue from starvation and death.  Other officers
followed Mr Vernon aloft.

"She is a boat afloat, and pulling towards us," sung out one of them.

Everybody on board was looking over the sides or out of the ports at the boat, which we neared
rapidly.  We soon made out that there were several people in her besides those who were pulling;
but whether there was a lady or not, we could not discover.  I pitied poor Mr Vernon's feelings
all the time very much.  He came down on deck again, and stood at the gangway pale as death,
but manfully suppressing his emotion.  The boat drew near us.  She was evidently belonging
to a merchantman, and, from her build, and the appearance of the people, they were English;
but there was no female form among them.  Mr Vernon scrutinised the countenances of those in
the boat as she came alongside; but he soon, apparently, recognised none as those he had seen
on board the Ariadne, for he drew a deep breath, and, I thought, seemed more composed.

The people from the boat now came up the side, and she was hoisted up. She was in a very battered
condition, and had evidently been lately repaired in a hurried manner.

They were received at the capstern by Captain Poynder.  An honest, sturdy-looking gentleman
stepped forward as spokesman.

"I see that I am fortunate enough to have got on board a British man-of-war," he began.  "Well,
sir, I have a pretty account of piracy and attempted wholesale murder to give."

"Let me hear it at once, sir, that I may judge what is to be done," said Captain Poynder.

"Yes, sir, certainly.  My name is Hudson, sir.  You must know that I am, or rather was, master
of the Helen brig.  We sailed from Liverpool, where we took in a valuable cargo of manufactured
goods, chiefly silks and fine cottons.  We were bound for Leghorn.  While we were taking in
our cargo, there lay alongside of us a fine new brig, the William, owned by some very respectable
merchants of our port.  Her master was a certain Captain Delano, a very well-spoken, fine-looking
man.  I cannot say that I ever liked him.  There was something in his eye, and way of talking,
which made me doubt him.  Not but that he said many things that were very good and right, but
there was nothing hearty in them; and now and then he let out opinions which made me sure he
was a bad man, notwithstanding the way he had managed to come over his owners.  There were
several suspicious things which I had heard of him from time to time.  He was an American,
hailing from New York; yet he fought very shy of all masters coming from thence, and had refused,
on some excuse or other, to take charge of a vessel going there.  He, two years ago, had command
of a barque, the Brunswick, trading up the Straits.  Some queer things were said to have taken
place in her; and I'm very much mistaken if the black flag did not fly aboard her more than
once.  At last this Mr Delano was caught attempting to carry out a large smuggling transaction
in Malta harbour, as, perhaps, you may have heard, sir, when you have been there.  He was convicted,
and thrown into prison.  After having been shut up for a year, he was liberated, ruined in
character, and without a penny in his pocket. At about half an hour to the north of this Wady
runs another, called Wady Byre (Arabic), likewise falling into that river. Between these two
valleys are situated the villages of Denna (Arabic) and Kokab (Arabic). Beyond Meraszrasz

BYSAN

[p.343] we began to descend, and reached the bottom of the valley El Ghor in seven hours and three
quarters from our departure from Nazareth. We now turned more southward, and followed the valley
as far as Bysan, distant eight hours and a quarter from Nazareth.

The two merchants and myself had left the caravan at Meraszrasz, and proceeded to Bysan, there
to repose till the camels came up: but the drivers missed the road, and we continued almost
the whole day in search of them. Bysan (Bethsan, Scythopolis) is situated upon rising ground,
on the west side of the Ghor, where the chain of mountains bordering the valley declins considerably
in height, and presents merely elevated ground, quite open towards
the west.

At one hour distant, to the south, the mountains begin again.

The ancient town was watered by a river, now called Moiet Bysan (Arabic), or the water of
Bysan, which flows in different branches towards the plain.

The ruins of Scythopolis are of considerable extent, and the town,
built along the banks of the rivulet and in the valleys formed by
its several branches, must have been nearly three miles in circuit.

The only remains are large heaps of black hewn stones, many foundations of houses, and the
fragments of a few columns. I saw only a single shaft of a column standing. In one of the valleys
is a large mound of earth, which appeared to me to be artificial; it was the site perhaps
of a castle for the defence of the town.

On the left bank of the stream is a large Khan, where the caravans repose which take the shortest
road from Jerusalem to Damascus.

The present village of Bysan contains seventy or eighty houses; its inhabitants are in a miserable
condition, from being exposed to the depredations of the Bedouins
of the Ghor, to whom they also pay a heavy tribute.

After waiting here some time for the arrival of the caravan, we rode across the valley, till
we reached the

VALLEY OF THE JORDAN

[p.344] banks of the Jordan, about two hours distant from Bysan, which bore N.N.W. from us. We
here crossed the river at a ford, where our companions arrived soon afterwards.

The valley of the Jordan, or El Ghor (Arabic), which may be said to
begin at the northern extremity of the lake of Tiberias, has near
Bysan a direction of N. by E. and S. by W. Its breadth is about two
hours.

The great number of rivulets which descend from the mountains on
both sides, and form numerous pools of stagnant water, produce in
many places a pleasing verdure, and a luxuriant growth of wild herbage
and grass; but the greater part of the ground is a parched desert,
of which a few spots only are cultivated by the Bedouins.

In the neighbourhood of Bysan the soil is entirely of marle; there are very few trees; but
wherever there is water high reeds are found. The river Jordan, on issuing from the lake of Tiberias,
flows for about three hours near the western hills, and then turns towards the eastern, on
which side it continues its course for several hours. The river flows in a valley of about a quarter
of an hour in breadth, which is considerably lower than the rest of the plain of Ghor; this
lower valley is covered with high trees and a luxuriant verdure, which affords a striking contrast
with the sandy slopes that border it on both sides. The trees most frequently met with on the banks
of the Jordan are of the species called by the Arabs Gharab (Arabic) and Kottab (Arabic) [The
following are the names or the rivulets which descend from the western mountains into the Ghor,
to the north or Bysan. Beginning at the southern extremity of the lake of Tiberias are Wady
Fedjaz (Arabic), Ain el Szammera (Arabic), Wady Djaloud (Arabic), Wady el Byre (Arabic), and
Wady el Oeshe (Arabic). To the south of Bysan are Wady el Maleh (Arabic), Wady Medjedda (Arabic),
with a ruined town so called, Wady el Beydhan (Arabic), coming from the neighbourhood of Nablous,
and Wady el Farah (Arabic). On the east side of the Jordan, beginning at the Sheriat el Mandhour,
and continuing to the place where we crossed the river, the following Wadys empty themselves into
it: Wady el Arab (Arabic), Wady el Koszeir (Arabic), Wady el Taybe (Arabic), Wady el Seklab
(Arabic), which last falls into the Jordan near the village Erbayn, about one hour's distance
north of the place where we crossed. This Wady forms the boundary between the districts; called
El Koura and El Wostye.

On the west side of the river, to the north of Bysan, are the following ruined places in the
Ghor: beginning at the lake, Faszayl (Arabic), El Odja (Arabic), Ayn Sultan (Arabic). Near where
we crossed, to the south, are the ruins of Sukkot (Arabic). On the western banks of the river, farther
south than Ayn Sultan, which is about one hour distant from Bysan, there are no ruins, as far
as Rieha, or Jericho, the yalley in that direction being full of rocks, and little susceptible
of cultivation.].

[p.345] The river, where we passed it, was about eighty paces broad, and about three feet deep;
this, it must be recollected, was in the midst of summer. In the winter it inundates the plain
in the bottom of the narrow valley, but never rises to the level of the upper plain of the
Ghor, which is at least forty feet above the level of the river.

The river is fordable in many places during summer, but the few spots where it may be crossed
in the rainy season are known only to the Arabs.

After passing the river we continued our route close to the foot of the eastern mountain. In half
an hour from the ford we crossed Wady Mous (Arabic), coming from the mountains of Adjeloun.
In one hour and a quarter we passed Wady Yabes, and near it, the
Mezar, or saint's tomb called Sherhabeib (Arabic).

In two hours we came to a stony and hilly district, intersected by several deep but dry Wadys,
called Korn el Hemar (Arabic), the Ass's Horn. Our direction was alternately S. and S. by W.
Here the Jordan returns to the western side of the valley. The Korn el Hemar

ABOU OBEIDA

[p.346] projects into the Ghor about four miles, so that when seen from the north the valley
seems to be completely shut up by these hills. From thence a fertile tract commences, overgrown
with many Bouttom (Arabic) or wild pistachio trees. Large tracts of ground were burnt, owing
probably to the negligence of travellers who had set the dry grass on fire. At the end of six
hours, and late at night, we passed to the right, the ruins of an ancient city standing on
the declivity of the mountain and still bearing its original name Amata (Arabic). My companions
told me that several columns remain standing, and also some large buildings. A small rivulet
here descends into the plain. In six hours and a half we reached the Mezar Abou Obeida (Arabic),
where we rested for two hours. The tomb of the Sheikh is surrounded by a few peasant's houses;
but there are no inhabitants at present, except the keeper of the tomb and his wife, who live
upon the charity of the Bedouins. It appears from the account given by the great Barbary traveller,
Ibn Batouta, that in the sixteenth century this part of the Ghor was well cultivated, and full
of villages.

The valley of the Jordan affords pasturage to numerous tribes of Bedouins. Some of them remain
here the whole year, considering it as their patrimony; others visit it only in winter; of
the latter description are the Bedouins who belong to the districts of Naszera and Nablous, as
well as those of the eastern mountains. We met with several encampments of stationary Bedouins,
who cultivate a few fields of wheat, barley, and Dhourra. They are at peace with the people
of Szalt, to many of whom the greater part of them are personally known; we therefore passed unmolested;
but a stranger who should venture to travel here unaccompanied by a guide of the country would
most certainly be stripped.[For the names of the Bedouin tribes see the classification, in the
Appendix.]

ELMEYSERA

[p.347]July 3d.--We departed from Abou Obeida long before sun-rise, proceeding from thence in
a more western direction. In a quarter of an hour we passed the northern branch of the river
El Zerka, near a mill, which was at work. In one hour we passed the principal stream, a small
river, which empties itself into the Jordan about one hour and a half to the S.W. of the spot
where it issues from the mountain. Its banks are overgrown with Defle (Solanum furiosum).
On the other side of the Zerka we ascended the mountain by a steep acclivity, but the road,
from being much frequented, is tolerably good. The mountain consists of calcareous rock, with
layers of various coloured sand-stone, and large blocks of the black Haouran stone, or basalt,
which forms a principal feature in the mineralogy of Eastern Syria. In two hours and three quarters
we arrived at the top of the mountain, from whence Abou Obeida bore N.N.W. Here we had a fine view
over the valley below.

On the west side of the Jordan, between the river and the mountains of Nablous, I remarked a
chain of low calcareous rocky heights which begin at about three hours north of Abou Obeida,
and continue for several hours distance to the S. of that place on the opposite side of the
river. The highest point of Djebel Nablous bore N.W.; the direction of Nablous itself was pointed
out to me as W.N.W. On the summit where we stood are some large heaps of hewn stones, and several
ruined walls, with the fragments of three large columns. The Arabs call the spot El Meysera (Arabic).
The Zerka, or Jabock of the Scriptures, divides the district of Moerad from the country called El
Belka (Arabic). The highest summit of the mountains of Moerad seems to be considerably higher
than any part of the mountains of Belka. From Meysera the road continues over an uneven tract,
along the summit of the lower ridge of mountains which form the northern limits of

MOUNT OSHA

[p.348] the Belka. We had now entered a climate quite different from that of the Ghor. During the
whole of yesterday we had been much oppressed by heat, which was never lessened by the slightest
breeze; in the Belka mountains, on the contrary, we were refreshed by cool winds, and every where
found a grateful shade of fine oak and wild pistachio trees, with a scenery more like that of
Europe than any I had yet seen in Syria. In three quarters of an hour from Meysera we passed
a spring. I was told that in the valley of the Zerka, at about one hour above its issue from
the mountains into the plain, are several hills, called Telloul el Dahab (Arabic) (the Hills
of Gold), so called, as the Arabs affirm, from their containing a gold mine. In one hour and a
quarter we passed the ruined place called El Herath (Arabic). The Arabs cultivate here several
fields of Dhourra and cucumbers. My companions seeing no keepers in the neighbouring wood carried
off more than a quintal of cucumbers. About one hour to the S.E. of Herath are the ruined places
called Allan (Arabic), and Syhhan (Arabic). At the end of two hours we reached the foot of the
mountain called Djebel Djelaad and Djebel Djelaoud (Arabic), the Gilead of the Scriptures,
which runs from east to west, and is about two hours and a half in length. Upon it are the
ruined towns of Djelaad and Djelaoud. We ascended the western extremity of the mountain, and
then reached the lofty mountain called Djebel Osha, whose summit overtops the whole of the Belka.
In three hours and a quarter from Meysera we passed near the top of Mount Osha (Arabic), our general
direction being still S.S.E. The forest here grows thicker; it consists of oak, Bouttom, and
Balout (Arabic) trees. The Keykab is also very common. In three hours and three quarters we
descended the southern side of the mountain, near the tomb of Osha, and reached Szalt (Arabic),
four hours and a half distant from Meysera. Near the tomb of Osha was an encampment of about
sixty tents

SZALT

[p.349] of the tribe of Abad (Arabic); they had lately been robbed of almost all their cattle by
the Beni Szakher, and were reduced to such misery that they could
not afford to give us a little sour milk which we begged of them.

They were still at war with the Beni Szakher, and were in hopes of recovering a part of their property;
but as they were too weak to act openly, they had encamped, for protection, in the neighbourhood
of their friends the inhabitants of Szalt.

They intended to make from hence some plundering excursions against their enemies, for they had
now hardly any thing more to lose in continuing at war with them.

I alighted at Szalt at the house of one of my companions, where I was hospitably entertained
during the whole of my stay at this place.

The town of Szalt is situated on the declivity of a hill, crowned
by a castle, and is surrounded on all sides by steep mountains.

It is the only inhabited place in the province of Belka, and its
inhabitants are quite independent.

The Pashas of Damascus have several times endeavoured in vain to subdue them. Abdulla Pasha, the late governor,
besieged the town for three months, without success.

The population consists of about four hundred Musulman and eighty Christian families of the
Greek church, who live in perfect amity and equality together: the Musulmans are composed of
three tribes, the Beni Kerad (Arabic), the Owamele (Arabic), and the Kteyshat (Arabic), each
of which has its separate quarter in the town; the principal Sheikhs, at present two in number,
live in the castle; but they have no other authority over the rest than such as a Bedouin Sheikh
exercises over his tribe. The castle was almost wholly rebuilt by the famous Dhaher el Omar,[See
the history of Sheikh Dhaher, the predecessor of Djezzar Pasha in the government of Akka, in Volney.
Voyage en Egypte et en Syrie, vol. ii. chap. 25. Ed.] who resided here several years. He obtained
possession by the assistance of the weakest of the two parties into which the place
AIN DJEDOUR

[p.350] was divided, but he was finally driven out by
the united efforts of both parties.

The castle is well built, has
a few old guns, and is surrounded by a wide ditch. In the midst of
the town is a fine spring, to which there is a secret subterraneous
passage from the castle, still made use of in times of siege. In a
narrow valley about ten minutes walk from the town, is another spring
called Ain Djedour (Arabic), the waters of both serve to irrigate
the gardens and orchards which lie along the valley. Opposite to Ain
Djedour is a spacious sepulchral cave cut in the rock, which the people
affirm to have been a church. In the town, an old mosque is the only
object that presents itself to the antiquary. The Christians have
a small church, dedicated to the Virgin, where divine service is performed
by two priests, who each receive annually from their community about
L4. They are not very rigid observers either of their prayers or fasts;
and although it was now the time of Lent with the Greeks, I daily
saw the most respectable Christians eating flesh and butter.

The
greater part of the population of Szalt is agricultural, a few are
weavers, and there are about twenty shops, which sell on commission
for the merchants of Nazareth, Damascus, Nablous, and Jerusalem, and
furnish the Bedouins with articles of dress and furniture. The prices
are at least fifty per cent. higher than at Damascus. The culture
consists of wheat and barley, the superfluous produce of which is
sold to the Bedouins; vast quantities of grapes are also grown, which
are dried and sold at Jerusalem. The arable fields are at least eight
miles distant from Szalt, in the low grounds of the neighbouring mountains,
where they take advantage of the winter torrents. In the time of harvest
the Szaltese transport their families thither, where they live for
several months under tents, like true Bedouins.  Mr Dunnage
had a full fresh, Anglo-Saxon countenance, which, though I at first thought rather grave and
cold, after a few minutes' conversation seemed to beam with kindness and good nature.  He looked
grave as we entered, and having motioned us to be seated, shook his head as he remarked, "I
have no news, lieutenant, of the brig, I am grieved to say.  Have you anything to report."

"The worst surmises only, sir," said Mr Vernon; and he then gave him an account of our having
picked up the master and crew of the Helen, and of the outrage they had suffered.

Mr Dunnage listened with deep interest.

"Ah! that fully accounts for a circumstance which has puzzled me exceedingly.  That very brig,
the William, belongs to my friends, Hodge, Podge, and Company, of Liverpool; and I am sure
they would have consigned her to me, had they intended her to come here.  Here she came, however,
consigned to a Jew, a man of very disreputable character; and I understand that she discharged
but a very small part of her cargo.  We must try and find out what has become of it, and see
if Captain Hudson can identify any portion of it.  When I sent down to inquire about her, I
found that she had sailed again, and, it was reported, had proceeded up to the Levant.  Altogether
my suspicions were very much excited, especially when I found, on inquiry, that Delano was
her master.  Her crew, also, were said to have come on shore in gay-coloured silk waistcoats,
and to have spent more money than seamen are likely to have lawfully possessed."

"Oh, let us at once try and find out what was the nature of the cargo sold by Delano," exclaimed
Mr Vernon.  "Can you tell me what the Ariadne had on board?"

"I see the drift of your question," answered Mr Dunnage; "but I do not think that, foolhardy
as Delano may be, he would have ventured to offer for sale articles which had been shipped
from this, and would be so easily recognised.  No; all that we can hope to prove without a
doubt is, that the William is the brig which plundered the Helen; and we must then take means
to find out, without delay, what has become of her, and to put a stop to her career.  Stay;
let me consider what is best to be done.  The Admiral will, I am sure, gladly send all the
men-of-war that can be spared to look out for her."

"I have thought of that already," said Mr Vernon; "but, my dear sir, I suspect that such would
not be the best way to capture the pirate crew. They would very likely hear of our being on
the search for them, or would become suspicious at the sight of a man-of-war, and contrive
to make their escape.  We shall require to use great caution to get hold of so clever a fellow
as Delano is described to be.  I would propose rather to fit out a small merchantman, a xebeque
or schooner, and to man her with men-of-war's men.  We may, in a craft of that description,
be able to get alongside the William, unsuspected, and to capture her without loss of life."

"A capital idea," exclaimed Mr Dunnage.  "I have a craft in my eye, which I think you will
consider suitable for the object; and I am certain the merchants here will gladly defray all
expenses."

So the matter was settled; and as neither Mr Dunnage nor my lieutenant were men who would allow
the anchor to block up Mr Neptune's cottage door for many days together, we immediately set
off to have a look of the vessel proposed.  She was a small schooner, the Thisbe,--most vessels
in the Mediterranean have classical names; and the result of the examination was the opinion
that she was well suited for the purpose.

"Now, my dear lieutenant," said Mr Dunnage, "do you go on board and beat up for a crew.  I
will run round to the merchants to get them to share the expenses.  By this evening she shall
have her stores on board and be ready for sea.  Don't suppose I'm bragging.  Where there is
a will there is a way."

Off ran our excellent friend, while Mr Vernon and I hastened on board to describe the proposed
plan to Captain Poynder, and to get his leave to borrow some of the Harold's men.  As may be
supposed, there were plenty of volunteers for the expedition,--indeed, everybody wanted to
go; but we had to wait patiently till Mr Dunnage came on board, as he promised to do, to announce
what arrangements he had made.  When I got back into the berth, I found all the youngsters
discussing the subject of the disappearance of the Ariadne.  It was the general opinion that
it was possible Delano and his crew might have fallen in with her; but still she had had ample
time to reach Gibraltar.  We made up our minds that Mr Vernon would be placed in command of
the expedition, and we each of us hoped to be selected to accompany him.  Adam Stallman, who
was in the berth, did not make any remark; but after a time he got up and went on deck.  He
looked, I observed, more sad and full of care than even Mr Vernon.  At last Mr Dunnage came
on board with a despatch from the Admiral to Captain Poynder.  Mr Vernon was soon afterwards
sent for into the cabin.  The consultation was very short.  When he came out, he informed Adam
Stallman that he had applied for him as his mate, and, to my great satisfaction, told me that
I was also to accompany him.  I was very anxious to get Dicky Sharpe; so, mustering up all
my courage, I boldly asked Captain Poynder if he might be of the party.

"I suppose Mr Du Pre can dispense with his valuable services in the ship for a time," replied
the captain; "so, if Mr Vernon will take charge of him, and you, Mr D'Arcy, will undertake
that he gets into no mischief, he has my leave to go."

The truth was, the captain was glad to allow the mates and youngsters to go away in small craft,
as he considered that they thus gained more knowledge of seamanship, and confidence in their
own resources, than they could have done by remaining on board.  Twenty picked men were selected
from among the volunteers to man the schooner.  Mr Hudson, and four of his crew, were also
asked to go, to identify, if they could, the pirates.  As soon as the volunteers had got their
bags ready, and been mustered, we were ordered away in the boats to bring the schooner down
to the frigate, from up a creek in the harbour where she lay; while the purser was directed
in the meantime to get provisions and stores in readiness for her.  Where a body of disciplined
men labour with a will, a large amount of work can be done in a short time; and thus, before
night set in, we had the Thisbe fitted for sea, provisioned, stored, and watered.  We shipped,
likewise, four light guns, and a supply of small-arms and cutlasses, that we might make sure
of mastering the pirates, in case the plan of taking them by surprise should miscarry. We were
also ordered to take with us our rough clothes, that we might look as much as possible like
merchant seamen.  Our shipmates in the Harold gave us three cheers as we cast off from her
side, and, with a light breeze and a clear sky, stood out of the harbour.  The merchants had
left full discretion to Mr Vernon to proceed as he judged best from the information he might
obtain; but they suggested, at the same time, that he should run through the Greek islands,
among which it was probable the pirate would have gone; and, not finding her there, proceed
to Smyrna, where it was reported one of the pirates had said they were going.  Both Mr Vernon
and Adam Stallman had been on shore all day picking up what information they could.  Among
other things, they found that the crew of the William had been very profuse in their expenditure
on shore; and, as if to account for the quantity of cash they possessed, had said that they
had the luck to fall in with an abandoned vessel.  To show, however, how difficult it is for
rogues to agree in a false story, one had said that they had met her in the Bay of Biscay,
and another, inside the Straits, while a third had the audacity or blind folly to declare that
the name was the Helen, though the others gave her different names.  As soon as it was known
that suspicions were attached to the crew of the William, several tradesmen came forward to
say what they knew about them.  One of these gentlemen said that he thought it rather odd,
as I think indeed he might, when one of the men ordered twenty silk waistcoats of him of different
gay patterns, and paid the price down at once, while another bought six green coats.  I dare
say Mr Snip charged him a full price.  He declared that he had not sufficient reason to give
any information to the police about the matter, as seamen were curious fellows, and sometimes
fond of displaying fine clothes.  Another had spent large sums in a jeweller's shop, and had
gone out with several gold chains about his neck.  From what was reported, indeed, it appeared
that the wretched crew had spent a large part of their ill-gotten wealth.  To account for their
having so much cash, it was ascertained that they had at first gone to Leghorn, where Delano
had doubtless disposed of some part of the cargo.  It is only surprising that the authorities
at Leghorn had not detained her, when there were so many suspicious circumstances about her.
Thus, all the time that the wretches were under the idea that their crime was unknown, and
themselves unsuspected, they were insuring the means of their own detection and capture.  I
kept the first watch, with Adam Stallman, the night we sailed, when he made the above remark,
and many others.

"You will observe, D'Arcy," said he, "as you go through life, that evil-doers nearly always
lay nets for their own destruction: I might, I think, safely say always.  These men have already
given us evidence which must be sufficient to convict them; and, if not, depend on it, we shall
find it before long.  Now, how do you think this happens? Because, as I believe the Evil Spirit
is ever going about seeking whom he may devour, he tempts men to commit sin; and then so blinds
their minds, that they can no longer form a right judgment, even to save themselves from the
detection of their fellow men.  His temptations, also, are so weak and frivolous, when viewed
in their proper light, that, did not one know the folly of man, one would be surprised that
he could venture to make use of them.  His baits are always of a tinselly or shadowy nature,
either worthless when caught, or altogether illusions, as useless to people in general as the
gold chains and silk waistcoats are to these rough pirates.  Should it not make our hearts
sink with sorrow, when we see the worthless wealth, the empty titles, for which men barter
away their souls?"

I agreed with Stallman as to the correctness of his remarks.  My excellent messmate was very
fond of endeavouring, in a similar mode, to give instruction to the youngsters brought in contact
with him.  To do him justice, he contrived to do so in a more interesting way than my account
might leave my readers to suppose.  We had a fair wind, though light, for the first twenty-four
hours, and the schooner made good way; but at the end of that time it shifted round to the
eastward, a regular sneezer came on, the sea got up, and, close-hauled, the little schooner
was soon ploughing her way through the foaming waves.  My long service in the cutter made me
perfectly at home; but Dicky Sharpe, who had never been in a small craft in his life, was very
soon done up.  He threw himself down on a locker in the little cabin aft, looking the very
picture of misery.

"Oh!  D'Arcy, my dear fellow, do have the kindness to heave me overboard," he groaned out.
"I can be of no further use to any one in this world, and it would be a charity to put me out
of it.  It would, indeed, I assure you."

"Oh, nonsense, Sharpe," I answered.  "You are speaking gross folly: only your sea-sickness
excuses you."

"Now, don't scold me, Neil,--don't," he replied.  "If you felt as I do, you would not be inclined
to be very sensible."

"Well, then, get up, and be a man," said I.  "If you give in like that, and fancy yourself
dying, and all sorts of things, you deserve to be thrown overboard; though I'm not the person
going to do it."

"All hands shorten sail!" sung out Adam Stallman, who had charge of the deck.

I sprang up the companion-ladder, followed by Dicky, and from that moment he forgot all about
his sea-sickness.

We soon got the little craft under snug canvas, and time it was to do so; for, as man-of-war's
men often do small craft, we had been treating her like a big ship, and carrying on till the
last moment.  Never had the Thisbe been shoved through the water, probably, at the rate we
had lately been going; but more haste the worst speed, as we ran a great chance of proving
to our cost, for we were very near carrying the masts over the sides, or making the small craft
turn the turtle.

For two days we beat up against the gale, not one of us keeping a dry thread on our backs;
but after forty-eight hours of a good honest blow, the wind seemed to have done enough for
the present, and turning into a light baffling breeze, left us to make an easy, though slow,
passage across the blue calm sea.  This sort of weather continued till we made the mountainous
and wild-looking coast of the island of Cephalonia.  We ran in close along shore, as there
are no rocks to bring up a vessel; and, standing up a deep bay on the western side, with Guardiana,
or Lighthouse Island, on the north, dropped our anchor off Argostoli, the chief town.  Most
of the people were ordered to keep quiet below, while Mr Vernon, in plain clothes, went on
shore in the dinghy.  He came back in a short time, and reported that he could gain no tidings
answering to the description of the William.

My own knowledge of Cephalonia is but slight; but Stallman, who had been there before, gave
me some information about it.  It is one of the Ionian Islands, under the protection of England,
and had an English garrison, at that time consisting of about five hundred of the rifle brigade.
Thanks to Sir Frederick Adams, the country appears to be in a flourishing condition; the roads
are excellent, and the inhabitants cultivate not only the fertile valleys, but every inch of
soil to be found among its rocky heights.  There is another neatly-built and pleasantly--situated
town, called Luxuria, about three miles from Guardiana.

If we thought Cephalonia interesting, Zante, the next place at which we touched, was far more
so.  Its citadel occupies a lofty hill, situated at the head of a deep bay.  The citadel, bristling
with guns,--the town, with its steeples and domes,--and the surrounding country, with its groves
of olives, its fields of waving corn, and its villas and hamlets, presented to our eyes a scene
of surpassing loveliness.  Not a word of information could we obtain of the objects of our
search; so we again weighed anchor and stood on towards Corfu, the most beautiful and interesting
of all the Ionian Islands, within sight of the lofty and picturesque mountains of Albania.
The citadel of Corfu, standing on an island on the southern side of the town, may, from its
lofty position, surmounted by a lighthouse, be discovered at a considerable distance out at
sea.  Its southern side is completely inaccessible, and art has rendered the other sides equally
difficult to ascend; so that it is almost, if not entirely, impregnable.  The island is connected
to the mainland by a bridge, at the end of which is the fine open place called the Esplanade,
extending from the west side of the bay, to the palace of the Lord High Commissioner on the
east.  Most of the streets run at right angles to each other; the principal, the Strada Real,
runs to the gate which forms the chief entrance to the town.  The houses are for the most part
built in an irregular and slovenly manner; and even the public buildings cannot boast of much
beauty.  The inhabitants, of the town especially, are a mixture of Greeks and Venetians.  In
the country the population is more purely Greek.  The roads, constructed chiefly by fatigue
parties from the garrison, are excellent, and extend to every corner of the island, and must
contribute much to its material prosperity.  At all events, British rule has been of great
benefit to the Ionian people.  It might have been of greater.  More might have been done to
educate and improve the people, both morally and religiously; but had they been left to themselves,
they would most probably be in a far worse position than they now are.

Our inquiries here were as little satisfactory as at other places; and we were just tripping
our anchor, when a merchant-brig, coming up the harbour, passed us.  Mr Vernon hailed her,
to learn where she came from.

"Smyrna," was the reply.

She brought up near us, and he went on board.  He returned shortly with more animation in his
countenance than I had long seen there.

"I have at last notice of the fellow," he said.  "A vessel answering the description of the
William was in Smyrna harbour when the brig came out.  The crew, by their conduct, seem to
have excited some suspicion; and my only fear is that they may find it not safe for them to
remain, and will, therefore, take their departure."

This information put us all in spirits, for we had begun almost to despair of catching the
pirate after all.  Not a moment was lost in getting under weigh, and in making all sail the
schooner could carry.

We had a fair wind, and nothing worthy of note occurred on the passage, till we made the entrance
of Smyrna harbour, in the outer port of which we dropped anchor.  Mr Vernon then dressed himself
like the mate of a merchantman, and with one of our own people, and one of the crew of the
Helen, prepared to leave the schooner's side in the dinghy.  Just at the last moment I mustered
courage to beg that he would let me accompany him.  I had rigged myself in plain clothes, and
might, I fancied, have been taken for a steward, or the captain's son.  Mr Vernon considered
for a moment.

"Yes, come along, D'Arcy," said he.  "You will not do us any harm in that dress, and your eyes
and judgment may be of service."

I was delighted at the permission I had gained, and eagerly jumped into the boat.  Away we
then pulled up the harbour, in the lazy fashion of a collier's crew.  We scrutinised narrowly
each vessel in our course, but none answered the description of the William.  At last John
Norris, the seaman from the Helen, exclaimed--

"There, sir, that's her; inside the barque there.  See, she's got her fore-topsail loosed,
and there's the name of the maker on it--the very thing which first let us know that she was
the William."

To make more sure that the man was not mistaken, we pulled up the harbour a little way, and
then touching the shore, so as not to excite the suspicion of the pirates, should they by chance
observe us, we passed close by the vessel on our return.  There was, I thought, as I watched
her, a dark, ill-boding look about her; but that might have been fancy.  One man only was to
be seen.  He was walking the deck, with his hands in his pockets, and occasionally looking
over the side.  He caught sight of us as we pulled by, and seemed to be watching us narrowly.
I felt almost sure that he suspected something was wrong; but probably he had got a habit of
scrutinising everything which approached him, as a London pickpocket does when he knows that
the police are aware of his course of life.  As we dropped past the brig's quarter, I got a
better view of his countenance, and I felt sure that I had seen it before.  It was that of
a man I supposed to have been hidden long ago, with all his crimes, beneath the waves--no other
than Bill Myers.  It was a countenance I could not readily forget, after our encounter in the
cavern.  Then, in spite of all probabilities, he had contrived to escape from the breakers
of the Portland Race.  I was afraid to look up again, lest he should also recognise me, and
give the alarm to his shipmates; indeed, I was not at all satisfied that he had not already
suspected our intentions.  A small boat was floating astern of the brig.  He watched us for
some time, as we returned towards the schooner, and as long as I could observe him, he was
keeping his eye on us.  We lost not a moment, on returning on board, in getting out a merchantman's
long-boat, which we had brought with us.  She pulled four oars, and was a large, roomy boat.
Besides the hands to pull her, eight of our men were stowed away under a tarpaulin, which was
thrown over them, to look exactly as if it were covering up some merchandise.  All hands under
the tarpaulin were strongly armed, and arms were placed in readiness, stowed away for the use
of those who were pulling.

Mr Vernon again changed his dress, and I followed his example, lest Myers--or the man I took
for him--might recognise us.  With beating hearts we once more left the schooner.  We pulled
slowly up the harbour, and soon came in sight of the pirate brig.  The people, who had probably
been at their dinners when we before passed, were now some of them aloft, fitting the rigging,
and others working on deck.  It required, therefore, careful management on our part to take
them by surprise.  We pulled up, as if we were going to pass them at some little distance on
the starboard side.  The men imitated admirably the lubberly, sluggish fashion in which some
merchant seamen handle their oars.  Just as we were abeam, each of the two men pulling our
port oars pretended to catch crabs, and this suddenly brought the boat broadside on to the
brig's side.  Before, however, we could hook on, even the hands aloft seemed to suspect that
something was not right, and came sliding down the rigging. But notwithstanding this, we were
too quick for them, and before they could get below to alarm the rest, the party under the
tarpaulin had thrown it off, and we all together sprung up the sides, and attacked every one
we encountered.  Some fought desperately.  One fellow tried to throw himself overboard; but
we soon overpowered them, and had them lashed hands and feet.  To rush into the cabin was the
work of a moment. The door was locked, but we burst it open.  The noise made the captain, who
was in his hammock, start up.  He gazed at us for a moment, wildly and fiercely, and then drawing
a pistol from under his pillow, fired it at us.  The ball passed close to Mr Vernon's ear,
and buried itself in the bulkhead.  With a savage oath, the pirate was drawing out another
pistol, when we threw ourselves on him and seized his arms.  The weapon went off in the struggle,
and very nearly finished my career--the ball actually taking off the rim of my tarpaulin hat.
Before he could make any further resistance, three of our people followed us into the cabin,
and we soon had him, with his arms lashed behind him, and his feet secured together.  While
the operation was going on, he glanced at us like a tiger, but did not utter a word.  The remaining
few of the pirates, who had been asleep forward in their hammocks, had been secured without
resistance.  I looked round for Myers, or the man I had taken for him, but he was nowhere to
be seen.

Just as we had finished securing Delano, I bethought me that I smelt an unusual sulphurous
odour.  A dreadful suspicion had seized me.  Outside the main cabin was a door, leading to
a smaller one.  I forced it open, with a strength I did not think myself capable of exerting.
I felt that there was not a moment to be lost.  On the deck were a couple of casks, and a slow
match, burning at one end, communicated with one of them.  I cannot say that I thought, and
yet I was conscious, that in another moment I and all on board might be blown into eternity.
I know not what impulse moved me; but, bending down my mouth, I seized the burning match between
my teeth, and, though it much burned my lips and tongue, held it there till it was extinguished.
Then, overcome by the excitement of my feelings, I sunk down over one of the casks.  There
I lay for a moment, almost unconscious of anything.  I need scarcely say that the casks were
filled with gunpowder.  I should have fainted had not Mr Vernon come in, and had me carried
on deck.

"Your presence of mind has saved all our lives, D'Arcy, and I can never forget it," he exclaimed.
"But we have still more work to do.  Lift off the hatches, my lads."

This order was quickly obeyed.  With eager haste he hunted through every part of the ship.
I guessed at length what was in his mind.  He was seeking to discover any property of the Normans,
or any articles which might have been on board the Ariadne.  It was a moment of dreadful anxiety.
Nothing, however, was to be found which could lead us to suppose that the Ariadne had fallen
into the power of Delano.  Mr Vernon had directed Adam Stallman to get the schooner under way,
and to bring her up alongside the pirate brig, as soon as he calculated we could have taken
possession.  She now appeared, and, furling sails, dropped her anchor close to us.  The scuffle
on board the William had attracted the attention of the crews of the vessels lying near, several
boats from which presently came alongside; and it was, I fancy, at first believed that we were
a band of pirates, attempting to cut out a British merchantman.  Mr Vernon explained to them
what had occurred, and after a little time satisfied them that we had full authority for what
we were doing.  I can scarcely describe events in the order they occurred.  Our search over
the brig having been concluded, and no one else being discovered, we made inquiries among the
pirate crew, to learn who had laid the plan for blowing up the ship; but one and all denied
having any knowledge of it.  Even Delano was taken by surprise when he was told of it by Mr Vernon.

"Ah! that's the work, then, of that unhung scoundrel, my mate, Dawson," he exclaimed.  "It
was a thought worthy of him.  What! and has he escaped?"

"We found no one who appears to be your mate," said Mr Vernon.  "But what could have induced
him to commit such an atrocious act?"

"To try and save his own neck by sending us all to perdition before our time," exclaimed Delano,
evidently for the moment forgetting all caution, from his feeling of exasperation, and thus
clearly inculpating himself.

"Where do you think he has gone, then?" inquired Mr Vernon, quickly, hoping to gain further
information from the pirate in his present mood.

"That's not for me to say," he replied; but not another word could we elicit from him on the
subject.

He kept his fierce eyes glaring on us as we searched the cabin.  We came on a box of cigars
in one of the lockers.

"Ah! bring me one of those," he growled out.  "You will let a man make himself comfortable
in his own cabin, at all events."

A seaman, as sentry, had been placed over him, with a pistol in his hand.

"May I give it him, sir?" asked the man.

"No; not on any account," replied Mr Vernon; "but do you, D'Arcy, light one and put it in his
mouth."

As I stooped down to follow my superior's directions, I fancied the pirate would have tried
to bite off my fingers, he gave so vindictive and fierce a look at me.  As I stood by him,
I asked, "Has your mate, whom you call Dawson, ever been known by the name of Myers?"

"What's that to you, youngster?  Most men have more than one name," was his somewhat equivocal
answer.

His manner, however, rather confirmed me in my suspicion that the man I had seen on deck was
no other than the daring smuggler we had so often tried in vain to capture in the cutter. 
Having thoroughly examined the ship, we transferred Delano and five of his crew into the schooner,
while the remainder were secured on board the brig, into which Adam Stallman and Sharpe, with
ten of our people, were sent as a prize crew. Before sailing, Mr Vernon went on shore to report
to the English Consul, as well as to the Turkish authorities, what had occurred.  He got great
credit from the merchants for the mode in which he had captured the pirate.  It appeared that
even there the conduct of the crew had begun to excite suspicion; but as it happened to be
nobody's business to inquire into the affair, they would have escaped, had we not opportunely
arrived, that very day.

No information could be obtained of the missing mate.  He had not been seen to land, and no
one had heard of him.  The dinghy, however, having disappeared from the brig's stern, was sufficient
proof that he had effected his escape in her.  I was too much occupied all the time I was at
Smyrna, to make many observations about the place.  Figs are the great staple produce and subject
of conversation for the greater part of the year, enlivened now and then by a visit from the
plague, and then people talk about that; but at the time I speak of, I do not know that it
had ever occurred to the inhabitants that they had the means in their own hands of avoiding
its constant presence by properly draining their city.  I have since, from the observations
I have made in my course through life, come to the belief that there is not an ill which afflicts
mankind which they have not the means of mitigating, if not of avoiding altogether.--But to
return to my narrative.  As there was nothing more to detain us at Smyrna, the two vessels
made sail, and shaped a course for Malta.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.

VOYAGE TO MALTA--THE REPENTANT PIRATE--THE PLAGUE--A SQUALL--BOBBY SMUDGE PROVES USEFUL--ATTEMPT
TO CAPTURE THE SCHOONER--TRIAL OF THE PRISONERS--THEIR EXECUTION--THE YOUNG PIRATE'S DYING COUNSEL.

We had been five days at sea, and a fair breeze, though somewhat light at times, had sent us
tolerably well on our course.  A strict watch had been kept on the prisoners.  All seemed very
unconcerned as to the almost certain fate which awaited them.  They ate and drank, and laughed
and conversed among themselves, as if they were to be released at the end of the voyage.  One
of their number, however, who had received a severe hurt in the scuffle when they were captured,
was in a very different temper.  He kept as far apart from them as he could, and joined neither
in their jokes nor conversation.  He was far younger than the rest; and as I watched him I
observed an expression in his countenance which would not have been there had he been a hardened
villain.  He seemed grateful to me also for noticing him, and I consequently frequently took
an opportunity of saying a word to him appropriate to his situation.

"I should like to read, sir, if I had a book," he said to me one day. "I once was used to reading,
and it would be a great comfort."

I promised to try and get him a book.  When I told Mr Vernon of the man's request, he advised
me to lend him my Bible.  "He may not care for it at first," he observed; "but as he wishes
to read, he may draw instruction and comfort from it; and it may, by God's grace, enable him
to perceive the evil of his career."

I accordingly took the pirate my Bible--it had been my sainted mother's. The unhappy man's
eye brightened as he saw it.

"Well, sir, I was ashamed to ask for it, and I knew not if one might be on board; but that
is the book I wanted."

I left it with him, and he was constantly reading it attentively and earnestly; nor did he
allow the sneers and jeers of his companions to interrupt him.  I had perceived a considerable
change in him since he was brought on board; and he every day seemed to grow thinner and weaker.
I thought that he was dying; and I believe that he was of the same opinion.

Some bulkheads had been run up in the after-part of the hold to form a cabin for Delano--not
for his own comfort and convenience, because he was the greatest villain of the gang; but in
order not to allow him an opportunity of communicating with his companions.  He lay there on
a mattress, with his heavy handcuffs, and his legs chained to staples in the deck, like a fierce
hyaena, glaring on all who looked at him.  I should not, however, picture him properly if I
described him as a wild-looking savage.  On the contrary, there was nothing particularly objectionable
in his face and figure.  His face was thin and sallow, without much whisker; his features were
regular, and could assume a very bland expression; his figure, too, was slight and active,
and his address not ungentlemanly: but it was his eye, when either sullen or excited, which
was perfectly terrible.  Conscience he seemed to have none: it was completely dead, as were
all the better feelings of which our nature is capable: they were destroyed, too, by his own
acts--his long unchecked career of wickedness.  Once he had been gay, happy, and innocent;
but no good principles had ever taken root in his heart.  Very early, those a mother's care
had endeavoured to instil into him had been eradicated; and step by step--slow at first, perhaps--he
had advanced from bad to worse, till he became the consummate villain he now was. But I am
forestalling the account I afterwards got of him.

We had three officers' watches on board the schooner.  Mr Vernon kept one, I kept another,
and an old quartermaster we had with us kept the third.  Mr Vernon, in compassion to poor Bobby
Smudge, had applied for him as cook's boy, to get him out of the way of Chissel the carpenter,
his master, and in hopes of improving him by a somewhat different treatment to what he had
been accustomed.  The good effect of considerate kindness was already apparent; and the poor
lad seemed most grateful for any encouraging word spoken to him.  The best of our men had been
sent on board the brig, and we remained only with eight and the Helen's crew--a very fair complement,
had we not always required two to stand sentry over the prisoners.  We had another and a more
insidious enemy on board, of whom we wot not, and whom no sentry could control-- the plague--that
fell scourge of Asiatic cities.  How it came on board we could not discover.  It might have
been in some of the pirates' clothes, or some of our men might have caught it while they were
on shore for a short time; or it might have been concealed in the schooner long before, and
only brought forth by a congenial state of the atmosphere.  There it was, however.  It made
its appearance on the fifth day, and in two days carried off three of our people and one of
the Helen's crew.  The pirates escaped unscathed.  It seemed, indeed, in no way to alarm them.
They laughed and talked, and blasphemed more than ever.  We hailed the brig, which had hitherto
kept us company, and found that she was free from the affliction; so that, of course, except
at a distance, we could hold no communication with her.  I will not attempt to describe the
appearance of that dreadful disease.  It was sad to see the poor fellows attacked, with so
little prospect of their recovery; while no one could tell who would be the next victim.  As
they died they were sewn up in their hammocks, with a shot at their feet, and at once consigned
to the deep.  Mr Vernon read the funeral service appointed by the Church of England for such
an occasion.

After the first man was buried--a fine, active young fellow two days before, apparently full
of life and strength--he addressed the crew:--

"Do not suppose the prayers I have read can do any good to him who has just gone for ever from
our sight.  For your benefit they were offered up.  A like fate to his may be that of any one
of us before another day has passed; and I would earnestly urge you, for the short time which
yet may remain for you, to turn your hearts to God--to prepare for eternity."

Something more he said to the same effect.  It was good advice at the proper time.  I am sorry
to say that it was very little heeded, or, at all events, very quickly forgotten.  Two of those
who stood by and heard it, were themselves, within two days, called to their last and dread
account.  Mr Vernon took it very much to heart; anxious and agitated as he had been of late,
his nerves were much shaken, and I feared that he would be the next victim.  He bore up bravely,
like a Christian, for some time; but, as one after another of the crew was taken ill, he succumbed,
not to the malady itself, but to very weariness, and was compelled to take to his cot.  My
commander's illness threw a larger amount of responsibility on me than I had ever before enjoyed.
I felt on a sadden grown wonderfully manful, and did my best to be up to my duty.  Watson,
the quartermaster, was a great aid to me.  The old man seemed never to want sleep.  He was
on deck at all hours, constantly on the look-out, or seeing that the sentries were on the alert.
Perhaps he did not place full confidence in my experience.  We had had light winds or calms,
with a hot burning sun, and sultry nights, for nearly a week. When this weather commenced,
the plague appeared.  The barometer had been falling for some hours; but still there was no
other indication of a change of weather.  A fourth man was taken ill.  I had gone below to
report the case to Mr Vernon, when I heard Watson's voice, in quick eager tones, calling the
people on deck to shorten sail.  I sprang up the companion-ladder.  The sea was as smooth as
glass, and the sky was bright and clear enough in the south-east, whence a small dark cloud
came sweeping up at a rapid rate towards us.  I perceived that there was not a moment to lose.
The people sprang to the halyards and brails; but before all the sail could be taken off the
vessel, the squall had struck her.  Over she went on her beam-ends.  A cry of terror was heard
above the roar of the wind in the rigging, and the rattling of ropes and blocks, and the dash
of the surging waves.  The water almost reached the combings of the hatches: everybody on deck
thought we were gone.  Two of the men were washed overboard.  Watson, who was aft, hove one
of them a rope.  He seized it with convulsive energy: his life, dear to the meanest, depended
on the firmness of his grasp.  We hauled him in out of the seething cauldron; but the other
poor fellow drifted far away.  To the last he kept his straining eyes fixed on the vessel.
He was a strong swimmer, and struck out bravely--lifting himself, every now and then, high
out of the water, as if that useless exertion of strength could bring him nearer to us.  Perhaps
he was looking for a plank, or something to make for, to support himself.  Unhappily, none
was hove to him in time.  All hands were too much occupied in the means for preserving their
own lives.  Weak and ill as he was, Mr Vernon had rushed on deck as he felt the vessel going
over.  He had ordered the helm to be put up; and Watson had seized an axe, waiting his directions
to cut away the mainmast, when the throat-halyard block parted, the peak-halyards had already
been let go, and the mainsail coming in of itself, the vessel righted in an instant; then,
feeling her helm, and the headsail being yet set, she flew off before the squall.  While we
were rejoicing at our own preservation, we almost forgot our poor shipmate.  Never can I forget
the cry of despair he gave as he saw us flying from him.  He knew full well that it was impossible
for us to return; not a spar or plank was near to support him, to prolong his life even for
a few short hours.  The brig, also, was too far away to leeward to render him any help; so
that aid from man he had none.  Lifting up his arms, with eyeballs starting from his head,
he gave one last look at us; and then, uttering a cry of agony, sunk for ever.  It had been
dreadful to see strong men struck down by the plague, and die by rapid degrees; but I know
not whether a scene like this was not still more harrowing.  In the course of an hour we had
run out of the squall, and the weather had become cool and refreshing.  The squall had one
very beneficial result, for no other persons were attacked with the plague, and the man who
was suffering from it began rapidly to recover.  Vernon also sensibly felt the change in the
weather, and every day I saw an improvement; though the causes of his illness were too deeply
seated to callow the atmosphere to have much effect on him.  We very soon repaired the damages
which the schooner had sustained, and by the next morning we were all to rights.  Our chief
anxiety was for the brig.  We had lost sight of her in the squall, and we could not tell whether
she had been more prepared than we were to meet its fury.  Even had she not suffered from the
gale, the plague might have broken out in her.  Mr Vernon came occasionally on deck, but he
was compelled, from weakness, to spend the greater part of the day in his cot, though this
was very much against his inclination.  We had in vain questioned and cross-questioned our
prisoners, to discover if they knew anything of the fate of the Ariadne, but not a particle
of information could we obtain; and I was myself satisfied that they really knew nothing about
her.  Our late peril suggested a new cause of alarm to the mind of Mr Vernon, which apparently
had not before occurred to him; and he began to fear that the vessel in which the Normans had
sailed might have been overtaken by one of those white squalls so common in the Mediterranean,
and might have suffered the fate we so narrowly escaped.  Since the squall, our prisoners had
remained unusually quiet; though, while the plague was aboard, they were as noisy and blasphemous
in their conversation as ever.  The sick man continued in the same state as before, though
he seemed more reserved when I spoke to him than he had been at one time. He continued reading
all day, as long as there was light, and asked to be allowed to have a candle to read at night;
but this, of course, could not be permitted.  There was evidently something working in his
mind, which he would gladly be rid of, but could not.  Having lost so many hands, the duty
fell, naturally, more severely on the survivors; and we had enough to do to keep watch on deck,
and a vigilant guard over our prisoners.

One night I had charge of the deck.  Besides the man at the helm there was the look-out forward,
and two hands lying down by the windlass. There was no moon, and the sky was covered with clouds,
so that it was very dark.  As I kept moving about, now looking out to windward, now over the
lee-side, and then at the binnacle, to see that the schooner was kept on her proper course,
I fancied that I saw a dark figure come up the main-hatchway; and while I stopped at the waist,
I heard a voice, in a low whisper, say--

"Hist, sir, hist!  I want to speak to you."

"Who is it?" said I, in the same low tone.

"Bobby Smudge, sir; listen: there are not many moments to lose, before we shall all have our
throats cut, if we don't take care."

This piece of intelligence put me on the qui vive, though, remembering Master Smudge's pranks,
I own that I did not much credit it.

"Come here," said I, rather impatiently, "and let me know all about it."

"I didn't like to be seen, sir," he replied, coming cautiously up to me, and looking round
to ascertain that no one was near.  "I don't know, sir, who's a friend and who's an enemy aboard
here, just now."

"What do you mean, boy?"  I asked.

"Why, just this, sir.  That thundering scoundrel below there, is just trying hard to turn all
the men's heads; and if we don't look alive, he'll do it, too."

I now felt that there might be some truth in poor Smudge's information.

"Go on, my lad," said I.

"Well, sir, I has to confess that he first tried it on with me.  While the people were dying
with the plague, and no one was looking on, he called me to him, and told me that he knowed
where loads of gold was stowed away--enough to sink the ship and freight another twice the
size; and that if I would help him to get his liberty, he'd show it to me, and that I might
have as much as I wanted.  I listened to him, and thought there would be no great harm if I
was to help him to get free, and save his neck; so I agreed to take a message to the rest of
the brig's people, to tell them to keep up their spirits, and to try and get their arms and
legs out of limbo.  He then told me to hunt in the carpenter's chest for a file, and a cold-chisel
and hammer.  While I was looking one night for the tools, the thought struck me, all of a heap
like--if this chap was to get free, what would he do with Mr Vernon and you, sir, who had been
so kind to me, and saved me from so many of that Mr Chissel's finnams?  Why, he'll be cutting
their throats, to be sure, and making off with the schooner; and where should I then be, I
should like to know.  So I goes back to Captain Delano, and tells him I couldn't find the tools.
He swears a great deal at this, and tells me to go and look for them again; and that if I didn't
bring them, he'd be the death of me.  How he was to do me any harm while he was chained hand
and foot, I couldn't tell; but still I was very much frightened.  Well, howsomedever, I keeps
a watch on him, and I soon seed that he was trying it on with some of the Helen's crew; and
at last, that he'd got one of our people to listen to him.  How far he had succeeded in getting
them over to his plans, I couldn't tell till just now.  I had stowed myself away in the coil
of the hawser, just before the bulkhead of his cabin, where I lay in a dark shadow, so that
no one could see me, when I heard a man talking to him.  I made out that he had almost got
his fetters off his limbs, and that the other people would be shortly free of theirs; and that
they knew where the arms were to be found; and that as soon as they had got them, they would
make a rush on deck, and throw overboard all who wouldn't join them.  Then they were to carry
the schooner to the coast of Africa, to the very place where all Captain Delano's gold is stowed
away."

How much of this story might be true, and how much imagination, I could not tell; but it was
too serious a matter to allow any risk to be run; so I ordered him to slip below, and to beg
Mr Vernon would at once join me on deck with his pistols.  He was then to make his way forward,
and to rouse up Watson, with directions to him to come to us.  Bobby was so quick in his movements,
that before a minute had passed they both joined me.  They were but just in time, when some
dark heads were seen rising up above the combings of the hatchway.  Before, however, they had
time to make their footing good on the deck, Mr Vernon, Watson, and I had sprung on them, and
knocked them below again with the butt-ends of our pistols.  At the same time, before they
could make another attempt, the three men forward came running aft, and we quickly got the
hatches on over them.  There they and the two wretched traitors Delano had inveigled to release
them remained, like wild beasts shut up in a cage,--much more dangerous, however, for they
had the sentries' muskets, and perhaps other arms which might have been conveyed to them. 
They were, moreover, driven to desperation, and it therefore required great caution in dealing
with them.  Mr Vernon had recourse to a ruse to assist in damping their spirits.

"Brig ahoy!" he sung out, "send your boat aboard here well-armed; our prisoners have broken
loose.  Watson," he whispered, "go and get the people up from forward.  I suppose you can trust
them."

"Ay, ay, sir, they are all true enough," he replied; "it's only one of the merchant-brig's
crew, and that poor fellow, Nolan, who was always weak-like.  They ought never to have been
placed as sentries."

When all the people were mustered, we outnumbered the pirates; but, though we had arms in our
hands, so had they; and if we took the hatches off, we could scarcely hope that they would
yield without a struggle, which would very probably prove a bloody one.  Still, if we let them
remain below, they might commit some mischief--very probably set the ship on fire, or force
their way out through the bulkheads, either forward or aft, when we were not expecting them.
While this state of things was continuing, I happened to look over the side: my eyes caught
sight of an object looming through the darkness.

"A sail on the weather bow!"  I sung out, with no little satisfaction.

We hauled up a little, and stood for her.  She had seen us and shortened sail.

"What vessel is that?"  I inquired.

"A prize to his Majesty's ship Harold," answered the voice of Adam Stallman.

"All right; we want your aid.  Heave-to, and send your boat aboard, with the people well-armed,"
I sung out.

In a few minutes Adam himself stood on our deck, with four well-armed followers.  The inconvenience
of a lengthened quarantine, to which he would be exposed, was not, under the circumstances,
to be taken into consideration.  A plan of operations was soon settled on.  We agreed to have
lanterns ready, and by swinging them down into the hold the moment the hatches were off, we
hoped to discover where the pirates were stationed, and thus, if they attempted to fire, to
be able to take better aim at them in return.  It was an anxious moment.  At a signal the hatches
were in a moment thrown off.  Delano stood like a lion at bay, with a musket in his hand. 
He fired it at Stallman, and then attempted to spring up on deck.  Happily the ball missed
its aim, and he was knocked over by several stout fists, which his head encountered, and fell
like a log back into the hold.  Several shots were exchanged, and the four pirates fought desperately
in their hopeless attempt to regain their freedom.  They were soon, however, overpowered, and
borne down on the deck, without loss of life to either party.  The only people who did not
fight were the two traitors and the sick pirate, and he remained bound as before, having refused
to be liberated.  Delano had been stunned by his fall, and when he regained his senses, he
found himself again in irons, with additional chains round his arms.  This showed him probably
that all that had passed was not a dream, as it might otherwise have appeared to him.  He growled
out curses against his ill-luck, but he had no other means of venting his rage and disappointment.
The other men took the matter very coolly.  It appeared to me that their minds were too dull
and brutalised, and their hearts too callous, to comprehend their awful position.  Seared in
their consciences, they were truly given over to a reprobate mind.  The two men who had been
gained over by Delano to assist him we sent on board the brig, exchanging them for two who
could be relied on; and now our misfortunes seemed to have come to an end.  The young man I
have spoken of belonging to the pirate's crew, after this seemed to sink faster than ever.
Mr Vernon, in consideration of his condition, had him removed from the immediate neighbourhood
of the others, and placed within a screen in the after-part of the hold.  I then, at his request,
went to visit him one afternoon.  He was sitting up, with the Bible on his knees, and his back
resting against the bulkhead, so that the light which came down the hatchway-glanced on his
forehead and the leaves of the sacred book.  His hair, which was of a light brown (almost auburn,
it had probably been, as a lad), was very long, and hung down on either side of his high, smooth,
and sunburnt brow.  His dress was that of an ordinary seaman, and when he was first captured
it was perfectly neat and clean.  I went and sat down on a bucket by his side.

"I have asked to see you again, sir, for you are the best friend I have found for many a year,"
he began, in a weak voice, speaking apparently not without pain and difficulty.  "From this
book I have discovered, at length, the cause of all my crimes, my sufferings, and ultimate
doom. Disobedience brought me to what I now am.  I never learned to obey or to fear God or
man.  I was born in the same rank of life in which you move, perhaps with far greater expectations;
and when I think of what I might have been and what I am, it drives me to madness, and I wish
that I had never been born.  My father was a man of property and position, and much esteemed
for many virtues.  My mother was highly educated and refined, and of religions feeling.  It
might be supposed that a child of such parents could not but turn out well.  Unhappily for
me, they loved me much, but not wisely.  I was allowed to have my own way in all things, I
was never taught to obey.  As I grew up, my self-willed disposition became more and more developed.
I could not bear constraint of any sort.  Too late they discovered their error.  I had received
at home some little religious instruction; I even knew something about the contents of the
Bible, but its spirit was totally beyond my comprehension.  At last it was determined to send
me to school.  I went willingly enough, for the sake of the change; but, not liking it, ran
away.  I was not sent back, but instead a tutor was provided for me.  He was totally unfitted
for his occupation, and was unable, had he tried, to make any good impression on me.  We quarrelled
so continually, that he was dismissed, and I was persuaded to go to school again.  Once more
I ran away; but this time I did not run home.  I wanted to see the world, and I was resolved
to become a sailor.  I cannot bear to dwell on my ingratitude and heartlessness.  I knew that
my disappearance would almost break my mother's heart, and that my father would suffer equally;
yet I persevered.  I little thought what I was to go through.  A fine brig was on the point
of sailing for the coast of Africa.  I fell in with the master, and offered to go with him.
He asked no questions as to who I was, or where I came from; but, wanting a boy, he shipped
me at once.  The next day we were at sea, and all means of tracing me were lost.  I was not
ill-treated; for the captain, though bad enough in many respects, had taken a fancy to me.
We were to engage, I found, in the slave-trade.  At first I was shocked at the barbarities
I witnessed, but soon got accustomed to them.  We did not always keep to that business. The
profits were not large enough to satisfy our avarice; and even piracy we did not hesitate to
commit at times, when opportunity offered. At length the brig was cast away, and many of the
crew and all our ill-gotten gains were lost.  I, with two or three others, who escaped, shipped
on board a Spanish slaver.  We changed from bad to worse. Knives were in constant requisition;
more than once I dyed my hands in blood.  I gained a name, though a bad one; and was feared,
if not loved. Such was the training--such the scenes of my youth.  After a time I began to
weary of the life, and wished to see English faces, and to hear English spoken once more; so,
finding a vessel short of hands returning home, I ran from the slaver, and shipped on board
her.  We were cast away on the south coast of England; many of my shipmates never reached the
land.  I was picked up by a boat's crew when almost exhausted, and was carried by them into
a cave near the shore.

"They belonged to a large band of smugglers,--their leader one of the most daring and successful
on the coast.  I was too much hurt to be moved for some days, and passed the time listening
to their adventures, which they were at no pains to conceal.  I became so much interested in
their mode of life, that a few words of encouragement from their chief, who was known under
the name of Myers, induced me to join them.  I thought I would take a few cruises with him
before I paid a visit to my home, to inquire for my father and mother.  A wild life I spent
for some time.  Our lawless occupation led us into many acts of violence, in which I was never
backward.  One you are cognisant of.  I was in the cavern when you and your commanding officer
were brought there, and I assisted in hanging you over the pit.  I was a favourite with Myers;
and he trusted me entirely.  When he was obliged to leave the country, I had resolved to start
homeward; but was engaged in running a cargo on shore, when I was captured by the revenue men,
and after an imprisonment of some months, sent on board a man-of-war.  She was bound for the
coast of Africa.  I laughed at the climate which carried off many of my shipmates; but the
discipline of a king's ship did not suit me, and I took an early opportunity of running from her.

"I lived among the blacks for some time; but it was a weary life, and finding a trader homeward
bound, I got on board, and at length reached Liverpool.  I went to my father's house.  Both
he and my mother were alive, but I had great difficulty in persuading them of my identity.
When they were convinced of it, they were ready to receive me like the Prodigal.  But I had
not repented.  I was not fit to dwell with them.  I felt like a wild beast among lambs.  I
had not an idea in common with them.  When the novelty wore off, my evil habits came uppermost.
I asked my father for money.  He told me that he wished me to embrace some regular calling,
and desired to know what I would choose.  I laughed at the notion.  He still declined giving
me the sum I asked for, but I insisted that I must have it.  My looks alarmed him, and at length
he reluctantly gave it me.  With it I set off for Liverpool, where I soon spent it.  Then the
first pang of remorse came across me.  I thought of the calm quiet of that home for which I
had so completely unfitted myself.  I was meditating returning to it once more, and asking
my father to explain his wishes, when, as I was sauntering along the quays, I encountered Myers.
He was much disguised, but he knew me and stopped me.  He told me that he was engaged in a
scheme by which a rapid fortune was to be made; that he could not then unfold it; but that,
if I would ship on board a vessel with him, he would explain it when we were at sea.  My impulse
was to refuse; but I was tired and weary, and consented to enter a tavern with him.  He there
plied me with liquor till all my scruples vanished, and I became once more his slave.

"What occurred on board that vessel I cannot now tell; but you will probably know ere long.
But the favour I have to ask of you is, that if I die, as I hope to do before our trial, you
will find out my parents, and tell them, not all the truth, but how you encountered me on the
point of death, and that I died repentant."

I promised the unhappy young man that I would do as he desired, and, at his request, I took
down the name and address of his parents.

I have often since thought, as I recollected this story, that if parents did but consider the
misery they were storing up for themselves and their children by neglecting the precepts of
the wise King of Israel, they would, oftener than they do, search that book for counsel and
advice, and would teach their children also to seek instruction from its copious pages.

Oh! my young friends, remember that you cannot live well without some rule of conduct, any
more than you can steer a ship across the ocean without a compass or knowledge of the stars.
Then, let me urge you to take the best rule you can find; and where, let me ask, does there
exist one comparable, in any way, to that found in the Proverbs of Solomon? If you would be
truly wise, learn them by heart, and remember them always.

We were very thankful when, at length, we reached Malta harbour.  Of course we were put into
quarantine, but we were relieved from the charge of our prisoners.  To his own surprise, as
well as mine, Charles Adams-- so he called himself--the young man whose short history I have
just narrated, still survived, and there appeared every probability that he would be able to
undergo his trial.  Our first inquiry was to ascertain if any news had been received of the
Ariadne; but nothing had been heard of her, and poor Mr Vernon was doomed still longer to endure
the tortures of suspense.

At last our quarantine was concluded, the pirates were carried off to prison, and we returned
on board our ship, which had come in from a cruise just in time to receive us.  For several
days we did nothing but talk about our adventures with our own messmates, as well as with various
people who came off to see us.  I got great credit for the way in which I had saved the brig
from being blown up; though, as I was as much interested as any one else in the success of
the performance, I cannot say that I thought I had done any great thing.

Poor Bobby Smudge came in, too, for his share of praise for having informed us of the plot
of the pirates to retake the schooner; and most certainly he had been the means of saving all
our lives.  No one after this attempted to bully him, and I observed a marked improvement in
his appearance and character.

The trial of the pirates came on at once; and the Harold was kept in harbour, that we might
attend it as witnesses.  I will not enter into minute particulars.  The leading facts of the
case will be of sufficient interest.  Evidence had been collected to prove that the William
had sailed from England with one description of cargo, and that her master had disposed of
various articles not among it. A similar sense of unreality has been held to pervade the speeches.
It has been asserted that they are simply artificial compositions, never addressed and not capable of
being addressed to any audience of living men. Certainly one can hardly conceive of the last
chapters, with their minute description of the temple buildings,
officers and ceremonies, as forming part of a public address; and
some even of the earlier chapters, e.g. xvi., xxiii., do not suggest
that living contact with an audience which invests the earlier prophets
with their perennial dramatic interest.

At the same time, to regard him simply as an author and in no sense
as a public man would undoubtedly be to do him less than justice,
cf. xi.

25.

He was in any case a pastor--a new office in Israel, to which he was led by his overwhelming sense
of the indefeasible importance of the individual (iii.

18ff., xviii., xxxiii.). But--especially in his earlier ministry, till the fall of the city--he
was prophet as well as pastor, with a public message of condemnation
very much like that of his predecessors.

His reputation as a prophet naturally rose with the corroboration which his words had received
from the fall of the city, xxxiii. 30, but even before this it must have been high, as we
find him frequently consulted, viii. 1, xiv. 1, xx. 1; and though behind the real audience he
addresses, we often cannot help feeling that his words have in view that larger Israel of which
the exiles form a part (cf. vi.), the chapters, as they now stand, are no doubt in most cases
expansions of actual addresses. This view is strengthened by the precision of the numerous
chronological notices, cf. viii. 1.

There is another important aspect in which the contrast between Ezekiel and the pre-exilic prophets
is very great: viz. in his attitude to ritual.

Every one of them had expressed in emphatic language the relative, if not the absolute, indifference
of ritual to true religion (Amos v. 25, Hos. vi. 6, Isa. i. 11ff., Mic. vi. 6-8). No one had expressed
himself in language more strong and unmistakable than Ezekiel's contemporary, Jeremiah. Yet Ezekiel
himself devotes no less than nine chapters to a detailed programme for the ecclesiastical organization
of the state after the return from exile (xl.-xlviii.). With some justice Lucien Gautier has called
him the "clerical" prophet, and Duhm goes so far as to say that he annihilated spontaneous
and ethical religion. This, as we shall see, is a grave exaggeration; but there can be no doubt that
in Ezekiel the centre of gravity of prophecy has shifted. He threw ritual into a prominence which,
in prophecy, it had never had before, and which, from his day on, it successfully maintained (cf.
Hag., Zech., Mal.).

It is difficult to estimate justly the importance to Hebrew religion of the new turn given to
it by Ezekiel: it seems to be, and in reality it is, a descent from the more purely spiritual
and ethical conception of the earlier prophets.
  Finding, after they had been some time at sea together, that neither
his mates nor his crew were likely to refuse joining in any project he might suggest, he boldly
proposed to them to turn pirates; and not only to plunder any vessels they might fall in with,
whose crews were unable to offer resistance, but, by putting them out of the way, to prevent
all chance of detection.  They waited, however, till they got into the Mediterranean, and they
there fell in with a fine brig, out of London, laden with a valuable cargo.  They surprised
and overpowered the crew, whom they confined below, while they plundered her of everything
valuable.  Some of her crew had recognised them.  To let them live would certainly lead to
their own detection; so they scuttled the ship, and remained by her till she sunk beneath the
waves, with the hapless people they had plundered on board.  Then they went on their way rejoicing,
and confident that no witnesses existed of their crime.  They knew not of the Eye above which
had watched them; they thought not of the avenging witness in their own bosoms.  In the wildest
revels and debauchery they spent their ill-gotten wealth.  This time they were true to each
other, and if any one suspected that their gold was obtained by unfair means, it was found
impossible to prove anything against them.  It was before this, I believe, that Delano had
attempted to carry out some smuggling transaction at Malta, and had been thrown into prison;
on being liberated from which, ruined in fortune, he had taken to the desperate courses I have
described.  He next got command of the William brig, in which he was joined by four of his
old crew.  Two were put in by the owners,--the carpenter and another man. He would willingly
have sailed without them.  He was also joined by an old comrade, Bill Myers, who had just lost
his cutter off Portland.  He had no fears of finding any opposition to his projects from his
scruples.  The William lay alongside the Helen, which vessel was taking in a rich cargo.  He
easily excited the cupidity of his crew by pointing it out to them.  His own vessel had a cargo
of very inferior value--chiefly, I believe, of earthenware.  The William sailed a short time
before the Helen.  He first proposed the plan of plundering her to the four old pirates.  They
did not offer the slightest objection, but expressed their doubts whether all the crew would
join them.

"They must be made to do it," answered Delano, fiercely.

Myers at once acceded to Delano's proposal.  Charles Adams was the next to join them.  They
now felt themselves strong enough to talk openly of their project.  Each man boasted of the
deeds of atrocity he had committed with impunity, especially of their last act of piracy, and
of the mode in which they had spent the proceeds of their crime.  They told tales of the buccaneers
of old--of the adventures of pirates in their own day, of which they had heard, and of some
with which they were acquainted--of the hoards of wealth they had acquired.  When they found
that these stories had not sufficient effect with some of their shipmates, they applied to
Delano, and liquor was freely served out. Most of those who had before resisted now consented,
in their drunken state, to join in the proposed scheme.  The most persevering and eager tempter
was the mate.  If he could not persuade, he laughed away the scruples of the more honest or
more timid.

"Detection! nonsense!" he exclaimed.  "Who can ever find it out?  Who can know it, unless you
go and talk of it yourselves?  What's the reason against it?  Let's be men!  Let's be above
such folly!  If they go to the bottom--why, a gale of wind and a started butt might easily
send them there; so, where's the difference?  In one case, their rich cargo would go with them;
now, you see, shipmates, we shall get it.  So, hurra for the black flag, and overboard with
all scruples!"

Now, however glaring the folly and wickedness of such reasoning may appear to us, it seemed
very tempting and sensible to the miserable men to whom it was addressed.  The carpenter only,
and another man, refused to drink, or to participate in any way in the project.  They could
not, however, turn the rest from their intentions.  The treacherous mode in which the Helen
was taken possession of, I have already described. The carpenter alone held out; the other
man pretended to join them, with the hope, it appeared, of saving the lives of their prisoners.
When they had mastered the crew of the Helen, the pirates jeered and laughed at them, as they
were removing the cargo, and, bound as they were, even kicked and struck them, and treated
them with every indignity.  They then compelled the carpenter to accompany them on board with
his tools, and, holding a pistol at his head, made him bore holes in the ship's bottom.  No
one appeared to have been wilder or more savage than Adams.  Having completed this nefarious
work, as they thought, effectually, the pirates left their victims to their fate. They would
certainly have returned to remedy their mistake, and to send the Helen more speedily to the
bottom, when they caught sight of a ship of war in the distance.  They watched impatiently,
but still the Helen floated.  At length the strange sail drew near, and, fearful of being found
by her in the neighbourhood of the plundered vessel, they stood away under every stitch of
canvas they could set.  Scarcely had the deed been committed, than each began to fear that
the other would betray him; and, as if oaths could bind such wretches effectually, they all
agreed to swear, on crossed swords, that they would never divulge what had occurred.  They
compelled the carpenter and the other honest man to join them in their profane oath, threatening
to blow out their brains forthwith, if they refused.  It seems strange that men guilty of such
crimes should make use of the sign of the cross to confirm their oaths, and call God especially
to witness their misdeeds.  What extraordinary perversity such is of reason!  Yes; but are
not those we mix with every day guilty of similar wickedness and madness, when in their common
conversation they call on the name of the most high God to witness to some act of folly, if
not of vice, of extravagance, of cruelty, or senselessness?

The pirates sailed first for Leghorn, where they sold part of the plundered cargo, and spent
the proceeds in a way to excite much suspicion.  They then sailed for the island of Sardinia;
but they there found that they were already suspected.  Nothing could be more foolhardy than
their visit to Malta, where the crew spent their money in rigging themselves out in gold chains,
silk waistcoats, and green coats.  How their conduct should not have excited suspicion, I cannot
say; but it does not appear that the people with whom they dealt thought anything was wrong.
It is one of the numberless examples to prove that criminals are deprived even of ordinary
wisdom.  Delano, however, saw, from the way his crew were behaving, that if he remained long
at Malta, they would inevitably bring destruction on themselves.  Having, therefore, got them
on board, he sailed for Smyrna.  On the voyage Myers tried to induce them to plunder other
vessels; but none they could venture to attack fell in their way.  Their rage against Myers
was excessive when they found that he had attempted to blow them up, and that he had done so
doubtless for the purpose of getting possession of a considerable amount of treasure which
had been left on shore in the hands of an agent of Delano's.  I afterwards heard that he had
in all probability succeeded, as the agent had stated that he had presented an order from Delano
for its payment about the very moment we were taking possession of the brig, and, as he thought,
being blown into the air.  Search was made for him throughout Smyrna before we left the place,
and continued for some time afterwards; but the last accounts had brought no intelligence of
him, and it was concluded that he had escaped in disguise.

During the greater part of the trial, Delano had maintained his confidence and composure; but
at length the evidence of his own people, and the master and crew of the Helen, became so overwhelming
that he lost all hope, and, overcome by the most abject fear, sunk down, and would have fallen,
had he not been supported.  Recovering himself a little, he broke forth into earnest petitions
that his life might be spared.  He made the most trivial and weak excuses for his conduct,
utterly unlikely to avail him anything.  He declared that he had been led on by Myers; that
his crew had forced him to consent to the piracy; that he had endeavoured to dissuade them
from it, and that the fear of death alone had induced him to consent.  Nothing he could say
could, of course, alter the decision of his judges; and he, with six of his companions, was
condemned to be hung at the fore-yard-arms of the William, then lying in Quarantine Harbour.
It was dreadful to hear the shriek of despair to which Delano now gave vent.

"Mercy! mercy! mercy!" he cried.  "Oh, spare my life!  I am unfit to die!  Send me to toil
from day to day in chains, with the meanest in the land; but, oh, take not away that which
you cannot restore!"

"Let him be removed," said the judge of the court; and he was borne away, still crying out
for mercy.

The miserable man, who had never shown mercy to others, still besought it for himself.  The
other prisoners said not a word in their defence. One only voice was heard when all others
were hushed in the court.  It was solemn, though hollow and weak.

"Our doom is most just.  We suffer rightly; and may God have mercy on our souls," were the
words spoken.

I recognised the voice of Charles Adams.  I saw him the night before his execution.  He was
calm and happy.

"O that my fate," said he, "might be a warning to others! and I should feel still more contented
to die."

He begged to keep my Bible to the last, promising to give it to the chaplain to be delivered
to me.  I will not dwell on the dreadful particulars of the execution.  No Maltese could be
found willing to perform the office of executioner.  The chief of the police, therefore, ordered
a swinging stage to be formed on either side of the vessel, on which the criminals were placed
with ropes round their necks, secured to the fore-yard-arms, three on each side.  These stages
were secured in their horizontal position by ropes rove through blocks made fast to the fore-rigging,
with lanyards at the end.  As the chaplain reached a certain word in the Service, the seamen
stationed at the lanyards were ordered to cut them.  This was done, and the stages sinking
from under their feet, the miserable men were launched into eternity.  A barge was then brought
alongside, into which the bodies were lowered, and carried to Fort Ricasoli, at the entrance
of the great harbour.  Four of the bodies, being sewn up in tarred canvas, were hung in chains
to a lofty gibbet; while two were buried beneath it.  For many long months afterwards the four
pirates hung there,--a terrible and disgusting sight, and an awful warning to all who might
be inclined to pursue the same evil course.

The chaplain returned me my Bible the following day.  Within it I found a note from Adams,
first, thanking me warmly for my attention to him; and it then continued,--"Shameful as is
my merited fate, I would that all my young countrymen may know it.  Tell all you meet that
they are sent into this world, not to live for themselves, but for others,--as a place of trial,
not of amusement; that if they would secure contentment now, and happiness for the future,
they must, first of all things, learn to conquer themselves; they must overcome their tempers--their
passions--their love of ease--of self-indulgence; they must remember that they are surrounded
by snares and temptations of all sorts, all allowed to exist for the purpose of trying them;
that the devil is always going about, ever ready to present the bait most likely to lure them
to destruction.  I entreat you--I adjure you--to make this known wherever you can.  The knowledge
of this may save numbers from ruin.  It cannot too often be brought before the minds of the
young.  I was ignorant of it.  I thought that I had a right to follow my own inclinations,--that
it was manly to do so; and, oh! how sorely have I suffered for my ignorance!--how bitterly
do I repent my infatuation. Yet, miserable as is my fate, if I can but prove a warning to others,
I shall not have lived in vain."

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.

CAN SHE BE THE ARIADNE?--SAIL FOR THE REEF COAST--DISCOVER THE LOST VESSEL--MAKE A PRISONER--ADVENTURES
ON SHORE--VISIT THE OLD SHEIKH--FIND JACK STRETCHER--HOW WE DID THE REEFIANS--JACK AND HIS
HORNPIPE--OUR FLIGHT--PURSUED--ESCAPE.

So completely had Mr Vernon's health and spirits given way, that we on board the Harold were
afraid he would have to leave the ship and go home.  At this juncture a merchant-brig came
in from the westward, and the master reported that, having been driven close in on the African
coast, he had seen a vessel, apparently a complete wreck, on shore.  He stated that he had
stood-in to examine her more closely, when, seeing through his glass a number of armed men
come down and prepare to launch their boats, he judged it prudent to stand-off out of their
reach.  Mr Dunnage obtained this important information, and instantly brought it on board.
Mr Vernon's eye brightened as he heard it; for hope, almost extinguished, once more dawned
within him.

Captain Poynder, who felt a deep interest in the fate of Major Norman and his daughter, easily
managed to get ordered down to the Barbary coast to examine into the matter.  Having ascertained
from the master of the merchantman the spot, as nearly as he could describe it, where he had
seen the wreck, we made sail for the westward.  We came off the coast about dusk, and then
hove-to.  "Boats away!" was on this occasion a welcome sound; for we knew that it portended
that there was work to be done.  Mr Vernon commanded one of the boats, and I went with him.
Stallman had charge of a second, and Dicky Sharpe, who since our trip to Smyrna had much improved
in steadiness, accompanied him; while Stanfield, another mate, went in a third.  A light gun
was placed in the bow of each boat; and each man had a musket and brace of pistols, as well
as his cutlass; so that we were well-armed and ready for anything. We were in high spirits,
though we knew full well that it was no party of pleasure we were on; for, if discovered, we
might expect some pretty sharp fighting, as the inhabitants of that part of the coast are the
most warlike and determined pirates along the shores of the Mediterranean.  With muffled oars
and in perfect silence we pulled towards where the wreck was supposed to be.  There was no
moon; but the stars of a southern clime were shining--as they well know how to do in that region,--so
that we could distinguish the dark outline of the coast, backed by a range of high mountains.
The only sound was from the splash of our oars, which, as they rose rapidly from the water,
let drop a sparkling shower of phosphorescent fire.  I steered, while Mr Vernon with his night-glass
swept the coast, in the hopes of discovering the wreck.  We got close in with the shore; but
not a sign of her was to be seen.

"Avast pulling, and let the other boats close up," he whispered.

When the boats had got near enough, he ordered Stallman to pull to the eastward, and directed
me to steer to the west, and Stanfield to follow us.  That the coast was pretty thickly inhabited
we had strong evidence; for so close in with it were we, that we could hear dogs barking, and
music, and even human voices; while now and then the report of firearms showed that some Arabs
were coming home from hunting, or were firing off their muskets at some festival or other.
We had pulled at least five miles along the coast, when I fancied that I discerned, still further
on, some dark object on the sands.  We pulled up to it, and there, sure enough, lay a stranded
vessel.  Mr Vernon now directed Stanfield to wait off about a quarter of a mile, while we went
in and tried to board the vessel, to ascertain positively what she was.

"Should any accident happen to us, or should we be taken prisoners," he continued, "you will
wait till nearly dawn to render us assistance, in case you have an opportunity, and then make
the best of your way back to the ship.  Captain Poynder will then, without doubt, devise some
plan for rescuing us or any other persons we may find on shore."  Stanfield, of course, knew
very well what he meant by this, and promised to keep a bright look-out, whatever might occur.
Using still more caution than ever, we approached the vessel.  She lay with her head inshore,
in a small inlet, and it appeared much more likely that she had purposely been hauled in there,
than that she had been driven on shore.  There was ample water for our boat right under her
stern.  The stern-windows were open.  Holding on by the rudder-chain, Mr Vernon climbed up,
and got in at a sternport.  Without asking leave, I followed his example, and the bowman then
handed us up a lantern.  I had a match-box in my pocket.  We struck a light and lighted the
lantern, and then commenced an examination of the cabin.  At the first glance we saw it was
that of an English merchantman.  There were the state-cabins on either side, the buffets for
plate and crockery, the neat book-case, the racks for charts and telescopes, the sofa at one
end, and the fireplace, all showing an attention to the comfort of any passengers who might
be on board. Everything valuable had, however, been carried away, the more cumbrous articles
alone remaining.  Mr Vernon looked round with deep anxiety depicted on his countenance.  "Yes,
D'Arcy, this is indeed the Ariadne.  I know her well," he whispered.  "I myself put up that
book-case, and screwed in those hooks for a cot in the state-cabin.  Oh! what can their fate
be?  I must ascertain it without delay."

"It would never do to go on shore as you are at present, sir.  You would be taken prisoner
or murdered outright, to a certainty," I replied.  He was silent for a minute.

"You are right, D'Arcy, you are right," he replied, in a dejected tone. "The affair requires
time and great circumspection.  These people are not to be trifled with, I know.  Force alone
will not succeed, or I am certain Captain Poynder would land every man who can be spared from
the ship, and would compel these Reefians to let us know what has become of their captives."

"Yes, sir, and every man would gladly follow, wherever you might lead," I replied.

"I know they would--I know they would, D'Arcy," said he.  "But let us take a look over the
ship, and perhaps we may find out something to direct our proceedings."

We opened the cabin-door cautiously, and crept up the companion-ladder. The hatch was off.
We got on deck: no one was there.  Shrouding the lantern, we crept along the deck, and descended
into the main-hold.  The entire cargo had been removed.  We concluded that the vessel had no
one on board, and were about to return, when I suggested that we should look into the forepeak.
We therefore moved cautiously, as before, along the deck, and were descending the ladder, when
Mr Vernon touched my leg.

"There is some one breathing down here," he said.  "Be prepared for a rush."

When we got to the bottom of the ladder, as he threw the rays of the lantern round the place,
they fell on the sleeping form of a young Arab, dressed in a turban, and his white haick folded
gracefully round him. The instant the light fell on his eyes, he started up with a look of
mute astonishment, and laid his hand on the hilt of a dagger by his side.  Before he could
unsheath it, Mr Vernon had thrown himself upon him, and wrenched it from his grasp, while,
I following, we without much difficulty secured him; for, though graceful and active in appearance,
he had not much muscular power.  He did not call out.  Perhaps he disdained to do so.  But
to prevent him, should he show any inclination to call for help, Mr Vernon rather unceremoniously
thrust a handkerchief into his mouth.

"Now, hurry, D'Arcy, and call up one of the men to help carry this lad into the boat.  Here
is a prize worth having indeed," he said.  "He may be of incalculable service to us."  I did
as I was ordered, and he quickly got the lad securely bound and up on deck.  As we were dragging
him along, the handkerchief fell out of his mouth, and he gave a shriek, which showed that
he was no willing prisoner.  The noise, however, only made us hurry him along the faster down
the companion-ladder, and out at the port into the boat.  We handed him along into the stern-sheets,
and then, Mr Vernon giving the order to shove off, we backed out of the creek, and got the
boat's head round, to pull out to sea.  We were only just in tune, for the lad's cry had attracted
the notice of his friends; and we could hear people shouting, as they ran down to the beach,
to learn who it was that had cried out.  Unfortunately the splash of our oars attracted their
notice, and they began firing away at us, as fast as they could load their matchlocks.  "Give
way, my lads, give way!" cried Mr Vernon, more from habit than that the men required any inciting
to pull fast, as the shot came splattering about us.  The young Moor made one or two attempts
to rise, evidently with the intention of springing into the water, and swimming on shore again;
but we held him down; and, as we got further off, he either saw that the attempt would be useless,
or, from something he learned from the shouts of his countrymen, he thought it wiser to remain
quiet.  We were congratulating ourselves on none of the shot reaching us, and fancied that
we were getting out of danger, when we saw a dark object glide out from a creek or harbour
to the westward, followed by another, and then another, which we at once made out to be row-boats,
pulling probably some twenty oars or so, and famed for their speed.  We had the start of them,
however, by half a mile or more; and, as our two gigs were far from slow coaches, we did not
altogether despair of escaping.  Still the odds were fearfully against us; and, even if we
were not killed outright, potato-digging and water-drawing for the rest of our days was not
a pleasant prospect for contemplation, independent of failing in the object we had in view.
This made all hands bend to their oars with redoubled vigour.  Happily the row-boats had no
guns in their bows, or if they had, the people had forgotten their powder or shot, as the few
bullets which reached us now and then were the only missiles we had to dread.  Well, away we
pulled, with the Reefian row-boats after us, our great hopes being that we should decoy them
within range of the Harold's guns, and then, if we could bag a boat-load, we might hope to
treat advantageously for any prisoners they might have taken.  We made the dark, smooth water
hiss and bubble under our bows, as we clove our rapid way through it, throwing up a mass of
shining foam before us, and leaving a line of liquid fire in our wake.  We soon gained more
hope of escape, from the rate at which our pursuers came on; and we began to suspect that the
boats, probably in the hurry of the moment, were manned with old men and lads, and any one
who was at hand; and that they were likely rather to fall off than to increase their speed.
This proved to be the case.  We gained on them slowly at first, but more rapidly by degrees,
till we actually ran them out of sight.  Our next business was to find our ship; and I kept
a bright look-out for her.  Our young captive, meantime, lay at the bottom of the boat, and
when he found that we had escaped from his countrymen, he seemed to take things very coolly;
and when Mr Vernon assured him that we meant him no injury, he replied, that if we took his
life, his tribe would some day cut us up piecemeal, and throw the bits to the jackals.  As
we were pulling along, we heard a shout, which proved to come from Stallman, who had, of course,
seen no wreck; but he had discovered a spot where the water was deep up to the shore, and where
there appeared to be no inhabitants, so that he had been able to pull close in, and could have
landed, if necessary.  We now altogether pulled out to sea, and in another hour fell in with
the frigate.  She then stood off shore, and by daylight we were out of sight of land, so that
the Reefians could not have guessed who their visitors could have been.  I think that I before
have said that Mr Vernon was a great linguist.  He spoke Arabic perfectly, and was thus able
to hold communication with our young prisoner, whose fears, before long, he succeeded completely
in silencing, and whose confidence also he soon appeared to have gained.  All the morning Mr
Vernon was in earnest conversation with the young Reefian, and, by his countenance, he appeared
to be gaining information of a highly interesting character. He then went into the captain's
cabin, and after a long conversation with him, the ship's course was shaped for Tangiers.

Just before we reached that place, he called me to him.

"D'Arcy," he said, "I have remarked your steadiness and discretion above your years; and as
I have a difficult and--I will not conceal it from you--a hazardous expedition to make, in
which a companion to assist me would be very valuable, I wish to know whether, if the captain
will allow you, you would be willing to accompany me?"

Where is the midshipman who would not have answered as I did, and say that I should be delighted,
and that the more danger the better fun?  In fact, my heart almost came into my mouth at the
proposal; and my only fear was that the captain might put his veto on it.

"Oh! just tell him, sir," said I, "that I have neither father nor mother, nor brother nor sister;
and I don't think that the great Counsellor D'Arcy would break his heart if anything happened
to me, nor bring an action against him for expending a midshipman uselessly.  My other uncle
is a naval officer, and he would never dream of objecting."

I do not know if these reasons had any weight with the captain, but he granted his consent
to my accompanying Mr Vernon, who forthwith gave me a sketch of his proposed plan of proceeding.

"You must know, D'Arcy," said he, "that the young Reefian informs me that the Ariadne was driven
inshore by a heavy gale; and that before she had time to haul off, a calm came on, when several
boats, manned by his people, pulled off to her.  The master, who seems to have been a brave
fellow, had no notion of yielding without a blow, and, arming his crew, gave them a warm reception.
Several of the Reefians were killed and wounded before they could make good their footing on
board.  The gallant master was killed, and so were more than half his crew.  Major Norman and
the rest of the people escaped without a wound, though they expected to be cut to pieces; but
their defence had so excited the admiration of their captors, that they were, instead, treated
with considerable kindness, though ultimately marched off as prisoners.  Miss Norman was discovered
in the cabin; but when it was known who was her father, he was allowed to accompany her.  The
people who captured the brig belong to a tribe ruled over by a powerful chief, who resides
some miles along the coast.  He seems to have claimed the brig as his own perquisite; and this
youth, who is a relation of his, was living on board to take care of her.  Miss Norman and
her father likewise became his property, but I cannot speak my gratitude to Heaven, on finding
that she is treated with the most perfect respect, while her father is employed in the gardens
of the Kaid.  His young nephew describes him as a fierce, despotic old fellow, not at all likely
to give up his captives, unless compelled by force.  He says that he is so very wealthy, that
no temptation of a high ransom will influence him.  This, however, I am resolved, without delay,
to ascertain, and to employ every means in my power to liberate my friends.  He seems to owe
no allegiance to the Emperor of Morocco, or to any other acknowledged potentate; so that I
will not attempt the long business of negotiation, which would, too probably, end in disappointment.
At first I thought of taking the lad with me, but then I considered that he would be of more
service as a hostage on board; and I have promised him that, if his information be correct,
and I succeed in recovering my friends, I will give him an unerring rifle and a silver-mounted
dagger, so that I have won him over completely to our interest.  As I speak Arabic as well
as any Turk, I have resolved to assume the character of a Turkish jewel-merchant on a journey
to buy precious stones for the Sultan.  I feel that I can act the part very well.  How does
the plan strike you?"

"Very good; capital, sir," I answered, the romance of the thing taking my fancy immensely.
"But, as I do not speak a word of Arabic, or any Eastern language, I do not see how I am to
help you."

"I have thought of that," said Mr Vernon.  "You must pretend to be dumb; I hope that you will
not have to hold your tongue long.  I wish you also to take your violin.  I do not know that
the Turks ever play it; but you must be my slave, you know--a Christian slave, not long captured,--and
that will account for your knowledge of so Nazarene-like an instrument.  Miss Norman heard
you play once on board, and you will thus certainly attract her notice, and be able to hold
communication with her."

"Oh! excellent--excellent," I exclaimed, enchanted at finding the very event I had once dreamed
of about to be realised.  "When are we to commence our adventure?"

"As soon as I can arrange our costumes, and make other necessary preparations.  Captain Poynder,
after he has landed us, intends to watch off the coast, and to stand in at night, to be ready
to render us any assistance we may require."

Two days after this conversation, a party of travellers were seen issuing from the ancient
gates of the city of Tangiers,--in days long gone by, when Charles the Second ruled the land,
held by a British garrison, till delivered over to the Portuguese.  He who seemed to be the
leader of the party rode a strong, active horse, and was habited in long, dark, flowing robes,
a turban of many folds of muslin, long yellow boots, and spurs of great size.  A large moustache,
and a beard bushy and long, almost concealed his month.  The ink-horn at his waist, and his
want of weapons of defence, showed that he was a peaceable character.  A lad also, in an Eastern
dress, though of simple and somewhat coarse materials, followed him on a stout mule, which
likewise carried a pair of saddle-bags, and a small square chest secured in front.  Slung over
the back of the youth was a long case, of curious form.  A dagger at his side was the only
arm he wore.  A tall man, well-armed with matchlock and scimitar, rode ahead on a stout nag.
On his head was the high red Moorish cap, with many folds of muslin twisted round it.  The
flowing hair fell over his shoulders, above which he wore a soolham of red cloth, while gaily-worked
yellow boots, and a pair of spurs of cruel length and sharpness, adorned his feet.  He evidently
felt his importance, as the protector and fighting-man of the party. Another personage followed,
of inferior rank, with a mule, which carried the chief part of the baggage.  The country through
which they travelled was of an undulating character, but parched by the suns of summer, the
beds of the winter torrents being now stony ravines, and the only green visible being furze
and palmetto, and here and there patches of Indian corn not quite ripe, though the stubble
of fine wheat and barley extended over a considerable portion of the ground.

"D'Arcy, my boy, how do you like being turned into a young Turk?" said Mr Vernon, calling me
up to him, after we had proceeded some way.

I touched my mouth, and pointed to out escort.

"Never mind them," he replied; "they are, I am assured, faithful to the backbone, and know
how matters stand.  There is little use of giving such men half-confidences."

"Then," said I, "I'll make play with my tongue while I can.  I like the fun amazingly.  What
do you propose to do, sir, next?"

"In the first place, when we get up to the territory of the old chief, Mulai Mohamed, we must
leave our escort and proceed alone to his village.  We must present ourselves at his residence,
and, inquiring whether he has jewels to sell or wishes to buy others, must endeavour to gain
access to the inmates of his harem; or, at all events, we must try to meet with Major Norman,
or some of the crew of the Ariadne. However, we must be guided entirely by circumstances."

It was a great satisfaction to me to be able to talk, for I fancied that I should have had
to hold my tongue from the moment I set foot on shore. I wish that my space would allow me
to describe my journey, for it lasted a considerable number of days, and was very amusing.
We pushed on as rapidly as the strength of our steeds would allow, though that was far from
fast enough to suit Mr Vernon's impatience.  We met with a variety of adventures also.  At
night we used to halt, and pitch our tent, and fetch water, and cook our supper; while our
followers would sit before the fire, recounting their adventures, or boasting of the deeds
of their ancestors or friends, or telling tales of genii or ghouls, and a variety of other
beings, in whose existence they firmly believe.  As we journeyed on, we killed a quantity of
game, chiefly partridges, which crossed our path in great numbers; and now and then we got
a shot at a wild boar, and knocked him over.  At night, watch was always kept with a good fire,
or we should have had the jackals, who were always howling round us, paying us a visit.  These
beasts the Moors do not object to eat, though they will not touch pig.  We one day fell in
with an encampment of a powerful tribe, the Sheikh of which insisted on my master, Taleb Moostafa,
otherwise Lieutenant Vernon, dining with him.  I accompanied him for the pleasure of looking
on, though, of course, I was not expected to eat likewise.  On arriving at the tent of the
Sheikh, we found him seated within it, on a cushion, covered with thick skin, another being
placed for the Taleb, or scribe, for to that learned profession Mr Vernon thought he might
venture to belong.  A variety of compliments having passed, a table was brought in and placed
between them.  It was circular, about two feet in diameter, and scarcely more than six inches
from the ground, richly inlaid and painted in arabesque.  A large bowl, full of a highly-seasoned
soup, with some sort of macaroni in it, was first placed on the table.  The bowl contained
spoons, with which the guests were to help themselves at the same time. Next came a plate of
beef, much stewed, and garnished with melons; and lastly a huge dish of kesksoo,--a thick porridge,
made of wheaten flour piled up, which the Sheikh attacked most vigorously, while my master
attempted to follow his example.  When dinner was over, some of the tribe assembled on horseback,
and played all sorts of pranks.  Some stood on their heads while their horses went; they charged
each other at a rapid speed; they changed places with their companions at full gallop; then
they would dash up to where we stood, and, discharging their muskets, wheel about and give
place to others, who followed at their heels.  Some would dash their haicks or turbans on the
ground, and leaning from their horses, would pick them up, without for an instant slackening
their speed.  Next they shot at a mark, a flower on a pile of stones being their target; and
certainly they managed to hit it in a wonderful way.  The same men, however, would probably
have but a poor bag of game to show after a day's walk over the moors in Scotland.  Our friendly
Sheikh accompanied us some way on our journey on the following day, with many good wishes for
our welfare.  I must leave out the rest of our adventures, till one evening, Hamed, our chief
guide, pointing to a line of lofty mountains which fringed the coast, exclaimed--

"There, most learned Taleb, at the foot of yonder mountains, you will find the residence of
the fierce Sheikh you seek.  Further we dare not go, as we have no wish to feel our throats
being cut.  Here we will remain till you return, if you ever do return, which Allah grant may
soon be, though I am doubtful of it.  If you do not come back, we will report your loss to
your friends, and trust they may find means to avenge you."

Taleb Mohammed laughed at this speech, though he saw the difficulties in our way; and next
morning, leaving our tents and heavy baggage, we entered the district of the Reefian chief.
It was towards evening that we approached his dwelling, which we discovered from its superior
size to the rest of the neighbouring sun-dried brick cottages, thatched with reeds.  It was
surrounded by a garden, full of melon plants and vines, and many other fruits, delicious in
a hot climate; and backed by fields of Indian corn.  Before entering the village, we ascended
a height, whence Mr Vernon took a long anxious glance over the blue sea with his telescope,
which he had brought with him.

"There she is, D'Arcy," he exclaimed at length, in an animated tone, pointing to a white speck
just seen above the horizon, which I made out to be a ship's royal.  "I knew that Captain Poynder
would be up to his time.  Now we can depend on help from without, if we can but find our friends."

It was near the time that the voice of the Mueddin, from the summit of the village mosque,
announced that the hour of evening prayer had arrived, and called on the faithful to worship
Allah, when we entered the village.  Without halting, we rode at once up to the entrance-gate
of the great man's abode.  Cool confidence afforded us the best chance of success.  We were
brought up at a porch, with a closed gate, in a high wall which ran round the mansion.  We
knocked loudly, and after a time the gate was opened by a slave, who salaamed low as he demanded
our business.

"To see your great, powerful, and most illustrious master, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera," said
Mr Vernon, in Arabic.  "Tell him that I have come to treat with him about a matter of great
importance."

The slave on this disappeared, keeping us outside, though he shortly returned, with two or
three more slaves and a couple of armed men.  Two of the slaves taking our steeds, the first
signed us to advance, and led the way through a garden full of sweet-scented plants, the verbena,
the jessamine, and rose, and shaded by luxuriant vines, trailed on bamboo trellice-work over
head, the fruit hanging down in tempting bunches within our reach.  In front of an alcove,
or summer-house, on a rich carpet, sat a stout old man, in flowing robes, and long white beard,
which hung down over his breast.  We bowed low, and then stood still before him, for he did
not offer us cushions to sit on; while Mr Vernon, paying the fullest compliments his knowledge
of the language could command, opened his business.

"I do not understand clearly what all this is about," said the old Sheikh, in reply.  "Jewels
to sell and jewels to buy.  Perhaps to-morrow I may understand better.  Come again in the forenoon,
and show me your wares, and we will see what is to be done."

Taking this remark as a signal that we were dismissed, we salaamed as before, and retired down
the garden.  We had reached the entrance, when a slave overtook us, and informed us that his
master would allow us to sleep in a guest-room, opening into an outer court-yard, on one side
of the main entrance.  Mr Vernon told me afterwards, that not having any definite plan, he
thought it would be wise to accept the Sheikh's offer with a good grace, as more likely not
to excite suspicion.  The room to which we were shown was a small one, without windows or furniture,
some little apertures over the entrance alone admitting light and air when the door was shut.
It had the advantage, however, of enabling us to get out without being observed. To-day Nance had
a bag to pick from. Here lay her chance. The girls who took the rags from the bags were the most
apt to find treasures, and their turn came only once a month.

She was fast nearing the bottom of the last bag. Every time she thrust her hand in, her heart beat
fast, and she thought, "Shall I keep it, if I find anything?"

Once more, and her hand touches something cold; her fingers close round it, and she draws it
out. Her head swims, she clutches the table with her other hand to keep from falling--perhaps,
after all, it is only a button. She collects herself, and peeps slyly into her hand.

A gold thimble!

No one has seen it, no one knows, and Nance slips it into her pocket, and goes on with her work;
but somehow it doesn't run smoothly. It is "Silk, cotton, woollen, linen," and then "Cotton, woollen,
linen, silk," and the girls find fault because the piles are "mixed," and then the bell rings,
and they are free for to-day.

Cautiously Nance makes inquiries about the "finds." How much did they sell things for, if they found
any?

"My aunt," said one girl, "onst foun' a gol' ring, an' the jew'ler
give her a dollar for 't."

"He melted it down," explained another. "They allus does that. He told me one day that if ever
I found a gold breas'pin or a bracelet, 'which 'tain't noways likely you will,' sez he, 'fetch
it to me, an' I'll give you what's right for it.'"

So Nance's "find" was really worth money. More money, too, than she could earn in many days'
steady toil. What would it not buy! Food, clothing, warmth, everything,
seemed within her reach now that she held that source of wealth in
her hand.

"'Tain't stealin', I hope," thought Nance. "Course not.
I don' know who it belongs to."

When alone, Nance took out the thimble.
What a dainty little thing it was! She tried it on each of her hard,
bony fingers, and laughed to see the poor grimy things wearing a golden
crown.

Why, there were letters on it!

"Reel writin'!" cried Nance,
as she paused under a street lamp to spell the word by its light.

"Onst
I could read writin'. That first mus' be a capertin--that's what they
call them big fellers that stands first--a kin' of a Gennyrel with
his soljers. Oh! I don' know the capertins--never got acquainted when
I went to school; common letters was good enough for me.  I now urged Jack to go and find the major, to let him know that help was at hand.

"Time enough by-and-by, when he comes in from the fields, where they've sent the poor gentleman
to work.  They put me to field labour at first, but they found out that I was handy as a rigger,
so they've put me to refitting some of their craft.  They've given me to understand that if
I'll consent to turn Moor or Turk, or somewhat of that sort, and worship their Prophet, they'll
make me a captain, or admiral for what I know, and will give me one of their black-eyed young
women for a wife; but I'll see them all triced up at their own yard-arms before I changes my
religion, or forgets my own faithful rosy-cheeked Poll at home."

I applauded his resolution, and charged him to adhere to it in ease he should not escape.

"No fear of me, sir, I hope," he answered.  "But, I say, sir," he added, in a serious tone,
"I hope Mr Vernon, who used to be a very nice young gentleman when I knew him in the Turtle,
ain't turned Turk in earnest."

I assured him that he was only acting the part for a short time, which, I believed, was lawful.

"Well, I'm glad of that, sir," he replied.  "But, I say, sir, what do you think?"  He looked
out of the door, and then came back, and continued,--"I see a number of these Moorish fellows
coming here, drawn, it's pretty clear, by your music.  Now I'll just see if we can't astonish
the natives.  Do you strike up a right jolly hornpipe, and I'll toe and heel it till all's
blue, and see if I don't make them understand what a real sailor can do with his feet when
he's inclined."

The idea pleased me amazingly; so I came to the door, and began to scrape away right merrily,
while Jack commenced one of the wildest hornpipes I ever saw danced.  How he cut and shuffled,--how
he crossed his feet and sprang up in the air, and kicked and capered,--it is almost impossible
to describe.  I could scarcely forbear laughing myself, especially when I saw a number of grave
long-bearded Moors assembled round him, with looks of mute astonishment and admiration at his
agility.

Mr Vernon soon joined them, and was as much astonished, evidently, as the rest.  At last even
Jack's physical powers could hold out no longer, and, exhausted, he threw himself down on one
of our horse-rugs near the door.  He had, however, not remained there long, when one of the
Sheikh's slaves made his appearance, and, salaaming Mr Vernon, said that his master had been
informed that his young follower possessed a wonderful instrument, and a wonderful talent for
playing on it, and that he wished to hear him.  He intimated also to Jack that he must get
up and go through his hornpipe again.  Jack, nothing loth, sprang to his feet, and, as he passed
Mr Vernon he whispered, "Now's your time, sir; look about you."

We and several of the spectators were now forthwith ushered into the presence of the great
chief.  We found him seated in the garden-porch of his house, a number of lamps hanging from
the trees around him.  It was a picturesque and romantic scene.  Four or five persons--mostly
grave old gentlemen with long white beards--sat on cushions on either side of him; while others,
in rich dresses, which betokened some rank, stood behind him.  He had evidently been having
a dinner party, and now wanted an evening entertainment.  Mr Vernon salaamed before him, and
asked what was the pleasure of so generous, magnificent, and grand a chief.

"Why, this: Understanding your young slave can play in a wondrous manner, I wish to hear him,"
said the Sheikh.  "But tell me, O merchant! how is it that he can communicate with my captive,
as I am told he does. They must have been acquainted before."

This question at first puzzled the pretended Turk, but he promptly replied, "O most wise and
sagacious chief, worthy of being monarch of the faithful, know that these Nazarenes are in
their youth instructed in many arts and sciences.  Some play on instruments, some dance, others
sing, or paint likenesses of men and beasts, strange abomination as that may appear.  Now my
slave is one who has learned to play on an instrument, and he who has the happiness to be owned
by your highness, is one who has learned to dance."

"I see, I see," exclaimed the chief; "and it is a sin that two such accomplished slaves should
belong to different masters; therefore, merchant, what price do you fix on yours? for, if he
answers my expectations, I intend to become his purchaser."

This announcement puzzled Mr Vernon somewhat; but, of course, he could not refuse at once.

"He is unworthy of being possessed by your highness," he replied; "for nature has not allowed
him the power of speech.  But, rather than speak of that matter, let him show you a specimen
of his art."

He then made a sign to me, and I struck up Jack's favourite hornpipe; the Moors, old and young,
black beards and grey, short and long, forming a circle round him.  Up he jumped, and, with
arms akimbo, commenced his dance.  If he had before shuffled, and kicked, and capered, he now
redoubled his efforts, snapping his fingers, clapping his hands, turning and twisting in every
conceivable way.  Scarcely ever before was such a hornpipe danced.  It drew forth rounds of
applause from even the gravest of the spectators.  The chief was delighted.  Turning to one
of his attendants, he gave an order, which I did not then comprehend.  Mr Vernon had kept outside
the circle, to be ready for any emergency which, as Jack hinted, might occur.  I, meantime,
played away a variety of other tunes, till Jack, jumping up from the spot where he had thrown
himself, made a sign to me to begin another hornpipe.  This time he even outdid either of his
former attempts; indeed, before, I believe that he was only shamming being tired; for my fingers
and elbows began to ache before his legs or breath gave any signs of his wish to end the dance.

"Change the tune, Mr D'Arcy.  Wallop-ahoo-aboo!  I'll just give them an Irish jig to keep them
staring."

A jig I played, and a jig he danced, with agility enough to win the heart of any Nora Creina
in old Ireland.  Then I tried a Scotch reel, and he almost outdid the jig: nor did he cease
till he saw Mr Vernon rejoin the circle.

"Now if we haven't bamboozled the old gentleman famously, my name's not Jack Stretcher!" he
exclaimed with a loud laugh, slapping his thigh; an action which was naturally supposed by
his audience to mark the finale of his barbaric dances.

Exclamations of wonder broke from the lips of all around; and I, having played a few more airs,
we were dismissed, graciously, to our dormitory.

Mr Vernon then told me that, while Jack was dancing, he had managed to speak both to Major
Norman and his daughter, the chief having sent for the inmates of his harem to witness the
strange seaman's dancing.

It was arranged that we should the following night try to communicate with the frigate's boats;
and if they could manage to send a party on shore, that we should scale the walls of the harem,
and carry off Miss Norman--they being ready to support us.  She, at at all events, would be
prepared for the emergency.

Mr Vernon told me that, from what he heard, there would be no use negotiating, as the old chief
boasted that he never had given up a slave he had taken, and never would.  He was also subject
to fits of fury, so that no time was to be lost in carrying out our plans.  The great difficulty
was to communicate with the boats, but Jack undertook the task.  While employed in the harbour
he had observed where some small skiffs lay, and he declared that he could easily steal off
with one of them, and should without difficulty fall in with the boats.  The next day was to
be spent in marking out our line of retreat, and in settling the spot at which the boats were
to land.

In the afternoon Mr Vernon was sent for to exhibit his jewels, and I went with him.  The Sheikh
laughed at the idea of he himself having any to sell, but he had no objection to buy some;
and that the ladies of the harem might select for themselves, we were ushered to the entrance
of its sacred precincts.  I kept my eyes very sharp about me, and I saw that, by scaling a
not very high wall, we could easily get up to the very door of the harem, which was separated
from the main building.  I at once recognised Miss Norman, though she was veiled like the rest
of the ladies.  She came forward to examine the jewels, and looked at several which the Sheikh
offered her.  One after the other she put them back into the box, till at last Mr Vernon contrived,
unobserved, to slip a paper into her hand.

"It's all right," thought I.  "Miss Norman will now be prepared when we are ready to help her
to escape."

A few jewels were bought; but Mr Vernon signifying that he would be happy to return on the
following day, should any of the ladies desire to change their mind, they unanimously declared
that he must certainly come.

Several times during the day Jack made excuses for coming up from the harbour, and each tune
brought his ample pockets full of rope.  As soon as it was dark he came cautiously into our
chamber, where we all set to work, and in a short time had manufactured a rope-ladder quite
long enough to go over the garden wall.

"Now," said he, "I must be off, and try and fall in with the frigate's boats.  I have a skiff
all ready, but I may have some way to pull; so don't, sir, make a start till I come back and
let you know all's right."

Several very anxious hours passed away after Jack's departure, and Mr Vernon and I at last
began to fear that some accident had occurred to him, or that he had missed the boats, and
that we should have to risk another day within the old Sheikh's power.  Major Norman and his
daughter must have been still more anxious, for they were separated from each other, and less
able to account for the delay than we were.  At length our anxious ears caught the sound of
a light footstep, and Jack poked his head in at the door.

"All right," he whispered.  "The boats are ready to pull in when I signalise them.  While you,
gentlemen, go and get the young lady, I'll be off and call the major."

Eagerly Mr Vernon and I hurried out, carrying the ladder between us. It was a wonder some of
the numerous dogs, found in every Moorish village, did not give tongue at us.  We reached the
part of the wall nearest the harem.  Mr Vernon soon clambered up it, and, hoisting up the ladder,
secured one end on the garden side, by pegs in the ground, which we had before prepared; while
I held down the outer side.  I heard him give a low whistle, as he had arranged.  While I was
anxiously waiting his return, I felt a hand placed on my shoulder.  I started with horror,
and almost let go the ladder, for I thought it was a Moor come to capture me, and that our
enterprise had failed; but, looking up, I saw Jack's honest face, and Major Norman behind him.

"I think, sir," said Jack, "if you were to go over the wall, and help the lady up, it would
make quicker work, and it won't take you long to follow."

His advice seemed so good that I did as he recommended.  Fortunately I did so, for I do not
think otherwise the ladder would have kept in its place.  I found Mr Vernon waiting at the
door of the harem, in despair almost at the non-appearance of Miss Norman.  At length the bars
within were gently removed, and, the door opening, she stepped forth into the garden.  There
was no time for greeting.  Closing the door, Mr Vernon took her hand, and hurried on to the
ladder.  Climbing up, he had lifted her over the wall, and placed her in safety in her father's
arms, and I was following, when a door in another part of the building flew open, and a bright
light streaming forth, I saw the old chief and a number of his attendants, with arms in their
hands, rush out into the garden.  I was over the wall in an instant, pulling the ladder after
me, and not waiting to see which way they came.

"Fly, sir, fly!"  I exclaimed.  "The old tiger is after us."

No second warning was necessary, and Mr Vernon and her father, lifting Miss Norman between
them, hurried along the road towards the beach, Jack and I bringing up the rear, to keep our
pursuers at bay.  Lights now appeared in different parts of the village, and just as we turned
a corner we saw the old Sheikh and his people in hot pursuit of us.

"Run, sir! run as fast as your legs can carry you, and bring up the people from the boats,"
cried Jack, as he saw our enemies coming after us, and drawing a cutlass with which he had
provided himself from the boats, and buckled to his side.  "I'll keep these chaps off from
the young lady till help comes to us, I'll warrant."

I darted forward as fast as my legs could carry me.  I was afraid every instant of being stopped
by some Moor who might dart out from his house; but happily at that time the inhabitants of
the village were fast asleep, and as yet there had been no noise to awaken them.  Fortunately
the old Sheikh was too fat to move fast; and his slaves, probably, had no fancy to encounter
the formidable Englishman, whose agility of heel had made them fancy him little short of a
Gin, or evil spirit of some sort.  At last I reached the little creek where the boats were
lying, the men resting on their oars, ready to shove off at a moment's warning.

"Help! help!"  I exclaimed, panting for breath.  "Help! or Mr Vernon will be retaken."

In a moment Adam Stallman, and a dozen men from the different boats, were by my side.  All
had been arranged for the emergency which had occurred.  On we ran, in close order, at a double-quick
step.  Scarcely were we in time.  The Moors were up to our friends, but Jack was laying about
him in such gallant style, that no one could manage to lay hold upon them.  His sword flew
round his head like a flash of lightning; and though his opponents cut and thrust at him from
all sides, he remained unhurt, while he had drawn blood from several of their sides.  He shouted,
and shrieked, and leaped about, springing now on one side, now on the other, yet back again
in the middle of the road, if they attempted to press too much forward.  Stallman, seeing at
a glance how affairs stood, divided his people, so that they could encircle Mr Vernon and his
friends; and then, coming up to Jack's assistance, for a moment entirely drove back his assailants.
By this time the whole village was aroused, and the Moors, collecting in numbers from the houses,
attacked us furiously on all sides.  Our brave fellows, however, kept them at bay, and retreated
in good order towards the boats.  We had no time to lose, in truth, for they were making for
the boats themselves, and, if they got in our rear, might cut us off, and overpower also the
party left in the boats.  It was with no small satisfaction that I heard the voice of Dicky
Sharpe shouting out to us to come on; and then a brisk fire from the men with him cleared the
intervening space of Reefians, who had got ahead of us.  The old chief and his slaves had hitherto
not fired, either for fear of hurting Miss Norman, or because they had no powder or firearms.
Now, however, the blood of all parties was up, and pistols began to flash, and sabres to clash,
and a hot fight was going on, as we made a dash for the boats, and Miss Norman was lifted safely
in.  The Reefians now rushed furiously down on us.  Adam Stallman and Jack Stretcher were the
last men in, they keeping a whole host of Moors at bay, while the boats were being shoved off;
then, by a desperate leap, Jack, by Stallman's order, got into one of the boats, while he himself
sprang into another.  Alas! at that moment a volley came rattling down among us, and before
Stallman could take his seat he fell into the bottom of the boat.  It was the one I had reached.
I stooped down.

"Where are you hurt, Stallman?  Oh! tell me, tell me," I exclaimed, taking his hand.

"In my side; lend me a handkerchief, pray," he answered, faintly.  "But give way, my lads--give
way; never mind me."

The men had stopped in their exertions for a moment, and were leaning forward to discover if
he was much hurt.  They needed not, however, a second order, for volley after volley came rattling
over us; while the foremost and more daring Reefians in their rage rushed into the water, in
the hope of seizing us.  Some who grasped the gunnel had reason to repent their temerity; for
we dealt them such blows with our cutlasses, that they were compelled to let go, every wound
they received increasing their fury.  Others waded after us up to their arm-pits, firing their
pistols, and cutting at us with their scimitars, shouting fiercely at us all the time, and
grinding their teeth with rage and disappointment.  It was no child's play; for, had they caught
us, they would have destroyed every one of the party.  By dint of great exertion the boats
were at length got clear and into deep water.  By the flashes of the firearms I could see the
old Sheikh standing on the beach, and trying to urge his followers to pursue us still further.
When they found that all hope of preventing our embarkation had gone, they hurried of to the
harbour to launch their own boats for the pursuit.  We had a long way to pull, several of our
people were hurt, and the boats were likewise full of men; so that we felt we were far from
certain of escaping after all. Mr Vernon ordered the gun in the bow of his boat to be fired,
to draw the attention of the frigate, should she not have heard the sound of the musketry;
and I followed his example.  By this time we were a couple of miles or more away from the shore,
but the frigate was still some five or six miles from us.  Before long, by the light of the
dawn just breaking, we could see the Reefian boats stealing out from the land; but we had now
no great fear of being caught.  Still our enemies pulled very fast, and were animated with
every feeling of rage and revenge to excite them to exertion.  Hitherto there had been a dead
calm, which much facilitated our progress; and as the gloom of night cleared away, we could
see, in the grey of the morning, the frigate's topsails hanging uselessly in the brails.  I
kept anxiously looking back at our pursuers.

"Do they gain on us?" asked Stallman, who sat propped up in the stern-sheets.

"I fear so," I replied; "but the frigate is still not so very far off."

"If they overtake us, I will ask you, D'Arcy, to drop astern a little, and try and keep them
at bay, so as to afford the first gig a better chance of escaping," he said, faintly.

This was the boat Miss Norman was in.

"Of course, Stallman," I answered, "every one here will do their best to defend the young lady.
Won't you, my lads?"

"Ay, ay, sir; never fear," replied the men, with one voice, at the same time giving a cheer.
"Hurra! hurra!"

The enemy's boats were now drawing uncomfortably near, and the headmost ones had begun to fire,
though their shot did not reach us.  Still it was too evident that they would be up to us before
the frigate could come to our assistance.  There she still lay, like a log on the water. I
did not much fear the enemy; but I knew if they overtook us, even if we escaped, it would be
the cause of much more bloodshed.  Presently, as I was thinking of this, I saw a light ripple
curling over the smooth, shining surface of the leaden-coloured sea.  Another and another cat's-paw
followed; the frigate let fall her topsails--they were sheeted home; sail after sail was set;
and just then, as the sun rose in a blaze of glory, our gallant ship was seen standing towards
us--a magnificent and welcome sight--under a press of canvas, lighted up by the bright rays
of the warmth-giving luminary.  A simultaneous cheer rose from the boats' crews as they beheld
the spectacle; and, with redoubled efforts, they gave way to meet the ship.  The Reefians saw
that their prospect of catching us was gone; and giving us a parting, though happily harmless
volley, they pulled round, and made all haste to the shore, to avoid being themselves in their
turn pursued and captured.  We were, soon after this, on board, and heartily welcomed.  The
poor fellows--there were four or five of them who had been badly wounded--were carried to their
hammocks, and tended carefully by the surgeon.  Adam Stallman was conveyed to Mr Vernon's berth
in the gun-room.  He was evidently more hurt than anybody else.  The doctor gave a very unfavourable
report of his case to the captain from the first.  Every one on board grieved much to hear
of his danger, for he was much beloved; but he seemed calm and contented.  When I saw him his
looks were cheerful--a smile was on his lips.  Few would have believed that he was a person
about shortly to die, and that he full well knew it.  It was not a stoical indifference to
death; not the courage of a man endowed with physical hardihood; but true Christian fortitude
and resignation to the will of God, trust in his Maker's promises, hope in the future, which
supported him.  We were now returning to Malta; for Captain Poynder saw that there would be
no use of attempting to punish the Reefians for their late acts, and that we should certainly
only be the chief sufferers if we attacked them.

One day Adam Stallman sent for Dicky Sharpe and me.

"My dear boys," he said, "I have sometimes given you good advice, and I much regret that I
have not given you more, as you always took it well. I may never have an opportunity of speaking
to you again."

"Oh! don't say so, Stallman," sobbed my young messmate.  "Don't die! You must recover, and
stay with us."

"Life and death are in God's hands alone," replied Adam Stallman.  "As you have a regard for
me, promise me that you will try not to forget what I say to you.  Remember always that you
were sent into this world as a place of trial--that you have numberless bad propensities existing
in you, and many temptations constantly offered to you--that your trial consists in the way
you conquer the one and resist the other; but also recollect that you have no power whatever
of yourselves to do this--that of yourselves you would not even know how to resist--you would
not know that it was necessary to resist.  But then you must know that God is just, merciful,
and kind; that He has given mankind a guide, not only to tell them that they must resist, but
to show them how to resist temptation--how to conquer evil propensities; that if they will
pray to Him, He will give them knowledge and grace, and strength sufficient for all their wants.
In that guide--that Book of books--He tells them that He sent His only Son, that His sufferings
and death might be accepted instead of their eternal suffering and death, to which their sins
would most justly have consigned them.  Therefore, my dear boys, I want you to study, that
book, day after day--never give it up.  But, at the same time, do not fancy that you are doing
a meritorious act by merely reading it.  You must examine it, and treasure it, as you would
a precious gift.  You should read it with thankfulness and joy that God has given you that
precious gift.  You are not doing him any service by reading it.  The acts alone which result
from reading it do him any service; and, after all, those acts are only your bounden duty.
Common gratitude demands them from you.  Never forget.  You must pray daily-- pray for grace,
and faith, and strength, and knowledge; and be assured that God will give them to you at last.
Never cease praying.  What I have said may seem hard to you, my dear boys; but it is the truth;
and I could not have died happy without saying it, as I felt that it was my duty to say it.
Be religious, and never be ashamed of your religion. Hoist your colours in sight of the enemy,
and fight bravely under them wherever you go."

Much more our friend said, but the above was the pith of his discourse. I believe that neither
my young messmate nor I ever forgot what he said. By following his advice, we have found a
comfort, a joy, a strength, which we should never otherwise have known.  Our kind friend's
forebodings were speedily fulfilled; and before we reached Malta he had, in perfect peace,
yielded up his life to the God who gave it.

"What! did the good Adam Stallman really die?" some of my young readers may ask.  Yes; good
and bad, rich and poor, of all ranks and stations in society, are often summoned in their joyous
youth, their flowering manhood, by a just God, to render up an account of their mode of life.
Oh! my young friends, remember that you, too, may be summoned away from this bright world,
and all you hold dear, in an hour, a day, a year--at a moment you think not of; and that you,
too, must render up an account of how you have lived on earth before the great, the just, the
All-seeing Judge; that every thought of your heart, every action you have performed, will then
be laid bare; and that, unless you can say, I did my duty to the best of my power and knowledge,
and I trusted to Christ to save me, it were better, far better, that you had never been born.
I shall be glad to find that my adventures amuse you, but I should also deeply blame myself
if I did not try and make you understand these things; and I should feel that it were also
far better that my book had not been written.

CHAPTER NINETEEN.

RETURN TO ENGLAND--APPOINTED TO THE OPOSSUM--THE COMMANDER'S OATH--HOW HE KEPT IT--THE GALE--LOSS
OF MASTS--OLD POPPLES--DEATH OF COMMANDER-- THE PIRATE--END OF MYERS.

I forgot to say in the last chapter, that before shaping our course for Malta, we ran a little
way down the coast, and landed our young Reefian prisoner.  It might have been better had Captain
Poynder endeavoured, through his means, to treat with the old Sheikh for the liberation of
his captives; but, probably, the success of such a plan was considered too doubtful to be attempted.
What became of Mr Vernon's jewel-box I do not know: I fancy the contents were of very little
intrinsic value. We carried Major Norman and his daughter to Gibraltar, whence they went to
England.  Mr Vernon did not marry for upwards of a year after this. He and his wife are among
my most intimate friends.  We met with no more adventures worth recording in the old Harold.
At length we returned to Portsmouth, and being paid off, I was once more a gentleman at large.
I did not long remain so, for my kind uncle took care to get me another ship as soon as possible.
In the meantime, I accompanied Dicky Sharpe to the home of his father and mother, Sir John
and Lady Sharpe.  They were excessively kind, and made a great deal of me; and so did the Misses
Sharpe, who, being a good deal older than Dicky, treated us somewhat like little children,
petting and humouring our fancies, which did not altogether please me.  It made me much more
inclined to act like a child, and to join Dicky in any pranks he proposed.  I was very sorry,
however, to have to go away.  It was, at the same time, no little satisfaction to both of us,
that we found ourselves appointed to the same ship--a fine sixteen-gun brig, just fitting out--the
Opossum, Captain Cranley.  Dicky, however, got leave for two or three weeks, while I had to
join at once.  His friends got him the appointment because it was considered better that he
should see some service in a small craft, with a smart officer, which our commander was said
to be; while I joined because I was not likely to get a better.  I had gone to see Larry as
soon as I reached England, and found him and his wife flourishing.  When I got back to Portsmouth,
while the brig was fitting out, I paid him frequent visits, to the old man's great delight;
and he used to tell everybody he met what a first-rate sailor I had become, winding up invariably,
with a look of no little pride, "Ay, sir, and 'twas I taught him--didn't I, Master Neil?"

I must not forget to mention my kind uncle and aunt, and Daisy Cottage, where I was always
a welcome guest.  He had paid the cutter off, but expected soon to obtain another appointment.
Of the Marlows I could only hear that they had gone abroad; but as Miss Alice had promised
to write to my aunt as soon as they had settled, I was in hopes of hearing about them.  But
I must get on with my story.  The Opossum was at sea, running down Channel, with orders to
wait at Falmouth for despatches and mails for Halifax, Nova Scotia.  With the exception of
Dicky Sharpe, all my brother officers were strangers to me, and mostly to each other, so it
took a little time before we became acquainted and shook into our places.  Captain Cranley,
I found, was somewhat of the old school--very kind-hearted and simple-minded, and not less
strict towards himself than towards others--with a nice sense of honour, and very sensitive
of rebuke.  I was very glad to find that my old friend Jack Stretcher had volunteered, with
the hope of one day becoming a warrant-officer.  I must also mention the boatswain, who, though
an oldish man, had not long taken out his warrant.  He was a prime seaman, with nothing very
remarkable in his appearance, except that he was tall and thin, and had a long bushy beard,
now somewhat grizzled.  The aforesaid individual, Mr Popples, was neat and clean, and had really
good manners; his great ambition being to rise in the world, though he had begun to ascend
rather late in life.  We youngsters had a great respect for him, notwithstanding some of his
peculiarities, and should never have dreamed of playing him the tricks we did old Chissel and
Trundle in the Harold.  Two days after we left Falmouth, the wind, which had been from the
eastward and moderate, chopped round to the westward and north-west, and began to blow very
heavily.  Our commander, however, was not a man to be frightened by a capful of wind; so we
close-reefed the topsails, and lay upon our course as near as we could.  The gallant little
brig headed the seas bravely, and gave us every reason to hope that we might weather out the
gale without damage.  Towards the evening of the third day, however, it came on to blow harder
than ever; the clouds came gathering up in thick masses, as if hurried one on the other, without
the means of escaping, and the sea rose higher and higher.  Mr Pullen, the master, kept glancing
to windward in a significant manner.

"What do you think of it, master?" asked Captain Cranley.

"Why, sir, the sooner that we up-helm, and run into port, the better for the ship and ourselves,"
replied Mr Pullen.  "There's no use straining a vessel till every timber in her creaks and
groans with pain,--that's my opinion."

"A very just one, master, and I'll follow your advice," said the captain.  "All hands wear ship."

The delicate, operation was successfully performed.  The helm was put up--the aftersails were
brailed up and furled--more headsail was got on her.  For an instant she rolled heavily in
the trough of the sea; then her headsail, feeling the full force of the wind, carried her head
away from it, and, like a sea-bird released from imprisonment, off she flew on rapid wings
before it.  A number of vessels, driven in by stress of weather, were collected in Falmouth
Harbour as we entered.  We ran by them, past the flag-ship, for the purpose of bringing up,
when we were hailed with--

"What!  Captain Cranley, are you afraid of a capful of wind?  There's nothing to hurt you now
outside; so go to sea again without bringing up."

These words stung our old captain to the quick.

"It's the first time James Cranley was ever taunted for being afraid of anything, much less
a gale of wind; and it shall be the last time, too, whatever comes of it, so help me Heaven!"

Fearfully did the old man keep his vow.  Accordingly, we forthwith stood out again to sea.
When we were clear of the land, we found the gale completely abated, and we had a very fine
passage, till within about a hundred miles of our port, when it fell calm.  Never do I recollect
a more perfect calm.  The sea was like lead in colour, but as smooth as glass, though every
now and then there came a long, slow, gently-moving undulation, as if there were some unseen
power beneath the water.  There was something, I thought, very ominous in the whole appearance
of the atmosphere.  The barometer, the seaman's warning friend, began also to sink, and each
hour the quicksilver got lower and lower.  Thus passed two days, but not a breath of wind came.
Captain Cranley paced his deck with uneasy steps.  The master likewise looked far from satisfied,
I thought, with the appearance of the weather, and kept continually glancing round the horizon,
in search of the expected sign of a change. The sails hung idly down against the masts, every
now and then flapping loudly, as the vessel rolled slowly in the swell.  It would have been
more seamanlike had they been furled; but, to tell the truth, our commander appeared seized
with a fit of infatuation, which deprived him of his usual clear judgment on professional matters.
He had not got over his late unjust reprimand.  With a morbid feeling of injured honour, he
allowed it to rankle in his bosom.  People are apt to have a foreboding of evil; but on the
present occasion there were ample reasons for dreading mischief.

"To my mind, if we were to furl every stitch of canvas, and send down our topmasts, we should
be acting like seamen," said old Popples, as I was forward, attending to some duty.

"Why do you say that?"  I asked.  "The sea is like glass, and there's no wind, nor chance of
any, as far as I can judge."

"Because I haven't sailed round the world for the last forty years with my eyes shut, Mr D'Arcy,"
he replied.  "Be sure, when the weather's like this, there's no slight gale coming on; but
the commander is a good seaman, and I suppose he'll give the order soon."

The commander, however, did not seem to apprehend any immediate change of weather.  Not so
Mr Pullen.  Whenever he went into the cabin, he found that the silver in the barometer had
sunk lower than ever; and each time he came on deck, looking more anxious than before.  After
some time spent in watching the sky to the northward, he walked up to the commander.

"Captain Cranley, sir," said he, "it's my duty to tell you that, in my opinion, this weather
won't last many hours longer--not to say minutes, perhaps; and if the squall I look for catches
us with all this canvas set, it will carry the masts over the side to a certainty."

"It's the custom in the service generally for officers to wait till their opinion is asked,"
replied the commander, turning on his heel, and taking a few more turns on the quarter-deck.
At last he stopped, and looked out towards the northward and westward, where a thick mass of
clouds was banking up, each instant rising higher and higher.

"Mr Fairman," he said, to the first-lieutenant, "call all hands to shorten sail; put the brig
under double-reefed topsails.  Whichever way the squall comes, we mustn't be frightened at
it this time, eh?"

The command was quickly obeyed, but the air remained as stagnant as ever.  Still old Popples
was not satisfied.

"We are better so than we were before, I'll allow," he remarked; "but the gale, when it does
begin to blow, will, to my mind, be a regular hurricane, and we shall be glad to run before
it under bare poles.  Mark my words, Mr D'Arcy!"

Boatswains do not always deliver their opinion thus freely about their captain; but old Popples
was privileged, at all events with us midshipmen.  Mr Pullen shrugged his shoulders and said
nothing, though he evidently held the same opinion as the boatswain.  The commander had just
retired to his cabin, while the master continued his walk, turning his eye every now and then
towards the quarter whence he expected the wind to come.  Suddenly he stopped.

"Here it is!" he exclaimed.  "Up with the helm--square away the afteryards."

Scarcely had he spoken, than a terrific roar was heard, and down came the gale upon us with
unbridled fury, driving before it vast masses of spoondrift, and tearing up the water into
huge waves, which every instant rose higher and higher.  Off flew the brig's head, however,
before it, and it seemed like a race between her and the dense sheets of spray which careered
over the seas, and the clouds of scud which chased each other across the sky.  Her course,
however, was to be suddenly arrested.  The commander made his appearance hurriedly on deck.

"What means this?" he exclaimed.  "There's our port, sirs," pointing to the north-west.  "Bring
the ship on a wind--down with the helm--brace up the yards!"

The officers stood aghast, but the order was not to be disputed.

No sooner did the brig feel the full force of the wind, than she heeled over, till her lee
guns were buried in the waves, and the spray came flying over us, fore and aft.  Still we looked
up to it, and, had the wind not increased, we might have weathered it very well; but it was
evident that the gale had not yet come to its height.  Magnificently the brave little brig
dashed through it; but it was fearful work,--the timbers groaned, and the masts bent, every
instant threatening to go by the board.  Once more Mr Pullen urged the commander to bear up.

"No, no, master," he answered, shaking his head; "I've sworn that no power shall ever again
turn me away from the port to which I am bound; and James Cranley is not a man you would ask
to break his oath, I hope."

"Well, sir, but the brig will hold her own better under closer canvas, you'll allow," urged
the master.

After some time the commander permitted the topsails to be close-reefed, but not another stitch
would he take off her.  Still the brig had too much sail set; and wearily and heavily she laboured
through the yet fast rising seas.

I had been on deck for some hours, and, drenched to the skin, was shivering with cold, when
Mr Pullen, with whom I was a favourite, told me to go and lie down in his berth, our own not
being tenable, from the water which the straining of the ship allowed to run into it.  All
the officers and the watch were on deck.  In spite of the heavy pitching of the ship, I soon
fell asleep.  How long I remained so I know not, when a terrific noise awoke me.  I felt the
suffocation of drowning, and for a moment saw the water in dark green masses rushing into the
cabin.  In another instant it was all dark.  I uttered a prayer for mercy, for I felt that
the brig was on her side and sinking.  Still the love of life did not desert me.  Through the
darkness I discerned one bright spot overhead.  I made for it, and as I found my hands grasping
the combings of the gun-room skylight, the brig, with a sudden jerk, righted again. I thought
it was only preparatory to going down.  Still I held on.  The water rolled away, and disappeared
from above and beneath me, and I was able to obtain a clear view along the deck.  What a scene
of destruction and horror met my view!  Of all those living men who lately peopled her decks,
not a soul was there--not a mast was standing--not a boat remained--as if the destroying sword
of the Archangel had swept over them.  The decks were swept clear of everything; while the
green foam-topped seas, in mountain masses, rose above them, threatening every instant to overwhelm
my hapless vessel.  A glance showed me all this. Looking forward, I saw another head rising
from the fore-hatchway; it was that of old Popples, the boatswain.

"What! are they all gone?" he shouted; "then I'm captain.  Lend a hand, Mr D'Arcy, and we'll
try and get the ship before the wind."

"Captain of a sinking ship you may be, Mr Popples," I answered, amused, even in that moment
of horror, at the old man's extraordinary ambition.

But there was no time for talking.  I sprang on deck, as he had done, and at the same instant
a cry reached our ears, and looking to leeward, we saw the faces of several of our shipmates,
clinging to the spars and rigging, which still hung on to the ship.

At first, surrounded as they were with the seething foam, their countenances convulsed with
terror or agony, as they clung with their death-grasp to the rigging, it was difficult to recognise
them; while, one by one, they were torn from their uncertain hold, and borne far away to leeward.
Still some clung on.  I trusted my friend Dicky Sharpe might be of the number; for even then,
strange as it may seem, I pictured to myself the grief and misery his loss would cause at that
home where I had lately seen him the hope and joy of a loving mother and affectionate sisters.
These thoughts occupied scarcely a second.  In a few moments I recovered from the sensation
of almost overwhelming horror which the scene had caused; and, as I gazed more attentively,
I recognised Dicky himself, with Captain Cranley, and the master, yet clinging to the rigging.

The watch below, whom the boatswain had summoned, joined us without delay; and I must do him
the justice to say, that no one could more nobly have exerted himself than he did in trying
to save those who would speedily deprive him of his new-fledged honours.  The foremast and
its rigging, in falling, had torn away the chain-plates and everything which secured it forward;
and the whole tangled mass of spars and ropes now hung on by the after-shrouds, and had both
served to put the brig before the wind, by holding back her stern, while it allowed her head
to pay off, and acted also as a sort of breakwater, which saved us from being pooped.  The
poor fellows in the water were crying loudly for help as they caught sight of us on deck. 
One of the nearest was Dicky Sharpe. Calling Jack Stretcher to my aid, I got him to heave a
rope with a bight at the end which I had made.  It fell close to Dicky's head.  He grasped
it with one hand, and slipped it over his shoulders.  We hauled on it till we got him near
the side.  Just then the foreyard came surging up, and I thought would strike him.

"Give me your hand!"  I shrieked out.

I caught it barely in time.  Stretcher leaned through a port, and we got Dicky in at the moment
that the yard came thundering against the side, almost grazing his foot.  All this was but
the work of a second. Popples had in the meantime, by great exertions, managed to get the master
on board; and his next attempt was to save Captain Cranley.  He, however, was much further
out, hanging on to one of the topmasts.  None of the ropes near him which we could reach would
come home.  There appeared to be no means of saving him.  Two other men were, however, got in.

"Come, I can't bear to see our old skipper washed away before our eyes. What will his wife
and children do?" exclaimed Jack Stretcher.  "I've no one at home to care for me; so some on
you clap on here, while I just make a fly out, and see if I can't get hold of him."

The gallant fellow had made a rope fast to his waist, and was on the point of making his perilous
attempt by springing into the raging sea, when a terrific wave came rolling up astern.  Its
curling crest lifted high the spar to which the commander clung.  I fancied that I could see
his starting eyes take one last earnest glance at the ship, and his lips moved as if imploring
us to save him.  Then down came the wave; and as the ship was hurried on before it, its broken
waters tore away his already failing grasp, and in a moment he was buried from our sight. 
We had no time to mourn for him then.  Mr Pullen instantly took command, and Popples was fain
to act as his first-lieutenant; while Sharpe and I did our utmost to make ourselves useful.

The wreck of the masts, as I have said, kept the brig before the wind. While some hands set
to work to rig the pumps, others got up a bit of a jury-mast, secured to the stump of the foremast.
On this we managed to spread a topgallant-sail, which helped her along famously.  All hands
who could possibly be spared were required to work the pumps, spell and spell; and the wonder
was, when we found the immense quantity of water she had taken on board, that she had not gone
down.  As it was, her deck and upper works leaked in every direction; and we all felt that
such, even now, might be our fate.  I shall never forget the anxiety of that first night, as,
amid the raging seas, with the gale howling round us, our near sinking ship, battered and dismasted,
ran through the darkness, every sea, as, foam-crested, it came rolling up astern, threatening
to overwhelm us.  Who but fools would not, on such occasions, feel the utter helplessness of
their own arm to help them, or would fail to put their trust alone in Him who is all-powerful
to save.  Yes; it is amid the raging storm and on the battered wreck that the seaman, if his
mind be but directed aright, gains a practical knowledge of the value of religion.  But alas!
how few--how very few--are taught religious truths; and the very men who wander round the globe,
and might act as important pioneers of civilisation and Christianity among the heathen, are
allowed, for the most part, to remain ignorant and profane--a disgrace, instead of an honour,
to the Christian nation to which they belong. Such a state of things ought not to exist; and
I ask you, my young friends, to aid in conveying the blessings of the gospel to our gallant
seamen, and, through their means, to the far distant nations of the earth.  But to return to
the brig.  For two days we ran to the southward, without any change in the weather.  At length
it began to moderate, and in three days more we had run into comparatively a smooth sea.

No one would willingly have blamed our late unfortunate commander; but we all felt that, had
he bore up in time, as a seaman should have done, instead of obstinately persisting in holding
his ground, he would have saved his own and many valuable lives, and the brig would have escaped
the disaster she had suffered.

Mr Pullen had shaped a course for the Bermudas; but, low as they are, it was necessary to keep
a very sharp look-out, to prevent running past them, or on to the coral reefs by which they
are surrounded.  Our landfall, however, was better than we expected; and one of the fine pilot-boats,
for which the islands are so deservedly noted, coming off to us, we were safely towed into
harbour.  The brig was some months in the hands of the dockyard people before we were ready
for sea, our despatches, after some weeks' detention, being sent on to their destination.

During the period of our stay, the merchants, as well as the military officers, were very kind
to Dicky and me.  The Bermudas are also called Somers' Islands, because Sir George Somers was
cast away on them in 1609, since when they have been inhabited by English settlers.  Their
productions are very similar to those of the West Indies.  There are a number of blacks on
them, who at the time I speak of were slaves, but are now, of course, free.  They consist of
four principal islands, the chief of which is called Saint George, and other smaller ones.
They take their name from Juan Bermudez, who discovered them in 1522.  I have no time to say
more about the place.

Before we were ready for sea, a new commander was sent out from England--Captain Idle.  His
name was very far from appropriate to his character.  He brought us the pleasing information
that we were destined for the coast of Africa, where some fast cruisers were much wanted to
put down the slave-trade.

Captain Idle had seen some service.  He had been thirty years at sea, out of which time he
had not probably spent two on shore.  He had been in the North Seas and West Indies, in the
Antarctic Ocean, and on the coast of Africa, in the Indian seas, and in every part of the Pacific.
There was not an unhealthy station in which he had not served.  He had served for ten years
as a first-lieutenant.  He had been three times wounded, and had obtained his rank, both as
lieutenant and commander, for two remarkable deeds of gallantry; and now, as a special reward
for his services, I suppose, he was sent out to the coast of Africa.

A first-lieutenant also joined us--Reuben Spry by name,--and two mates, the senior of whom
did duty as second lieutenant--Holland and Waller. The very day we were ready for sea we went
out of harbour, and made the best of our way towards the coast of Africa.  A succession of
easterly winds had kept the Opossum more to the west than she would otherwise have been.  We
were about the latitude of Barbadoes, when, having run on during most of the night with a fair
breeze, towards morning it dropped altogether, and we found ourselves rolling away in a tropical
calm.  As we were already in the seas where slavers are to be found, a bright look-out was
kept, in the hopes of our falling in with a prize, though as yet not a sail had been seen to
which it was thought worth while giving chase.  As morning broke, of a day I shall not easily
forget, there appeared to the southward, not four miles from us, two vessels becalmed like
ourselves.  One, a large barque, somewhat the nearest to us, was clearly an English merchantman;
the other, a low, black schooner, had the wicked, rakish appearance of a Spanish slaver.  The
look-out from the foretopmast-head gave notice at the same time that he could see two boats
pulling from one vessel to the other.  The captain and all the officers were speedily on deck.

"There's some mischief going on there," exclaimed Captain Idle, after a look at the vessels.
"Mr Spry, call the boats away; we must send and overhaul these fellows."

Three boats, under the command of the first-lieutenant, were speedily in the water, and manned,
all hands being well-armed.  Waller had charge of one boat, I of the third,--and not a little
proud did I feel of the honour.  A cup of cocoa and some biscuit being first served out to
each of us, to give us strength for the work to be accomplished, away we pulled towards the
barque.  It was hot enough when we started, but as the sun rose higher it grew hotter still,
and the glare on the smooth water became so bright as almost to blind us; but nothing relaxed
our exertions, all hands feeling that there was some work before us. They were all very grandly and
magnificently dressed. After they had spoken to our Emperor, they expressed a wish to come to
visit me. It seems they were told I had been their friend when the Emperor asked me to help him
take Blefuscu, and they came to thank me for my justice and generosity.

They invited me to visit their island, where I should receive every kindness and hospitality.
I thanked their lordships very much, and said I should be pleased to come and pay my respects
to the Emperor of Blefuscu before I returned to my own country.

Those not pulling blazed away right merrily for a few minutes, and then watched for the result.
It seemed to have encouraged one party and to have disheartened the other, for the boats we
had before seen were observed pulling back to the schooner.

"Follow me, Waller.  After the boats, my lads!" shouted Mr Spry. "D'Arcy, do you board the
barque.  See if any assistance is required, and if not, pull for the schooner."

It took me but a short time to find myself alongside the barque, while the rest of our party
were in chase of the strange boats.  So eagerly were those on board looking out at the chase,
that they did not observe me step on board.  Alas! the appearance of the deck showed too plainly
that mischief had already been done.  One man lay dead, and two more sat on the deck, supported
by their shipmates.  But there were two persons in a group standing aft, whom I thought I recognised.
I looked again. I was sure I could not be mistaken, and running up to them, I found myself
shaking hands most warmly with Mr Marlow and his daughter.  He did not recognise me; but she
did in a moment, and told him who I was.

"Again you have helped to save our lives, Mr D'Arcy," he exclaimed; "for, thanks to our brave
captain here, we were able to resist a band of villainous pirates who attacked us, till your
appearance frightened them off."

I of course told them how happy I was to be of service, and then, finding that my presence
on board the barque was not required, I tumbled into my boat, and gave way after my shipmates.
The pirates' boats had gained the schooner about ten minutes before they had.  I was not long
behind them, and the aid of my boat's crew was very welcome.  The deck of the schooner was
crowded with men, who were making a desperate resistance.  The most prominent of them fought
more like a demon than a human creature.  With desperate energy he wielded a huge cutlass,
with which he kept the deck clear around him.  His men, however, a mixture of Spanish, Portuguese,
blacks, and a few English or Americans, were falling thick on either side, and several had
actually been driven overboard.  My gallant fellows gave a loud shout as we scrambled on deck,
and, led by Jack Stretcher, they cleared everything before them. Some of the pirates were forced
down the hold, others overboard, and several sunk on the deck to rise no more.  Still the captain
stood at bay.  I now had a better opportunity of observing him, and at once I recognised my
old enemy, the villain Myers.

"Your time is come at last, Bill Myers," I shouted.

The words seemed to have a paralysing effect.  What thoughts they called up, I know not.  Perhaps
he had not for long been known by that name. He made a few steps backward, and then, with one
bound, cleared the side of the vessel and leaped overboard.  There was no land to swim to--no
boat to pick him up--but ravenous sharks surrounded the scene of strife, already collected
by the taste of blood.  In another instant the long-sought-for smuggler, murderer, and pirate
was their prey.  The remainder of the pirates yielded without another blow.  We found that
they had shipped for a slave voyage only; but had been induced by Myers, who had lately got
command, to commence a course of piracy, which, by our appearance, had happily been cut short.
After some hours, a breeze springing up, we brought the vessels together.  Waller and I were
ordered to take the prize into Barbadoes, where the barque also was bound; while the Opossum
cruised outside to look out for slavers.

Mr Marlow was going to spend some time at Bridgetown, where he had a house of business.  He
received Waller and me most kindly, and nothing could exceed the hospitality of the inhabitants
generally when they heard of our exploit.  Captain Curtis, also, the master of the barque,
got great credit for the way he had defended his vessel till we came to his assistance.  Miss
Alice Marlow had grown somewhat, but still she was very little for her age.  She was, however,
as kind as ever, and I, for one, was very sorry when the Opossum came in with another prize.
The survivors of the men who had boarded the barque were hung, and the schooner herself was
condemned.  This business being accomplished, the Opossum once more made sail for the coast
of Africa.

CHAPTER TWENTY.

LOOK OUT FOR SLAVERS IN A BOAT--WEARY OF WAITING--A SAIL IN SIGHT-- CAPTURE HER--ATTACKED BY
A LARGER SLAVER--DESPERATE FIGHT--BEAT HER OFF.

We had been some weeks on the coast without having taken a prize, although we had chased several
suspicious-looking craft, which had contrived to get away from us.  At Sierra Leone we had
shipped a dozen Kroomen, to get wood and water for the ship, a work which Europeans in that
climate are unable to perform without great risk.  At length Captain Idle began to grow impatient.
One day he sent for Waller, who had been on the coast before with him, and was a very clever,
active fellow.

"Waller," said he, "I want you to go away in the pinnace, and while some of these slaving gentlemen
are running away from us, perhaps you may be able to render a good account of them.  You will
require a companion. Will you like to take D'Arcy with you?"

Waller expressed his readiness to go, and to have my society; and so it was settled.  Among
his other accomplishments, he was a first-rate shot with a rifle, and it was reported, when
he was before on the coast, that he used to pick off the men at the helm, and any of the crew
who went aloft or appeared above the bulwarks, and had thus caused the capture of several slavers.
I was to see this talent exerted.  Jack Stretcher, who was a capital companion, went with us
as coxswain.  We were all dressed in thick flannel shirts, and had blankets in which to wrap
ourselves at night.  We had water and provisions for ten days, and a small stove, with which
to warm up our cocoa and tea, and to make a stew or a broil on occasion.  I do not remember
that we had any other luxuries.  Towards the end of the afternoon watch we shoved off from
the brig's side, having wished our shipmates "Good-bye!" with a sort of feeling that we might
not meet again.  While the Opossum stood away on a bowline to the northward, we shaped a course
for the mouth of the Gaboon river.  We arrived at our cruising ground before daybreak.  Waller
then ordering the men to lay in their oars, which had hitherto been kept going, and lowering
the sail, told them to wrap themselves in their blankets, and to lie down under the thwarts.
I kept watch while he also slept.  The night was bright and beautiful, and the sea, smooth
as a mirror, reflected the glittering stars which shone forth from the dark blue heavens, while
our boat lay floating idly on its slumbering bosom.  So deep was the silence which reigned
around, that the breathing of the sleepers sounded strangely loud, and I fancied that I could
hear vessels, even though out of sight, passing by, or fish rising to the surface to breathe,
or cleaving the water with their fins.  At other times my imagination made me fancy that I
could hear beings of another world calling to each other as they flew through the air or floated
on the ocean; and I almost expected to see their shadowy forms glide by me. About an hour before
dawn, Waller got up and told me to take some rest. I was not sorry to lie down, albeit my rest
was far from refreshing.  I soon began to dream, and dreamed that I was a plum-pudding, and
that Betty, the cook at Daisy Cottage, had fastened me up in a flannel pudding-bag, and put
me into a pot to boil.  The water soon began to simmer, and I to swell and swell away, till
the string got tighter and tighter round my throat, while a thick black smoke arose from some
coals which she had just put on.  I was looking out of the pot, and meditating on the proverb,
"Out of the frying-pan into the fire," when, being unable to stand it any longer, I jumped
out of the pudding-bag, and found myself rolling at the bottom of the boat.

"Why, D'Arcy, I thought you were going to spring overboard," said Waller.  When I told him
my dream, he laughed heartily, and agreed there was ample cause for it.

Our blankets were wet through and through, and a dense black fog hung over us, through which
it was impossible to discover the position of the sun, which had some time been up, or of any
object ten fathoms off; while the sea was as smooth as a sheet of glass, and as dull-coloured
as lead.  As I awoke I found my throat sore from the unwholesome moisture I had inhaled.  We
had nothing, therefore, to do but cook and eat our breakfast, and practise patience.  There
was little use exhausting the men's strength by pulling, as we were as likely to pull from,
as towards, a vessel.  Hour after hour thus passed away, till at length the sun conquered the
mist, and gradually drew it off from the face of the deep, discovering a wide expanse of shining
water, unbroken by a single dot or speck which was likely to prove a sail; while to the eastward
arose a long dark line of mangrove-trees, at the mouth of the Gaboon river.  The land-breeze
came off to us, smelling of the hot parched earth; and we turned our eyes anxiously whence
it blew, in the hope of seeing some white sail dancing before it over the bar of the river;
but we were doomed to disappointment.  The hot sun struck down on our heads, and tanned and
scorched our cheeks, and the upper works of the boat cracked with the heat, till a beefsteak
might have been broiled on the gunwale.  At last the land-wind died away; there was again a
dead calm, in which we roasted still faster, till the sea-breeze set in and somewhat cooled
our parched tongues.  Now we looked out seaward, in the hopes of finding some slaver, unsuspectingly
standing in, either to ship the whole or the portion of a cargo, having already, perhaps, taken
some on board at another part of the coast.  Nothing is more trying to the temper than to have
to sit quiet and do nothing; yet such was our fate from day to day, as we lay like a snake
ready to spring on its prey. The sun rose, and roasted us, and set, leaving us to be parboiled,
and rose again, without a sail appearing.  We ate our breakfasts, and dinners, and suppers,
and smoked our pipes, and sat up, and went to sleep again, in the same regular manner for several
successive days.

At length, one morning, a light breeze sprang up; and, as the fog was blown off in dense wreaths,
the topsails of a schooner were seen rising above them.

"Out oars, my men, and give way with a will!" exclaimed Waller, in an animated voice.  "We
are not yet seen, and may get alongside before they find us out."

The men, in their delight at the prospect of having something to do, would have cheered, but
he silenced them.  We hoped that she was a slaver; but she might, after all, be only an honest
Liverpool trader. When first seen, she was little more than a mile off, to the south-west of
us, running in for the land with the wind, which was from the northward abeam.

"What do you think of her, Jack?" asked Waller, after Stretcher had been eyeing her narrowly.

"Why, sir, to my mind, those topsails have only been cut by Spanish fingers; so I make pretty
sure she's nothing else than a nigger passage-vessel."

This announcement made the men give way still more heartily, for, though the wind was fair,
we did not make sail, as we should thereby have been more quickly seen.  Away we pulled, the
water bubbling and hissing under our bows as we cut through it.  When we got within a quarter
of a mile of the chase, she saw us, we judged, by hearing a musket fired and seeing a bullet
strike the water near us.

"That proves he has got no guns on board.  Give way, my lads!" shouted Waller.

The men cheered, and bent to their oars with greater vigour.  We then hoisted the British ensign,
and fired a musket to make the fellow heave-to; but, taking no notice of the signal, he held
on his course. The wind continued so light, however, that we were overhauling him fast; but
there were signs, both on the sky and water, that it might again get up, and afford him a better
chance of escaping.  At all events, he was evidently not inclined to give in.

"I must teach the fellow that the British flag is not to be trifled with," said Waller, taking
up his rifle.  "I have no compassion on these slaving villains."

Scarcely had he spoken, when a man, whom we both took to be the captain, jumped into the netting
abaft the main-rigging, and made some very significant gestures to us to be off; and directly
afterwards, seeing that we continued our course, several of his crew let fly their muskets at us.

"You've brought it on your own head," exclaimed Waller, loading his rifle.  He fired.  The
next moment we saw the man fall back upon his deck.  There was then a great deal of shouting
on board the schooner; her helm was put up, and, the breeze freshening, she began to pay off
before the wind.  She had not got round, though, before we were under her quarter.

"Hook on to her main-chains, my lad,--hook on fast!" cried Waller.

Unfortunately the bowman missed his aim; and the schooner, falling off, brought the stern of
our boat in contact with her counter.  Without a moment's thought, Waller had sprung over her
low bulwarks, followed by Stretcher and me.  In an instant we were attacked by the whole of
the slaver's crew, who, with loud shouts and ferocious gestures, rushed aft, fully hoping,
as they saw that the pinnace had dropped astern, to make us an easy prey.

The mainsheet of the schooner had been eased off, the foreyards had been squared, and, with
the now strengthening breeze, the schooner was running fast through the water.  Waller took
one glance over his shoulder, and that showed him that there was scarcely a chance of the boat
overtaking us.  Our fate was sealed: no mercy could we expect from the slaver's crew.  One
hope only remained,--Waller had thought of it.

"Knock down the man at the helm, and jam the tiller down hard!" he sung out to Stretcher. 
"We will keep the other fellows at bay in the meantime."

"Ay, ay, sir," answered Jack, as coolly as if he had been merely ordered to give a pull at
the main-brace.

There was a cry, and the next moment the body of the helmsman dropped on the deck.  Jack had
literally cut his head off with a sweep of his cutlass.  The sight had the effect of making
the Spaniards hang back for a moment, when Jack, putting the helm hard down, made the sails
all shiver, and finally got her fore-topsail aback.  Seeing what had occurred, the crew of
the pinnace cheered, and, giving way, were soon clambering over the counter, while we made
a dash at the Spaniards, few of whom attempted to oppose us even for a moment; most of them,
indeed, throwing away their arms, made their escape to the forecastle.  The rest followed their
example; and in two minutes the schooner Zerlina, with a hundred and fifty slaves on board,
was ours.  Besides the captain, and the other man who was killed, there were twenty stout fellows,
two or three only being out of fighting order with their wounds.  We had difficulty enough
to keep the rest quiet.  They were, in truth, very sulky, and inclined to revolt, when they
had recovered from their fright, and saw to how few they had succumbed.  Curses, loud and many,
escaped their lips, and showed that, if they had an opportunity, they would murder us, and
retake their vessel, without scruple.  We therefore kept four of our men as a watch over them,
with loaded muskets, with orders to shoot the first who showed signs of proving mutinous. 
Having made these arrangements, we turned our attention to the living cargo crowded between
her decks.  It was a sickening sight, as we got the hatches off and looked down upon the mass
of black faces which, with their white eyeballs rolling and mouths agape, gazed up at us, wondering
what was next to happen.  There sat a hundred and fifty human beings chained down to iron bars
running across the deck--men and women of all ages, their chins resting on their knees, without
space to stretch out their limbs, or to alter their position in any way; a rag round their
loins being their only covering.  They were in good health, not having been out many days;
and there was a good supply of water and farina on board.  We did our best to make them understand
that we were friends, and would set them on shore again, and make them free, as soon as we could.

During our examination of the schooner, we had discovered a number of spare handcuffs.  Jack
Stretcher brought them from below, and threw them on the deck, with a significant look at the
Spaniards, who, in defiance of orders, had made several attempts to come out on deck.

"I think if we was to clap 'em on to them Spanish lubbers, it wouldn't be amiss, sir," said
he to me, holding up a pair before me.

I mentioned the suggestion to Waller, who at length agreed that it would be safe to follow
it, taking one-half at a time, while the rest remained in their berth under the forecastle.
Jack received the necessary orders.

"Ay, ay, sir," he answered.  "Senhor Dons, understando, move forewardo instanto, or I'll drive
the pointo of my cutlasho into vostros sternosos."

The prisoners understood his actions more than his words, for he fully suited the one to the
other, and they showed no inclination to dispute them, he having evidently made them respect
him, from his strength, and the daring he had displayed on boarding.  Some we confined forward--some
in the after-cabin; and most fortunate it was that we did so.

It was some time before all our arrangements were made.  About an hour before dark we tacked,
to stand inshore again, Waller intending, should we not fall in with the brig, to shape a course
for Sierra Leone.  We tacked again about midnight; but when daylight came, not a sign was there
of the Opossum; and, accordingly, towards the above-mentioned place we steered.  We had the
pinnace in tow; but we had taken the gun out of her, and placed it amidships on the deck of
the schooner. Overcome with fatigue, Waller had thrown himself down aft, wrapped up in his
blanket, while I stood near him, with my eyes winking, and trying in vain to be wide awake,
when I was startled by the cry of "A sail on the weather-bow!"

"Which way is she standing?" asked Waller, springing to his feet.

"Right down for us," answered Jack, who had gone aloft.  "I was hoping she might be the brig,
at first; but she's a large square-topsail schooner, and, by the cut of her canvas, she looks
like a Spanish or a Portuguese slaver."

As the stranger drew near, no doubt as to what she was remained on our minds.  Waller took
his measures accordingly, with perfect coolness. Seeing that the prisoners were thoroughly
secured, we got ready all our arms, and supplied ourselves with ammunition.  The gun amidships
was also loaded to the muzzle, and covered with a tarpaulin.  With the calm courage which British
seamen on all occasion display, our men waited the approach of the stranger.  As she drew near,
we made out that she had three guns on each side, and that her decks were crowded with men.
Notwithstanding this overpowering disparity of force, our men looked at her in no way daunted;
and I felt sure that what men could do they would for our defence.  Waller, however, judged
that it would be as well to animate their courage with a few words.

"Now, my men," said he, "we are but ten of us on board this craft, but we are true and honest;
and though there are probably fifty or sixty Spaniards in yonder schooner, they are a set of
slaving scoundrels, who cannot stand up a moment before British seamen.  They will not attempt
to hull us with their shot, because they will wish to get back the schooner uninjured; so they
will try to take us by boarding.  I hope they may, that we may show them that they have caught
a Tartar.  All we have to do is to blaze away with our muskets till we can give them a taste
of our cutlasses.  Our big gun we'll keep for a last dose; so now, my boys, trust in a righteous
cause, and huzza for Old England and victory."

Our men cheered long and lustily, and the sound must have reached the ears of the Spaniards,
and at once showed them, had they before doubted it, that the schooner was a prize to a British
cruiser.  They forthwith began to blaze away with their guns; but, as we had expected, they
fired high, in the hope of cutting away some of our rigging, that they might the more easily
lay us aboard.  We replied with our musketry as soon as they got within range, and Waller picked
off several of their people with his rifle, so that they probably fancied we had some good
marksmen concealed under our bulwarks.  When they drew nearer, however, they could not have
failed to discover the smallness of our numbers.  As they sailed faster than we did, all we
could do to prevent their raking us, which more than once they attempted to do, was to keep
away when they endeavoured to cross our bows, and to luff up again when they threatened to
pass under our stern.  Seeing, therefore, that the quickest way of deciding the engagement
was to run us on board, they bore right down upon us; and, unable to avoid them, the fluke
of our anchor became hooked on to their fore-rigging.  At the same instant full thirty swarthy
figures were seen crowding into the Spaniard's riggings and nettings, brandishing their swords,
with fierce cries of vengeance, thinking to terrify us into surrendering.

"Now, my lads! give them the dose I spoke of," shouted Waller.

The enemy leaped down on our deck, and were already in possession of the forecastle.  The tarpaulin
was cast off from the gun, and the muzzle, loaded as it was with missiles of all sorts, was
turned towards them, and fired right in among them where they mustered the thickest. Scarcely
a man escaped being hit; five were killed outright; and so astonished were the rest, that,
thinking probably that the vessel herself was blowing up, they tumbled, scrambled, and clambered
back into their own schooner in the greatest confusion.

"On! my boys, on!" shouted Waller; and, making a dash at the fellows, we much expedited their
movements.  In an instant not an enemy was left alive on our decks.

"Up with the helm!" sung out Waller; and at the same time Jack and another man cutting away
at the fore-rigging of the enemy, we sheered clear of him; while he, backing his fore-topsail,
dropped under our stern without firing a shot.  We therefore hauled our wind, and kept on our
course, and soon afterwards he filled his sails, and stood away to the southward.  He had enjoyed
a sufficient taste of our quality.  Not one of us was hurt, while a quarter of his people must
have been killed or wounded.

Our men gave a loud huzza as they found themselves free.  To me it seemed like a wild dream.
A few minutes before we were engaged in a desperate struggle for life; and now, uninjured,
we were sailing gaily over the calm water, victors in the strife.  Had it not been for the
dead bodies of our foes remaining on the deck, we could scarcely have believed our senses.
This action is considered one of the most gallant that has occurred on the coast.

The next day, to our great satisfaction, the Opossum hove in sight. Captain Idle, having taken
our prisoners out of us, ordered us to proceed forthwith with the negroes to Sierra Leone for
adjudication.

CHAPTER TWENTY ONE.

BLOWN OFF THE COAST--WALLER'S KINDNESS TO THE NEGROES--RUN SHORT OF PROVISIONS AND WATER--VESSEL
LEAKING--AMERICAN HARD-HEARTEDNESS-- WALLER'S NOBLE RESOLVE--BEACH BAHIA--AUDACIOUS TRICK OF
BRAZILIAN SLAVE-DEALERS.

We had parted from the Opossum about a couple of days, when we observed signs of one of those
terrific easterly gales which sometimes blow off the coast of Africa.  Waller, from his previous
experience, knew them, and remarked them in time, so that we were able to get all snug to meet
the wind when it came.  On a sudden the hitherto calm leaden water was covered with a foam-drift,
like the fine sand swept across the stony desert.  The only sail we had set was a close-reefed
topsail and storm-jib; the helm was put up, and away she flew before the gale, swift as the
albatross on its snowy wing.  Away, away we sped, and soon, leaving the African coast far astern,
were ploughing the water of the South Atlantic.  The Zerlina, though a beautiful model, as
are most of her class, was flimsily built, and far from a good sea-boat, speed only having
been cared for in her construction.  As we got away from the land, we met a good deal of sea,
in which she laboured much; and Ned Awlhole, one of the carpenter's mates, who was acting carpenter,
came one afternoon with a very long face into the cabin, where Waller and I were sitting at
dinner, to inform us that she was making far more water than was satisfactory.

"Get the pumps rigged, then, and we must try and keep her clear till we can manage to beat
back to Sierra Leone," said Waller, as coolly as if it were a matter of slight importance.

"It is rather a serious thing this, is it not?"  I observed.  "I wonder you make so light of it."

"Very serious; and on that account it behoves us, as officers, to keep up our own spirits,
and to cheer up the men," he replied.  "I am sorry to say also, that I very much fear we shall
fall short of water before we get into port, if this wind continues; and, with all these poor
blacks on board, that will indeed be a very serious thing.  Good seamanship may enable us to
keep, the ship afloat, but God only can provide us with water."

"What must we do, then?"  I asked.

"We must place all hands on short allowance, and we may fall in with some vessel which may
supply us; or showers may come, and we may collect enough for our more pressing wants," he
replied.  "We must keep the poor negroes on deck as much as possible--with fresh air they may
exist with less water."

Waller had speedily won the confidence and affection of the negroes, by his kindness and considerate
conduct.  At first, when we had taken possession of the vessel, they looked upon us as enemies,
for the Spaniards had told them that we should cook and eat them; but Waller, who could speak
a few words of their language, soon tranquillised their fears on that account.  He then got
upon deck the sick, and those whose limbs were chafed or bruised, and gave them medicines,
and dressed their wounds with his own hands.  He told them that they should be set free to
go where they wished, and should, if possible, be enabled to return to their own country. 
Few, however, had any hope of being enabled to do the latter, for they had mostly all been
taken in war, or kidnapped from districts away from the coast, the wars being undertaken by
the chiefs nearer the sea for the express purpose of making prisoners to sell into slavery.
Two or three of those who had been kidnapped had already been at Sierra Leone, or other British
settlements, and as they understood a good deal of English, we were able to communicate pretty
freely with them.  We found them, poor children of Ham, very intelligent fellows, and as capable
of receiving instruction as the people of any other race I have ever met.  Waller's good example
was followed by the crew, and at last each man vied in showing kindness to the poor wretches,
so that they learned to look on us truly as their friends and protectors.  We did but our duty.
They were our fellow-creatures, and we were soon to be fellows in suffering.  At first I own
it was very trying, and more than once, as I was dressing their wounds, I turned sick; but
I recollected that they were fellow-beings, with human feelings, and souls to be saved, like
ours, and I returned to my duty with renewed strength to perform it.  At length we found that
we could, with perfect safety, allow all the blacks to come on deck as they liked.  Whenever
Waller appeared, they shouted after him--"How do, Masser Waller?  Bless 'um, Masser Waller!"
And some would come and kneel down, and put his hand on their heads, with a look of affection
which was unmistakeable.

"I believe, sir, it's all very right with these poor fellows, and there's no harm in them,"
said Jack Stretcher to me one day.  "But, to my mind, it doesn't do to trust these strange
niggers too much.  They sometimes, I've heard, rises and cuts the throats of their friends."

I agreed with Jack that it was necessary, in most cases, to be cautious; but in the present
instance it was evident, as things turned out, that it was owing to Waller's judicious treatment
of the negroes that all our lives were preserved.

All this time the wind was blowing so strongly from the eastward, that we found it impossible
to beat up against it, so we had nothing else to do but to continue running before it.  Every
day matters were getting more and more serious; our own provisions were growing shorter.  Of
anything like luxuries we had none--salt beef and pork, hard biscuit and rice, and a little
tea and sugar, with a cask of rum--none of the best either, by-the-bye.  Waller called me into
the cabin for a consultation.

"To get back to the coast is now impossible," he remarked.  "If this wind holds, and we can
keep the craft afloat, our best chance is to try and make the coast of Brazil.  The port of
Bahia is the nearest, and I propose steering for that place."

I agreed with him; but we neither of us had any very strong hopes of being really able to make
it in time to save our own lives and those of the negroes.  On carefully examining our stock
of provisions, we found that only by the most economical expenditure of them, and with the
most favourable weather, should we be able to reach our destination in time. A foul wind, or
a day or two of calm, would ruin us; and a gale would in all probability send us to the bottom.
The blacks, of their own accord, took their spell at the pumps, and finally relieved our men
entirely of the labour.  Had they been compelled to continue pumping, it would, I am certain,
have worn them out.  We most dreaded a want of water.  Not a cloud appeared from which we might
draw it forth, and scarcely could we expect a shower.  Though constantly on the look-out, not
a vessel could we see, from whence we might get provisions.  At length, one morning, as Jack
Stretcher had gone aloft--

"A sail on the weather-bow!" he sung out, in a cheery tone, which gave hope to all our hearts.
"She's standing across our course, so we can speak her without altering it." 

The former was a genuine Rio, but the Java was mostly Jamaica coffee.

Roasted coffee then was packed (for city trade) in five and ten pound
packages, and this size package seemed to supply the wants of the
ordinary grocer for a week.

Occasionally a twenty-five pound package, and in a few instances
as much as fifty pounds of one grade was sold at a time.

The class of customers the coffee roasters sold in those days were
the smaller merchants; the larger stores, having their ideas as to
quality, bought their coffees green.

As they had very little sale for the roasted, they would send a half-sack,
and sometimes a whole sack to have it roasted.

It took a number of years to induce the larger grocers, and even
the average grocers, to purchase their coffee already roasted.

Coffees were roasted in the old style, "pull-out" roaster cylinder. That is to say, it was
necessary to stop the roaster and to pull out the cylinder to sample
the coffee in order to know when to take the coffee off the fire.

When the coffee was ready to take off, the cylinder was pulled out its entire length. It was
then turned over and a slide nine inches wide, running the full length
of the cylinder, was opened and the contents were dumped in the cooling
box.

When the coffee reached the cooling box, it took two men with hoes or wooden shovels to stir and
turn it until it was properly cooled, there being no cooling arrangements then as we have
nowadays.

"And now, what's your pleasure, Mr Lieutenant?" laid the master of the brig.

Waller explained exactly what had occurred.  "And now," he continued, "we are in a sinking
state; we have neither provisions nor water to last us till we can reach a port; and the destruction
of all these poor people is sealed if you do not help us."

"What! take all them dirty niggers aboard my craft?" exclaimed the skipper, with a look of
ineffable disgust.  "You Britishers have rum notions, I calculate."

"No, pardon me," said Waller.  "I only ask you to preserve from almost certain destruction
a number of our fellow-creatures; and any remuneration which you may require will certainly
be paid you."

"What! do you call them black niggers fellow-creatures, master?  That's a rum joke, I guess,"
exclaimed the skipper.  "I should be happy to be of service to you, but you are so unreasonable,--that
you are."

"Scarcely unreasonable, sir," urged Waller, mildly.  "Can you not name a sum for which you
could land all the people I have on board at Bahia, or the nearest port we can make."

"No, sir; I guess no sum would pay me to defile my vessel in the way you propose," said the
Yankee.  "I'll take you and your own crew with pleasure; but the niggers are out of the question."

"What! would you leave the poor wretches to perish in the most horrible way, with thirst and
starvation?" exclaimed Waller, shuddering at the thought.

"They are niggers," said the Yankee, coolly puffing forth a cloud of smoke, and leaning back
in his chair with a self-satisfied look.

"Hear me, sir!" exclaimed Waller, rising, a flush mantling on his brow. "I have six thousand
pounds of my own in this world.  That sum I will make over to you, by every legal means you
can devise, if you will take these poor people on board your brig, and land them in a place
of safety.  This shall be over and above what my Government may award you. I entreat you, as
you hope for mercy here and hereafter, to do as I ask."

"Not if you were to go down on your knees and pray till to-morrow morning," replied the Yankee,
slowly.  "Niggers are niggers, and they can't be otherwise.  If you and your people like to
come aboard, you are welcome.  You've got my answer, Sir."

"Then, sir," exclaimed Waller, rising from his seat, "I'll trust to the negroes' God, to mine,
and to yours, for that help which you deny them. May you never be in the same strait and seek
in vain for help.  Good day, sir."

The Yankee looked at us with an expression more of surprise than anger as we left the brig's deck.

"Stay! you are not a bad chap, I guess.  Here, just take these things; you are welcome to them."

Saying this he ordered a cask of water, some beef and biscuits, and a few little luxuries,
to be put into the boat.  We were not in a position to decline the gift; and, to do the Yankee
full justice, he would receive no remuneration.  We thanked him sincerely; and assured him
that we regretted deeply our opinions on the nature of negroes did not coincide; at which he
shrugged his shoulders, and we pulled back to the schooner.

We again made sail for the westward.

When I told Jack Stretcher what had occurred, he slapped his hand on his thigh, and exclaimed:

"Mr Waller was right, sir, that he was, not to think of deserting the poor niggers; and there
isn't a man of us but would gladly stick by him to the last."

I told Waller what Jack had said, and he replied that he was sure all our people would have
refused to have deserted the poor blacks, even if he had proposed so cruel a proceeding to
them.  We husbanded to the utmost the provisions we had brought from the brig; though, divided
among all the people, there was scarcely more than enough to sustain life for a day.  Still,
not a seaman grumbled.  Far from so doing, he willingly shared his own scanty allowance with
any negro who appeared more particularly to require sustenance.  It was amusing to see the
weather-beaten, thick-bearded men carrying about the little black children, whose mothers were
too weak to bring them on deck.

Though these Africans had hitherto been taught, with good reason, to look upon white men as
incarnations of devils, they began to consider our gallant fellows as something approaching
to angels; and, like savages in general, always in extremes, they were ready now to worship
us.  Providentially the easterly wind continued, and the sea remained calm, so that we made
very good way, and were able to keep the leak under.  It was with a sense of deep gratitude
that we at length made the land, when we had not a drop of water remaining, and with scarcely
food enough to sustain life for another day.  We fondly believed that all our troubles were
over.  The negroes shouted, and clapped their hands, and laughed with joy: some of them fancied,
I believe, that they had got back to Africa.  The next morning we dropped our anchor in the
harbour of Bahia.  Waller proposed to get the schooner repaired, to take in a supply of provisions,
and to return to Sierra Leone, intending, if necessary, to bear all the expenses himself. 
Now I am going to relate a circumstance which may seem very strange, but is, nevertheless,
perfectly true.  As soon as we brought up, Waller went on shore, intending to report all that
had occurred to the British Consul, and to get his assistance in carrying out his intentions.
I was in the meantime left in charge on board.  Waller had been gone a couple of hours, and
I was looking anxiously for his return, hoping that he would bring some provisions and water,
when, as I was walking the deck, I observed three boats pulling off towards us.  As they came
near, I saw that one of them contained several men in uniform.  They stepped on board without
ceremony; and one of them presented a paper, in Portuguese, which looked like an official document,
though, of course, I could not make it out.  I shook my head to signify this, when he commenced
explaining in broken English that he and his party were sent by the Governor to convey the
negroes on shore, that the vessel might be the more speedily hove-down to be repaired.  I was
somewhat surprised that Waller had not first returned; but it never occurred to me to suspect
a fraud in the matter.

While the Portuguese were speaking, three more boats came alongside, and in a very few minutes
all the blacks were transferred from the schooner into them.  Without an instant's delay, the
boats left the schooner's sides; but instead of making towards the town, they pulled away to
a spot some distance from it, where the negroes were landed, and I lost sight of them.  About
an hour after this, Waller returned.

"I have settled with the Consul, who will have a large store, where our poor blackies can be
housed comfortably while the schooner is repaired; but he says we must keep a strict watch
over them, for the people here are such determined slave-dealers, that they will kidnap them
before our eyes."

My heart sunk as I heard these words, and I felt like a culprit.

"Why," I exclaimed, "the Governor has sent and had them all conveyed on shore."

Waller could scarcely believe his senses when he found all the negroes gone.  He hurried back
to the Consul, who went with him to the Governor. The Governor knew nothing whatever of the
matter, nor did any of the officials of the town.  The Consul and some of the British in the
place made every inquiry in their power, but no information whatever could they obtain.  There
could, however, be no doubt that some slave-dealers had carried out the nefarious plot, while,
by the employment of bribes, they easily contrived to escape detection.  Waller felt the matter
very severely.  To have the poor negroes, in whom he took so great an interest, carried into
slavery, after all the toil and danger he had gone through, was almost heartbreaking.  For
long afterwards he could scarcely bear to speak on the subject.

It was not without difficulty that we got the schooner repaired; but at last she was ready
for sea, and without further delay we made sail for Sierra Leone.  We had a very fine run across.
Within a day's sail of the coast, we fell in with a slaver, which, supposing us to be of the
same kidney as herself, allowed us to ran alongside; so that, without the slightest opposition,
we took possession of her.  Although she had no slaves on board, she was in every respect fitted
to carry them.  She had but a small crew, it being evidently intended to take more men on board
when the slaves were shipped.  Waller thought it best to remove them into the Zerlina, while
he sent me and three hands, with Jack Stretcher as my first-lieutenant, to navigate the prize
into port.  As may be supposed, I felt very proud of my new command, and pictured to myself
the satisfaction I should have in reporting my arrival at Sierra Leone.

CHAPTER TWENTY TWO.

MY NEW COMMAND--A HEAVY SQUALL AND CAPSIZE--SAVED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCHOONER--TAKEN OFF
BY A SLAVER--CHASED BY THE OPOSSUM--THE SPANIARD'S THREAT--A HURRICANE--SHIPWRECK--MY FRIENDS
THE MARLOWS--CONCLUSION.

There is a common saying that "there's many a slip between the cup and the lip."  I experienced
the truth of it on the present occasion. Scarcely had I got on board my new command, when one
of the thick fogs I have before described came on.  The Zerlina was leading, and being by far
the faster vessel of the two, was already a mile ahead of us. However, I was pressing on all
sail to keep up with her, while Waller shortened sail to enable me to effect this object. 
The fog grew thicker and thicker, and at last night came on, and we lost sight of our consort.
The fog lasted two days.  When at length it partially cleared, we saw a sail hull down to the
southward; but not another speck was visible in the whole circle of the horizon.

"We must pack on her, and try and overtake Mr Waller," said I to Jack Stretcher.  "He will
heave-to for us, probably, when he finds we are so far astern."

Pack on her we did, in truth.  If Jack had a fault as a seaman, it was a too great fondness
for carrying on to the last.  We neither of us took warning from our misfortune in the Opossum.
The faster the little schooner ran through the water, the greater was our satisfaction.

"If we continue to make as good way as we do at present, we shall soon overtake the Zerlina,"
said I to Jack.

"She's got a clean pair of heels of her own, I'll allow; but we have taught our little craft
to go along too," he answered, looking up with no small amount of pride at our well-set canvas.

A true sailor has a pride in the good behaviour of any craft he happens to be on board.  Thus
a couple of hours passed, and we certainly were gaining on our consort.  I own that I had not
been keeping that look-out to mark any change in the weather which I ought to have done.  In
a tropical climate, especially, a seaman cannot be too careful--the changes are so very sudden.
I had gone below to dinner, that meal consisting of some cold salt beef and hard biscuit, washed
down with rum-and-water drunk out of a tin cup.  I had been off the deck rather more than half
an hour, and was just putting my head up the companion-hatch, when I heard Jack Stretcher sing
out, "Let go the fore-sheet!--down with the helm!--down with the--"

Before he could finish the sentence, there came the rushing sound of a heavy squall.  Down
bent the schooner to its fury--over, over she went. To spring on deck and to clamber up to
the weather-bulwarks was the work of a moment.  Still the vessel rose not: the helm had lost
its power; the sheets remained fast; her sails reached the water.

"She's gone!--she's gone!" shouted my crew.

I still had a faint hope she might right herself again; but when she made the attempt, the
furious wind beat her back, the sea washed over her sails, and in another moment she turned
completely over.  I can scarcely describe my sensations.  I had no time, I fancy, to experience
any; at all events, I do not remember what they were.  I never lost hope; for, bad as things
were, I did not expect to be drowned.  In the meantime I had clambered to the outside of the
bulwarks.

"Give me your hand here, sir!"  I heard Jack Stretcher sing out, and looking up, I saw that
he was hanging on to the main-chains.  With his assistance, as the vessel went over, I managed
to climb up on her keel, and there we together sat for the moment in comparative security.
Like a true sailor, he had caught hold of a rope, and brought the end up with him.  Our first
thought was to look out for our shipmates.  One had, unhappily, been below; the other two had
been washed off the deck.  They were, however, supporting themselves in the water, at no great
distance from the vessel.  When they saw us they shouted to us to help them, for neither of
them were good swimmers.

"Keep up, my lads!" cried Jack, in return.  "Get a little nearer, and I'll lend you a hand."

Meantime he was hauling in on the rope, and coiling it up ready to heave to them.

Just then I saw something dark moving under the water close astern of the vessel.  Jack saw
it also, as I guessed by the glance of his eye.

"What's that!"  I asked, a thrilling sensation of horror creeping over me, for I knew too well.

"One of those sea-devils--a shark, sir," he answered, in a low tone. Then he shouted out, "Strike
away, my lads!--strike away! you'll soon be within reach.  Never say die!  Strike away!  Hurra!"

Inspirited by these words of encouragement, one of the men at length got within reach of the
rope.  Jack hove it to him.  He made a spring and grasped the end, and without difficulty we
hauled him up, he little suspecting the terrific danger he had for the present escaped.  The
strength of the other poor fellow was evidently fast failing.  The dreaded monster of the deep
was not far from him.  Still, happily, he did not know of its presence, and the exertions he
made kept it at a distance.

"I'm afraid poor Sandy will never reach us, sir," said Jack, looking at him compassionately.
"Just do you, sir, and Jim Dore, lay hold of the end of the rope, and I'll try and carry it
out to him.  There isn't much fear of Jack Shark as long as one keeps moving; and I see a bit
of a stick down there, which I'll catch hold of, and give him such a rap on the nose if he
attempts to meddle with me, that he'll remember it for many a day to come."

He said this as he was coiling up the rope again.  I could not dissuade him from his gallant
resolve, and yet so dreadful seemed the risk of his being destroyed by the shark, that I almost
wished he had not thought of it.

Jim and I caught hold of the other end of the rope, and seizing it without another word, he
plunged into the sea, encouraging Sandy to perseverance with his loud shouts.  He first grasped
the piece of wood he had seen, and with it in his hand he swam towards Sandy, every now and
then stopping to strike the water vehemently with it.  Although the foam was flying over the
tops of the waves all the time, and the sea was washing up the sides and almost sweeping as
off from where we sat, under the lee of the vessel it was comparatively calm.  Anxiously indeed
did I watch my brave shipmate's proceeding.  Every moment I expected to see the shark make
a dash at him, but his splashings and kickings kept the monster at bay.  He was almost up to
poor McTavish, when the latter threw up his arms and disappeared from our sight.  Jack was
after him, though; and, diving down, in another instant appeared holding him by the hair. 
Throwing the bight of the rope under his arms, he sang out to us to haul away on it.  We did
so, while he supported the man with one hand, and kept slashing the water with the stick which
he held in the other.

Meantime I saw the fin of the shark as the monster kept swimming about in his neighbourhood,
eager evidently to make a dash at him, yet afraid of approaching.  At length we got the almost
drowned man up to the side of the vessel, and were hauling him up, Jack still being in the
water, when some feeling, I scarcely know what, prompted me to look in the direction where
I had just before seen the shark.  The monster was no longer there.  I instantly cried out
to Jack.  The words were scarcely out of my mouth, when he made a spring and scrambled out
of the water by the main-chain-plates.  Then, turning round, he dealt a tremendous blow at
the tail of the shark, who had closely followed him.

"I'll teach you to play such a sneaking trick as that, my boy!" he shouted, as the greedy fish
swam off discomfited.

I breathed more freely when brave Jack was once more seated alongside of me on the keel of
the vessel Sandy McTavish, whose life he had thus so gallantly preserved, now came to his senses,
and in a short time was sufficiently recovered to take care of himself.  Our position, however,
was far from enviable.  Here were we, four human beings, seated on the keel of a vessel which
might any moment go down, with neither land nor a sail in sight.  For some time, after all
our exertions, we sat silent, collecting our thoughts.

"Well, Jack," said I, "what are we to do?"

"Wait patiently, till God sends us help, sir," he replied.  "We can't help ourselves.  It's
fortunate we've just had our dinners.  We shall hold out the longer."

We scarcely exchanged another word for some hours, but kept wistfully glancing our eyes round
the horizon, in the hopes of a sail appearing. Shortly before darkness came on, and the hour
of ten passed by, I began to feel rather hungry.  At the same time I happened to put my hand
into my pocket, and there I found the greater part of a ship's biscuit, which, as I was quitting
the cabin, I had mechanically thrust into it. I almost shouted for joy as I found the prize--though
it was not much to be divided among four men.  The discovery made the rest fumble in their
pockets.  McTavish had a tobacco-box, which he had only just filled, and Jack found a huge
lump of grease, which, though not very savoury, was not to be despised.  How it had come there
he could not recollect. These treasures, however, we determined not to begin to consume till
the following morning, for that night we had no hopes of being taken off the wreck.  The squall
had rapidly passed off, and the ocean was now as calm as before.  The sky was clear, and the
sun went down in a blaze of glory, shedding a bright ruddy hue over the wide expanse which
surrounded us.  Night came on, and the stars burst forth from the blue vault of heaven, and
cast their reflection on the smooth, mirror-like water, as we sat on, hour after hour, afraid
of going to sleep, lest we should slip from our hold, yet longing for repose.  At last it occurred
to me to have the rope passed from one to the other, and secured round our waists, so that
if one fell asleep and began to slip, the rest might support him.  Thus we got through the
longest night I had ever then passed.

The grey dawn came at length, and as the light rapidly increased, we looked anxiously around
the horizon, but nothing but the smooth glassy sea met our sight.  Oh, then, well do I remember
it!  There came over me a deep sense of our utter helplessness, and of the palpable necessity
of dependence on a higher power.  Of what use was our strength?  Of what use was our seamanship?
Our strength without food would quickly leave us; while all we could do was to sit still. 
I spoke my thoughts to my companions.  They listened attentively, and we all knelt down together
on our unstable support, and prayed to God for preservation from our great peril.  After this
act we felt refreshed and encouraged; and I observed that the voices of my companions assumed
a more cheerful tone than before.  Our trials, however, were but commencing.  As the sun rose
in the sky, his beams struck down on our undefended heads and scorched us dreadfully, till
Jack bethought him of fastening his handkerchief over the top of his, and we followed his example.
Instead of breakfast, we each of us took a quid from Sandy's box, and that had the effect of
staying our appetites for some hours.  This, however, did not satisfy our stomachs entirely,
and a short time after noon we could no longer resist attacking our scanty store of provisions.
My biscuit I broke in two, and returning one-half to my pocket, I divided the other into four
parts, Jack treating his lump of grease in the same way.  We ate it with a relish I can scarcely
describe.  It was the only food we consumed for the whole of the day.  Again the sun went down
without a sail having appeared.  That night passed away as had the former one, though each
of us got rather more sleep.  The next morning there was the same dull calm.  Noon came, and
with a heavy heart I served out the remainder of our provisions, but none of us seemed to care
much for food.  Water was what we craved for.  A thimbleful to moisten our tongues would have
been worth its bulk in gold.  A raging thirst was growing on us.  I urged the men to abstain
from drinking salt water, for I well knew that if they did, it would only increase their sufferings.
Earnestly did I pray that we might not have to endure another night on the wreck, for I thought
that we could never exist through it; but the night came, and we passed it, how, I scarcely
know, for, though not asleep, I was certainly not fully awake, except to a sense of some overpowering
misfortune.  The day came, a day which we must pass without food or water.  Our sufferings
hitherto had not been great, but this morning they became very intense. Hope, which had till
now never deserted us, began to grow faint, and alas! even trust in God's providence to wane.
I tried to pray, but my thoughts were confused.  I could not for two consecutive minutes fix
them on the same subject, and I experienced practically the folly of attempting to wait for
a death-bed repentance, for sickness, or for such a moment as the present, for reconciliation
with God.  I speak of my own feelings, and I believe that they were not far different from
those of my men.  Hour after hour we sat gazing stupidly at each other.  The hot sun rose and
scorched us as before, while the bright glare his rays cast on the smooth ocean almost blinded
our eyes.  Several times I tried to rouse myself to talk to my men, and to encourage them;
but I own that I failed miserably in the attempt, and, from weakness, I was scarcely able to
refrain from giving way to a flood of tears.  It was some time past noon, when I saw Jack's
countenance brighten up.

"What is it?"  I asked.

He pointed eagerly to the southward.  I turned round, and looked, and there I saw in the horizon
a long, thin, well-defined, dark blue line, and in the centre of it a white speck.

"A breeze! a breeze!"  I cried.

"Ay, and a sail, too," added Jack.  "She is standing this way.  Huzza! my lads."

Jim and Sandy cheered faintly.  They were the first words they had uttered for some hours.
We now all found our tongues, a fillip had been given to our spirits, and we thought scarcely
of our hunger or thirst. The dark blue line advanced, and grew wider and wider, till it spread
itself over the ocean; and the white speck grew higher and higher, till the topsails of a vessel
were seen rising out of the water.  Oh! with what intense anxiety did we watch her, fearing
every moment to see her alter her course, or pass by without noticing us.

"Can she be the Zerlina?" said I to Jack.  "I think when Mr Waller found that we were not following
him, he would have put back to look for us."

"No, sir; she has too wide a spread of canvas, to my mind, for the Zerlina," answered Jack.
"I'm doubtful what she is."

"Maybe she's the Opossum hersel'," remarked Sandy.  "I ken she ought to be found hereabouts."

"No, no, my boy; that craft is a square-rigged schooner, and a big one too," said Jack, positively.

Less than an hour showed us he was right, and a long, low, black, rakish-looking schooner,
with a wide spread of canvas, everything set alow and aloft, to catch the breeze, came sweeping
past us.

"She's a slaver," I exclaimed, with dismay.

"Ay, and has as wicked a look as I ever wish to see," said Jack.

He was right in his description, and as she glided by us, a villainous set of ruffians of every
shade of colour, of every variety of costume, appeared looking at us over her bulwarks.  Still,
ruffians as they might be, it appeared better to be taken off by them than to remain and perish
where we were.  We waved to them to come to us, and Jack and Jim Dore sung out, "Misericordia!
misericordia!"

They appeared, however, to take no notice, either of our signs or our cries, and our hearts
sank within us.  Happy would it have been for us had they left us where we were (so it seemed
a short time afterwards). However, directly they had passed us, their studding-sails were taken
in, the yards braced up, and in fine seamanlike style the schooner was rounded-to, close to
leeward of us.  A boat was instantly lowered, and pulled up alongside the wreck.  Her crew
did not improve in appearance on a nearer inspection.  As they made signs to us to get into
the boat, we slid off the bottom of the schooner, when they hauled us in, and placed us in
the stern-sheets.

While they were pulling on board their own vessel I saw them eyeing my uniform with suspicious
glances, and they made remarks which I did not understand.  Our condition was sad enough to
excite the compassion of anything human.  When we were lifted on deck we could scarcely stand,
and even Jack, with drooping head, had to support himself against the bulwarks, and little
would any of those who saw him have supposed the gallant deeds of which his brawny arm was
capable.  Our lack-lustre eyes and parched lips showed what we most needed, and at last some
of the crew brought us some water in a bowl, which speedily revived us, while others came with
a mixture of soup and beans.  I never ate anything I thought so delicious, in spite of its
being redolent of garlic, and containing no small quantity of grease.  While we were being
fed, the boat was hoisted in, the schooner put before the wind, and the studding-sails again
set.  She was a powerful vessel, and, from several unmistakeable signs, I perceived that she
was full of slaves.  I had done eating, and was beginning to look about me, when a little,
dark, one-eyed man, who by his dress I saw was an officer, came up to me, and taking me by
one of my uniform buttons, asked--

"What for this?"

"It's the button of my coat," said I, in a simple tone.

"I know.  You officer, then?" asked my friend.  "English ship?"

"I have that honour," I replied.

"What ship, then?" he inquired.

I told him.

"How came you, then, there?" he asked, pointing to the wreck, which we were fast leaving astern.

I told him the truth.

"What say you, then, if we cut your throats, and heave you overboard?" he asked; and as I looked
at the twinkle of his one eye, and the expression of his lips, I thought that he was capable
of any act of atrocity; but I determined to put a good face on the matter.

"I do not see why you should murder us," I replied, calmly.  "We neither wish to harm you,
nor can we; and as you have just preserved our lives, it would be something like destroying
your own work."

"We will see about that," he remarked.  "You might find us sometimes in a humour when there
would not be much doubt about the matter.  Your men are safe enough, as they will doubtless
join us, and three stout hands will be welcome.  You may think yourself fortunate, if you ever
set foot ashore alive."

I saw Jack, who was listening, put his tongue in his cheek, as much as to say, "Do not reckon
on my joining your villainous crew."  I had remarked that the captain of the slaver, for such
I guessed the little man to be, improved in his way of speaking English as he proceeded, and
I therefore warned Jack and the others to be careful what they said, lest they should offend
him.  After this conversation we were left alone, and sitting down on deck, I was very soon
fast asleep.  I was awoke by a man bringing me a mess of some sort to eat, and when I had devoured
it I should have fallen asleep again, but the captain came up and told me that I might turn
into a spare cabin on deck.  Taking off my clothes, I threw myself on the bed, and slept without
moving till the grey light of dawn came in at the scuttle.  I was awoke by a loud jabbering
and swearing, and presently the sound of a gun came booming over the water.  There was then
the noise of blocks creaking and ropes rattling, denoting that more sail was being made on
the vessel.  I dressed quickly and opened the door of my cabin, but scarcely had I stepped
out on deck when my shoulder was roughly seized by the captain of the slaver, while with his
other hand he pointed to a large brig about three miles off, under all sail, standing directly
for our larboard quarter.

"What craft is that?" he asked, fiercely.  "Your men say they do not know her.  Do you?"

I looked again.  I had no doubt she was the Opossum.  "If I am not mistaken, she is the ship
to which I belong," I replied, calmly.

"Is she fast?" he asked.

"She is reputed so," I answered.  "But I doubt it she is so fast as this vessel."

"For your sakes, as well as for ours, it is to be hoped not," he observed, with a grin which
I thought perfectly demoniacal.  "If she overhauls us, we shall be obliged to put into execution
a trick we play at times, when too hotly pursued by your cruisers; only, instead of expending
our negroes, who are valuable, we shall be compelled to make use of you and your people.  It
will be happy for you, if there are no sharks ready to grab you before your ship lowers a boat
to pick you up. You understand me?"

I did, too well.  The slavers, when hotly pressed by a cruiser, will throw overboard some of
their blacks, one by one, lashed to something to float them, trusting that the humanity of
the British commander will induce him to heave-to, and to pick them up, although thus delaying
him in his chase.

I felt very sure my one-eyed friend would put his threat into execution; and though it certainly
afforded us a way of getting back to our ship, the risk in the interim of being caught by a
shark was far too great to be contemplated with equanimity.

"If you do throw us overboard, I only hope that you will provide us with sticks, or some weapons
with which to defend ourselves against the sharks," said I.

"You are a brave boy," said he, "and deserve a better fate; but it cannot be helped."

There was a fine breeze, but nothing more; and by the time the schooner's sails were trimmed,
as I looked over the side I saw that she was making good way through the water.  I doubted
whether the Opossum could go faster; and I saw, at all events, that, like other stern chases,
this would be a long one.  It very probably would last two or three days, perhaps longer. 
I scarcely knew what to wish.  Were it not for those dreadful sea monsters, we all of us might
be able to get on board the brig, and help to capture the schooner afterwards, I thought to
myself.  We were allowed perfect liberty to walk about the decks as we liked; so I went up
to Jack, and asked him what he thought about the probability of the brig overtaking us.

"Why, sir," he replied, after contemplating her, and looking over the schooner's side for some
time, "this craft has got as clean a pair of heels as any vessel I was ever aboard; and though
our brig, I'll allow, is no laggard, I doubt if she'll overtake her, if the wind holds steady,
before we reach the West Indies, where, I take it, we are bound."

Jack was right, with regard to the relative speed of the two vessels, at all events.  As I
kept my eye on the brig, I could not but acknowledge that we were slowly but surely increasing
our distance from her.  This put the captain in good humour.

"Ah! my young friend," he said, tapping me on the shoulder, "you have escaped the sharks this
time, I believe."  At night I turned in and went to sleep, for I had not yet recovered from
my want of rest and unusual anxiety.  The next morning, there, however, was the brig, right
astern of us, though we had much increased our distance from her.  When I appeared, the captain
gave me no friendly look; and it was only towards the evening, when we had brought her topsails
beneath the horizon, that his good humour was re-established.  Another night passed, and the
brig was out of sight.  I thought it more than probable, however, that Captain Idle was still
following, in the hopes of finding us becalmed, or in some other way falling in with us.  I
cannot stop to describe the scenes of gambling and fighting continually going on among the
schooner's lawless crew, though their outbreaks of fury were generally repressed, before arriving
at extremities, by the energy of the little captain.  We got on tolerably well with them. 
Jack danced his hornpipe, I sang, and the other two men made themselves generally useful. 
I, therefore, no longer had any great fears about our present safety.

A dreadful doom was, however, prepared for most on board.  One night I was awoke by a terrific
noise, and, rushing on deck, I found that one of those fierce hurricanes which occur at times
in the tropics had just commenced.  Amid a mass of spoondrift the schooner drove helplessly
before it.  The night was dark as pitch, except when vivid flashes of forked lightning darted
from the clouds and shed a bright blue glare on our decks, exhibiting a scene of horror and
confusion seldom surpassed. The seamen ran to and fro shrieking with terror, calling on their
saints to help them, and vowing candles and other offerings at their shrines, the fiercest
and most quarrelsome generally showing the most abject fear.  The little captain, to do him
justice, kept his presence of mind, and endeavoured to restore order, but he had lost all control
over his crew.  Jack found his way aft to where I was standing, and I was truly glad to have
him near me.

"It's to be hoped there's no land under our lee, or it will fare ill with us," said he.  "But
I'm not quite certain.  Just now, when there was a bright flash of lightning, I thought I saw
something very like it right ahead of us.  We must be ready for the worst, I'm thinking, Mr
D'Arcy."

I felt this to be the case, and prayed earnestly to God to stretch forth His hand to save us.
Scarcely a minute had elapsed after Jack had spoken, when the tempest, thundering down on the
accursed slave ship more violently than before, the lightning flashing more vividly, a terrific
shock was felt, which made her tremble as if about to part asunder; the tall masts bent like
willow wands, and fell with a crash into the sea; and the voracious waves came curling up,
foam-crested, astern, and sweeping everything before them.  The howling of the fierce hurricane
overpowered the agonised shrieks of the drowning crew, as they were carried overboard; while
from the hold arose the heart-piercing cries of despair and terror of the helpless negroes
who were confined there, deprived of even a chance of escape.  Our two shipmates had found
their way aft, to where Jack and I were holding on for our lives, sheltered partly by the raised
poop.  Still we drove on.  We had evidently been forced over a reef, and we hoped that we might
reach smooth water.  The sea no longer broke over us.

"What say you, lads?  Let's try to give those poor fellows down there a chance for their lives,"
cried Jack.

All agreed to the proposal.  There were scarcely any Spaniards left to stop us; and had there
been, I do not think they would have ventured to interfere.  I had observed some axes hung
up inside the cabin-door, and seizing them, we tore off the hatches, and leaped down among
the terror-stricken wretches below.  Sandy had bethought him of securing some lanterns, for
in the dark we could do nothing.  As soon as he had brought them, and we had got them lighted,
Jack singing out, "Amigos!--amigos!--have no fear, my hearties!" we set to work with a right
good will, and knocked the fetters off a considerable number of the unfortunate negroes.  The
operation was nearly completed, when we felt another terrific shock vibrate through the ship.
Again and again she struck.  We had just time to spring up the main-hatchway, followed by the
howling terrified blacks, when the sides of the ship seemed to yawn asunder; a foaming wave
rushed towards us, and at the same moment a vivid flash of lightning showed us the shore, not
a hundred yards off.

"There's hope yet," I heard Jack exclaim.

There is, after that, a wild confusion in my mind of shrieks and groans; of foaming, tossing
waters; of pieces of plank driven to and fro; of arms outstretched; of despairing countenances,
some pale or livid, some of ebon hue, lighted up ever and anon by a flash of lightning.  I
was clinging, I found, to a small piece of timber torn from the wreck.  Now I was driven near
the sands; now carried out to sea; tossed about on the tops of the foaming waves, rolled over
and over, and almost drowned with the spray.  Still I held on convulsively, half conscious
only of my awful position.  It seemed rather like some dreadful dream than a palpable reality.
How long I had been tossing about in this way, I knew not.  Daylight had been stealing on even
before the final catastrophe had occurred.  At length I know that I felt myself carried near
the sands, and while I was trying to secure a footing, some black figures rushed into the water
and dragged me on shore.  My preservers were, I discovered, some of the negroes who had escaped
from the wreck.  I was too much exhausted to stand; so they carried me up out of the reach
of the waves, and laid me on the sands, while they returned once more to the edge of the water.
Their object was evident.  By the increasing light I saw several figures clinging to the rocks,
against which I concluded the vessel had struck.  Full twenty negroes were on the beach, which
was strewed with bits of plank and spars, and coils of rope, and other portions of the wreck.
Presently I saw four or five of them plunge into the water together, holding the end of a rope.
They struck out bravely, and though more than once driven back, they still made way, till they
reached the rock, up which they clambered.  The people on the rock helped them out of the water.
There were several negroes, a few of whom were women, and three white men.  One of the white
men held a black infant in his arms, and as the light increased, I recognised my friend Jack
Stretcher. The question of the Ezra memoirs raises the further question of the Aramaic documents.
The memoirs are immediately preceded by the Aramaic rescript of Artaxerxes permitting Ezra
to visit Jerusalem for the purpose of reorganizing the Jewish community (Ezra vii. 12-26). Doubt
has been cast upon the authenticity of this document on the strength of its undeniably Jewish
colouring; but this, as we have seen, is probably to be explained by the not unnatural assumption
that Ezra himself had a hand in its preparation. Its substantial authenticity seems fully guaranteed
by the spontaneous and warm-hearted outburst of gratitude to God with which Ezra immediately
follows it (Ezra vii. 27ff): "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of our fathers, who hath put such
a thing as this in the king's heart," etc. A similar criticism may be made in general on the Aramaic
document, Ezra iv. 7b-vi. 18. It is certain, as we have seen, that the document has been retouched
by the Chronicler; but the whole passage and especially the royal decrees are substantially authentic.
Attention has been called to the Persian words which they contain, though this alone is not
decisive, as they might conceivably be due to a later author; but the authenticity of the decree
of Cyrus is practically guaranteed by the story that it was discovered at Ecbatana (Ezra vi.
2). Had it been a fiction, the scene of the discovery would no doubt
have been Babylon or Susa.

After making allowance, then, for the Chronicler's occasionally cavalier treatment of his sources,
we have to admit that the sources themselves are of the highest historical
value, though in order to secure a coherent view of the period, they
have, in all probability, to be rearranged.

  He may eat as much of it as he likes," said Miss Alice.

I recollect this scene; but I fancy after it I got a relapse, through which, however, I was
mercifully carried, after a tough contest with death.  Oh! how tenderly and kindly I was nursed;
every want was attended to--every wish gratified, almost before expressed--by an old black
woman, who, day or night, scarcely ever left my bedside.  I quite loved her good, old, ugly
face--for ugly it was, without the possibility of contradiction, according to all European
notions of beauty, though some of the descendants of Ham, in her own torrid land, might at
one time have thought it lovely.  She was assisted in her labours by a damsel of the same ebon
hue, who had been saved out of the slave ship; and I believe that the attention of the two
women was redoubled on account of the way I had treated their unhappy countrymen on board that
vessel.  Jack Stretcher had been obliged to rejoin the brig, and had gone away in her.  I was,
however, frequently favoured by a visit from Miss Alice Marlow and her kind father, in whose
house I remained for many months, treated as if I had been a well-loved son.  At length I was
one morning riding down by the seashore, when the wide-spread canvas of a man-of-war caught
my sight, standing in for the land.  I recognised her at once as the Opossum, and was therefore
not surprised when, some hours afterwards, Waller walked into Mr Marlow's drawing-room.  Captain
Idle and the doctor followed soon afterwards, and a consultation having been held, I was pronounced
fit for duty, and compelled, with many regrets, to leave my kind friends, and to go on board.
The brig soon afterwards returned to the coast of Africa, where we took some slavers, went
through various adventures, and lost several officers and men with fever; and I again fell
sick, so that my life was despaired of.  Now, entertaining as these sort of things may be to
read about, no one was sorry when, one fine morning, another brig-of-war hove in sight, bringing
us orders to return home.  "Hurra for old England!" was the general cry, fore and aft.  "Hurra!
hurra!"

At length I once more found myself an inmate of Daisy Cottage, and many happy weeks I spent
there--perhaps the happiest in my life--in the society of my uncle and aunt and young cousins.
I there slowly, but effectually, recovered from the effects of the African climate, and the
hardships I had lately gone through, and was ultimately pronounced as fit as ever for service.
When Larry Harrigan heard that I was ill, he came over to Ryde, and could scarcely be persuaded
to leave me for a moment, till assured by the doctor that I was in no danger whatever, but
even he seemed much to doubt the judgment of the learned disciple of Galen.  Afterwards he
allowed very few days to pass without coming to set me, till I was strong enough to return
his visits, which I did not fail to do.  The good, kind old man!  He never went back to Ireland,
but lived on at Southsea, in perfect comfort, till he and his wife reached a green old age.
He used to tell me, confidentially, that there was an honest navy agent, who had found him
out, and insisted on paying him a wonderful interest for a certain share of prize-money, which
he had fortunately neglected to claim in his younger days.  It was, in truth, a way I took
of contributing to maintain the old man in comfort, without his feeling that he was a pensioner
on my bounty.

Some time after I had been at home, I heard from my gallant friend Waller, who had gone back
to Barbadoes.  He gave me a piece of information, at which I own I was not very much surprised,
namely, that he was on the point of bringing Miss Alice Marlow to England as his bride.  "I
hope that she will prove worthy of him, for a finer fellow does not exist," said I.

A short time before I left Daisy Cottage to join my next ship, I was sitting in the drawing-room,
when Sir Richard Sharpe was announced, and in walked Dicky himself.  We almost wrung each other's
hands off before we could speak, and then we did indeed rattle away.  His father was dead,
he told me.

"I have been compelled to deprive the navy of my services," said he, with perfect gravity.
"But you see that I have my estates to look after, and my mother and sisters' welfare to attend
to; and I could not fulfil my duties in these respects were I to remain afloat.  Do you know,
D'Arcy, I am very glad indeed that I went to sea," he continued, more seriously.  "It made
me think much less of myself, and cured me of many faults; for I am very sure that I should
have been spoiled had I remained at home.  They always let me have too much of my own way,
and that is bad for the best of us.  Now in the service I got cobbed and mast-headed, and made
to do what I was told; and I'm all the better for the discipline, though I did not like it
at the time.  Then I learned a very important lesson,--that every man, whatever his position,
has his duties to perform; and that, if he does not do them to the best of his power, he must
certainly expect to be disrated."

"You mean to say that you learned this out of the man-of-war's Homily-book,--the Station Bill,"
said I, smiling at my own conceit.

I must explain that this Station Bill is a book in which is entered the place which every man
on board is to occupy, as well as the duties he is especially to attend to, though at the same
time he is expected to do his very utmost in performing any other work which may be necessary.

"That's just it," replied Sir Richard.  "I used to think that the captain of a man-of-war had
a good deal to do to keep his ship in good order; but I can tell you that I feel that the owner
of a large estate has many more and multifarious duties; and that in a great degree every soul
upon it is committed by God to his care, and at his hands will they be required."

I fully agreed with my old messmate in these matters, and was rejoiced to find that he had
really discovered the true object of life.  I am happy to say that he was after this a very
frequent visitor at Daisy Cottage, and that ultimately one of my cousins became Lady Sharpe.
They, the Vernons and the Wallers, are among my most valued friends; and at the houses also
of Admiral Poynder and Captain Idle, and most of my subsequent commanders, I am a welcome guest.

I must not forget to mention, once more, my gallant companion in so many adventures, honest
Jack Stretcher.  He volunteered into the next ship to which I was appointed, to my very great
satisfaction; and afterwards taking out his warrant as a boatswain, he was with me for several
years, and a better boatswain there is not in the service.  I have never revisited my ancestral
halls since I left them with Larry to go to sea; and, to say the truth, the Encumbered Estates
Court knows more about them than I do.  The ocean is my only heritage; my ship is my wife,
and I look on my crew as my children.  I went to sea again as a midshipman; then, after passing,
I spent four years as a mate, and six as a lieutenant; during which time I saw a good deal
of hard service.  At length I got my promotion as a commander, and have still to look for my
post step.

Every career has its trials.  A naval life has many; but we must always bear in mind that we
were sent into this world for the express purpose of undergoing them, and that while some persons
are proved by hardships and poverty, others are so by abundance of ease and wealth.  I, for
my own part, feel that I have much for which to be grateful; and though I have neither rank
nor riches, I do not consider myself unfortunate nor ill-treated.  And once more I say, that,
had I to begin my career again, I should prefer to every other a life on Salt Water.

THE END.
