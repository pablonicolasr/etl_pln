Crispi was disposed to renew the struggle, for there was within a march of a day or two a larger
Italian force than that which had been defeated, under a competent commander, and the losses
of the Abyssinians had been so heavy that they were unable to advance, while the season of
rain was so close on them that they must have retreated in a few days, even if not attacked,
and if attacked in their retreat they must have abandoned all the fruits of their previous
victory. But to do this it was necessary to prorogue the Chamber until the operations were
concluded, and this course was opposed in the cabinet; Saracco, the Minister of Public Works,
threatening to resign if a further prorogation was decreed. The public panic was such that
a partial crisis would have been the signal for an outbreak of disorders on the part of the
parties opposed to the African policy, headed by the extreme Left in the Chamber,--a risk which
several of the ministers were indisposed to face,--and the ministry resigned without waiting
to meet the Parliament.

Civic courage in Italy is so low that any grave military or civil disaster, no matter on whom
should fall the responsibility, entails a change of ministry, and in this case even the King
abandoned Crispi, though the chief responsibility for the disastrous result of the campaign
rested on himself. Humbert always retreated before any popular commotion. He never understood
that the duty of the sovereign was to lend his moral support to his ministers so long as no
constitutional question was involved, or until there had been the expression of the will of
the nation, deliberately formulated, and not by the accidental votes which in the Italian Chamber
are oftener the result of conspiracies or panics than of any question involving a political
measure. Parliamentary government in Italy is a caricature of the form, demanding for its safe
working the most conservative influence of the Crown to control its action. But Humbert, by
yielding to every gust of excitement in the Chamber which, even by a surprise, menaced the
ministry, encouraged and developed the disorderly tendency and the strength of the subversive
party which always profited by the disorders. The only satisfactory means of control is rotation
of crops, using corn, small grain, and the Iron cowpea, a variety immune to this and other diseases.
Susceptible crops should be kept from infected fields for two or three years.


In the succeeding ministry the King had the unprecedented courage to refuse to accept Rudiní
and his programme, but admitted his inclusion in the ministry of General Ricotti, an old and
admirable soldier and military organizer, who was resolved to begin his administration by a
long desired and needed reorganization of the army, reducing its numbers and increasing its
efficiency. On this point the King was inflexible, for he always refused to allow the army
to be reduced organically, though he never refused to accept such a diminution of the rank
and file as made it utterly inefficient for an emergency, so long as the cadres and the number
of officers were not diminished. He sent a message to some senators who were in his confidence
to the effect that the measure of Ricotti must be defeated there, as he could not count on
its being rejected by the popular assembly. The senate rejected it, and Ricotti, unsupported
by his colleagues, resigned. The régime of half measures and little men returned. The accession
of Victor Emmanuel III. may bring about a change, if the new King has statesmen to fall back
on, but I do not see them amongst the old men. The only man competent to assume an effective
reconstitution of the state is Sidney Sonnino, the Secretary of the Treasury with Crispi, but
he is not a popular man, and, if he attempts to govern by the strong measures necessary, he
will meet the same hostility which always assailed Crispi. Nothing less than the courage and
abilities of a Cromwell could reform government in Italy, and, in the opinion of some of the
wisest and most patriotic Italians I know, the task is hopeless and the decay inevitable.

Fully convinced of this myself, I could but lose that interest in the future of Italy which
had always made residence there so attractive to me. Moreover, I had arrived at an age which
rendered the proper performance of the duties of my position on the "Times" impossible. Accordingly,
I sent in my resignation and returned to England, where in such condition of social and intellectual
activity as my years and circumstances permit, I hope to end my days, no longer a participant
in political affairs and content simply to live.

  Spartali, Marie. The band, equipped with brand new uniforms
  and instruments, is playing underneath the convent
  balcony. Their duties
  during
  the festivities are strenuous; for they
  must
  serenade the residence of every magnate in the
  town, receiving contributions
  of pesetas, cigarettes,
  and gin.
  
  This afternoon we made
  our round of calls, for every family keeps open house.
  A number of matinée balls were in session, where the natives
  danced "clack-clack"
  around the floor to the monotonous
  drone of home-made instruments. Our
  friends all wished us a "Ma-ayon Pascua"
  or "Feliz Pascua," for which "Merry
  Christmas" they expected some remembrance of
    the day. Our efforts
    were rewarded
    by innumerable gifts of cigarettes
    and many offers of tanduay
    and gin. At one place we experimented
    with a
    piece of "bud-bud,"
    which is (as its
    name implies)
    a sweet-meat
  made of rice paste mixed with sugar.
  The hams with sugar frosting, and the
    cakes flavored with native
    limes, and cut in the
  shape of the "Ensanguined Heart,"
    were more
    acceptable. At one house we received
    a cake made in the image of a lamb,
    with sugar ringlets
    representing
    fleece.
  At our departure, "many thanks, sir,
    for the visit,"
    and a final
    attempt to get
    rid of another cigarette.
    It is in bad taste to refuse. A Filipino host would feel offended
    at your not accepting
    what he offered.
    He would
  feel as though discrimination were
  implied.
  
  At night after the cock-fight one
  droll fellow brought around a
    miniature marionette
    theater,
  of which he was the proud proprietor.
  While his assistant blew
    a bamboo flute behind the
    scenes, the puppets
    danced fandangoes and
    played football in a very lifelike manner.
    Seated on an empty
    cracker-box
    in front, surrounded by the ragged picaninnies, sat Dolores, with
    her sparkling eyes, lips parted, and
    her black hair hanging loose,--oblivious
    to everything except the marionettes.
    
    The star attraction was
    preceded by applause. The number was
    announced by those familiar with
    the exhibition as
    a "Moro combat," and as the assistant struck a harrowing obligato on
      an old oil-can, the
    Moros appeared with fighting
    campalons and barbarous-looking
    shields. The crowd
    expressed its
    approbation in wild
    howls. The first two rounds were
    rather tame. "Afraid! Afraid!" exclaimed the crowd, but
      presently the combatants
    began to warm up to
    their work and to make frantic lunges at
    each other at the vital
    spot. This was the time of breathless
    and instinctive pressing forward
    from the back rows. Somebody
    cried out, "Cebu!" or "Down in front!" and then again,
    "Patai!" which means
    "dead." One of the warriors
    at this cue flopped
    supine on the stage,
    and the suppressed excitement broke. The victor, not
    content with mere manslaughter, plied
    his sword so energetically as quickly to reduce his victim
      to a state of
    hash. At this
    point his Satanic
    majesty, the curtain
    manager, saw fit to
    intervene, and with a
    long spear he successfully probed the limp remains, completing
    the assassination. I had not known
    until then what a young barbarian Dolores was.
      
    The last attraction of
    our Christmas week was a genuine Mystery play, the Virgin
    Mary being represented by a
    girl in soiled white stockings and
    a confirmation
    dress. The Christ Child was a Spanish
    doll in a glass case. There were the three
    wise men--one in a long
    beard and a pink
    mask, and the
    others in gold braid and
    knickerbockers--more like dandies than philosophers.
    "Joseph" was splendid,
    with a shepherd's crook and a
    sombrero. Adoration
    before the manger was the theme that
    was developed in a series of ballets danced by the children to a
tambourine and castanet accompaniment. At the conclusion of the play,
the little actors in their starry costumes, Joseph and the Virgin
(carrying the Babe), the three philosophers, and the musicians and
the army of admiring followers, filed out into the moonlight, and
as the sweet music of the "Shepherds' Song" diminished gradually,
they disappeared within a shadowy grove of palms.
