"Financially, it would be an economy--we should save storage of furniture, and have a convenient
refuge in case of illness.  The place is cheap, and could be run with quite a small staff,
and would be a pleasant means of returning hospitalities.  We could settle down for as long
as it suited us--three months, two months, a few weeks, as the case might be--and then, when
the impulse to roam came upon us, we should simply rise up and depart.  I should never ask
where you were going.  If you asked me, I should not reply.  Probably I should not know.  On
certain months of the year the house might become the exclusive property of one owner, when
she might invite her own friends, and disport herself as she pleased.  Again, we might devote
a certain period to charity, and entertain lame dogs.  There's no end to the good and the pleasure
that might be got out of that house.  `Pastimes' is its name; isn't it quaint and suggestive?
And on the enclosed sheet you will behold elaborate calculations of the sum which it would
cost to run.  The figures are over the mark, for I never delude myself by under-calculating
in money matters.  For my own part, I can pay up, and have enough over to wander at will. 
Can you do the same?  If not, say no at once, and the project is buried for evermore.  You
must not be tied.  I refuse to be a party to shutting you up in the depths of the country for
the whole year round.  You have had enough of that.  What you need now is movement, and the
jostle of other lives; but if, in addition, you can afford a rest-house, a summer lodgment,
a sanatorium for mind and body, and a meeting-place with a friend, then pack your box, Evelyn,
come and look at Pastimes with me!

"Your friend, Charmion Fane."

I threw down the letter and seized the sheet of calculations in an agony of eagerness.  A glance
at the final addition brought relief.  Yes!  I could do it--pay my full share, and still have
a handsome margin left over.  Once satisfied on that point, there could not be a moment's hesitation,
for it would be glorious to share a house with Charmion, and to have her companionship for
some months of each year.  My whole life was transfixed by the prospect, and yet she was right!
I could not have accepted the offer if it had meant a permanent settling down to a luxurious
country life.  I was too restless, too eager for experience, too anxious to discover my very
own work, and to do it in my very own way.

The picture of that old English house, with its panelled rooms, set in a surrounding wealth
of flowers and green, gripped hold of my imagination; but here was an odd thing.  It was powerless
to banish another picture, in which there was no rose and no blue, but only dull neutral tints--the
picture of a basement flat in a grey London road, with electric burners instead of sun, and
for view, a vista of passing feet belonging to bodies cut off from sight.

I could not, even for Charmion, give up the prospect of that flat, and all that it had come
to mean; but--let me acknowledge it honestly--it was balm and relief to know that I could have
a means of escape, and that at culminating moments of weariness, when everything seemed wry
and disappointing, and the whole weight of seven storeys seemed to be pressing down on my brains,
I could bang my door, turn the key, and fly off to peace and beauty, and a healing pandering
to personal tastes!

Woman is a complex character, and I am no better than my kind.  I feel it in me to be an angel
of self-denial and patience for, say, the third of the year!  I know for a certain fact that
I should have a bad lapse if I tried to keep it up for the remaining thirds.  Now, thanks to
Charmion, the way was made easy, and I could put my hand to the plough without fear of drawing
back.

I leapt out of bed in a tingle of excitement.  Impossible to lie still when things were happening
at such a rapid rate.  The sun was shining, and, looking at a belt of trees in the distance,
I could catch a faint shimmer of green.  It is perhaps the most intoxicating moment of the
year, when that first gleam of spring greets the eye, and this special year it held an added
exhilaration, for it seemed to speak of the budding of fresh personal life.

I laughed; I sang; the depression of the last weeks fell from me like a cloak, and I faced
the future glad and undismayed.  With the reading of that letter had come an end to indecision.
I now knew exactly what I was about to do.  Write to Charmion, and fix the earliest possible
date for a meeting in town.  From town we would inspect Pastimes, the while I instituted inquiries
for a suitable flat.  The two homes secured, I would then return to The Clough, and divide
my furniture into two batches, send them off to their several destinations, and follow myself,
hot foot.  It would take some time to put both dwellings in order, but it would be interesting
work.  I love the making of interiors, and if Pastimes must be fitted beautifully to do justice
to itself, still more would it be needful to turn the uninspiring "flat" into a haven of comfort
and cheer.

At this precise moment my prancing brought me in front of the long mirror, and what I beheld
therein brought me up with a gasp.  Twenty-six is quite a venerable age, but at moments of
happiness and exhilaration it has a disconcerting trick of switching back to seventeen.  That
smiling, bright-eyed, pink-and-white-cheeked girl in the glass, with two long pigtails of hair
hanging to her waist, looked really absurdly juvenile!  Given a small stretch of imagination,
you might have believed that she was a flapper preparing for her last term at school; by no
possible mental effort could you have placed her as a douce maiden lady, living alone in London,
devoting herself to good works in a manner as adventurous as it was unusual.

Mothers of children would insinuate that I was a child myself; troubled matrons would purse
their lips, and say, "I can't tell you, my dear. You are too young."  Certainly, oh, most certainly,
men of all ages would put me down as a designing minx!  In vain industry, self-sacrifice and
generosity--that young face, that bright youthful colouring would nullify all my efforts.

It was true--it was true!  I looked, as Aunt Eliza had pointed out, a dozen years too young
for the part.  People would stare, people would talk, people would advise me to go back and
live with my aunts, and wait ten years.

In a frenzy of impatience I seized the two long plaits, and twisted them now this way, now
that.  Astonishing the difference which hair-dressing can make!  I have read of a heroine who
passed successfully as her own twin sister by the simple device of plainly brushed hair and
puritanical garments, the sister, of course, sporting marcelle waves and Parisian costumes.
I dipped my brush in the water-jug and dragged back my own hair in a plastered mass, clamping
the plaits to my head.  I looked like a Dutch doll!  Clean and chubby, and, alas! considerably
younger than before.  I parted it in the middle, and glued it over my ears.  I looked like
a naughty schoolgirl, who had had her hair dressed by a maiden aunt.  I piled the plaits in
a coronet over my forehead; I looked like a portrait of a Norwegian damsel dressed for her
bridal.  I threw down the brush in disgust, and stamped with impatience.

No use!  Not a bit of use!  All the hair-dressing in the world could not make me look old,
or even approximately middle-aged.  The ugliest flannel blouse that was ever made, while it
would certainly be hideously unbecoming, could not add one year, let alone ten, to my age.

It was a bitter blow.  All that morning I went about pondering the desperate question of how
to look old.  Aunt Emmeline had prophesied that I should know soon enough, "with those beaked
features," but I wanted to know now, not in any permanent, disagreeable fashion, but as a kind
of sleight-of-hand trick, by which I could be mature one day and the next in blooming youth.
Elderly in London, young at Pastimes.  A douce, unremarkable "body" in the basement flat, and
in Surrey a lady of leisure, rings on her fingers and bells on her toes!

Aunt Eliza would have cried once more, "Oh, don't be silly!" if I had confronted her with such
a problem.  I said, "Don't be silly!" to myself many times over in the course of that day,
but I persisted in being silly all the same.  At the back of my mind lingered the conviction
that if I went on thinking long enough a solution would come.

How could I manage to look old?  I asked the question of myself every hour of the next few
days.  I asked it of everyone I met, and was fatuously assured that I demanded the impossible;
at long last I asked it of old Bridget, whose sound common sense had come to my rescue times
and again.

"Sure, my dear, your husband will manage that for you!" was Bridget's instant solution.

"Not the husband I shall choose!"  I replied with easy assurance.

A moment's pause was devoted to the problematical Prince Charming whose mission it would be
to keep me young, then I asked tentatively:--

"What shall I look like, Bridget, when I am old?"

Bridget folded her arms and regarded me with a critical stare.

"Your hair will turn grey, and them fine straight brows of yours will grow thin, or maybe fall
out altogether, and leave you with none.  An' you'll wear spectacles, and have lines round
your eyes.  But it's neither the grey hairs nor the specs that spoils the looks.  It's not
them that's the worst!"

I stared at her open-mouthed, trembling between shrinking and curiosity.

"It's the shape of the cheeks!" said Bridget darkly.  "Yourself now, and the ladies of your
age, it's pretty, slim bits of faces you have, going to a peak at the chin.  When you're old,
it runs to squares and doubles.  Look to your cheeks, miss, if you wants to keep young!"  She
unfolded her arms, stretched them at full length, and comfortably folded them again.  Her broad
chest heaved in a cackle of amused reminiscence.

"Sure, d'ye reminder Miss Kathleen when she play-acted the ould lady, the last Christmas party?"

Poor old Bridget!  She got the surprise of her life in my reception of that simple question.
Jumping out of my chair, dancing round, whooping and hurraying "like a daft thing," as she
afterwards described my movements.  Then to find herself at one moment enthusiastically patted
on the back, and at the next to be pushed towards the door, and exhorted to hurry!--hurry!--to
mount to the attic, and bring down the old tin box--well, it was disconcerting, to say the
least of it, and Bridget's dignity was visibly upset.  She had forgotten that all the "make
ups" which we had used for various Christmas festivals were stored away in that old tin box,
and consequently could not guess that I was fired with an ambition to try on Kathie's disguise
forthwith.

Ten minutes later I was standing before the glass and enthusiastically acclaiming the truth
of Bridget's statement, as I stared at the reflection of a spectacled dame with grizzled eyebrows,
grey hair banded smoothly over the ears, and a bulging fullness at the base of each cheek!
It was the cheeks that made the disguise!  Spectacles and hair still left the personality of
the face untouched; even the bushy eyebrows were but a partial disguise, but with the insertion
of those small india-rubber pads came an utter and radical change.  That chubby, square-faced
woman was not Evelyn Wastneys.  Never by any possibility could she see forty again.  So far
as propriety went, she might roam alone from one end of the world to the other.  If she lived
in the largest block of flats that was ever erected, her neighbours would regard her comings
and goings with serene indifference.  Admirable woman!  She did not "take the eye".  I met
her spectacled glance with a beam of approval.

"I have it!--I have it!  I must dress for the part!  In London I'll be a middle-aged aunt;
in Surrey, a niece--my own niece and namesake, who, of her charity, consents to receive some
of her auntie's protegees and give them a good time!"  The wildness, the audacity of the project
made to me its chief appeal.  My life interest had been so sheltered, so hedged round by convention,
that at times it had seemed as though there was a wall of division between me and every other
human creature.  It was so difficult to show oneself in one's real colours, to see and know
other people as they really were.  But now!--oh, what a unique and exhilarating experience
it would be to taste at the same time the romance of youth and the freedom of age, to witness
the different sides of other characters as exhibited in their treatment of aunt and niece.

That one illuminating suggestion of Bridget's has cleared the way.  From the moment of hearing
there had been no real hesitation; before night fell my plans were made, and a telegram to
Charmion was speeding on its way.  A new life lay before me--a dual life, teeming with interest
and possibility.  On one hand, my fate must be to some extent bound up with that of Charmion
Fane, the most interesting and, in a sense, mysterious woman I had ever met; on the other,
I was plunging into the unknown, and transforming myself into a new personality, to meet the
new circumstances.  I stared at myself in the glass and solemnly shook my grey head.

"Evelyn, my dear, be prepared!  You are going to have an adventurous time!"

CHAPTER FOUR.

A TALK IN LONDON.

The aunts expressed a mitigated approval of Charmion's proposal.  Mrs Fane came of a good family,
and was "very well left".  Her married estate, moreover, gave her the privilege of chaperonage,
so that the dual establishment might be quite a good arrangement, all things considered, "until--"

"Until!" echoed Aunt Eliza eloquently, nodding coyly at me, while I stared into space with
basilisk calm.  I object to references to my problematical marriage--especially by aunts. 
The great "until" never arrived for them, yet they feel quite annoyed because twenty-six has
found me still a spinster!

I made my journey to London with a sense of great adventure, Bridget going with me in the dual
role of maid and mentor.  She was the only person who was to accompany me into the new life,
and experience had proved that her sound common sense might be trusted to act as a brake on
the wheels of my own impetuosity.  We stayed the morning in town, when I interviewed a house
agent, and set him on the search for suitable flats, and then we adjourned to the West End
to buy a becoming new hat.  It always soothes me to buy hats.  In times of doubt and depression
it is an admirable tonic to the feminine mind.  At three o'clock we left Waterloo for our two
hours' journey, and arrived at the old-fashioned inn, which was to act as rendezvous, before
half-past five.

Charmion was awaiting us in a private sitting-room, long, oak-beamed, spotlessly clean, and
a trifle musty, with that faint but unmistakable mustiness which hangs about old rooms and
old furniture.  Tea was set out on one half of the oak dining-table.  The china was of the
old-fashioned white and gold order, the cups very wide at the brim and cramped at the handle,
and possessing a dear little surprise rose at the base, which peeped out through a hoar frost
of sugar as you drained the last gulp.  Charmion laughed at my delight over that rose, but
I was in the mood to be pleased, to see happy auguries in trivial happenings.  I hailed that
rose as a type of unexpected joys.

Charmion was dressed in business-like grey tweeds, with a soft grey felt hat slouched over
her head.  She looked very pale, very frail, intensely, vibratingly alive.  This extraordinary
contradiction between body and mind made a charm and mystery which it is difficult to express
in words.  One longed to protect and shield her, to tuck her up on a sofa, and tend her like
a fragile child, at the very same moment that mentally one was sitting at her feet, domineered
by the influence of a master mind!

I ate an enormous tea, and Charmion crumbled a piece of cake upon her plate; then we had the
things taken away, and drew up to the fire, and toasted our toes, and looked into each other's
eyes, and exclaimed simultaneously--"Well?"

Hitherto we had talked on general subjects, Kathleen's marriage, the break-up of the old home,
my own journey, etcetera, but now we were free from interruption for an hour at least, and
the great subject could be safely tackled.

"Evelyn!  Do you realise that nothing is settled, and that nothing need be, unless you are
absolutely, whole-heartedly sure?"

"I am absolutely whole-hearted about several things already.  What sort of things were you
thinking about?"

"Well, take the house first.  It meets my ideal, but it mayn't be yours. You must promise to
give an unvarnished opinion."

"Make your mind easy!  If there is one thing that I may claim to be above all others, it is
`unvarnished'.  I have a brutal frankness in expressing my own opinion.  If, through nice feeling,
I try to disguise it, my manner shrieks it aloud!"

"That's all right then.  I'm glad to hear it.  Next comes the question of time.  We should
have to take a lease of three years.  I don't know if you'd care to bind yourself for so long."

That reminded me of the aunts' "until", and I said solemnly, "Charmion, tell me the worst.
Is there an eligible bachelor who owns the next `place' ready to discover me picking his roses,
or trespassing on his side of the stream, and to make love to me forthwith?  They always do
in books, you know, when girls go to live in country houses."

Charmion smiled her slow, languorous smile.

"I have amused myself with looking up the names of the people living in all the big houses
around: They seem uniformly made up of couples.  To the best of my belief, there is not a single
man, bachelor or widower, within many miles."

I said, "Oh!" and felt the faint, natural dismay which any human girl would feel in the circumstances.
Charmion herself was enough romance for the present, and a precipitate "lover next door" would
for the moment have been de trop, but still--

My expression (unvarnished!) evidently betrayed my feelings, for Charmion smiled, sighed, and
stretched out a caressing hand.

"Let's be honest.  It is foolish to set up a partnership in the dark. Is there anyone, Evelyn,
who may swoop down upon us at a moment's notice, and carry you off to share his house?"

"To the best of my knowledge there is not a solitary one.  I'm quite sure of one thing, and
that is, that however wildly he swooped, I wouldn't go!"

"But there must be--you are so pretty, Evelyn, and so attractive--there must have been."

"Oh yes; two.  But not real lovers, Charmion, only--pretendus.  One was young and needy and
ambitious, and thought that I should look very well sitting at the head of his table.  Incidentally,
that my money would be useful to provide the table and the things upon it.  The other--he was
rather a dear, and he cared enough to give me a pang.  But he was happily married last year
to a girl who is as un-like me in every respect as you can possibly imagine.  They are both
ancient history now."

"And you?  You yourself?  You have never been in love?"

If any other woman had asked me such a question there would have been short shrift with her.
Charmion herself had never before attempted such personalities; but now, when she deemed it
necessary, she spoke without a flicker of hesitation, her grey eyes staring full into mine.
It would have seemed ridiculous to take offence.

"Once.  At first sight.  Quite bowled over.  We met at an hotel."

She knew what I meant, made a dainty little grimace, and bent her head in a small bow of acknowledgment,
which somehow managed to look quite regal and stately.  I longed to put one or two questions
in return. Widows have been known to marry again!  Why should I not wish to be reassured on
my own account?  Why should it be wrong for me to force confidences, when she herself had led
the way?  It would not be wrong; it would be right, and prudent, and praiseworthy.  The only
objection was, I could not do it.  After that little bow of acknowledgment, Charmion threw
back her head until it rested on the high cushioned back of her chair.

"That's settled then," she said quietly.

Her heavy lids drooped over her eyes, her fine white hands were folded in her lap.  There was
in voice and manner an air of finality, which was as impervious as a barrier of barbed wire.
Not for any bribe in the world would I have attempted to scale it.

The next morning, bright and early, we chartered a "fly," and lumbered along two miles of country
lanes, and then, suddenly turning a corner, found ourselves at the gate of Pastimes.  It was
a dull, grey day, of which I was glad, for any place can look attractive in spring sunshine.
I have seen even a third-rate London square look quite frisky and inviting with a shimmer of
green over the black trees, and the spring-cleaned windows sending out flashes of light; it's
a very different spectacle on a November afternoon.  Five minutes' acquaintanceship with Pastimes
showed, however, that its predominating quality was cheerfulness.  There was a great deal of
panelling on the walls, but it was of white wood, not oak, and the old, small latticed windows
had been converted into deep bays, filled with great panes of plate glass--a pagan proceeding
from an artistic point of view, but infinitely cheerful and healthy.  There was a large central
hall from either side of which opened two rooms of medium size, facing respectively east and
west; a quaint descent of two steps led the way to a really spacious drawing-room, through
the great windows of which was a lovely vista of velvet lawn, and a great cedar drooping its
green branches to the ground.

Parallel with the drawing-room, and also facing south, was a long glassed-in apartment which
had evidently been used to harbour plants, garden-chairs, and impedimenta, but which revealed
itself to our eyes as an ideal sun-parlour for chilly days.  Sheltered from draughts by the
outstanding walls, yet with a glass roof and frontage to catch every ray of sun, the parlour
would be an ideal refuge for spring and autumn.  So far as public rooms went, we were well
off with five apartments at the disposal of two people.

"Mine!--yours!--ours!" cried Charmion, waving her hands descriptively, first towards the two
smaller rooms, and then to the other three in turn.

"In the hall we will eat; the big room shall be no ordinary formal drawing-room, but a living-room
a deux.  The sun-parlour also we shall share, but the `sulkies' shall be private ground, hermetically
sealed against intruders!  There is a spare room upstairs which can be spared for muddles.
I have a fastidiously tidy eye.  It offends me to see things scattered about, but my hands
will go on scattering them, so it is necessary for my peace of mind to have a muddle-room where
I can deposit bundles at a moment's notice, and feel sure that they will not be tidied away.
Well, shall we go upstairs and see the bedrooms?"

"Where are the stairs?"  I asked curiously, for from no corner of the hall was there a glimpse
of staircase visible.  I had not thought about it before, but now I realised that it was just
this absence which gave that touch of comfort and privacy which is wanting in the ordinary
entrance "lounge".  There was no draughty well, no galleried space overhead, from which curious
ears could overhear private confidences.  I stared round mystified, till Charmion opened yet
another doorway, and behold! there was the staircase, the oddest, curliest specimen of its
kind, mounting up and up within a narrow well, for all the world like the steps in a church
tower, except that these were wide and shallow, and that a thick brass rod had been placed
on the outer wall to act as a banister in the case of need.  Whoever had built Pastimes had
plainly believed that stairs were needed for the purpose of transit only, and had refused to
waste space on their adornment.

On the first landing were several good bedrooms, two of which possessed big sunny balconies,
facing south.

"That settles it!"  I told Charmion.  "If I had had any doubts before, the balconies would
have decided me, once for all.  All my life I have yearned to have a bedroom opening on to
a really big balcony.  I'm crazy about balconies!  Think of the happy hours one has spent on
balconies in Switzerland and Italy!  To have been in a room without one would have been to
lose half the joy.  And even in England--think of all the things one can do on a balcony of
one's very own.  Sleep out when it is hot. Air your mattress.  Hang up your sponge.  Grow your
pet flowers.  Dry your hair.  Cry it out quietly when you feel blue.  Sentimentalise over the
railings when you feel rose."

Charmion's fine brows arched, her lids drooped over her eyes.  I recognised the same expression
which her face had worn the night before, when for a moment I had seemed on the point of questioning
her about her own romance.  Once more I felt myself up against an impenetrable wall of reserve,
and hastily switched the conversation to the more prosaic topic of cupboards.  The very sound
of a balcony bristles with romance, but cupboards may be discussed with safety under the most
lacerating circumstances.  There is something comfortably safe and stodgy about them.  And
Pastimes was so rich in this respect that we spent a happy half-hour appointing their future
uses, and jotting down notes for their improvement.

Later on we visited the gardens, beautiful even in their sleep, and promising a very paradise
for summer days.  The lawns and flower beds immediately around the house were exquisitely in
order, but by far the greater part of the grounds was uncultivated.  There was a strip of real
woodland, where the light filtered down through the branches of tall old trees on to a carpet
of dried leaves and bracken, through which could be seen the close-growing green shoots which
foretold a harvest of bulbs.  Later on no doubt there would be primroses and bluebells, and
when summer came, if I knew anything about it, there would be two hammocks swinging between
spreading branches, and two happy women reposing therein.  It was this real country air which
gave Pastimes its chief charm.

That evening Charmion came to my room, and we sat together by the fire and talked for three
solid hours.  As a rule, I get fidgety in the evening when talk is the only amusement, but
I can sit and listen to Charmion for as long as she chooses to go on.  She is--interesting!
She says things in an interesting way, and has interesting things to say.  I have met extraordinarily
clever and well-informed people who are terrible bores.  Charmion would be interesting if she
told one how to make an egg flip!  As I watched the delicate play of expression on the tired
face, which was yet so thrillingly alive, as I listened to the slow soft drawl of her voice,
I felt a sudden rush of thankfulness and exhilaration.

"Charmion!"  I cried suddenly, "aren't you thankful to be rich?"

She flinched as though I had struck her, and turned upon me a wild-eyed look of affront.

"Rich?  Who says I am rich?  Who has been talking about my affairs? Have you--have you been
making inquiries to find out what I am worth?"

I stared, deeply offended.

"I have not.  Perhaps it would have been more business-like if I had, but I accepted your word.
I asked a simple question because at the moment I happened to be feeling particularly thankful
that I could afford to share Pastimes with you, and I imagined that you might possibly feel
the same."

I paused, waiting expectantly for words of apology and excuse, but none came.  Charmion stared
at me below knitted brows, and said shortly:--

"Yes, it is true.  You ought to have business references.  You shall have them!  My lawyer
shall write to you at once.  I was a wretch to speak so sharply, Evelyn, but--you touched a
sore point!  Thankful?  No, indeed!  Money is a curse.  The greatest handicap a woman can have.
If I had my life to live again, I should choose to be a penniless working girl!"

She had taken off her rings and dropped them in a sparkling little heap on her lap, the while
she softly polished her long pink nails.  Her padded kimona was of pink silk, heavily embroidered
with roses, her feet were thrust into slippers of the same shade and material.  A more luxurious
figure it would be difficult to imagine.  I rolled an expressive eye, and she shrugged her
shoulders in response.

"Oh, of course, I am an artificial product, and the chains hold fast.  I don't take any particular
interest in my appearance, but it is an ingrained habit to go through a certain routine.  It
would annoy me to have dull nails, so I polish them as you see; also, though I am dead tired,
I shall have my hair brushed for half an hour before going to bed, and then steam my foolish
face.  It bores me profoundly, but it would bore me more to feel unkempt.  So far as that goes,
I should do exactly the same on twopence a week!"

"Minus a maid and appliances?"

Charmion shrugged daintily.

"Soap and water are cheap, fortunately."

"I beg your pardon!  Not your kind of soap.  You might find even hot water a difficulty.  I
imagine that girls on twopence a week have to consider the price of boiling a kettle.  Their
hot water is not `laid on'.  Moreover, the poor dears must be `dead tired,' in a way which
you and I cannot even imagine."

"It is their life," Charmion said loftily.

"Excuse me--I mean to live!  That's why I am thankful to have money, because it gives me more
scope to live thoroughly."

"Poor innocent!  What a delusion.  Money shuts the door of your cage.  A golden cage, excellently
padded, but--its bars shut out all the best things of life!"

I laughed again, for the statement was so opposed to all accepted theories.

"What best things, for example?"

"Confidence," said Charmion solemnly.  "Trust in one's fellow-creatures."  She lifted her heavy
lids as she spoke, and her eyes looked into mine.  In their grey depths was a blank, empty
expression, which once seen is never forgotten, for it speaks of a hurt so deep and keen that
the memory of it breaks the heart.  I leapt from my seat and wrapped Charmion in my arms.

"Oh, my dear, my dear, there is one person you can trust!  Whatever happens, Charmion, you
can count on me!  Darling!  I know you have had troubles.  I don't ask to hear about them.
I only want to be allowed to love you, and to do all I can to help and to comfort.  Never,
never be afraid to ask for anything I can do.  I would put you before myself, Charmion, if
it ever came to a choice between our different interests--I would indeed!  Don't you believe
it is true?"

She laid her two hands on my shoulders and smiled.

"You dear thing!  I believe it is.  You would sacrifice yourself for me, and I should accept
the sacrifice.  It is the way we are made.  You to give, and I to demand.  Let us pray, my
dear, that the day may never come when our interests do clash.  Of a certainty, poor Evelyn,
you would come off worse!"

CHAPTER FIVE.

PASTIMES--AND MR MAPLESTONE.

The next morning, bright and early, we called on the house-agent to sign and seal the agreement
which should make us the happy owners of Pastimes for a term of years agreeably elastic.

Mr Edwards was a small, dapper little man, typically house-agenty in manner, even to the point
of assuring us gravely that another tenant was urgently in the field, and that we had secured
our lease by the very skin of our teeth.

Charmion lifted incredulous eyebrows.

"But, Mr Edwards, you wrote to me a second time, only a fortnight ago, to say the house was
still on your hands!"

"Quite so, madam.  And it was.  But only on Monday Mr Maplestone motored over from Wembly.
Mr Maplestone is Squire there--a very influential gentleman in these parts.  He is looking
out a house for a relative, and had only just heard that Pastimes was vacant.  He drove over,
as I say, and telegraphed to his friend that the house was too good to lose.  He expected a
reply this evening."

"When it will be too late!"  Charmion said calmly.  "You told him, of course, that you were
in treaty with another tenant?"

"I did, madam.  Quite so.  But"--the little man hesitated, and fidgeted uncomfortably--"Mr
Maplestone is--er--accustomed to get his own way!  I explained that I must accept a definite
offer, and that you had the first option, but I am afraid that he hardly realises--"

Charmion waved an imperial hand.

"We are not concerned with Mr Maplestone, or what he expects.  Pastimes is ours, and that settles
the question.  To-morrow morning Miss Wastneys and I will meet you at eleven o'clock, to go
over the house together. It is in good order, but we shall require a little decoration and
painting here and there.  You will be able to advise us how to get it done well and quickly.
When I say quickly I mean quickly!  Plenty of men must be put on to begin the work and finish
it in a few days' time, not one or two who will drag on for weeks.  You can get us an estimate
for time, as well as for cost."

Mr Edwards bowed, murmured, and waved his hands.  He looked overcome, poor man, as well he
might, for if one would-be client demanded his own way, the other was obviously determined
to have hers.  Between the two his path was not easy!  I smiled at him ingratiatingly, just
to help things along, but he took little notice of me.  Obviously, in Charmion's company I
did not "take the eye!"

On the way home I expressed sympathy for the disappointed Mr Maplestone, but Charmion refused
to agree.

"I don't know the man, so his pleasures and disappointments don't enter into my sphere.  Promiscuous
universal sympathy is too great a tax on the nervous system.  Why should I distress myself
about a man I have never seen?"

"Not distress yourself exactly, but you might cast a kindly thought.  He will be disappointed,
and the poor little agent will have a bad half-hour."

"Now you are asking sympathy for the agent, too!  Evelyn, aren't you the least little bit in
the world inclined to wear your heart on your sleeve?"

"Charmion, aren't you the least little bit inclined to be hard?"

She agreed with unflinching candour.

"I am.  It's the safer plan if one doesn't want to be hurt!"

"But--what about the other people?  Mayn't they be hurt instead?"

She looked at me gravely for a moment, then with a smile which grew gradually broad and roguish.

"We ought to strike a happy mean between us, eh, Evelyn?  You are all credulity and gush, and
I refuse to disturb myself about other people, or their affairs."

"That's not true!  You disturbed yourself about me!"

"Because it affected myself.  I had grown fond of you, and so you entered into my life.  Pure
selfishness, my dear!"

"I don't believe it!  I won't believe it!  It's no good trying to disillusion me, Charmion.
I've put you on a topmost pinnacle, and it would take a mighty effort to tumble you down!"

"Dear thing!" murmured Charmion fondly.  "Well--suppose we talk of the drawing-room walls?
I'm a great believer in occupying oneself with the next step.  Revelations of character will
follow in due course--I plump for white!"

"White certainly.  A warm cream white, with not a touch of blue in it. And the prevailing colour?"

"Let's count three quickly, and then each say what we think!"

We counted, and the two words leapt crisply forth.

"Rose!" said I.

"Purple!" said Charmion.  Then we looked at one another beneath puckered brows.

"Rose lights up better!"

"Purple is more uncommon."

"Rose is more cheerful in winter!"

"Purple is restful in summer!"

It seemed for a moment as if we had reached an impasse, then came an illuminating thought.

"Why not--both?  They harmonise well.  Purple curtains and carpet--the plain colour, very soft
and subdued, and cushions and shades of the right rose.  With our united treasures we ought
to have a lovely room. Where are your things, Charmion?"

"Stored," she said shortly.  "I tried a house for a few months, but it was too lonely an experience.
But I have a passion for beautiful furniture.  It has amused me to pick up good specimens here
and there. Now we shall enjoy them together!  Wait till you see my Spanish leather screen!"

"Wait till you see my Chinese cabinet!"  I retorted, and we talked "things" industriously for
the next hour.

After luncheon Charmion settled herself to write business letters, drawing a big screen round
her writing-table, the better, as she informed me, to protect herself against my chatter.

"You promise to be quiet, but in five minutes' time you begin again! Now please to remember
that to all intents and purposes I am in another room, and that until I choose to come forth,
I am dead to you and everyone else!  Do you understand?  These letters positively must get
off to-night!"

"Dear me!  I don't want to talk!  I shall be thankful to sit by the fire and enjoy a quiet
read," I said loftily, and promptly drew up an old arm-chair, and buried myself in the book
which I had bought to while away the hours of my journey, and then left unread, because my
own affairs were at the moment so much more absorbing than those of a fictitious heroine. 
Now that my mind was more at ease, I found the story interesting enough, and had read on for
about an hour with undisturbed enjoyment, when suddenly the door was flung open, and a voice
announced:--

"Mr Maplestone!"

I leapt up, putting up a hasty hand to smooth my ruffled hair.  That was the worst of having
only one sitting-room!  Visitors were hurled in upon one without a moment's warning.  Happy
Charmion behind the screen!  I stared across the room and beheld a tall--very tall--thin man,
with short reddish hair and light blue, angry-looking eyes.  He was dressed in riding costume,
which, so far as his figure went, became him exceedingly well.  He was probably somewhere about
thirty-five, and one glance at his tightly-set lips and firm square chin was enough to demonstrate
the truth of Mr Edwards' assertion that he was "a gentleman who likes his own way".  He had
probably heard by now that for once he was to be thwarted, and had come to tell me what he
thought about it. At this moment I forgot to be sorry for his disappointment in my exceeding
sympathy for myself!  I glanced helplessly at the screen.

"Mrs Fane, I believe."

"I am Miss Wastneys.  Mrs Fane is engaged.  Perhaps it is something that I--"

He laid his hat and stick on the table.

"May I have a few minutes' conversation?  You will allow me to sit down?"

"Certainly."

I pushed aside the easy-chair and seated myself on one of the six "uprights" which were ranged
about the room.  It felt so much more business-like and supporting.  Mr Maplestone seated himself
opposite to me, and rested his hands on his knees.

"I am told that you have some idea of renting a house called Pastimes, near here!"

"We have taken Pastimes.  Mrs Fane and myself have this morning signed the lease."

He waved an impatient hand.

"This morning!  So I am told.  Edwards has behaved very badly.  I warned him that things should
not be hurried through."

"They have not been hurried.  It is several months since Mrs Fane first saw the house, and
three weeks since negotiations were opened a second time."

"I only heard this week that the house was vacant."

"And should Mr Edwards"--(the innocent inquiry of my voice was growing more and more marked)--"was
it his duty to have told you?"

His eyes sent out a flash.  I could see the muscles of his hand clench against his knee.  I
had scored a point, and his anger was correspondingly increased.

"Perhaps I had better explain," he began in a tone of elaborate forbearance.  "I live at Wembly.
Most of the land between here and there belongs to me.  Pastimes happens to be outside the
limit, and so it escaped my memory.  I have not been over it before.  I did not know the last
tenants.  For the last few weeks I have been looking for a house for my friend--a member of
the family who is returning from abroad.  Invalided!"

He pronounced the last word with emphasis, staring fixedly at me the while.  I adapted my features
to express polite commiseration.

"It is natural that he should wish to live within driving distance of his friends."

"Oh, quite!"

"The moment that I saw Pastimes I knew for a sure thing that it would be just his house--"

"I am sorry, but as he has not seen it, he can't be disappointed.  There must be other houses--"

"I have already said I have been searching round for--the--last--three-- weeks," Mr Maplestone
repeated, in the carefully deliberate tone which disguises irritation.  "Nothing else will
suit anything like so well."

I murmured indefinitely, and glanced at the screen.  Mentally I could see Charmion leaning
back in her chair, smiling her slow fine smile, inquisitively waiting to see just how firm
or how weak I could be.  I was not inclined to be weak.  There was something in the personality
of this big domineering man which roused an imp of contradiction.  We sat silent, eyeing one
another across the room.

"I believe you and--er--Mrs Fane are strangers to this neighbourhood?"

"Yes!  That is so."

"You have no--er--special link or attraction?"

I saw the trap, and protested blandly.

"Oh, yes!  We are delighted with Pastimes.  It exactly suits our requirements."

Mr Maplestone frowned, and fidgeted to and fro, then suddenly leant forward, straightening
his face into what was obviously intended to be a smile.

"Miss Wastneys!  Will you forgive me if I am perfectly frank and honest, and tell you exactly
what is in my mind?"

"Of course I will.  I am sure," I declared mendaciously, "there can be nothing to forgive!"

He had the grace to look a trifle ashamed, but his resolution did not waver.  Not a bit!  He
looked straight in my eyes, and said deliberately:--

"I want Pastimes!  For the moment it has slipped through my fingers, but a couple of hours
cannot seriously affect your arrangements.  On my cousin's behalf I am anxious to take over
the lease.  It would be an act of grace on your part if you would agree to this arrangement,
and deal with me as his representative!"

The audacity of it!  For a moment I was silent for sheer want of breath, but I could feel the
blood rushing into my cheeks, and knew that my eyes were sending out flashes to meet his own.
My appearance must have prepared him for my answer before it came, uttered in a very calm,
very haughty, aggravatingly deliberate tone.

"We are not in the habit of changing our plans in a couple of hours. Pastimes suits us.  It
is unnecessary to look for another house.  The matter was decided this morning."

"You understand that my cousin is an invalid, and that he has a special reason for wishing
to live in this neighbourhood?"

"There are other houses.  Pastimes is not the only one that is vacant."

"It is the only one that is suitable," he repeated doggedly, and there followed a silence during
which he sat back in his chair, staring at me with the light blue eyes, which of all eyes in
the world can look at once the coldest and the most angry.  If he could have done what he wanted
at that moment, he would have taken me by the shoulders and shaken me well.  To have made up
his mind that a thing must be, and to find himself thwarted by a bit of a girl--it was unsupportable!--so
unsupportable, that even now he refused to believe it could be true. Giving himself a little
shake, like a dog who rouses himself to fresh efforts, he again made that industrious attempt
at a smile, and began slowly:--

"I am afraid I have made a bad beginning!  Please forgive me if I have seemed discourteous.
When we have talked things over quietly, I have no doubt that we shall be able to reach a satisfactory
agreement."

"I'm afraid I can't see how that can be!  There is only one Pastimes, so one of us is bound
to be disappointed!"

He pounced on that as if scenting a hopeful weakness.

"Exactly.  Yes; but the disappointment would vary in intensity.  That is what I am anxious
to point out.  When Edwards told me that the tenant was a lady I felt reassured, for it is
a matter in which a woman's kindliness and good heart--"

My eyes roved to the screen.  Charmion's ears were assuredly open at this moment, straining
to hear my reply.  I raised my eyebrows, and said frostily:--

"We are speaking of a business arrangement.  I am afraid that is the only light in which we
can consider the matter.  We shall honourably fulfil our part of the agreement which we have
signed."

"You refuse to show any consideration for an invalid returning home-- after many years?"

"Not at all.  If it is ever in our power, as neighbours, to show him any kindness, we shall
be eager to do all that is possible--short of giving up our own house for his benefit.  Would
you do it yourself, Mr Maplestone--for the sake of a stranger you had never seen?"

He stood staring at me, his cheeks bulging with the moving lumps which show that people are
swallowing down words which they dare not allow themselves to say.  With the same air of elaborate
patience which he had shown before, he explained slowly:--

"My cousin has been stationed in India.  In a border regiment.  He has served his country for
thirty years.  Now he has had a paralytic stroke, and is making his way home by slow stages.
A man who has worked and suffered as he has done deserves a home, and the gratitude of his
fellow-countrymen."

"There are two sides to every question, Mr Maplestone.  If I chose to go into details, I might
convince you that Mrs Fane and I have our own claims, which seem to us equally strong."

He leapt from his seat, and advanced until he stood directly facing my chair.

"That finishes it!  It is no use appealing to your feelings.  Let us make it pure business
then!  I offer you a hundred pounds down for the reversion of the lease!"

So it had come to this.  Bribery undisguised!  I lowered my eyelids, and sat silent, an image
of outraged dignity.

"You refuse!  It is not enough?  Two hundred then!  Three!"

Still silence.  But my listening ears caught a threatening rustle behind the screen.

"Three hundred!  It is a good offer.  You are not bound to this neighbourhood.  You can find
other houses to suit you.  Still not enough?  Name your own terms then.  How much will you take?"

"A million pounds!"

The words leapt out of my mouth as it seemed of their own volition.  I was tired of this farcical
bargaining, and determined to put an end to it, once for all.  I stood up and faced his blank
stare of amazement, without at least any outward shrinking.

"Surely it is useless to prolong this bargaining.  It is very unpleasant and humiliating."

Mr Maplestone set his square jaw.

"You are only one partner to this transaction.  Mrs Fane is probably your senior.  If I were
to see her, she might be induced to name a more--er--shall I say reasonable (oh, the cutting
sarcasm of that tone!) figure."

"Two millions."

The high clear tone struck across the room.  Mr Maplestone wheeled round and beheld Charmion
standing just outside the opening of the screen, one hand raised to rest lightly on the curved
wood coping.  She might have posed as a picture of graceful, imperturbed ease, so calm, so
smiling, so absolutely unflurried and detached in both manner and bearing did she appear. 
Mr Maplestone looked at her and--this was a curious thing--at one glance realised his defeat.
All my efforts at dignity and firmness had failed to convince him, but behind Charmion's frail,
essentially feminine exterior, those keen eyes had at once detected that strain of inflexibility
which I was only slowly beginning to realise.

It was hopeless to bandy words.  The Squire knew as much, and turned to the table to lift his
hat and whip.  He gave a short scornful laugh.

"The terms seem a trifle--high!  I am afraid I must retire from the bidding.  Pastimes is yours.
I hope"--he looked from me to Charmion, and his expression was not pleasant to see--"I hope
you may not have cause to repent your bargain!"

We bowed.  He bowed.  The door opened and shut.  Charmion looked at me and shrugged her shoulders.

"A declaration of war!  We have begun our campaign by quarrelling with the most `influential
gentleman in these parts!'  Things are getting exciting, Evelyn!"

I did not speak.  Reaction had set in, and I felt a pang of remorse.  I did not want to quarrel
with anyone, influential or uninfluential.  I was sorry I had been ungracious.  I felt a pang
of sympathy for the poor, big, bad-tempered man riding homeward after his defeat.

I wondered when and how we should meet him again.

CHAPTER SIX.

HUNTING THE FLAT.

Leaving the workmen to carry out the necessary decorations at Pastimes, Charmion and I adjourned
to London to buy carpets and curtains, and a score of necessary oddments.  We found it a fascinating
occupation, and grew more and more complimentary to each other as each day passed by.

"Charmion, you have exquisite taste!  That's just the shade I had chosen myself."

"You have a perfect eye for colouring, Evelyn.  I always know that your choice will be exactly
my own."

Sometimes we saw the humour of these self-satisfied compliments, sometimes we were so busy
and engrossed that we accepted them open-mouthed.  I suppose in every mind personal preference
is magnified into the standard of perfection, and all the arguing in the world will fail to
convince A that he is--artistically speaking--colour-blind, or B that her drawing-room is a
bazaar of trumpery odds and ends!  All the more reason to be thankful that we agreed.  We were
convinced that our taste was unique; but supposing for one moment that it was bad, we should
at least share a comfortable delusion!

The oak entrance hall was to be ornamented with old delft.  The curtains and chair coverings
were to be of the same shade of blue.  The parquet floor was to be supplied with rugs of warm
Eastern colours.  Exactly the right shade of violet-purple had been found for the drawing-room,
and I should be ashamed to say how many shops we ransacked for the chair coverings, until at
last we found the identical pattern to satisfy our demands.  Certainly I should be ashamed
to confess what we paid for the piece.  Charmion was appallingly extravagant!  That was another
discovery which I had made in the last days.  It seemed as if she found a positive satisfaction
in paying abnormal prices, not with the purse-proud bombast of the nouveau riche, but rather
with the almost savage relief of a slave who shakes off a few links of a hated chain.  I was
a little alarmed at the total to which our purchases amounted; but I comforted myself with
the thought, nothing new would be required for a long, long time, and that, if I found my income
running short, I could always retire to my flat, and live on a figurative twopence under Bridget's
clever management.

Charmion had heard all about the flat by this time, and had hurt my feelings by treating the
whole proposal as a ridiculous joke.  She made no attempt to dissuade me--had we not agreed
never to interfere in each other's doings?--but she laughed, and said, "Dear goose," and arched
her fine brows expressively as she asked how long a lease I proposed to take, "Or, rather,
I should say, how short?"

Now I had myself inclined to a short lease with the option of staying on, but opposition stiffened
my back, and I there and then decided to go and look at several possibilities which I had hitherto
put aside as impracticable because they had to be taken for a term of three to five years.
Bridget would go with me--dear, lawless, laughter-loving Bridget, who entered into the play
with refreshing zest.  Bridget had the real characteristic Irish faculty of looking upon life
as an amusing game, and the more novel and unorthodox the game was, the better she was pleased.
"Sure it's your own face!  It's for you to do what you please with it!" was the easy comment
with which she accepted my proposed disguise.  She undertook to do most of the work of the
flat without a qualm, and shed an easy tear of emotion over the sorrows and difficulties which
it was to be my mission to reduce.  "Oh, the poor creatures!  Will they be starving around
us, Miss Evelyn, and the little children crying out for bread?"

"N-not exactly that," I explained.  "I want to work among gentlefolk, Bridget--poor gentlefolk,
who suffer most of all, because they are too proud to ask for help.  But they will probably
be short of time, and service, and probably of strength, too, and when I get to know them,
they will let me help them in these ways, though they would not accept my money--"

Bridget looked sceptical.

"I wouldn't put it past them!"

I laughed, and dropped the subject.

"Oh, well, time will show.  Meantime you understand, don't you, Bridget, that they are not
cheerful places that we are going to see?  Cheerful positions in London mean big rents, and
I mean to live among people who have to count every penny several times over, and try hard
to make it into a sixpenny bit.  You and I will have sunshine and light at Pastimes--you won't
mind putting up with dullness for part of the year?"

"What would be the good of minding?  You'd go, whether or not, now you'd got your head set!"
returned Bridget bluntly.  She added after a pause, "And besides, we'll be getting our own
way.  I'm thinking we shall be glad of the change.  It's not as much as a thought of your own
will be left to you, with Mrs Fane by your side."

"You are entirely wrong, Bridget, and it is not your place to make remarks about Mrs Fane.
Please don't let me hear you do it again."

"Yes, ma'am," murmured Bridget, turning instantly from a friend into an automaton, as was her
custom on the rare occasions when I hardened myself to find fault.  The words were submissive
enough, but her manner announced that she had said her say, and would stick to it, though Herself,
poor thing, must be humoured when she took the high horse.  As usual, I retired from the conflict
with a consciousness of coming off second best!

The next day I told Charmion that I was "engaged," and true to our delightful agreement, she
asked no questions, but quietly disappeared into space.  Then, with a ponderous feeling of
running the blockade, I put on wig and spectacles and the venerable costume which had been
provided for the occasion.  Appropriately enough, it had originally belonged to an aunt--Aunt
Eliza, to wit--who had handed it to me in its mellowed age, to be bequeathed to one of my many
protegees.  It was brown in colour--I detest brown, and it cordially detests me in return--
and by way of further offence the material was roughened and displayed a mottled check.  The
cut was that of a country tailor, the coat accentuating the curve of Aunt Eliza's back, while
the skirt showed a persistent tendency to sag at the back.  When I fastened the last button
of the horror and surveyed myself in the glass, I chuckled sardonically at the remembrance
of heroines of fiction whose exquisite grace of outline refused to be concealed by the roughest
of country garments. Certainly my grace did not survive the ordeal.  What good looks I possessed
suffered a serious eclipse even before wig and spectacles went on, and as a crowning horror,
a venerable "boat-shaped" hat (another relic of Aunt Eliza) and a draggled chenille veil.

Bridget was hysterical with enjoyment over the whole abject effect, but I descended the stairs
and passed through the great hall of the hotel with a miserable feeling of running the blockade.
Suppose I met anyone! Suppose anyone knew me!  Suppose--I flushed miserably at the thought--Charmion
herself was discovered sitting in the hall, and raised her lorgnon to quiz me as I passed by!

I need not have troubled.  Not a soul blinked an eye in my direction. If by chance a wandering
glance met mine, it stared past and through me as though I were impalpable as a ghost.  My
disguise was a success in one important respect at least--there was no longer anything conspicuous
about me; I was just a humble member of society, one of the throng of dun-coloured, ordinary-looking
females, who may be seen by the thousand in every thoroughfare in the land, but who, as a matter
of fact, are not seen at all, because no one troubles to look.  By Bridget's side I passed
through the streets of London as through a desert waste.

Half an hour's journey by tube brought us to the first of the flats on my list.  It was also
the first specimen of its kind which Irish Bridget had ever seen, and the shock was severe.
I found myself in the painful position of expecting "a decent body" to live in a kitchen two
yards square, with a coal "shed" under the table on which she was supposed to cook, and to
sleep in a cupboard, screened in merciful darkness, since, when the electric light was turned
on, the vista seen through the grimy panes was so inimitably depressing that one's only longing
was to turn it off forthwith!

"Preserve us!  Indeed, if it was to die in it we were trying, it would be easy enough, but
I'm thinking we'd make a poor show of living, Miss Evelyn!  And used to the best as we are,
too," said poor Bridget dolefully.

I sprang a good ten pounds in rent at the sound of her pitiful voice, and ran my pencil through
every address below that figure.

Ten separate flats did we visit in the course of that day, and it was a proof of what Aunt
Emmeline would call my stubbornness that I came through the ordeal without wavering.  Regardless
of Bridget's appealing eyes, I led the way forward, always affecting a buoyant hope that our
next visit would be successful, while mentally I was holding a Jekyll and Hyde argument with
my inner self, as follows:--

"Impossible to live in such warrens!"

"Other people manage to live in them all the year round!"

"But, as Bridget says, I have been used to the best."

"Quite time, then, that you take your share of the worst!"

"My health might suffer--"

"You have a good chance to recruit."

"I might lose my looks--"

"Disagreeable--but the world would go on, even if you did. Incidentally, you might improve
the looks of other women!"

"It would be awfully dull!"

"At first--yes!  Not when you get into stride.  Helping other people is the most exhilarating
of tonics."

"I have never lived in a town.  I should feel cramped, prisoned, stifled for air."

"But think how you would feel when the day came to return to Pastimes! Wouldn't that first
hour in the garden be glorious enough to repay you for all the exile?"

Bridget's wheedling voice broke in on my argument:--

"Miss Evelyn, dear, I've been thinking--wouldn't it be a duty-like, to be having a bit of sun?
Seems like we could wrestle along a bit better if we faced the right way!"

Poor dear!  Above all the drawbacks, it was the darkness of the interiors of those small flats
which most perplexed the good countrywoman: the passages lighted only through the ground glass
panels of bedroom doors; the windows shadowed by walls of other buildings, which towered up
at but a few yards' distance; the kitchens staring blankly into a "well," ornamented with the
suggestive spirals of a fire-escape.

"If we could maybe face somewhere where there was a bit of green!" pleaded the eloquent Irish
voice.  "Sure the leddies and gentlemen you are meaning to help--you'll be more likely to find
them in the place you'd choose yourself, if you were settling in earnest?"  Bridget rolled
an eye at blocks E, F, and G of a colossal pile of buildings which stretched their inky length
over the two blocks of a narrow thoroughfare.  "Cast your eye over them window curtains!" said
she scathingly.  "Ye can tell what's inside without troubling to look.  A dirty, idle set that
will sponge on you, and laugh behind your back!"

I looked, and shuddered, and was thankfully convinced.  In my efforts not to aim too high,
my standard had fallen impossibly low, and Bridget's keen common sense had been right in prophesying
that I was more likely to find a congenial type of people in a neighbourhood which appealed
to my own taste.

No sooner said than done!  I escorted Bridget to a restaurant, and fed her and myself with
lots of good hot food, and then straightway hired a taxi, and drove back to the agents to demand
addresses of flats a little further afield, which should have at least a modicum of light and air.

It appeared that I had demanded the thing above all others for which tens of thousands of other
women were already clamouring!

"Everybody wants a cheap flat in an open and airy situation.  For one that is to let we have
a hundred applicants.  Of course, if you are prepared to pay a long price--"

"But I am not."

"Quite so.  Otherwise I have some fine sites in Campden Hill.  Lift. Central heating.  Every
convenience."

"Seventy pounds is the utmost--"

"Quite so.  Then we must rule out Campden Hill, or Hampstead, or Kensington."  The agent switched
over the leaves of his book, ran his finger down a list, and hesitated, frowning.  "There is
one vacancy which might suit--a small block of flats on the borders of Hammersmith. The postal
address is Kensington.  I don't know if you are particular as to address?"

"Not a bit."

"Ah!"  The agent evidently thought small beer of me for the admission. "Most ladies are.  In
this case we can ask an extra five pounds a year because of the Kensington address, and the
class of tenants is much better than in the adjoining blocks a few hundred yards off, where
the postal address is Hammersmith."

Bridget coughed in an impressive fashion which was intended to say, "Better class!  Hark to
that now!  That's the place for us!"  As for me, I was torn between amusement at the rank snobbery
of it all, and a tender pity for the pathos that lay behind!  Poor strugglers, clinging on
to the fringe of society, squeezing out the extra pounds so badly needed for necessities, for--what?
The satisfaction of seeing a certain word written on an envelope, or of impressing a shop assistant
with its sound.  In some cases no doubt there were deeper reasons than snobbishness, and it
was thought of them which supplied the pathos. Some careworn men and women had weighed that
extra rent in the balance, and had considered that it was "worth while," since a good address
might prove an asset in the difficult fight for existence, or perchance some loved one far
away had vicariously suffered in past privations, and might be deluded into believing in a
false prosperity by the high-sounding address.  My ready imagination pictured the image of
an invalid mother contentedly informing her neighbours: "My daughter has moved to Kensington.
Yes!  Such a charming neighbourhood.  The gardens, you know.  And the royal palace!"  Five
pounds a year might be worthily expended on such a gain as this!

Well, there seemed nothing for it but to prospect Weltham Mansions at once, so we chartered
yet another taxi, and hurried off without delay to have daylight for our inspection.  We drove
for miles, through streets at first wide and handsome, then growing ever dingier and more "decayed".
Is there anything in the world more depressing than a third-rate English suburb?  I can imagine
being poor contentedly in almost every other land--in India, for instance, I know of impecunious
couples who have lived in two tents beneath two mango trees with comfort and enjoyment, but
it takes a super Mark Tapley to enjoy poverty in London!

We had left the gardens a long way behind before at long last we reached a block of dull red
buildings, the various doorways of which were decorated with different letters and numbers.
A 1 to 40--C 41 to 80--D 81 to 120--etcetera, etcetera.  The windows were flat, giving a prison-like
effect to the exterior, and I was just saying devoutly to myself, "Thank goodness, that's not--"
when the taxi stopped, and my eyes caught the fateful letters carved on a dull grey stone!

It was Weltham Mansions, and there were two flats to be let.  The porter produced the keys
and led us up, up, endless flights of stairs to a crow's nest near the roof, and then down,
down again to what was described as the "sub-basement," which, being interpreted, meant that
the level of the rooms was a few feet beneath that of the road.  Now I had always set my affections
on a basement flat, chiefly--let me confess--because the sound of it appealed to my ears as
so suitable and appropriate to my new role.  Also, to be able to walk in and out, without mounting
the stairs, minimised the risk of discovery, which was no light point under the circumstances,
but it was a distinct surprise to find that the flat itself appealed to me more than any which
I had yet seen.  Why?  Not because of the rooms themselves, for they were ordinary and prosaic
enough, but because the bank which sloped from the floor of the area to the street railings
was of grass, closely-growing, well-conditioned grass, broken here and there by tiny, sprouting
leaves of--yes! extraordinary as it seems, there could be no doubt about it, for both Bridget
and I recognised them in one lightning glance--primroses!  Some former tenant who loved the
country had planted those roots in a hopeful mood, and they had taken hold, and grown, and
multiplied.  When spring came the owner of that basement flat would have a primrose bank between
herself and the world outside those high railings.  She had also a strip of cement area in
which she could place tubs filled with soil which would provide blossom for later days. The
exposure was south, and the railings were high, so that the tiny garden would be assured of
sun and security.  The soot would fall, and the dust lie thick, but there would be colour and
life, and on the air faint wafts of perfume.

We went back to the porter's room to hear the particulars of the lease, and on my way I stopped
to read the list of names printed on little slides on a mahogany board.  There were forty in
all, and they were as illuminating as such names usually are, when suddenly, three parts down
the list, I came upon one which made my heart leap into my mouth.  I stood reading the few
words over and over, actually spelling the letters in my incredulous surprise, but there it
was; there was no doubt about it--the words plainly printed for every one to see--

"Number 32.  Mr Wenham Thorold."

Well, talk about fate!  There are some circumstances under which one realises at once that
it is useless to struggle.  This was one!  I turned to the porter with an air of resignation.

"I will take the flat.  Please prepare the necessary papers, and send them to me to sign."
Then I gave him my new name.  After due deliberation I had determined to be "Miss Mary Harding,"
as Wastneys is unusual, and might draw undesirable attention.  Miss Mary Harding, of a basement
flat!

CHAPTER SEVEN.

HOSTILITIES?

Our removal into Pastimes--like every other removal since the time when man began to live beneath
a roof--took far longer than we expected.  I went back to Ireland to gather my possessions,
and say good-bye, and Charmion stayed in London to hurry up tradesmen, and make uninteresting
purchases of pots and pans, and dusters and door scrapers, and the other needfuls which every
house must have, but which are so dull to buy.

When I joined her in the hotel, I found her in a state of haughty displeasure over the extraordinary
delay which was attending the work at Pastimes itself.  In another person this state of mind
would have found vent in "fuming," but Charmion never fumed.  She folded her hands, and drooped
her white lids, and drawled in a tone of incredulous disgust:--

"I can't understand it.  I told them to be quick.  I expressly stipulated that they were not
to potter."

"Apparently they are not even `pottering'!  They have not begun at all!" I said grimly, as
I ran my eye down the letter just received from the "man in charge".  It was the ordinary,
ultra-polite, ultra-servile production of the tradesman who has not kept his word.

"Dear Madam,--Owing to a press of other work, I regret that I have not been able to commence--"

"Commence!  Odious word.  It is adding insult to injury to use it.  And what can he mean? 
He seemed so keen about the order.  Said he was so slack that he would be able to put on all
his hands!"

"I shall write and tell him to do so at once," said Charmion magnificently, and I held my peace
and let her do it, knowing that it would be no use to object, and hoping that at least her
letter might succeed in extracting some more definite information.

It did!  This was it:--

"Madam,--I beg to inform you that Mr Maplestone having rented the house known as `Uplands,'
on behalf of General Underwood, and placed urgent orders with us for its re-decoration, we
are regretfully compelled to delay operations at Pastimes for some weeks.  We are making all
possible speed with the present contract, and beg to assure you that your work shall then be
finished with all despatch.

"We have the honour to remain, etcetera."

Charmion and I looked at one another, and looked, and looked, and looked.  We were both thinking
hard--thinking backward, thinking ahead. Exactly what we thought neither of us put into words;
we just sat silently and stared, until presently Charmion rose, marched over to her writing-table,
and scribbled a few words on a telegram form.  Then she held it out for me to read:--

"Order for decorations at Pastimes cancelled herewith."

"Do you approve?"

"Er--oh, yes, of course--I suppose so.  But how shall we--"

"That's easily arranged.  Any town firm will be glad of the order.  It will be more expensive,
but will probably be better done.  In any case we have no choice."

"It's such a tiny village.  Where could the men sleep?"

"I haven't the slightest idea.  That is their business, not mine.  We shan't have any difficulty
about that," Charmion declared, and she was right, for the West End firm who received our instructions
waved aside the question with smiling assurance.  They were accustomed to sending workmen all
over the country.  To the loneliest places.  All could be easily arranged.  We were left with
the impression that if it had been our pleasure to pitch our tent in the Sahara, the frock-coated
manager would have executed our wishes with equal ease.  So far, so good; but as we left the
shop Charmion turned to me, and said darkly:--

"I think, under the circumstances, it might be wise to change our minds about employing country
maids, and to engage London ones instead."

"You are afraid--"

"I am afraid of nothing, but I think it probable that the local girls who wrote to us about
situations may now be `urgently' bespoken for service at Uplands."

"Well, he will need servants," I said feebly, and fell to thinking of Uplands itself, and of
how unfortunate it seemed that General Underwood should be settling so near ourselves.  We
had noticed the house, indeed, we could not fail to do so, as it lay a quarter of a mile along
the high road from Pastimes, on the direct route from Escott, which was Mr Maplestone's village.
It was a handsome-looking house, but painfully prosaic, built of grey stone, unsoftened by
creepers, and showing a row of windows flat and narrow, and extraordinarily high.  One could
just imagine the rooms, like so many boxes, and the hall flag-tiled, and the house full of
draughts, for the windows of the principal living-rooms faced perversely towards the north.
I hoped the poor General would instal a heating system and a generous supply of rugs; but what
chiefly concerned me at the moment was the thought that every time--every single time--that
cross, red-headed man came over to visit his relative, he must pass our door!

My imagination immediately conjured up half a dozen irritating encounters.  Evelyn returning
home on a wet day, bedraggled, not at her best, toiling along the wet lane, and being splashed
with mud by the wheels of a giant car, from the cushioned seat of which the Squire and his
wife regarded her with lofty disdain.  There was a Mrs Maplestone, and I had drawn a mental
picture of her, which I felt sure was true to life.  Small, meek, rather pretty, with big brown
eyes which held a chronic expression of being rather frightened by what had just gone before,
and exceedingly anxious as to what should come next.  She would probably wear handsome furs,
and a hat three seasons old.

Encounter number two represented Evelyn in her best hat and coat, feeling rather spry and pleased
with herself, until presently, clinketty clank, round the bend of the road came the quick,
staccato beat of horses' hoofs.  Mr and Mrs Maplestone cantering past in hunting kit, which
at one glimpse killed complacency and substituted disgust for the poor fripperies of town.

Encounter number three was most obnoxious of all.  It represented Evelyn solus encountering
Mr Maplestone solus and on foot.  Approaching him on the unsheltered road, torn by the problem,
"Will he bow?  Shall I bow?  Will he pretend?  Shall I pretend?" moving nearer and nearer,
and in a final moment of discomfort meeting the stare of blank, angry eyes.  Poor man!  It
must be exhausting to have such a violent temper. I wondered what he looked like when by chance
he was happy and pleased!

The West End firm got through their work in record time, and at the end of three weeks Charmion
and I took possession, and set to work at the task of putting our house in order.  Every woman
delights in this work in prospect; in reality, every one comes full tilt against a score of
irritating, aggravating contretemps which baulk her carefully-laid schemes.

Our contretemps appeared in a very usual form.  The cook and gardener, who had been definitely
engaged to meet us on our arrival, and whom we had, therefore, not replaced in town, sent missives
instead, to "hope they didn't inconvenience, but they had changed their minds".  The two town
servants who had arrived were immediately plunged into woe, and, looking into their set, dour
faces, one could hear the inward thought, "Don't believe anyone ever was engaged!  Just one
of their tricks to get us down here to do the work alone."  We left them sitting like monuments
of woe in the kitchen, and shut ourselves up in the drawing-room to consult.

"Uplands, I conclude," said Charmion coldly.

"Oh, no!  I don't believe it.  He wouldn't condescend to that!"

"Why not?  He stopped the work in the house."

"That was different!  After all, he is the Squire, and when it was a case of inconveniencing
him, or a stranger--a local tradesman could hardly be expected to put us first.  At least,
you can understand his position."

"Does the same argument apply to local domestics?"

"It might do; but I don't believe it was used.  To give a tradesman an order for now or never,
and to--to stoop to bribe a servant to break an engagement--surely they are two different things!
I do not believe Mr Maplestone would do it!"

"Well!--we shall see.  In the meantime, what about dinner?"

I went back to the kitchen and talked to the Londoners, smiling radiantly the while.  I said
it was upsetting, but we must expect upsets.  No one ever settled into a new house without
one.  I said there would be no difficulty in getting another cook--we would telegraph for one
to-morrow; in the meantime we would just picnic, and do the best we could.  I looked from one
sulky face to another, and asked confidently:--

"Now, which of you is the better cook?"

The parlour-maid said she was a parlour-maid.  She had never been asked to cook.  She could
make tea.

I said, "Thank you!" and turned to the housemaid.

The housemaid said she was a housemaid, and didn't understand stoves. She had always lived
where kitchen-maids were kept.

I said calmly, "Oh, well, it's fortunate that I am a woman, and can cook for the lot of you
until help comes.  Perhaps you will kindly bring tea into the hall, and then get your own as
quickly as possible.  I shall require the kitchen by six o'clock."

They were horribly discomposed, and I left them murmuring vaguely in protest, very pleased
with myself and my fine womanly attitude, though at the bottom of my heart I knew quite well
that Bridget would come to the rescue, and never a saucepan should I be allowed to touch.

As a matter of fact the good soul descended on the slackers like a whirlwind, and the while
she drove them before her, treated them to an eloquent lecture upon the future sufferings,
privations, rebellions, and retaliations of the prospective husbands of females who had grown
to woman's estate, and yet could not cook a meal.  Through the green baize door I could hear
the continuous torrent of invective, broken at first by protest, later on by soft exclamations
of surprise, and finally--oh, the relief of that moment!--by an uncontrollable explosion of
laughter. The Cockney mind is keenly alive to humour, and when a racy Irishwoman gets fairly
started on a favourite subject, the delicious contradictions of her denunciations are hard
to beat!  That laughter saved the situation, and the domestic wheels began to move.

Charmion wrote to an emergency lady in town.  I didn't see the letter, but I diagnosed its
tone.  Peremptory and--lavish!  Wages no object, but speed essential, or words to that effect.
Anyway, in two days' time a married couple arrived, were pleased to approve of us, and settled
down with the air of coming to stay.  She was an excellent cook, and he seemed a rather indifferent
gardener, which just suited our views.  If gardeners are experts they want their own way, insist
on bedding-out, carpet-beds, and similar atrocities.  We meant to run our garden on different
lines!

Hurrah!  I am so relieved.  The truants have not gone to Uplands.  I met the cook in the village
to-day, recognised her, and tackled her to her face.  She flushed and wriggled, looked uncomfortable,
but not as penitent as I should have liked to have seen.

"Was it necessary to wait until we had actually arrived, before letting us know that you had
changed your mind?"

She stood on one foot, and drew circles on the road with the other.

"Didn't decide myself till just the last minute."

"You hadn't taken another place then?  I understood from your note--"

"I'm staying on with my mother.  I may go to a lady at Guildford."

Silence.  One department of my brain felt an immense relief, the other an immense exasperation.

"Then you were free all the time!  Doesn't it strike you as wrong and dishonourable to show
such a want of concern for other people's convenience?"

She muttered.  I caught the sound of a few words--"I'm not the Only One!" and put on my most
dignified air.

"However, it is all for the best.  You certainly would not have suited us.  I hope for your
own sake you will learn to keep your word."

I walked on, nose in the air, aggressively complacent in appearance, but those words rankled!

"Not the only one!"  Now what did she mean by that?  Obviously the insinuation was meant to
go home, but how and where had we been to blame?  Not in our treatment of the woman herself.
We had offered good wages, and to pay for the time she had been kept waiting; yet something
had happened which had made her willing to lose money and time, and that something was not
another place!  I felt puzzled, and, at the bottom of my heart, worried about it all!

Later on I paid my first visit to the little draper's shop, and ran the fire of a universal
scrutiny from the staff.  The "young ladies" knew who I was, and were devoured by curiosity,
but it was not a friendly curiosity!  Instead of the eager smiles which usually greet a new
customer, there was a pursed-up gravity, a stolid attention to business, which was decidedly
blighting.  At home in Ireland every tradesman was more or less a friend, and what they did
not know of Kathie's affairs and mine was not worth hearing.

"Pastimes, I believe!" said the sales-woman with the pasty face, when I directed the parcel
to be sent home.  Was it fancy which read a note of reproach in her intonation?

Coming home, I met General Underwood in a bath-chair, being pushed along by a man in livery.
He has white hair and a yellow face.  He looks tired and ill, and lonely and sad.  I'm sure
he hates the bath-chair, and fights horribly with his doctor, who insists on fresh air.  He
rolled his tired eyes at me as I passed, and said something in a low voice to his attendant.
I was misguided enough to turn my head, and behold! the Bath-chair was tilted round so that
he might look after me.  The man knew me by sight, and was laying bare the whole horrible truth.

"That's her, sir!  The lady from Pastimes!"  I felt ruffled, and went straight into my "sulky,"
where I stayed till lunch-time.  We had a delicious souffle, and Charmion asked no questions,
and went out of the way to be particularly sweet.  I felt better every moment, and by the time
coffee arrived had quite recovered my spirits.

If the General had lived in Pastimes, he would have had to use the bath-chair just the same,
and his hair would have been quite as white! Pastimes could not have made him young!  Charmion
is right.  I wear my heart on my sleeve.  I must learn to be more callous and matter-of-fact!

CHAPTER EIGHT.

THE VICARAGE CALLS.

On Sunday we went to the Parish Church.  At breakfast, Charmion seemed silent and depressed;
but, true to our agreement, I asked no questions, and she volunteered no explanation.  She
said she was not going to church, but later on she changed her mind.  I think she saw that
I was disappointed, and a trifle shy at going alone, so off we went together-- Charmion a marvel
of unobtrusive elegance in grey, and I "taking the eye" in sapphire-blue--along the breezy
lane, past the closed gates of Uplands, through the shuttered High Street into the tiny square,
in a corner of which the church was nooked, with the vicarage garden adjoining the churchyard.

The congregation was assembling from different parts, and everybody who passed stared at us,
the men stolidly enough, the women with a curiosity which, to my mind at least, had something
antagonistic in its nature. Their pursed lips, their sidelong glances, reminded me of the assistants
in the draper's shop; of the cook who muttered that she was not "the only one".  I looked at
Charmion to see if she felt the atmosphere, but her eyes held the blank, far-off expression
which marked her dark hours. She had no attention to spare for village worthies: nothing that
they could do or think was of sufficient importance to arouse her attention. Inside, the church
was bare and uninteresting, and the musical service poor, but the Vicar himself attracted me
greatly.  A plain-looking man nearing forty, but with a most expressive and eloquent voice.
He read the service exquisitely--so exquisitely, that words which one knew by heart seemed
suddenly filled with new meaning.  When the time came for the sermon I expected great things.
It seemed to me that the man who could so wonderfully interpret the words of others, must be
endued with the gift of eloquence for himself.  I even braced myself for a mental effort, in
case his argument should soar above my head.  And then--a child could have followed him!  It
was absolutely the simplest, plainest, and most intimate address which I had ever heard from
a church pulpit.  Incidentally, it was also the shortest!

It was ten minutes to twelve o'clock when he folded his arms on top of the open Bible, and
leant forward for a long, silent moment, looking earnestly from side to side into the upturned
faces of his hearers. Then he began to talk--to talk, not to preach, speaking every word with
an inflection of the truest sincerity.  The text was "Forgetting the things that are behind,
I press towards the mark," and the "talk" ran pretty much like this:--

"How has this week gone with you, Brothers and Sisters?  To some it has brought success, to
others failure.  Bad weather, bad temper, lost control, a host of tiny troubles have sprung
upon us unprepared; have worked their will, and left us discouraged and weak.  Thank God for
beginnings!  New years, new months, new weeks--after every twenty-four hours, a new day, with
the sun rising over a new world!  Last week is dead.  All the grieving in the world cannot
revive it into life.  Bury it!  Remember only the lessons it has taught.  Forget the things
that lie behind.  Press forward!  This week is alive.  This week brings opportunity.  Live!
Work!  Pray!  With God's grace make it the best, the truest, the kindliest week you have ever
lived."

The clock struck twelve, and the sermon was over.  A bare ten minutes, but if he had preached
for an hour on end he could not have added to its effect.  The congregation listened in tense
silence, as though afraid of losing a word.  One felt the electric thrill of hope and courage
and high resolve which, flooded their hearts; felt it oneself; went out from the church braced
in heart and soul.

I want to know more of that man.  He could help one along.

I have got my wish.  He called with his wife this afternoon--the first callers since we arrived.
They were shown into the drawing-room, where Charmion and I were lolling over our tea.  There
was fruit on the table, besides a selection of cakes from town, and as we had been gardening
in the earlier part of the afternoon, and got thoroughly grubby and untidy, we had changed
into the tea-gowns which we wear in the evening when we are too lazy to put on more elaborate
clothes.  They are very nice tea-gowns, and, though I say so who shouldn't, we look exceedingly
nice in them, but to the eye of a hard-working country clergyman the whole interior may have
looked too luxurious to be approved!  His face looked very grave as he shook hands.

Mrs Merrivale is a surprise.  The Vicar figures on the church board as the Reverend John C.
Merrivale, but she has her cards printed, "Mrs J. Courtney Merrivale," and she calls him "Jacky"
in public.  She is very young--twenty-two or three at the most--and has a very long neck and
a pretty little face, with huge pale-blue eyes, and a minute mouth with coral-pink lips.  She
is dressed in cheap clothes made in the latest fashion, and she asks questions all the time,
and doesn't wait for an answer.  When you tell her a definite fact, such as that you have been
planting tulips in the garden, she says, "Not really!" or as a change, "Fancy!" or "Just think!"
He adores her.  Every time he meets her eyes, his grave, strong face softens and glows in a
way which makes one feel inclined to cry.  Lonely women feel so very lonely at such moments
as these!  She contradicts him over the most futile things, and says, "No, Jacky, it was three
o'clock, not four; I was just getting up from my rest," and he smiles, and doesn't mind a bit.

They had tea, but refused fruit, with an air of being rather outraged by the offer.  Mrs Merrivale
surreptitiously studied the details of Charmion's tea-gown, and the Vicar and I laboured assiduously
at conversation.  I had liked him so much on Sunday, and had hoped he would be a real friend;
but--things didn't go!  I had a miserable feeling that he had paid the call as a matter of
duty, that he disapproved of us, that he dreaded our influence on his precious little goose
of a wife. There was certainly a restraint in his manner.  Everybody seemed restrained in this
funny little place.  I wonder if it was something in the air!

Having made mental notes concerning the tea-gown, Mrs Merrivale next turned her attention to
the room, and stared around with frank curiosity and a barely concealed envy.

"Your room looks so pretty.  Jacky, that's exactly the material I wanted for our curtains.
You have beautiful china.  I'm collecting, too; but"--she gave an expressive shrug.  "Of course,
this room lends itself; it is so big, and get's all the sun.  You remember, Jacky"--she looked
at her husband with widened eyes--"Mr Maplestone called it a `Sun Trap'."

It seemed an innocent enough remark, but the Vicar's grave assent implied a deeper meaning.
Mrs Merrivale sighed, and elaborately lengthened her chin.

"Uplands is so bleak.  General Underwood feels the cold so much.  All the windows of the entertaining
rooms seem to look the wrong way."

"He should have some more put in, facing the sun," Charmion suggested in her regal way, and
Mrs Merrivale looked as much aghast as if she had suggested pulling down the whole house and
building it afresh.  I burst hastily into the conversation.

"I think I met General Underwood the other day.  In a bath-chair.  I was glad that he was well
enough to get out.  I hope he will soon be quite well."

The Vicar said gravely:--

"He will never be well.  The most that can be hoped is that he will not grow worse rapidly.
He is a fine man, and has done good service.  We are proud to have him back amongst us, but
I am afraid, for his own sake, it has been a bad move.  He ought to have settled in a kindlier
climate."

"Yes, but--" Mrs Merrivale began impulsively, and pulled herself up, and bit her red lip. 
"Jacky," she said hurriedly, "I'm afraid we must go."

They went, and I felt a worm.  It was plain to me now that the parish in general, from the
Vicar downward, had absorbed the idea that the strange ladies at Pastimes had played a mean
trick on their local hero, and were not inclined to smile upon the ladies in consequence. 
The Vicar had probably heard the Squire's prejudiced story direct, and from the Manor House
and the Vicarage reports had percolated, as such reports will percolate, to the draper's assistants,
and the man in the street, down and down to the truant cook herself.

Now the feudal feeling still lingers in English villages, and no self-respecting tenant chooses
to range herself against the Squire.  The cook's mother, no doubt, lived in a cottage owned
by the Squire, and enjoyed perquisites of various sorts which she had no disposition to throw
away.  Beside the kitchen fire there had, no doubt, been a lengthy conference over that rumour,
and the mother had said, "Don't you do it, Mary Jane.  If the ladies are across with the Squire,
how'll he take it if he hears my daughter's in their service?  And half a dozen people with
their eyes on this cottage as it is.  A nice thing it would be for me if I got notice to quit!"
The gardener's mother had probably presented the same argument to him, and the good people
who had eyed us askance on Sunday morning were probably reflecting to themselves, "They look
all right, but you never know!  There was evidently something very unpleasant about that lease.
Poor General Underwood, too.  Well, we won't be in a hurry to call.  We will just wait and see!"

I felt horribly depressed, and somehow Charmion's utter indifference made me feel worse.  I
do love to be liked; it would poison me to live in an atmosphere of prejudice and suspicion,
but she doesn't appear to care.  I have a curious conviction that to be socially ostracised
would be just what she would prefer.  Books, the garden, my companionship-- these would supply
her need.  New claims would be rather a bore.

I am not made like that.  I need more.  I feel horribly depressed.

Charmion saw it, and spoke out before we went to bed.

"You are worrying, Evelyn.  That disagreeable autocrat has succeeded in prejudicing our neighbours
against us, and it hurts you.  Well, nothing is irrevocable.  Say the word, and we will leave
the house to-morrow, and put up a bill--to let!"

I jumped nearly out of my skin, with horror and amazement.

"Never!  Not for the world.  My pride wouldn't let me even if I wanted to do it, and I don't--I
don't!  I love the house and the life with you even more than I expected, it's only that I'm
sorry about.  I do like to live at peace with all men.  Doesn't it worry you, Charmion, to
feel yourself unjustly accused?"

"It would have done once.  At your age.  Since then"--her eyes took the blank, far-away look
which always attended even the faintest allusion to the past--"since then I have lost the power
of caring.  When one has borne the one big hurt, the gnats have no power to sting."

I looked up eagerly, but she rose from her seat, pressing one hand gently over my eyes.

"No!  Don't ask me!  You have been very sweet, very forbearing.  One great reason why my heart
went out to you, Evelyn, was that you never questioned, never tried to probe.  Go on being
patient!  Some day you shall know.  I should like to tell you now, but I can't, I can't!  You
must wait.  Some day the impulse will come, then it may be a relief. Till then, Evelyn, you
must wait!"

CHAPTER NINE.

AN ENCOUNTER IN FORCE.

It is three months since we came to Pastimes, and until last week the days have slipped by
happily and peacefully enough, but without any happenings worthy of record.  We returned the
Vicar's call, and were asked to tea to meet ourselves, when Mrs Merrivale took the opportunity
to ask me the address of my dressmaker!  Two staid dames, who lived in small villa residences,
left cards at the door, an attention which we duly returned in kind.  The important people
in the neighbourhood have left us severely alone, whirling past our gates to pay assiduous
calls on General Underwood.  He is the local hero, and we are the hard-hearted strangers who
did Something--nobody knows precisely what--but Something mean, and underhand, and altogether
unwomanly about a lease, and so forced the poor dear General to endure draughts and cold rooms,
and seriously retarded his progress towards health!  It's no use pretending that I am not sorry
about it, for I am; but all the same, they have been happy months.  Charmion has seemed so
much brighter and more contented, and that itself means much to me, and we have been as happy
as bees in our beloved garden, bullying our one man into preparing what he considers absolutely
mad effects, and working with him to keep him up to the mark.  We have flagged one path, and
turfed over another, raised some beds, and sunk others, and contrived a really glorious hot-weather
arbour, a good six yards in diameter, and open on three sides, to secure plenty of fresh air
and an absence of flies.

Charmion has hardly gone out of the gate, except to church on Sundays, but I take a constitutional
every day, and scour the country-side.

My first encounter with the Squire came off about the third week we were here, and my imaginings
were wrong in all but two unimportant points. Mrs Maplestone wears voluminous sables and clothes
of antique cut; but they look quite charming and appropriate, for--she is antique herself!

She is the Squire's mother, not his wife.  He hasn't got a wife; never has had one, and never
will.  Hates all women and their ways.  Avoids feminine society, and has never been known to
pay a girl five minutes' attention in his life!  Such is the village verdict as repeated to
me through Bridget, who has a flair for gossip, and is one of those wonderful people who cannot
walk half a mile along a solitary country lane, without hearing, or seeing, or mentally absorbing
some interesting item about the lives of her fellow-creatures!

Every night when she brushes my hair she recounts these items to me, and I pretend to be uninterested,
and listen with all my ears.

In any case, Mr Maplestone seems very kind and attentive to his mother. I met them (as fancy
painted!) when I was coming home from a trudge along the damp lanes, and was looking considerably
blown and dishevelled.  They were getting out of their car just outside the gates of Uplands--a
most malapropos position!--but without the least hesitation he lifted his hat, and bowed, so
that I was spared the troubled uncertainty which I had imagined.

I can't say he looked amiable, but at least he was polite, and I was so relieved that I bowed
back with quite a broad smile.  Mrs Maplestone looked at me more in sorrow than in anger. 
I suppose she was thinking, "So young and so unkind!"  An hour later, from an upstairs window,
I saw the car whizzing homewards along the road.  It did not stop at our gate. I rather wished
it would.

After that we were constantly meeting.  There seemed a fate in it.  If I darted into the post
office to buy a penny stamp, he was there buying tobacco.  (You do buy tobacco in village post
offices!)  If I cut across fields and sat on a stile to rest, he came whistling from the opposite
direction, and I had to get up to let him pass.  If in leaving the house I turned to the right,
I met him advancing to the left.  If I turned to the left, behold he was striding manfully
to the right!  Each meeting was the result of absolute chance, but Mistress Chance can play
curious pranks at times, and it really seemed as though she was taking a mischievous delight
in bringing about these unwished-for encounters.  We always bow ceremoniously to each other;
he always frowns, and I always smile.  Theoretically I am annoyed and indignant; but at the
critical moment the comical side of the situation sweeps over me, and out flashes the smile
before I can force it back.  It is so absurd to see a big grown man sulking like a child! 
Quite a good thing he does not intend to marry.  His wife would have a nerve-racking time.

Well, as I said before, three months have passed by.  Spring has turned into summer, and every
day the garden brings fresh, delightful surprises.  Uninteresting green sprouts burst into
unexpected bloom; the rock garden is a blaze of purple and gold; blackened stems of creepers
have disappeared beneath festoons of leaves and flowers.

Charmion and I wear muslin dresses, and eat our meals in the arbour, and lie in hammocks in
the little orchard, and rejoice in every moment of the long sunshiny days.  Down at the bottom
of our hearts, I think we both have a feeling that this is just a little rest by the way. 
It won't last; we don't even wish it to last.  Life is too strenuous to pass in a summer garden;
but we needed a rest and it is very, very good for a change.  We pack boxes of flowers and
send them to the hospitals, and every Saturday afternoon we invite parties of working girls
from the nearest towns.  They arrive in weird garments, very loud as to colour, and befeathered
as to hats, and the village worthies look askance at them, shrug their shoulders, and think
small beer of us for entertaining such odd guests.

For three months our lives have been indeed the "annals of a quiet neighbourhood," and then
suddenly, last week, something happened!

I said suddenly--I might have said instantaneously, without any exaggeration.  The position
was this.  Scene, a sloping roadway just outside the village area.  The stage set with the
three principal figures.  Enter from left wing, General Underwood, reclining in his bath-chair,
being taken for a short ride by his affectionate kinsman, Robert Maplestone.  Enter from right
wing, Evelyn Wastneys, bearing for home.  So far, so good.  A similar encounter has happened
many times before, but this time the sight of my white-robed figure seemed to upset the Squire's
equanimity.  He stopped the chair, and turned his head over his shoulder, looking backward
over the road along which he had come. It afterwards transpired that the General's valet had
been left behind to finish some small duty, and was momentarily expected to follow.  At that
moment he did appear, and involuntarily Mr Maplestone lifted his hands to wave an imperious
summons.

I have said that the road is sloping; just at this point it is very sloping indeed, therefore
the bath-chair darted forward, and spun downward with incredible speed.  I have a kaleidoscopic
picture in my brain which seems to consist of a lot of waving arms--the poor General's arms
waving for help, the Squire's arms sawing the air as he raced in pursuit, further back in the
road the valet's arms thrown to the sky in an agony of dismay, while down towards me, ever
faster and faster, spun that runaway chair.

I had to stop it somehow!  There was no one else to do it, so it was "up to me" to do my best.
There was no time to be nervous, no time even to think.  I stood braced in the middle of the
road, and caught at the steering handle as it flashed by.  My weight was light, and the General
was heavy.  I expected to have to hold hard, but what really happened was startling and unexpected,
for the steering handle whirled straight round, struck me a severe blow on the arm, and--toppled
me right over on to the foot of the chair!  I sat down heavily on the General's feet, and the
front wheel tore whirling streamers from the bottom of my skirt. The chair swayed, jerked,
slackened its speed; two strong hands stretched out and checked it still further; a second
pair of hands gripped hold, and brought it to a stand.

Now came the moment when I ought to have been acclaimed, and overwhelmed with grateful acknowledgments
as an heroic rescuer, who had risked her own life to save a feeble and suffering old man; but
not at all!  Quite the contrary!  No sooner was his flight safely stopped than the General
turned and roared at me with furious voice:--

"You sat on my feet!  You are sitting on my feet!--I, with the gout! Get up!  Get up!"

Then he turned to Mr Maplestone, and roared at him:--

"What on earth did you mean by letting go?"

Then Mr Maplestone turned to the valet, and roared at him:--

"Why the dickens couldn't you come, instead of hanging about all day?"

Then they all turned on me, and chorused, "Get up!  Get up!" and I tried to get up, and the
caught streamers of my dress held me fast, and I sat down heavily again--plop, right on top
of the poor gouty feet. The General roared more loudly than before, the two other men called
out, "Oh, oh!" and I felt as if I should go into hysterics myself.  It was a most lacerating scene.

Mr Maplestone took out his penknife and hacked at the ends of my skirt; the valet, who was
the only calm and sensible one of the party, lifted me up, and supported me in his arms till
I was set free.  Then he let go suddenly, and I was so weak and giddy that I nearly fell down
a third time.  The General closed his eyes and emitted heart-rending groans, and the valet
nipped hold of the handle of the chair and made for home as fast as he could go.  I stood in
the midst of my rags and tatters, and Mr Maplestone stood by my side.

"I hope you are not hurt."

"Oh, not at all!"  I said bitterly.  I was aching from head to foot.  To judge from my sensations,
my right arm was paralysed for life.  In some mysterious way a wheel seemed to have passed
over my feet, and my toes burned like fire.  Perhaps they were broken--I could not tell.  I
had likewise several scrapes and a whole army of bruises, and the skirt of one of my nicest
afternoon frocks was torn into ribbons.  And not one word of thanks or appreciation.  No wonder
I was riled.  "Oh, not at all.  I like it!  I am only sorry that I have contrived to hurt General
Underwood.  Perhaps you will kindly convey my apologies."

He looked at me critically.  Aches don't show on the surface, and I expect I looked rather
red than pale.  The only visible signs of damage were the ends of muslin and lace which strewed
the road.  He looked at them and said solemnly:--

"Your dress is spoiled!  I'm afraid it was partly my fault.  I had to get you free, and it
was not a moment for deliberation.  I'm sorry!"

He really sounded sorry, and that smoothed me down.  I murmured that it didn't matter--only
a muslin dress--not his fault, while he went on staring fixedly.  Then at last he spoke, and
what he said gave me an electric shock of surprise.

"It's a good thing," he said, "it wasn't the one with the frills!"

The one with the frills!  For a moment my mind was a whirling void; I was too stupefied to
think.  Then gradually it dawned upon me that he must be alluding to a dress the skirt of which
was composed entirely of tiers of flounces.  It was a new and favourite possession, and I also
was glad that it was spared.  But--why should Mr Maplestone--

I gaped at him, and said:--

"Why?"

And he said lucidly:--

"Well, there would have been more to catch, wouldn't there?  Besides--" He flushed, and lapsed
into silence.  Evidently it was inadvisable to continue the subject.

I gathered together my jagged ends, and turned to walk homeward, rather wondering what was
going to happen when I began to move.  I found I could walk, however, which proved that no
bones were broken; but it was a halting performance, and hurt more than I chose to show.  If
I limped too much, in common politeness Mr Maplestone would be obliged to offer help.  I had
a vision of Charmion's face if she looked out of the window and beheld us walking arm in arm
up the drive!

"Why do you smile?" cried the voice by my side.  There was positive offence in the tone, and,
as I looked my amazement, he continued accusingly, "You always smile.  Every time we meet.
It must be an annoyance to stumble against me wherever you go.  Yet you smile!  And to-day
you are hurt, and you still smile!"

"I smile at my thoughts," I said grandiloquently.  "And you are wrong, Mr Maplestone.  It doesn't
annoy me at all.  Why should it?  You are as free to walk about as I am.  I have no right to
complain.  And my conscience is clear!  I have done nothing of which I have reason to be ashamed."

"You mean," he cried, "you mean that?--"

Then his voice broke off sharply, and his forehead wrinkled in dismay. "What's that?  That
mark on your arm.  Blood?"

He pointed.  I looked, and sure enough a dull red patch was spreading over the muslin sleeve
of my dress.  The blow had evidently cut the skin, and this was the result.  I felt dreadfully
sorry for myself, and rather faint, and altogether considerably worse than I had done before,
as a result of beholding these visible signs of injury.  So, I was content to see, did Mr Maplestone
himself.  He really looked horribly worried and distressed, and kept glancing at me with anxious
eyes, as if every moment he expected me to collapse.

But he never offered his arm!  He came with me as far as the gate, and then held out his hand
in farewell.  It would have been churlish to refuse, so I put my own hand in his just for a moment.

"Don't shake it, please," I said.  "It hurts."  And then, because it did seem such an odd thing
to say, I smiled again, a feeble watery smile.

He dropped my hand like a hot coal, and fled.

I limped into the house and told Charmion all about it, and cried quarts.  I was mottled all
over, black and blue.

CHAPTER TEN.

MRS MERRIVALE CONFESSES.

Next morning a groom came over with kind inquiries from the Hall.  Mr and Mrs Maplestone were
anxious to hear if Miss Wastneys had recovered from the shock of yesterday.  Miss Wastneys
returned thanks for kind inquiries.  She was suffering a good deal of pain, but her injuries
were not serious.

Recovered, indeed!  When I was a mass of bruises and aches, to say nothing of jumpy nerves.
I was not inclined to make light of my injuries to Mr Robert Maplestone.

Later on the General's valet made his appearance.

"General Underwood was anxious to hear how Miss Wastneys was this morning.  He was distressed
to hear that she had been hurt."

That was more tactful!  Moreover, on receiving the bulletin, the man informed our maid that
the old gentleman was rarely upset because he had been rude to the young lady.  As soon as
he was able he was coming in person to apologise.

Charmion listened quietly to the repetition of this announcement.  When the maid left the room,
she turned to me as I lay on the sofa, being very sorry for myself, and lifted inquiring brows.

"Well, Evelyn.  You know what this means?"

I did, or thought I did, but prevaricated, feeling self-conscious.

"What?"

"You have cut the knot with your heroic rescue!  The Squire will call; the General will call;
the neighbouring sheep will follow in their train.  We shall be graciously `forgiven' and admitted
into the fold. Our quiet, sent-to-Coventry existence is at an end."

I looked at her anxiously.  From voice and manner it was impossible to tell what she was really
feeling.  Above all things I wanted to please her.  But still--

"Are you sorry, Charmion?  Would you be sorry?  I suppose they will come, but there is no necessity
to receive them, if you would rather not.  After ignoring us so long, they could not complain.
I will leave it to you to decide."

"Then they shall come," she said firmly.  "You've been a brick about it, dear, but I'm not
blind.  I know that it has been a trial for you to be cut off from general society.  You are
a sociable creature, and need friends around you.  We have had a happy tete-a-tete, and I've
enjoyed it thoroughly, but it couldn't go on.  I should not have allowed it to go on.  I am
a selfish woman in many ways, but not selfish enough to make a hermit of you at twenty-six.
So!--let them all come.  In any case, we shall probably be making a move before very long,
so we can't be drawn very deeply into the rustic maelstrom!"

"We shall be making a move."

The words gave me a jar.  My "Kensington" flat is now in order, and ready to receive my furniture
whenever I care to send it in.  I am still in love with the Pixie scheme; but, while summer
lasts, and the garden grows more beautiful every day, I want to stay here!  In my own mind
I had settled down till September at least.  I had believed that Charmion was as happy as myself,
but now the old restlessness sounded in her voice.  I looked at her, and saw her eyes staring
wearily into space. Oh dear, oh dear, the narcotic of the new life is already losing its power;
the grim spectre of the past is casting its shadow between us!

They have called!  This afternoon, when we were having tea in the garden, General Underwood's
bath-chair appeared suddenly on the scene. First came a crunching of gravel, and when we turned
our heads to discover the cause, the front wheel was already turning the corner of the path,
and the next moment there was the General smiling benevolently upon us, the valet pushing the
handle, and walking by his side the Squire himself, very red in the face and puckered about
the brow, exactly like a naughty boy who is being dragged forward to say he is "sorry."

Fortunately there was no time to consider the situation.  We shook hands, and found a chair
for Mr Maplestone, and ordered more tea, and discussed the weather in its various branches,
all with the utmost propriety, until gradually the ice thawed.  Charmion is a gracious hostess,
and the General is as genial and simple in manner as most men who have spent their lives "east
of the Suez".  After five minutes in his society one understands why he is the idol of the
neighbourhood.  He looks ill, poor dear, but his blue eyes are still clear and alert, and he
twinkles them at you in such a shrewd, kindly fashion.

Not a word did he say about the accident until tea was half over and I handed him some cake,
when he looked full at me, and asked slyly:--

"How is the poor arm?"

"Progressing beautifully, thank you.  And--the poor feet?"

"Ah," he said eloquently, "that was a moment!  I am ashamed of my ingratitude; but, my dear
young lady, if you could have felt--"

"I know," I said humbly.  "Eight stone six.  But I had no choice; and at the worst, it was
not so bad as being spilt into the road."

"Indeed, yes.  I am under the impression that I owe you a great deal. It is difficult to express--"

"Please don't!"  I said hastily.  "I could hardly have done less, but I could very easily have
done it in a less clumsy way; and--it's so embarrassing to be thanked!  Let us talk of something
else.  Would you care to see our garden?  We have worked very hard at it all spring, and are
so proud of our effects.  We love showing people round!"

Then I suddenly remembered and blushed, and glanced guiltily at the Squire, to discover that
he was doing exactly the same at me, and we all three got up in a hurry, and disputed who should
push the bath-chair. The Squire did it, of course, and Charmion and I walked one on each side
and played show-women, and the dear old man admired everything he saw, and asked for seeds
in the autumn, and offered us seeds in return, and did everything nice and polite that nice
polite people do do on garden visits.

As for the Squire, he kept on saying nothing.

Our tour ended at the gate, and when we said our final good-byes, General Underwood explained
he was not up to calling, as he was often unable to go out, but that at any time, if we could
spare half an hour to visit him, it would be doing a kindness to a lonely old man.  "And will
you allow me to wish you much happiness and prosperity in your beautiful home?"

Charmion thanked him with serene unconsciousness, and the Squire and I stared elaborately into
space, so elaborately that on parting we made two separate dives before we succeeded in finding
each other's hands. Then the valet came forward, and the little procession turned out of the gate.

"Charmion," I said solemnly, "I feel a worm.  That dear, heroic old man! I wish we had let
him have `Pastimes' ten times over."

"Mistaken heroism, my dear.  He can be still more heroic at `Uplands'."

"Er--what do you think of--the other one?"

"Er--honestly, Evelyn, I don't think of him at all!"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mrs Maplestone has called, and the three or four other county magnates, none of them particularly
interesting from our point of view.  We are now formally and definitely "received," and the
first result has been a violent increase of intimacy on the part of the Vicar's wife.  I think
she has always "hankered" to know us, but not having enough individuality to act for herself,
she has waited for a lead before taking the plunge.

Now it appears that she is organising a garden fete and wants us to help.  It is her own idea,
and she says it is for the organ fund.  I don't want to be uncharitable, but I think it is
equally designed for the amusement and diversion of Delphine Merrivale!  I am uneasy about
that girl.  Nature never designed her for a clergyman's wife; she is restless and bored, while
that dear, good, fine man, who loves her so much, is as blind as a bat, and believes that all
is well.  To-day she sent for me to come to tea, and he came into the room while she was volubly
discussing various plans, which struck me as likely to cost more money than they were ever
likely to gain.  When he appeared she gave a little shrug of impatience, and for a few moments
lapsed into silence, but her self-control being soon exhausted, she took up her tale and babbled
on as enthusiastically as before.

It appears that every summer a "Sale" is held in the vicarage garden to dispose of the articles
manufactured by the "Working Party" throughout the winter session.  They consist of serviceable
garments for the poor, which are eagerly purchased by the members of the Needlework Guild,
and also of a selection of "fancy" articles which nobody wants, such as brush and comb bags
of pink and white crochet, shaving paper cases with embroidered backs (first catch the man
who uses them!) and handkerchief sachets of white satin, on which are painted (badly) sprays
of wild roses and maidenhair fern!

The parish has always meekly assembled itself together for the fray, paid threepence for a
plain tea, and departed peacefully on its way; but this year--this year, there is to be a band,
and a man to cut out silhouettes, and ices, and strawberries and cream, and quite a variety
of excitements.

"A treasure hunt for one, at an entrance fee of a shilling a head.  The treasures to be supplied
as voluntary offerings by the ladies of the neighbourhood."

Mrs Merrivale paused and cocked an interrogative eye at me, and her husband said gently:--

"Dear, aren't you too ambitious?  Our ordinary quiet sale has done very well until now.  Why
land yourself with a great deal of extra work and fatigue, to say nothing of expense, for an
altogether problematical result!"

"Oh, Jacky," she cried deeply.  "It is not problematical.  We shall make pounds and pounds.
I don't mind the work.  I like it.  Think how lovely it would be if we could clear off the
whole debt!"

He smiled at her with the tenderest appreciation.  Oh, if any man looked at me like that, I
would work my fingers to the bone to help him. Honestly and truly, he believed that she was
bracing herself to the fray out of the purest, most disinterested motives.  Never for one moment
did it occur to him that a grown woman could hanker after such ploys for her own amusement.
There is much in his unconsciousness which is beautiful, but--there is danger, too!  Surely,
surely when two people live together in such a terribly close relationship as husband and wife,
before all things it must be necessary to understand!

"Then I leave it to you, dearest," he said.  "Arrange as you think best. And now, if Miss Wastneys
will excuse me, I must say good-bye.  Poor Mrs Evans is worse this afternoon.  They fear that
an operation may be necessary.  She has had terrible pain."

Mrs Merrivale threw out her hand impulsively.  I was amazed to see that she had grown quite white.

"Don't, Jacky--don't!  You know I can't bear it.  Why will you speak of such things when I
have begged you not?"

"I'm sorry, darling.  I forgot.  My mind was so engrossed."  He laid his hand on her shoulder
as he passed, and said to me, in an apologetic voice, "This poor child is so sensitive.  The
pain of the world wounds her tender heart.  I am inconsiderate in bringing my burdens to her."

The door shut behind him, and we stared at one another for a long tense moment.  I knew, and
she knew that I knew, and suddenly the long strain of pretending to be what she was not reached
the snapping point, and she spoke out in a burst of impotent irritation:--

"It's not true!  I'm not tender-hearted.  They don't wound me at all, all these sordid miserable
details; they just irritate and disgust and asphyxiate.  Oh, I'm so tired of it all--so tired--and
he doesn't see, doesn't understand!  He puts me on a pedestal, and burns incense at my feet,
and believes that I am as interested as himself, and all the time--all the time I am smothered
with boredom and impatience.  I don't know why I am saying all this to you.  Yes, I do.  I
saw in your eyes that you saw through me, and knew what I really felt.  Now I suppose you are
horribly shocked?"

"Not a bit.  I don't understand enough to judge you one way or another; but I wish, as you
have begun, you would tell me a little more.  I'm young myself, you see, so I should probably
understand.  Lots of people tell me their secrets, and I'm always sorry, and very rarely shocked.
We all have our own faults.  Why should we be so very hard on other people because theirs are
a different brand from our own?"

She stared at me with her big blue eyes.

"What are your faults?"

"Well," I laughed, "the list would take a long time!  Shall we leave it for another day?  What
I want to know now is, why, with your temperament, did you come to marry a country parson?"

"Because I loved him, of course," came the ready reply.  "He came to take duty in our church
while our own clergyman was ill, and he stayed in our house.  He was so much older than I--fifteen
years--that I never thought of him--like that!  I just thought he was a dear, and liked to
talk to him, and show him about the garden, and get him to help me in little odd ways.  He
was so learned and serious and staid that all the others were in awe of him, but I ordered
him about, and made him wait on me, and teased him because he did it so badly.  It was such
fun!  I enjoyed myself frightfully.  Mother read me a long lecture one night, and said Mr Merrivale
would be pained to see father's daughter was such a frivolous girl.  But he wasn't.  He fell
in love with me instead. Doesn't that seem queer?"

I didn't think it was queer at all.  Imagination conjured up scenes in the summer garden where
the gay pretty girl had held her little court, and queened it over the grave, silent man. 
It was a thousand to one on his falling under the spell.  The mischief of it was that he had
expected the marriage ceremony to convert a butterfly into a staid, parochial wife.  John Courtney
Merrivale had a thousand virtues, but imagination was not his strong point.

"I think it was extremely natural.  Just what I should have expected to happen.  You are very
pretty, you know, and I expect you made a charming task-mistress.  And, of course, any sane
girl must have been interested in him.  But--what did you think about the life in this little
place?"

"Oh!  I didn't think about it at all," she said calmly.  "I was so happy, and--excited.  And
so busy getting my clothes, and the presents, and arranging for the wedding.  I had a lovely
wedding.  Eight bridesmaids carrying rose-staves.  And Jacky took me to Switzerland for the
honeymoon, and was so young and gay himself.  Like a boy.  I had a perfectly glorious three
months, and then--"

She paused, and the pink and white face puckered into a grimace as she cast an expressive glance
to right and left.

"We came home!  That was the first shock, seeing all this dingy, hideous furniture, and realising
that it had to stay.  Jacky likes it because it belonged to his mother, and he thinks it would
be wicked waste to sell it for nothing, and buy new.  I tried to brighten things up, but--if
you look round this room you will realise that a few new things made the effect worse!  I gave
it up in despair, and all my pretty cushions and embroideries, and pictures and ornaments are
hidden away in boxes in the attic."

"Oh, that's hard!  You have my unbounded sympathy.  I should hate to live in uncongenial surroundings.
Isn't there any room in the house you could have for your own, and furnish just exactly as
you like?"

"All the rooms are full.  I've given up trying to change things now, but they irritate me all
the same.  When I've been out all the day at meetings and guilds, it would be a rest to come
home to a pretty room. I look at those maroon curtains, and this hideous patterny carpet, and
feel all nervy and on edge; then Jacky thinks I am tired, and brings me hot milk."  She opened
her speedwell blue eyes to their fullest width, and stared at me dolefully.  "Oh, Miss Wastneys,
it is so strenuous to have to live up to an ideal!"

"It would be still more strenuous to--fall short," I said curtly, and she gave a start of dismay.

"Oh, goodness, yes!  Anything rather than that!  I wouldn't for the world have Jacky find me out."

I felt like an aged grandam admonishing a silly child.  Of course in the long run he was bound
to find out, for Delphine's discontent was obviously increasing, and the hour was at hand when
her self-control would come to a sudden and violent end.  Then there would be hasty words and
recriminations, the memory of which no after remorse could wipe away.  I was sure of it, and
said so plainly, qualifying my prophecy with a big "unless."

"Unless you can make up your mind to be honest now, and tell your husband the whole truth.
There is nothing to be ashamed of in being young and needing variety in life.  Tell him frankly
that too much parish gets on your nerves, and that you could do your work better if you went
away for a few weeks every three or four months.  There must be friends whom you could visit,
and who would be glad to have you.  After a change of scene and occupation you would come home
braced and refreshed, and ready to make a fresh start.  And you might speak about the room
at the same time.  You need not suggest selling any furniture, but just storing some of it
away in an attic or cellar, so that you could have a little boudoir of your own.  Do be sensible,
and tell him to-night.  He loves you.  He wants you to be happy.  He would understand."

She shook her head.

"No.  He would be kind and patient.  He would agree at once, and never say a word of reproach,
but--he wouldn't understand.  That's just it. His whole idea of me would be shocked out of
existence.  He would be disappointed to the bottom of his soul.  I--I can't do it, Miss Wastneys;
but it's been a relief to grumble to you.  Thank you for letting me do it.  Things have been
just a little better since you and Mrs Fane came to `Pastimes'.  I haven't seen much of you,
of course, but I have enjoyed watching you.  You wear such lovely clothes, and you are young
and interesting.  Most of the people are so dull and settled down.  I wish you would call me
`Delphine,' and come to see me as often as you can.  Just run in any time you are passing,
and let me come to you in the same way.  I've been so bored.  Well, never mind," she brightened
suddenly; "the fete will be a little excitement.  I am looking forward to that."

An idea flashed into my head.  I was sorry for the girl, and intensely, forebodingly sorry
for her husband.  If one could help to avert the threatened tragedy.

"I am just wondering," I began tentatively.  "Of course I can make no definite offer without
consulting Mrs Fane, but--would you like it if we lent our grounds for the fete?  The extra
space might be an advantage, and we could save you trouble by arranging for the tents and refreshments,
and perhaps organise some little stall on our own account."

I really thought that might save a good deal of expense, and so add to the profit of the afternoon,
and also that with our wider experience we might run the fete on more advanced lines, and so
give her, as well as the rest of the parish, a more amusing time; but to my disappointment
she flushed, and looked far from pleased.

"Oh, thanks, but--really, this is my affair!  If I have all the duty and responsibility of
being the Vicar's wife, I don't see why I should give up the fun of being hostess and arranging
my own fete in my own way. It's very sweet of you, of course, and I'm very grateful.  I hope
you won't be offended."

I began to laugh.

"Offended!  Why--Delphine, I was thinking entirely of you.  I'm immensely relieved, if you
want the real truth.  That's settled then, and we'll give you some treasures for the Hunt.
What would you like? Make up an appropriate list and send it along.  Anything you like, up
to--say five pounds!"

"Oh, you angel!  Will you really?" she cried ecstatically.  I had risen this time, and she
slid her hand through my arm, and accompanied me to the door.  Seen close at hand, her face
looked almost child-like in its clear soft tints.  I noticed also that her blouse was very
fine and delicate, a very different thing from the cheap lace fineries which she had worn when
I first saw her.  She followed the direction of my eye, stroked down an upstarting frill, and
coloured furiously.  "Ah, my blouse!  Do you admire it?  I wrote to town for it, to your dressmaker,
and I've ordered a lovely frock.  You'll see.  For once in my life I shall be really well dressed!
Seeing you and Mrs Fane has made me discontented with my dowdy old rags!"

CHAPTER ELEVEN.

THE GARDEN FETE.

The garden fete came off yesterday, and on the surface was a roaring success.  The weather
was ideal; the vicarage garden proved all that was necessary in the way of a background, and
the arrangements were so extraordinarily complete that my practical mind was constantly confronted
with the question, "Won't this cost far more than it gains?"  In a big city a charity entertainment
may throw out expensive baits with a fair chance of catching a shoal of fat and unwary fish;
but in a small village the catch can be calculated to a sou.  The big fish of the neighbourhood
will heave a sigh of duteous resignation, put a five-pound note in the purse, and start for
the fray prepared to spend it all, but not one penny more!  The smaller fry carry out the same
policy with ten or fifteen shillings.  The minnows take half-a-crown, with which they pay for
tea, and purchase soap at the provision stall, reporting to their husbands at night that, after
all, the money was not wasted.  The Vicar might just as well have it as the grocer.  All the
attractions in the world cannot worm shillings out of a public which is so prudent and canny
that it has self-guarded itself by leaving its cash at home!

Many times over yesterday afternoon I saw the flicker of longing in feminine eyes as they gazed
upon the tempting novelties displayed upon the stalls, but the next moment the lips would screw,
the feet pass by. Guild garments must be bought; tea paid for; tickets bought for the novel
Treasure Hunt, wherein--with luck!--one might actually gain by the outlay.  The visitors lingered
to gaze at the pretty china, and glass, and embroideries with which Delphine had filled her
stall; but the afternoon wore on, and it looked as full as ever--horribly full! There were
none of those bare, blank spaces which stall-holders love to see.  At five o'clock we marked
off the odd sixpences; at six o'clock we dropped a whole shilling, but still--hardly a sale!

Delphine looked--a vision!  At the first glimpse of her in her cobweb fineries, I was ill-bred
enough to gape, whereat she blushed and said hurriedly:--

"Your dressmaker!  Yes!  Isn't it a duck?"

And knowing the prices which Celeste charges for ducks with such feathers, I wondered, and--feared!
Did the Vicar know?  Was it possible that with his small stipend he could afford such extravagances?
Had the silly little thing ordered, and never asked?  Was it my fault for having given the
address?  Could I have helped doing so, when I was asked?  I had said she was expensive.  It
was some small comfort to remember that, and Charmion would say it was no concern of mine.
A dozen such disconcerting thoughts raced through my mind, but I shook them off, and said heartily:--

"It is lovely!  You are lovely!  I had no idea you were such a beauty. What does your husband say?"

Her face clouded.

"Nothing.  Doesn't notice.  Likes me as much in an old print.  But I--love it!  Oh, you don't
know what bliss it is to feel `finished off'.  Everything new, good, pretty, and to match!"
She gave a rapid swirling movement of the hand to call my attention to such details as shoes
and stockings, embroidered bag, and glorified garden hat.  "It's nothing to you.  You have
had them all your life, but I have only longed and--starved!"

She spoke with a passionate emphasis, which to many people would seem out of all keeping with
the subject; but I am young, and a girl, so I understood.  There are many empty-headed women
in whom the craving for pretty things is as strong as the masculine craving for drink and cards.
Circumstances have compelled these women to wear the plainest, most useful of clothes, while
every shop window shows a tantalising display of colour and beauty, and other women not half
so pretty as themselves bloom with a borrowed radiance!

No mere man can understand the inborn feminine joy in the feel of fine smooth fabric, nor the
blending of delicate colours, the dainty ruffling of lace.  To the rich these things come as
a matter of course, and the working classes are satisfied with garish imitations; it is the
poor gentlewoman with the cultivated taste, the cultivated longing for beauty, to whom temptation
comes in its keenest form.  It had come to Delphine, and she had succumbed.  I devoutly hoped
and prayed that the shock of the coming bill would prevent further extravagances!

Charmion and I took charge of the Treasure Hunt.  We had given the treasures, which were laboriously
chosen with a view to suitability. Umbrellas (lashed flat to the trunks of trees!) bags, photograph
frames, writing cases, boxes of handkerchiefs, chocolate, cigarettes, scent, and--this was
a cunning idea!--cash orders on a big London store.

There was a great rush for tickets, and the Vicar--very flurried, and out of his element, poor
man!--dragged in the Squire to help us.  The Squire had arrived with his mother an hour before,
and had sat under a cedar, drinking tea with a selection of old ladies and gentlemen, looking
as though he liked it quite well.  Whenever he met my eye, he glowered, as if to say, "How
dare you look at me!" and I smiled back, as that seemed to annoy him most.  Now, as the Vicar
brought him up, I could hear his muttered protests: "Rather not!  Can't you--isn't there something
else?"  Pleasing thing, I must say, to have a man forced to help you against his will!

Well, it was no use making a fuss before a score of curious eyes, so for the next half-hour
we stood side by side, selling tickets, explaining the rules of the Hunt, marshalling the seekers
in readiness for the signal to start.  He is capable enough, I will say that for him, and has
a patent knack of silencing garrulous questioners.  It was the funniest thing in the world
to stand at the end of the lawn, and watch these rustic backs--young, old, and fat middle-aged--all
poised on one leg, swaying to and fro, straining to be off!  Excruciatingly funny to watch
the stampede, after the loud "One--two--three--and away!"  The plunges, the waddles, the skelter
of flying heels!  One might have thought the gold of Klondyke was hidden in the kitchen garden.
I laughed, and laughed, in a good old Irish paroxysm of merriment, until the tears rolled down
my cheeks.  Mr Maplestone stared, turned on his heel, and stalked away.

I strolled back to the upper lawn, and the first person I saw was old General Underwood sitting
in his bath-chair, which had been drawn under the shade of a tree, so that he might see everything,
and yet be well out of the way.  He was too much out of the way, poor old dear! to judge by
his looks, and agreeably pleased to see my approach.

"Well, young lady, and how are you to-day?  You look very fresh and charming!"

"That's very nice of you, General!  I do like to be admired.  Isn't this rather a dull corner
for you?  Wouldn't you like to be moved?"

He looked around with his old, blue eyes.

"Everyone seems to have gone.  There was quite a crowd here a few minutes ago.  I sent my man
to the village to post some letters."

"We can manage without him.  There is a Treasure Hunt going on at the other end of the garden.
That is why this part is so empty.  Mrs Merrivale has hidden a lot of parcels among the trees
and shrubs, and everyone who pays a shilling can go and search for a treasure."

"Ha!"  His face lit up with the hunting instinct, which seems dormant in us all.  "Treasures--I
see!  A good idea.  Worth more, I presume, than the entrance shilling?"

"Oh, much, much more."  The pride of the donor sounded in my voice; then I looked at the poor,
old, tired, wistful face, and had a brilliant idea.  "General, shall we go hunting--you and
I?  I'll push and you'll steer, and we'll both look, and if it's a man's present, it's yours,
and if it's a woman's, it's mine, and if it's neutral, we'll toss!  They've only just started,
so we're in time."

He gripped the handle involuntarily, then loosened it to say:--

"My dear, I'm too heavy.  Wait till my man--"

"Nonsense!  I'm as strong as a horse.  Who waits is lost.  To the right, please, General. 
Straight down this path, and into the herbaceous garden.  Quite slowly, and keep a sharp eye
between the branches."

He quite chuckled with delight.  Viewed from the vantage ground of a bath-chair, a Treasure
Hunt was delirious excitement, but he was heavy!  I remembered a sharp upward curve some way
further on, and had a vision of myself pushing, with arms extended to full length, and feet
at a considerable distance between the arms, as I have seen small nursemaids push pram-loads
of fat twins.  How undignified it would be if I slipped half-way, and the chair backed over
my prone body!  Then, of course, the thing happened which I might have been sure and certain
would happen under the circumstances.  We came face to face with Mr Maplestone, and the General
called out:--

"Hi, Ralph!  There you are.  Just the man we want.  Miss Wastneys and I are hunting.  Come
and give a hand."

"Oh, if you have the Squire, you won't need me.  I'll go off on my own," I cried quickly; but
it was no use, the old man wanted both, and both he would have.  The Squire was to push behind;
I was to take the handle and pull in front; he himself must be free to hunt, since he was handicapped
by old eyes.  He issued orders with the assurance of a Commander-in-Chief, and we listened
and obeyed.

I started by feeling annoyed and impatient, but honestly, after the first few minutes, it was
great fun.  The Squire was an abominable pusher; first he pushed too little and left all the
work to me; and then, being upbraided, he pushed too hard and tilted me into a run; then we
changed places, and he took the wrong turnings, wheeled past plain grass beds where nothing
could possibly be hidden; then we both took the back, and the General peered from side to side,
and saw nothing, and grew discouraged, and sighed, and said his luck had gone.  No treasures
for him any more!

I will say for Ralph Maplestone that he is sweet to that old man!  He treats him just in the
right way, as deferentially as though he were in full health and strength, a martial figure
riding gloriously to conquest!  We cheered him up between us (I did it rather nicely, too!)
and became quite friendly in the process.  Two people can't join in pushing a bath-chair and
remain de haut en bas.  The thing is impossible.  I was most nice to Ralph Maplestone, and
he appeared to be nice to me.

Suddenly, in the middle of a bush, I saw a glint of brighter green, the tissue-paper wrapping
of a treasure, and instantly my fingers gripped the chair.  Mr Maplestone would have pushed
on, but I frowned and grimaced, and he looked and saw too, and we both puffed and panted, and
demanded a rest, during which I stood elaborately at one side of the bush, and he stood at
the other, so that the old dear could hardly miss seeing the paper.

Even then I had to give, it a surreptitious push before discovery came; but he had no suspicions,
not one, and was as pleased as a boy at the thought that his old eyes had been sharper than
our young ones.  We all took a turn at opening the parcel, and it turned out to be a vanity
bag, fitted with a mirror and other frivolities, so of course it was presented to me, and I
arranged my hair in the mirror, and powdered my nose with the puff, just to shock them, which,
by the way, it fully succeeded in doing.

"Girls didn't do that in my day!" croaked the General.

"All girls don't do it now!" grunted the Squire.

"My dear, you look far nicer without it."  This was the General's second venture.  I turned
to the Squire and asked solemnly, "Do I?" and he gave one quick look, and then stared past
me--through me--blankly into space.

"I am no judge," he said curtly.

Well, let me be honest!  It was flirtatious of me, I knew it was, and hurried to rub off the
powder, and get back to my briskest, most business-like manner.  As we had paid three entrance
fees, we were entitled to a treasure apiece, if we could find them, and I insisted upon keeping
up the search to the very last moment.  It amused the General; it amused me; I honestly believe
that it amused Mr Maplestone, as far as he was capable of being amused.  He was quite human;
once or twice, as we rushed after a "scent," he was even lively.  I began to think he might
really be quite nice.

We found one other parcel--a box of cigarettes--and then made our way back to the lawn, where
the General's valet was waiting, and took over the chair.  Delphine came up to me and slipped
her hand through my arm.

"Evelyn, you have managed beautifully, but you must be dead tired and longing for tea.  I'm
going to stand over you and make you rest.  Stupid of Jacky to send the Squire to help you!
You'd have been happier with anyone else, but he's so dense, so in the clouds, that he doesn't
notice these things.  Evelyn, isn't it strange how he dislikes you?"

"Who?  Your husband?"

"Nonsense.  No.  You know quite well--Mr Maplestone.  At first, of course, one can understand
he was prejudiced; but now!  And when you have been so nice!"

"Thank you for that.  I'm glad you appreciate me.  Why are you so sure the Squire does not?"

"Because," she said imperturbably, "he tells me so!"

Curiosity is a terrible thing.  It's bad enough when it concerns itself about other people,
but when it comes to oneself, it's ten times worse. I ached to ask, "When?" and "Where?" and
"How?" and exactly in what words Mr Maplestone's dislike had been expressed, but pride closed
my lips, and I would not let myself go.  Of course I had known before, but I had imagined that
after the chair episode--What stings is not the dislike itself, but the putting it into words
to such a confidante as Delphine.  No, let me be honest; the dislike itself does sting.  I
have my own petty feminine craving, and it is to be liked, to have people appreciate and approve
of me, if they do nothing more.  Even indifference is difficult to bear, but dislike--Well,
thank goodness, I have lived in a warm-hearted country among warm-hearted people who have loved
me for my name if for nothing else.  Really and truly, I believe this ugly, red-headed man
is the first person who has ever dared to speak openly of dislike for Evelyn Wastneys!

I pity and despise him.  I wouldn't have his approval if I could. Henceforth I shall never
think of him, nor mention his name.  To me he is dead.  All is over between us before anything
ever began!  It is finished.  This is the end.  The fete ended at nine o'clock, and Charmion
and I, with the other stall-holders, went into the vicarage to enjoy a supper of scraps.  As
a rule I adore scrap suppers after everyone has gone, and the servants have gone to bed, and
the guests make sorties into the pantry, and bring out plates of patties and fruit, and derelict
meringues, and wobbling halves of jellies and creams.  They taste so good, eaten in picnic
fashion before the fire, with a shortage of forks and spoons, and a plate as a lucky chance.
But somehow last night things didn't go!  I think perhaps there were too many "scraps" which
should by rights have been sold and paid for in good hard cash.  The Vicar was full of hospitable
zeal, and evidently enjoyed pressing the good things upon his guests, but there was something
in Delphine's pale glance which checked merriment.  She had had her fun, the interest of planning,
the excitement of playing hostess to the country-side, the satisfaction of knowing herself
to be the best-dressed, most admired woman present, and of queening it over women who had hitherto
patronised herself.  Poor little butterfly! she had enjoyed her hour, but now the sun had gone
down, and she was counting the cost.  The treasurer added up the coins handed in from the various
stalls and announced the total.  There was a little pause.

"Ah!" said the Vicar slowly.  "More than last year, but not so much as we hoped.  How will
it work out, dear, after paying expenses?"

"Oh, Jacky, I'm tired!  Can't we have supper in peace, before worrying about money!" she cried
pettishly.

Not another word was said.

When we were driving home, Charmion gave me a shock.

"I rather like Mrs Maplestone," she said dreamily.  "She is stiff and conventional, and it
has never even occurred to her that anyone can disagree with her views, and still have a glimmering
of right, but, at least, she is sincere.  If one could burrow deep enough beneath the surface,
she'd be worth knowing."

"I don't like people who have to be burrowed.  Life is too short.  And I am perfectly certain
that I should shock her into fits.  Personally, I don't intend to take the trouble of excavating!"

"That's unfortunate, for she wishes to know you.  She has invited us to dinner next Wednesday
to meet some friends."

"Charmion!  You didn't accept?"

"Certainly I did.  Wasn't it your express desire to be sociable, and to know your neighbours?"

"Oh, not them--not there!  It's pleasant knowing a few people, but one is at liberty to choose.
I think you might have consulted me!"

In the soft dusk she laughed, and stretched out a caressing hand.

"Tired, dear, and--cross?  I thought you'd be pleased.  Why and wherefore?  Tell me the truth?"

"Oh, don't be so tiresome, Charmion.  Of course I am tired.  I've been on my feet all day long.
Cross!  Why should I be cross?  Only--I don't choose to accept hospitality from that man. 
I tell you plainly I won't go."

She bowed her head, deliberately, once and again.

"Oh, yes, Evelyn, you will!  I gave you your choice, and having made it you will play fair.
I should have preferred to remain peacefully at Coventry, but having taken the first step at
your request, I don't propose to allow you to force me into society alone."

What could I say?  What was it possible to say?  There is no way out of it.  I shall just have
to go!

CHAPTER TWELVE.

A REVELATION.

The Vicar has called to tell us that Delphine has made up her accounts, and that the fete has
cleared fifty pounds more than the smaller affair last year.  He seemed pleased and proud,
and I was delighted, too, and immensely relieved, because I had really been horribly afraid
there would be no profit at all!  Curious to think where all the money came from to pay heavy
expenses, and still clear so much!  It just shows how small sums add up.  I asked if Delphine
were very pleased, and he hesitated, and said:--

"She seems tired.  Feeling the reaction, no doubt.  She worked so hard."

An imp of curiosity tempted me to see if he were really as blind as he appeared.

"She made a splendid hostess.  And didn't she look charming, too?  I am sure you were proud
of her in that lovely new frock!"

His eyes softened with a deep glowey look, which was reserved for Delphine alone.

"I am always proud of her.  She always looks charming; but the dress--I am afraid I must plead
guilty.  I know nothing about her dress."

"Really?  Truly?  You couldn't tell what it was like?"

"Not for a thousand pounds!"

I stared at him, frowning.

"If I had a husband I should like him to know.  I should be furious if I made a special effort,
and he didn't even notice that I had anything new."

He smiled with a forbearing air.

"Surely not!  I think better of you, Miss Wastneys.  Dress is altogether unimportant."

"Not to me.  Not to your wife.  There are some women to whom it is the greatest temptation
in life."

He looked outraged, disgusted, and changed the subject with a resolute air, but I was glad
that I had spoken.  A husband can be too unworldly, and lost in the clouds.  It would be the
best thing in the world for Delphine if he did notice, and that in more ways than one!

In the afternoon Charmion and I called at the vicarage to congratulate Delphine, and found
her distinctly the worse for wear.  Pale, heavy-eyed, and inclined to snap, a very different
creature from the radiant butterfly of three days ago.  She was glad to see me, however, I
was someone to snap at, which was what she wanted most at the moment, and she worked off quite
a lot of steam, hectoring me about things I might have done better, or not done at all, and
impressing on me for future occasions that I should be less independent, and take more advice.
She likewise informed us, quite incidentally and "by the way," that Mrs Ross had disliked my
hat and Mrs Bruce had asked if Charmion were anaemic--such a colourless skin!--and Mrs Someone
Else thought it so "queer" that we should live together!  Altogether she behaved like a spoiled,
ill-tempered child, but she looked so young and worried and pretty through it all, that on
the whole I felt more sorry for her than myself.  As for Charmion, she smiled, with an air
of listening from an illimitable distance, which I can quite understand has an exasperating
effect on people who do not understand and care.  It exasperated Delphine now.  I saw the blue
eyes flash, and the pink lips set, with a peevish desire to "hit back!"

"Mrs Bruce said her family know the Fane family quite well.  They come from the same county.
She was telling them about you, but, of course, not knowing your husband's Christian name made
it difficult.  She thought it so queer to have your own Christian name printed on your cards--"

"Did she?" said Charmion blandly.

"It is an American custom," I put in hastily.  "I should do the same if I had such a fascinating
name."

"I wouldn't!"  Delphine said--"it's so queer.  Unless, of course, one's husband had a hideous
name--Elisha, or Jonathan, or something like that. Even then one might leave it out."

"I shouldn't dream of marrying anyone called Elisha."

"What was--is--your favourite man's name?"

"Jacky," said Charmion naughtily.

Delphine's eyes flashed.

"Was that your husband's name?"

"Oh no."

The pink lips opened to ask a further, more definite question, but it died unsaid.  The steady
gaze of Charmion's eyes prevented that.  She would be a bold woman who could defy that silent
challenge!

We made our escape, and walked home in silence.  Charmion seemed very depressed, and went to
bed at nine o'clock.  Next time I see Delphine Merrivale, I shall tell her plainly that I will--not--have
Mrs Fane annoyed with questions about the past!

Last night we dined at the Hall.  Last night things happened.  We started feeling quite festive
and excited, for, after a strictly domestic life for nearly five months, it becomes quite thrilling
to dine in another house, and to eat food which one has not ordered oneself.  As we drove along
the lanes, we amused ourselves like schoolgirls, guessing what we "would have," and who would
"take us in".  Charmion, as the married woman, would obviously fall to the Squire.  I hoped
I should be at the other end of the table, with a partner who was sweet tempered and appreciative.
Bridget had come back from posting a letter, bearing the thrilling news that the Squire's car
had been to the station to meet a party of guests.  Two fine, upstanding ladies, and a gentleman
with a figure like a wooden Noah in the Ark.  The shoulders of him!--that square you might
have cut them with a knife!  It was refreshing to know that we were to meet people who did
not live within a radius of five miles.  I rather hoped those shoulders would fall to my share!

They did.  He is an American.  I might have guessed that by the description, and one of the
"fine upstanding ones" is his bride, and they have been "doing" England for a few weeks, before
starting on a year's honeymoon in the East.  The explanation of their appearance at the Hall
is that they "chanced" to have met the Squire years ago in America, and wished to renew the
acquaintance.  So things came about! Mr Elliott is an interesting man, and, like all Americans,
loves to talk about his own country.  He was pained and shocked to hear I had never crossed
the Atlantic, until I told him that half myself, in the person of an only sister, had gone
in my place.  I was just going to add that Charmion also had spent a great part of her life
in the States, when--something stopped me--one of those mysterious impulses which, at times,
lay a finger on our lips, and check the coming words.

Charmion sat on one side of the Squire, Mrs Elliott on the other.  I was half-way down the
table, sandwiched in between a dozen comfortable, middle-aged worthies, who were all intimate
friends, if not actually related to each other, and their conversation, though interesting
to themselves, was not thrilling to an outsider.  I saw the American's quick eye dart from
one to the other, and hoped he was not classifying the company as typical English wits!  The
dinner itself was long, heavy, and unenterprising; a Victorian feast, even to the "specimen
glass" decorations.  One rose and one spray of maidenhair, in a tall thin glass, before each
separate diner.  Charmion and the Squire talked and laughed together, and seemed quite happy.
She is a lovely creature when she is animated; there is a dainty charm about every movement
which makes her seem of a different clay from human creatures.  Even to see Charmion eat is
a beautiful thing!

All the same, that dinner was a trial of patience, and I was thankful when it was over.  In
the old-fashioned way, we left the men to their smoke, and wandered through the drawing-room
into a big domed palm-house, which in its fragrant dimness, with the giant palms reaching to
the very roof, looked much more inviting than the drawing-room with its glaring incandescent
lights.

The American bride attached herself to me and chatted amusingly enough. Before her marriage
she had lived "out west," so I plied her with questions about ranch life.  Kathie writes regularly
enough, but she is a wretch about answering questions, and is not half detailed enough to satisfy
my curiosity.  We stood leaning against one of the tiered flower-stands, enjoying the scent
and the beauty, chatting together so lightly and calmly, blankly unsuspicious, as we so often
are in the big moments of life, of what lies immediately ahead.  Between the spreading branches
I caught sight of Charmion looking at me with raised, inquiring brows.  She had noted my eagerness,
and was wondering what point of interest had been discovered between the wordy American and
myself.  I raised my voice, and cried happily:--

"Oh, Charmion!  Mrs Elliott knows Kathie's home.  She has stayed there herself.  I am asking
her all about it."

She smiled, and moved forward as if to join us.  Mrs Elliott gave a little start, and repeated
curiously, "Charmion!  Is Mrs Fane called Charmion?  That's a very unusual name.  I have only
heard it once before.  Very sweet, isn't it, but association goes for so much!"

"It does.  In this case it makes the name all the more charming."

"Why, yes, that is so.  Mrs Fane is a lovely woman.  But I guess I was less fortunate in my
specimen.  I never met her myself, but she married a man I knew well, and--ran away from him
on their honeymoon!"

I laughed.  I am so glad I laughed.  So glad there was time to say lightly, "She was soon tired!"
before, between the spreading leaves of a palm, I caught Charmion's eyes--my Charmion!--staring
into mine, and knew that she had overheard--knew more--knew, in a blundering flash of intuition,
that the words which had just been spoken referred to no stranger, but to herself!  Fortunately
for us both, Mrs Elliott was facing me, so she did not see, as I did, the sudden pause, the
blanching face, the dumb appeal of the stricken eyes.

I flashed back reassurement, and at once led the way forward--out of the conservatory, back
to the drawing-room, affecting to be tired, to want to sit down.  Mrs Elliott followed, unperturbed.
It didn't matter to her where she went, the one indispensable necessity was to talk, and to
have someone to listen.  She continued her history with voluble emphasis.

"I should think it was soon!  Well, I guess she might have thought it out before she went so
far.  Too hard on a man to be treated like that. Kind of humiliates him before his friends,
that a woman couldn't put up with him one month--"

"I shouldn't worry about his pride," I said curtly.  "What about hers? It would be worse than
humiliating for a woman to be obliged to go! He must have been a poor thing!"

"Well, I don't know.  He was a real popular man.  He may have been a bit careless and extravagant;
quite a good many young men are that, but they settle down into staid, steady-going husbands
if the right woman comes along to help.  Doesn't seem to me, Miss Wastneys, that it's possible
for any man to be so bad, that in three weeks the woman who had promised to stick to him till
death should throw up the sponge!"

It did not seem so to me, either, so I made no comment.  I should not have been human if I
had not burned to ask questions, but I would not allow myself to do it.  What Charmion wished
me to hear, she would tell me herself.  The time had come when she would tell me.  I knew that.
This chance encounter had decided the moment when her silence should be broken.

Mrs Elliott smothered a yawn, and straightened a diamond bracelet on her wrist.  The diamonds
were massed together so heavily that the weight dragged them to the inside of her arm, leaving
only the plain gold band in sight, a hiding of treasures which did not please the owner.

"Well," she said deliberately once more, "I guess it was a real cruel trick.  Whatever he'd
done, she put herself in the wrong that time.  The poor fellow's not done a mite of good ever
since."

I had to hold myself tight to prevent a start.  Not done!  She talked of the man in the present
case, as though he were alive, as though-- stupefying thought!--Charmion was not a widow after
all!  The thought was stupefying, but even as it passed through my brain, I realised that no
word of her own had been responsible for my conviction that her husband was dead.  It was rather
because she never did mention him that Kathie and I had made so sure that he did not exist.
My thoughts dived into the past, recalling faded impressions.  I remembered how Kathie had
said, "She must have loved him dreadfully not to be able to refer to him even now!"  And how
I had been silent, fighting the impression that it was the ghost of sorrow, rather than of
joy, which sealed Charmion's lips.

The door opened, and the men came into the room.  The different groups broke up and drifted
here and there; into the palm-house to look at the flowers, back into the drawing-room to talk,
drink coffee, and glance surreptitiously at the clock.  In this old-fashioned household, no
one thought of providing any other amusement for a dinner party than the dinner itself.  Having
been well fed, the guests were expected to amuse themselves for the hour that remained.  In
an ordinary way I could have taken my share in the amusing; I like talking, and am never troubled
by not knowing what to say.  Given people to listen, and look appreciative, I can monologue
for an indefinite time.  But--to-night!

Inside the palm-house I could see Charmion's grey figure reclining in a wicker chair, her face
ivory-white against the cushions.  She was waving her fan to and fro, and listening with apparent
attention to the conversation of her companions.  I guessed how little she would hear; how
bitter must be the dread at her heart; how endlessly, interminably long the moments must seem.

"Miss Wastneys, would you care to see the picture we were talking about at dinner?"

It was Mr Maplestone's voice.  I looked up and saw him standing by my side, and rose at once,
thankful for any movement which would pass the time.  We left the room together, walked to
the end of the long corridor, and drew up before the picture of an uninteresting old man with
several chins, and the small, steel-blue eyes which seem a family inheritance.  This was a
celebrated Romney, which had been the subject of a protracted law-suit between different branches
of the family, which had cost the losing party over a thousand pounds.  I thought, but did
not say, that I would have been obliged to anyone who would have taken him away, free, gratis,
for nothing, rather than that he should hang on my walls.  Spoken comment, under the circumstances,
was a little difficult and halting!

"This is the Romney."

"Oh yes."

"My grandfather."

"I see.  Yes.  How interesting."

He laughed--a short, derisive bark.

"That's the last thing you can call it!  A more uninteresting production I never beheld.  What
right had he to waste good canvas?  That is one point in which we do show more common sense
than our ancestors.  We do not consider it necessary to inflict our portraits on posterity."

"No.  We don't.  At least--"

He swung round, facing me, with his back to the open drawing-room door, his face suddenly keen
and alert.

"Miss Wastneys--never mind the picture!  I brought you out as an excuse. I wanted to ask--Whats
the matter?"

The question rapped out, short and sharp.  I looked at him, made a big effort to be bright,
and natural, and defiant, and realised suddenly that I was trembling; that, while my cheeks
were hot, my hands were cold as ice; that, in short, the shock and excitement of the last half-hour
was taking its physical revenge.  For two straws I could have burst out crying there and then.
It is a ridiculous feminine weakness to be given to tears at critical moments, but if you have
it, you have it, and so far I have not discovered a cure.  I could have kept going if he had
taken no notice, and gone on talking naturally; but that question knocked me over, so I just
stared at him and gulped, and pressed my hands together, with that awful, awful sensation which
comes over one when one knows it is madness to give way, and yet feels that the moment after
next you are just going to do it, and nothing can stop you!

I thought of Charmion, sitting calm and quiet in the palm-house; I thought of that first horrible
interview in the inn parlour; I thought of my heroic ancestors.  It was no use; every moment
I drew, nearer and nearer to the breaking-point.  I still stared, but the Squire's face was
growing misty, growing into a big, red-brown blur.  Then suddenly a hand gripped my arm, and
a voice said sharply:--

"Don't cry, please!  No necessity to cry.  You are tired.  I will order the car.  It shall
be round in five minutes.  You can surely pull yourself together for five minutes?"

The voice was like a douche of cold water.  I shivered under it, but felt wonderfully braced.

"Oh, thank you, but we ordered a fly."

"That's all right.  I'll see to that.  No one shall know anything about it.  You will leave
earlier than you expected--that's all.  I'm sorry"-- his lean face twitched--"the time has
seemed so long!"

"It's not"--I said feebly--"it's not that!"  But he led the way back to the drawing-room, taking
no notice.  Five minutes later "Mrs Fane's carriage" was announced, and we bade a protesting
hostess good-night.

Charmion and I sat silent, hand in hand, all the way home.  She felt cold as ice, but she clung
to me; her fingers closed over mine.  Just as we reached our own door she whispered a few words.

"I'll come to your room, dear.  Wait up for me."

The time had come when I was to hear Charmion's story from her own lips!

CHAPTER THIRTEEN.

MORE BITTER THAN DEATH.

Charmion came to my room in her white dressing-gown, with her long hair hanging plaited down
her back.  Remembering the icy hands I had held in mine, I had lit the gas fire, and she cowered
gratefully over its warmth.

"Kind of you, dear!  Warmth is comforting.  Well, Evelyn, so the time has come.  I have waited,
screwing up my courage; but the hour has been decided for us."

"Not unless you choose," I cried hastily.  "I would far rather never hear--"

She checked me with a wan smile.

"I do choose.  When it is over, it will be a relief.  I want you to know.  You will understand
better, and I shall not pain you so much, dear, kind Evelyn, by my harsh ways.  So all this
time you have believed that I was a happy widow?"

The expression jarred.  She saw the shrinking in my eyes, and smiled again, in the same wan,
hopeless fashion.

"Oh, I mean it.  Death comes like a sword, but in the end it is merciful, for it brings peace.
The one who is left suffers many pangs, but in time--in time, learns to be thankful for all
that the beloved is spared.  It is the living troubles which sear the heart.  I have envied
the widows who could look up and say, `It is well with him.  We shall meet again.'  With me
it has been all bitterness, all rebellion."

I sat silent, not daring to interrupt, and after a moment's pause she began again, speaking
in a still, level tone, with hardly any variety of expression.

"I am an orphan like you, Evelyn.  Both my parents died before I was fourteen, and I was sent
over to America to live with a grandmother aunt.  I was an heiress, unfortunately--you know
my views about riches!--and by my father's will I came into my money at eighteen.  My aunt
was a wise woman, and even to her intimate friends she never gave a hint of my fortune.  She
was a wealthy woman herself, and had no daughter, only one son, so it seemed natural that she
should give me a good time, dress me prettily, and take me about.  She had a horror of fortune-hunters,
and wanted me to be loved for myself, and be as happily married as she had been before me.
When I came out she brought me over to London for a season, and I was presented; but that was
my one and only visit to England in fifteen years.  I was glad to go back to New York, for
my real friends were there.  We had grown up together, and had the associations of years. 
In England I had only acquaintances.  Well! So it went on, the happiest of lives, till I was
twenty-four.  Several men wanted to marry me, but I never met anyone whom it was possible to
think of as a husband until--"

"Your husband?"

"Yes.  We were away for the summer--a whole party of us--camping in the most delicious spot.
I wish you could join an American camping party some time, Evelyn.  It's just the happiest,
freest, most ideal of lives! He came down as the guest of some other people.  The daughter
was one of my own friends.  I thought at first that she cared for him herself, but he never
paid her any attention--not the slightest; rather avoided her indeed, even before--"

"He cared for you.  Did it begin--soon--Charmion?"

"I cared for him the first moment we met.  I was sitting at a long tea-table set out in the
open, and my friend brought him up to a seat right opposite to mine.  She said, `Charmion,
this is Phil--Phil, this is Charmion!'  It was one of the rules of the camp that we called
each other by our Christian names.  The life was so informal that `Mr' and `Miss' seemed out
of place.  I looked up and met his eyes, and--it was different from anything I had felt before.

"He came for a week, but he stayed on and on until it was nearly a month.  I can't talk about
it, Evelyn.  Such times can never last.  Even at the best it is impossible that they can last.
Perfect happiness is not for this world.  It was all beautiful.  The place where we camped
was like another Garden of Eden; the weather was exquisite, such days, such mornings!  Oh,
Evelyn, such nights!  The sky a dome of deepest blue, with the stars shining as you never saw
them in this damp, misty atmosphere.  And he and I--"

Her voice broke.  Her hand went up to her face to hide the quivering of her lips.  It was a
petrifying thing to see Charmion break down.  I turned away my eyes, unable to bear it.  There
was silence in the room for several moments, then she began again.

"Nothing was said in words.  I didn't want him to speak.  I was perfectly happy, perfectly
sure, and I dreaded the publicity of an engagement.  Every one talking, questioning, teasing.
It would have seemed profanation.  Besides--if Marjorie had really cared as I suspected, it
would have been painful for her.  I wouldn't let him speak until we got back to New York, and
then, the very night I arrived, Aunt Mary was taken dangerously ill.  She lingered a few weeks,
but there was never any hope.  Then she died and I was left alone, for her son, my cousin,
lived in India.

"All that time he--my husband--had been coming to see me every day.  The doctor insisted that
I should go out to be braced by the fresh air, so he took me long drives, long walks, and then
sat by me indoors, comforting me, helping, advising.  He was everything to me, Evelyn! Aunt
Mary was dying, and she had been like a mother, but when he was with me I was satisfied; I
was content.  When she died, he urged an immediate marriage, and I was quite ready.  She had
left no money to me, but I told him I had some of my own.  He kissed me, and"--again her hand
went up to hide that quivering lip--"he said that did not concern him. He could keep his wife.
What money I had I must keep for myself, to pay for `little extravagancies'.

"I was thankful that he did not know, thankful that he did not care.  I looked forward to telling
him after we were married, and seeing his face of surprise.  We had planned to live in an apartment
until we had time to choose a house for ourselves.  I laughed to think how much bigger and
finer it would be than the little house of his dreams.  He was not at all rich--did I tell
you that?  He had had a pretty hard struggle all his life, and had only quite a moderate income.
I went to my lawyer and settled a fourth of my income on him for life.  I knew if we lived
in a bigger way there would be calls upon him which he would not otherwise have had.  Calls
for subscriptions, for charities, a dozen other claims. I hated to think that he should have
to come to me for money, or that cheques should be drawn in my name.  He asked me what I was
going to give him as a wedding present, and I laughed, and said, `Nothing interesting.  Only
a little note!'  The settlement was to be my gift."

Silence again.  I felt for her hand and held it tight?  Tragedy was coming; I knew it.  I waited,
tense with suspense.

"We were married very quietly.  Only two or three people in the church. He called for me. 
It was unconventional, but I was nervous and weak, and he knew he could give me strength. 
We went up the aisle together, hand in hand.  The man who was to give me away followed behind.
Many people in America are married in their own homes, but I preferred a church.  I've been
sorry since.  It has seemed a profanation.  To stand before the altar in God's house and take
those solemn vows, while all the time--all the time--"

She shuddered, and paused to regain self-possession.

"Well, Evelyn--well!  I had two weeks' happiness, two weeks in my fool's paradise, and then--the
end came!  He had gone over to New York for a day.  Some important business had arisen and
he was obliged to go.  He said good-bye."  She paused again, struggling for composure.  "It
was good-bye--good-bye for ever.  He did not know that, but he parted from me as--a husband
might from the wife of his heart.  It was impossible to doubt.  I was as sure of him, Evelyn--as
sure as that the sun is in the sky!

"After he had gone a letter was handed to me.  I did not know the writing, but inside--I could
not understand it--was a letter in his own writing.  Nothing else, just this one sheet, with
one long passage underscored.  I did not stop to think; the words leapt at me, my own name
first of all; and after I had begun to read there was no stopping short.  It was the second
sheet of a letter, so I could not tell to whom it had been written; but evidently it was to
a man to whom money was owing, and who had been pressing for a settlement.  It was full of
apologies for having failed to pay before; and then--then came the passage that had been underlined.
Perhaps, he said, in a few months' time things would look up.  There was a girl.  In a roundabout
way, through an English acquaintance, he had heard that she had a pile of money, though the
fact had been kept dark in America.  There was no doubt about it, since his informant was a
member of the legal firm who had wound up her father's estate.  By a stroke of good luck the
girl was staying at a summer camp with some of his own friends.  He had engineered an invitation,
and was there at the moment of writing.

"Think of it, Evelyn--at that very moment I was, perhaps, sitting innocently by his side. 
We used to scribble our letters together, sitting out in the woods, and break off every few
minutes to laugh and chatter.  Probably, after it was finished, we walked together to the nearest
post, and as we went he looked at me--he looked.  Oh!"--she winced in irrepressible misery--"is
it possible--is it possible that any man could act so well?  Can you wonder that I am hard
and cold--that I have so little sympathy for outside troubles?  I was once as loving and impetuous
as you are yourself, but that shock turned me to stone. It killed my faith in human nature!"

She was silent, struggling for composure, and I laid my hand on her knee, and sat silent, not
daring to speak.  What was there to say?  I realised now how infinitely more bitter than death
was the loss which Charmion had to bear.

"Well,"--she roused herself to go on with her story--"you can imagine the rest.  `The heiress
was,' he wrote, `quite a possible girl,' and seemed `agreeably disposed'.  There was evidently
no previous entanglement, and the circumstances were propitious.  It was his intention to go
in and win.  If it came off he would be in a position to pay up old scores and to start life
afresh.  It would be worth giving up his liberty, to end the everlasting worry of the last
ten years.  The letter ended with more promises and his signature.  No loophole of doubt was
left, you see.  There could be no mistaking that signature.  I had been married exactly two
weeks, and had believed myself the happiest woman in the world.  I now discovered that I had
been tracked down by an adventurer, who had married me only because, unfortunately, it was
impossible to get hold of my fortune without putting up with me at the same time."

"What did he say, how did he look, when you told him about your money and the settlement? 
Of course, you had told him by that time."

"Not much.  Very little indeed.  I thought at the time that he was overwhelmed, and a little
sorry that the wealth was on my side.  Looking back, I do him the justice to believe that he
was ashamed!  Even such a deliberate schemer might well feel a pang under the circumstances.
I remember that he put his elbows on the table, and hid his face in his hands.  He never alluded
to the subject again, neither did I.  There seemed plenty of time.  I loved him all the more
because he was not wildly elated.  All my life I had been trained to dread fortune-hunters,
to value sincerity above every other virtue."

"But during those two weeks after you were married, he still seemed to--care?  You believed
in him still?"

"Absolutely!  Utterly!  I must be easily duped, Evelyn, for with all my heart I believed that
that man loved me as deeply as I loved him.  Every word--every look!  Oh, he was a finished
actor!  It all seemed so real-- so real--"

"Charmion, after you had read that letter and understood all that it meant, what did you do?"

"I went to my room, packed a bag with a few changes of clothing, collected all the money I
had with me, quite a large sum in notes, and caught the afternoon train for New York.  I had
no idea where I was going.  My one longing was to escape before he came back, but things were
decided for me.  The shock made me faint, and in the heat of the train I felt worse every hour.
When we stopped at a half-way station I stepped out on to the platform in the same dull, dazed
way, hardly realising what I was doing, and carried my bag out into the street. Half a mile
away I saw a notice of rooms to let in the window of a small house, and I knocked and went in.

"I stayed in that house for over six months, Evelyn.  The woman was a saint--the kindliest,
gentlest creature I have ever met.  I told her that I was ill and in trouble, and wanted to
rest, and she put me to bed and nursed me like a child.  I was a long time in getting well.
The very strings of my being seemed to have snapped.  I lay torpid week after week, and the
good soul took care of me and asked no questions. She was one of those rare spirits who pray
to God to guide them day by day, and mean literally what they ask.  God had sent me to her
in my need--that was her firm belief--and what she did for me she did for Him. I had left no
message behind--only that terrible letter sealed up, to be given to my husband on his return.
I heard afterwards that he had searched for me far and wide, had even crossed over to England,
thinking I must be here.  When I was well enough I sent for my aunt's lawyer and took him into
my confidence.  He let me know when my husband returned to America, and as soon as possible
after that I came to England myself, under another name.  I was no longer his wife in heart.
Why should I keep a name which was given to me under false pretences?  Five years have passed
since then.  It seems like a century, and--here I am!"

"And all this time you have heard nothing?  Nothing has happened?"

"Yes.  I have heard.  He seems to have--felt it a good deal!  It is always painful to be discovered,
and for a man's wife to leave him before the honeymoon is over is hurtful to his pride.  He
makes periodic efforts to find me, but my lawyers are loyal, and will give no clue."

"And the settlement?  The money you made over to him?  Does he draw that still?"

She flushed and frowned.

"No.  It appears not.  He tells the lawyers that he will never touch it. I suppose if he changed
his manner of living it would be remarked, and people might guess something of the truth. 
His object is, of course, to throw all the blame on me."

The bitterness of her voice hurt me so that I ventured a timid protest.

"Charmion, I am not taking his part.  I think he was contemptible beyond words; but--isn't
it possible that he has regretted, that he has not taken the money because he was ashamed?"

"Possible, of course; but I should say extremely improbable.  However, I am no longer concerned
in his motives.  He gave up his liberty for a certain price, and the price is his.  The money
accumulates at the bank. Some day, no doubt, he will find it convenient to draw it."

I felt a movement of revolt, and cried quickly:--

"There is one person I despise even more than the man himself, and that is the creature who
kept that letter, and sent it to you too late to prevent the marriage!  If it were to be done
at all, why could it not have been done before?"

Her lips curved.

"Yes.  It was very cruel.  That was another disillusion, Evelyn.  I have always been convinced
that Marjorie was the sender.  Probably the letter had been written to her brother, or to some
near relation, and in some way had come into her possession.  She behaved very strangely about
our engagement.  But I had been her friend--how she could find it in her heart!  If there had
been any possibility of doubt I would have gone straight to her, and demanded the truth, but--what
was the use?  The letter was there.  I should only have brought more suffering upon myself.
She wanted him for herself, and could not forgive me for taking him away; but if she had come
to me at the beginning, when she saw how things might go, I should have gone away myself and
left the coast clear.  Even if it hurt myself, I should have been loyal to another woman who
had cared first!  Even now I have done my best for her.  I offered, through my lawyers, to
make no objection if he chose to free himself legally.  It could be done in America, you know.
I explained that it would make no difference to the settlement.  That was made, and should
remain unchanged!"

I looked at her sharply, for the sneer in her voice hurt me more than the pain.

"Charmion!  Forgive me, dearest.  You have been cruelly treated, but-- don't be vexed--aren't
you in the wrong, too, in feeling so bitter after all these years?"

To my surprise she assented instantly.

"Oh, yes; very wrong.  More wrong than they, perhaps, for I have had so long to think; and
what they did was done on an impulse.  Don't think I excuse myself, Evelyn.  I don't!  I see
quite well how hard and bitter I am, but--"

"You can't forgive?"

She hesitated, her grey eyes gazing into space.

"What exactly is forgiveness?  If by lifting a little finger I could make him suffer as he
has made me, nothing would induce me to do it.  If by lifting a little finger I could bring
him happiness and success, I think--no, I am sure that I would not hesitate.  But to purge
my heart of bitterness, that is beyond me!  It's always there, deep down, a hard, hard wall,
hiding the light, shutting me out from man--and from God!"

The last words came in a whisper.  I knew the effort with which they were spoken, and sat silent,
clinging to her hand.  What could I say? I, with my easy, sunshiny life; how dared I dictate
to her great grief. And yet I knew--I knew only in one way could peace come back.

The remembrance of the Vicar's first sermon came back to my heart like a breath of fresh air.

"Forgetting the things that are behind!"  I said softly.  "Couldn't you try that, Charmion?
Forgetting, and--pressing forward!  If forgiving seems beyond you for the moment, couldn't
you take the first step?"

For the first time since she entered the room her face lightened into something like her own
natural smile.

"Ah, Evelyn, that's like you!  Thank you, dear, for the reminder.  That was the text on our
first Sunday here.  There is one thing I would like you to know.  You have helped me more than
anything else.  You attracted me because you possess to excess the very qualities which I have
lost--trust, faith, overflowing kindliness and love.  It has been a tonic to be with you. 
There have been times--working in the garden by your side, seeing all the live green things
springing out of darkness-- when I've been happy again, better than happy--at peace!  But now--
this upheaval--it has renewed it all.  Evelyn, do you think she suspected?  Do you think she
will talk?"

"I am sure she won't.  Absolutely sure.  She had not a flickering doubt. The name is different,
you see, and she is too much absorbed in herself and her own affairs to waste any thought upon
us.  In a few days they sail for India."

"Yes."  She drew a sigh of relief.  "That's good.  I'm thankful.  It would have been so hard
to be uprooted again.  But you can understand, Evelyn, that for a time--" She rose, stretched
herself to her full height, and threw out her arms restlessly.  "The roving fit is on me. 
I must be off into the wilds and fight it out by myself."

I had known it was coming--subconsciously had known it for weeks, but it was hard all the same.
We had been so happy, and in six short months my roots seemed to have gone down surprisingly
deep.  I hated the idea of leaving "Pastimes," but I reminded myself that it was only for a
time-- only for a time.

"Of course" Charmion assured me heartily.  "It is August now.  We will make a rendezvous for
Christmas.  Perhaps I may turn up before that, like a bad penny, but you may depend on me for
Christmas.  You--you will go to your flat, Evelyn?"

I nodded silently.  The Pixie scheme had for the moment lost its charm, but I would not give in.

"Silly one!" murmured Charmion fondly.  "You dear goose!  Well, good luck to you.  May you
make other people as happy as you have made me."

CHAPTER FOURTEEN.

A YOUNG WIFE'S DILEMMA.

Not another word about herself did Charmion say, but she began at once to make preparations
for going abroad, and before a week is over she will be off.  She has friends in Italy, it
appears, and will probably spend some time near them, but even I am only to have an official
address, from which letters are to be forwarded.  She warns me that I may hear very seldom,
since when a "dark mood" is on, the very essence of a cure seems to be to hide herself in utter
solitude.

Well, I also am going to hide, and to shelter myself behind an official address, so I ought
not to complain; but all the same I do feel lorn and lone.  First Kathie torn away to another
continent, and now Charmion, who is so wonderfully dear!  The next thing will be that Bridget
will announce, some fine morning, that she is going to marry the gardener!  I told her so,
in a moment of dejection, and she petrified me by replying calmly:--

"Indeed, and he's been after pestering me to do it since the moment we set foot.  There's a
deal worse things I might do!"

"Bridget!"  I gasped; and I lay back in my chair.  I had spoken in the most absolute unbelief.
There were no illusions between Bridget and me, each knew the other's age to an hour, and Queen
Anne herself had not seemed to me more dead to romance than my staid maid.  I stared at her
broad, worn face, her broad, elderly figure in a petrified surprise.

"Bridget, do you really mean--do you honestly mean that you like him, too?"

She simpered like any bit of a girl.

"And why wouldn't I be liking him, Miss Evelyn?  Isn't he the fine figure of a man, and as
pleasant a way with him as if he'd been Irish himself?"

"But, Bridget, you're forty-five!  Do women--can women--is it possible to--to care at forty-five?"

Bridget chuckled; not a bit offended, but simply amused and superior.

"What's forty-foive, but the proime of life?  Care--are you asking? 'Deed, it's not forty-five
that's going to see a heart frozen stiff.  Ye mind me of the old dame of eighty, who was asked
what was the age when a woman stopped caring about a man.  `'Deed,' says she, `I can't tell
ye that.  You'll have to be asking someone older than me!'"

She laughed again, and I took my turn at looking superior.

"Then, of course, under the circumstances, you will not be inclined to come with me to town?"

"'Deed, and I will then.  I'd rather be with you than any man that walks.  And besides," added
Bridget shrewdly, "won't he be all the keener for doing without me a bit?"

I jumped up and marched out of the room, feeling jarred and irritated, and utterly out of sympathy.
That's the worst of being a spinster, you can never count on your companions as a continuance!
Kathie left me at the invitation of a man she had known a few months; Charmion regards me as
a narcotic to distract her thoughts from another man, and flies off the moment his memory becomes
troublesome; and now even Bridget!  Men are a nuisance.  They upset everything.

I've come to the vicarage.  When Delphine heard of our departure from "Pastimes" she developed
a sudden and violent desire to have me for a visitor for a short time before I left.  She is
nervy and depressed ("tired out after her hard work!" the dear Vicar translates it), and has
got it into her head that my society is the one and only thing that can set her right.  It
is flattering, and convenient into the bargain, for we are lending "Pastimes" to the widow
of a poor clergyman, and it will be a help to her to have me at hand until she has settled
down.  It seemed a waste of good things to leave the house empty through all the lovely autumn
months.  This poor soul is delighted to come; we are delighted to have her; the cook and housemaid
are--resigned to the change of mistress; more one cannot expect.

I've been here a week, and am already endorsing the theory that you can never really know a
person until you have lived together beneath the same roof.  Before I came, I thought the Vicar
as nearly perfect a husband as a man could be, and Delphine about as unsatisfactory a wife.
Now, after studying them for one short week, I have modified both opinions.  She is a lovable,
warm-hearted, well-meaning, weak, vain, dissatisfied child!  He is a very fine, a very noble,
a very blind, and irritatingly inconsiderate man!  On Wednesday he ordered dinner an hour earlier
for his own convenience, and he never came home at all.  On Friday he said he would be out
all day, and walked in at one o'clock, bringing three visitors in his train, demanding a hot
lunch.  He also, it appears, is difficult about money, which is not in any sense meant to imply
that he is mean, but simply that he wishes to give away as much as possible to other people,
and to deny his own household in order to be able to do it.  I was in the room one day when
Delphine presented the monthly bills, and his face was a network of worry and depression. 
The grocer's book was not included; he asked for it, and said it had been missing some time.
Delphine prevaricated.  I knew as well as if I'd been told that she was afraid to show it!

After he had gone out her mood changed.  She lifted the little red books from the table, flung
them one after the other to the ceiling, caught them with an agile hand, and sent them spinning
into the corner of the room.  This done, she danced round the table, came to a standstill in
front of my chair, and defiantly snapped her fingers.

"I--don't--care!  I don't care a snap!  I've done my best, and now I shan't worry any more.
It isn't as if it were necessary.  He could allow me more if he chose.  Why should a man stint
his wife to give the money away to outsiders?  Charity begins at home.  He expects me to manage
on a pittance, yet there must always be plenty of everything-- soup to send at a moment's notice
to anyone who is ill, puddings and jellies.  And all the stupid old bores coming to meals.
Could you keep house for this household on--"

I was startled at the smallness of the sum she mentioned; horrified when I contrasted it with
our own bills at "Pastimes."

"My dear--no!  My opinion of you has gone up by leaps and bounds if you can keep anywhere near
that.  You manage wonderfully.  I had no idea you were so clever!"

"Oh, well!" she said uncomfortably.  "Oh, well, perhaps not so clever as you think.  One gets
tired of struggling after the impossible.  In for a penny, in for a pound!  Life is too short
to worry oneself over halfpennies.  I shall tell the men to send in the books quarterly after
this.  I'm tired of being hectored every month.  Better get it over in one big dose."

I thought of the Vicar's pensive "Darling, isn't this very high?" and laughed at the idea of
"hectoring"; but the quarterly bills seemed a dangerous remedy.

"Won't your husband object?  Men hate bills to run on."

"Oh!" she waved a complacent hand, "I'll put him off.  He'll remember every now and then, and
then it will float out of his mind.  It's always an effort to Jacky to come down to mundane
things.  Evelyn, be warned by me, and never, never marry an unworldly man.  It's impossible
to live with them with any peace or comfort."

"Well, if I do, I'll see to it that he is worldly enough to understand household bills.  I'll
keep house for a month within his own limits, and let him see how he likes the fare."

Delphine stared.

"Jacky wouldn't mind.  So long as there was enough to give away, he'd eat cold meat, and mashed
potatoes, and contentment withal, every day of the week, and never complain.  I should punish
myself, not him, Evelyn." She subsided on the floor at my feet, laid her hands on my knee,
and lifted her flushed, childish face to mine.  Such a delicate rose-leaf of a face, more like
a child's than that of a grown-up woman.  "Now that you've stayed here, and seen for yourself
what it's like, truthfully, aren't you just a little sorry for me?  Week after week, month
after month, always the same routine of meeting and parish work, and keeping house.  It is
Jacky's work--his vocation; but for me, a girl of twenty-two, do you think it is quite fair?"

"I don't think you ought to ask me such questions.  I would rather not interfere," I said feebly.
I knew it was feeble, but it is a very, very delicate business to interfere between husband
and wife, and moreover the blame seemed fairly evenly divided.  The Vicar had undoubtedly made
a mistake in marrying a young girl for her beauty and charm, without considering if she were
a true helpmeet for his life's work.  Delphine had undoubtedly made a mistake in "never thinking"
of her future as a clergyman's wife; and now he was blindly expecting a miraculous transformation
of the butterfly into a drone, while the butterfly was poising her wings, impatient for flight.
I sat silent, and Delphine said pettishly:--

"I don't ask you to interfere.  Only to sympathise.  Is this a life for a girl of my age?"

"It depends entirely upon the girl and her ideas of `life'.  Some girls would--"

"What?"

"Love what you call `parish'.  Find in it her greatest interest."

She stared at me, the colour slowly mounting to her face.  Her voice dropped to a whisper.

"Yes, I know.  If I were good, and really cared!  Evelyn, I am going to confess something dreadful.
At home, when I had no responsibility, I cared far more than I do now.  I thought it would
be the other way about, but the feeling that I must do things, must go to meetings and committees,
must go to church for all the services, makes me feel that I'd rather not!  I daren't say so
to Jacky.  He'd be so grieved. I'm grieved myself.  I daren't tell anyone but you.  Do you
think any clergyman's wife ever felt the same before?"

I laughed.

"I'm sure of it!  Thousands of them.  It's not right to expect a clergyman's wife to be an
unpaid curate--plus a housekeeper, and it needs special grace to stand a succession of committees.
How would it be to drop some of the most boring duties and concentrate upon the things that
you could do with all your heart?  You'd be happier, and would do more good!"

"Do you think I should?"  She clutched eagerly at the suggestion. "Really, I believe you are
right.  As you say, I have not the strength to play the part of an unpaid curate."

But that misquotation roused me, and I contradicted her sharply.

"Excuse me!  I said nothing of the sort.  You are strong enough to do anything you chose. 
It is not strength that is wanting, but--"

"Go on!  You might as well finish, now you've begun.  But what?"

"Love!"

She gave a little gasp of astonishment.

"Love!  For whom?"

"Your neighbours.  Your husband.  God!"

"Oh, it you are going to preach next!" she cried impatiently.  She jumped up from her seat,
whirled round, and flounced from the room.

Mr Maplestone came in to tea.  He is quite a frequent visitor here I find.  Besides the fact
that he is a vicar's churchwarden, it appears that he has known Delphine since she was a child,
so that he is absolutely at home with her, and evidently very fond of her, too, in a cousinly,
elder-brotherly, absolutely matter-of-fact way.  The first time I saw him was quite early one
morning when, hearing unusual sounds of merriment from the dining-room, I opened the door,
and beheld the Vicar seated in an arm-chair, looking on with much amusement, while the Squire
held a box of chocolates in one upraised hand, and Delphine capered round him, snatching, and
leaping into the air like an excited little dog.  It was a festive little scene until my head
came peeping round the corner of the door, and then the fun collapsed like the pricking of
a bubble.  The Squire's face fell, likewise his hand; he jerked stiffly to attention, stiffly
handed over the chocolates, stiffly bowed to me, stared at my uncovered head.

"Oh, I didn't tell you!  Evelyn is staying here for a fortnight before going away."

He mumbled.  I mumbled.  The Vicar rose from his seat and made for the door.

"Well, we shall see you to lunch to-morrow, Ralph.  I have several points to discuss.  Delphine,
we shall meet at the Parish Room at twelve?"

"Oh!  That committee?  I suppose so," Delphine said ungraciously.  She tore open her box, helped
herself to the largest chocolate in the centre row, and offered me the next choice.  Ralph
Maplestone took up his hat.

"Oh, for goodness sake, don't you run away, too!  You haven't a committee.  There are heaps
of things I want to say still.  Ralph"--she went to his side and stared eagerly in his face--"did
you mean what you said the other day, about teaching me to ride?"

"Why not?" he said easily.  "If you'd care about it, I'd be only too glad.  Bess would carry
you well, and she's as safe as a house.  You could come up and practise in the park.  If I
were busy, Jevons could take you round.  He'd teach you quite as well, or better, than I should
myself."

"Oh!"--she beamed at him, a picture of happiness--"it will be fine! I've always longed to ride.
And afterwards, when I'm quite good--I feel it in my bones that I shall be good--will you still--"

He laughed good-naturedly.  He is extraordinarily good-natured to Delphine.

"Lend you Bess?  Certainly.  As often as you like.  Do her good to have the exercise."

"And when I'm very good--very good indeed--will you--"

He shook his head.

"Ah, hunting is a different matter.  Rather a responsibility.  What?  We must see what John
says.  In the meantime, you'll get a habit?"

"Yes."  She glanced at me quickly, and glanced away.  "Where shall I go? Would Matthews--"

Matthews was the local tailor.  The Squire waved aside the suggestion with masculine scorn.

"Certainly not.  Do the thing properly when you are about it.  Nothing worse than a badly-cut
habit.  Better go up to town!"

Again Delphine glanced at me.  The obvious thing was for me to return her invitation and invite
her to stay with me for the transaction, but obviously I couldn't do it.  Moreover I did not
want to, so I stared blankly before me, and resigned myself to being thought a mean thing.

"Oh, well--I'll manage somehow," Delphine said in a tone of finality, which was obviously intended
to stop the discussion.

Mr Maplestone looked at me and said:--

"Mrs Fane has already left, I believe.  I suppose you will join her later."

"I think not.  She has gone abroad.  I shall remain in England."

Delphine gave a short, irritable laugh.  I had annoyed her, and child-like, she wished to hit back.

"Abroad, and England!  That's all the address we are vouchsafed.  Mrs Fane and Miss Wastneys
evidently wish to shake off the dust of this village as soon as they drive away from `Pastimes'.
Even if we wish to communicate with them, we shall not be able to do it."

"Oh, yes, Delphine, you will," I contradicted.  "I have told you that letters will always reach
us through our lawyers."

"Lawyers!" she repeated eloquently.  "As if one could send ordinary letters in a roundabout
way like that!  I wouldn't dare to write through a lawyer, unless it were a matter of life
and death.  I must say, Evelyn, you are queer!  When we have got to know each other so well, too!"

"You thought it `queer' that Charmion and I should live here together; and now you think it
`queer' when we go away.  Isn't that a little unreasonable?"

"It is `queer' to be so mysterious about where you are going.  People ordinarily--"

"Very well, then!  We are not ordinary.  Let us leave it at that.  It is much more interesting
to be mysterious.  Perhaps we are really two authors of world-wide fame, who but ourselves
in the country for a short rest now and then between our dazzling spells of industry."

Delphine gaped, hesitated, then laughed complacently.

"Oh, well, Mrs Fane is the sort of person who might be anything.  But not you, Evelyn; certainly
not you!  You are not--"

"What?"

"Clever enough!" she cried bluntly.  The next minute, with one of the swift, child-like impulses
which made her so lovable, she threw her arms round my neck and kissed me vehemently.  "But
you are good--good and kind.  That's better than all the cleverness.  Forgive me, Evelyn; I'm
a rude, bad-tempered thing.  Kiss and be friends!"

Ralph Maplestone seized his hat and marched out of the room.

CHAPTER FIFTEEN.

A STARTLING PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE.

His afternoon the Squire, in his capacity of churchwarden, spent an hour with the Vicar in
his study, and then joined us for tea on the lawn.  It was a hot, airless, summer afternoon,
and we were all rather silent and disinclined to eat, and I felt my eyes wandering to the big
grey car which stood waiting outside the gate and wishing--many things!

I wished that I had a car of my own.  I wished I had my dear old Dinah, on whose back I had
been wont to roam the country-side.  So long as Charmion and the garden had absorbed my attention
I had been contented enough, but now an overwhelming restlessness seized me.  I was tired of
the slow movement of my own feet.  I longed to move quickly, to feel the refreshing rush of
air on my cheeks once more.  I wished the woman-hating, unappreciative Ralph Maplestone, had
been a kind, considerate, understanding, put-your-self-in-her-place sort of man, who would
have offered his time, and his car, and his services as chauffeur.

"Delphine, would you like to have a run in the car for a couple of hours or so before dinner?"

We jumped on our chairs, Delphine and I, automatically, like marionettes, the one from pleasure,
the other from surprise.  Had he seen?  Had he noticed?  The light blue eyes stared coolly
ahead.  For pure callous indifference their expression could not have been beaten. Coincidence!
Nothing more.

"Oh, Ralph, you dear!  How angelic of you!  I should love it of all things.  It's so close
and stuffy in this garden.  It will be perfectly delicious to have a blow.  Which way shall we go?"

"If you are not in a hurry we might get as far as the ponds."  He paused, frowned, glanced
hesitatingly towards me.  "Perhaps Miss Wastneys--Is there any special place you would like
to see?"

"Dearest!" the Vicar's voice broke gently into the conversation, "I'm sorry, but was not it
this afternoon you arranged to meet Mrs Rawlins at the `Hall,' to discuss the new coverings
for the library books?  I think you said half-past five.  It is nearly five now.  You would
not have time."

"I can send down word that I can't come.  I'll meet her to-morrow at the same time."

"I think not."  The Vicar's face set; his voice did not lose its gentle tone, but it was full
of decision.  "I think not.  Mrs Rawlins is a busy woman, and she has a long distance to come.
You would not wish to inconvenience her for the sake of a trifling pleasure!"

Delphine gave him a look, the look of a thwarted child, flushed to the roots of her hair, and
turned hastily aside.  Open rebellion was useless, but it spoke in every line of her body,
every movement of the small, graceful head.  I was sorry for her, for being young and feminine
myself, I could understand how dull was the claim of linen covers for injured bindings, compared
with that swift, exhilarating rush.  I looked at the Vicar, and began pleadingly, "Couldn't
I--"; then the Squire looked at me, pulled out his watch, and said sharply:--

"Ten minutes to five.  Hurry up, Delphine!  If you put on your hat at once you can have half
an hour.  It will freshen you up for your duties. I'll land you at the `Hall,' and"--he switched
his eyes on me with a keen, gimlet-like glance--"take Miss Wastneys a little further while
you are engaged."

I blinked, but did not speak; Delphine frowned; the Vicar said happily, "That will do well.
That will do very well!  Now, darling, we shall all be pleased!"

Deluded man!  Two less-pleased-looking females it would have been difficult to find, as we
made our way to the house, and up the narrow, twisting staircase.  Delphine was injured at
the prospective shortness of her drive; I was appalled at the length of mine.  Why had he asked
me?  Why hadn't I refused, and what--oh! what should we ever find to say?

"It's always the same thing; if a bit of pleasure comes along, there's bound to be a committee
meeting in the way!  Half an hour!  Pleased, indeed!  I've always been longing for Ralph to
take me drives, and now that he has been disappointed like this, the very first time, is he
likely to try again?  Of course, Evelyn" (tardy sense of hospitality!) "I am glad for you to
have the change.  It's awfully good of him."

"Quite heroic, isn't it?"  I said tartly, as I turned into my room.  No doubt the poor man
was disappointed, but she need not have rubbed it in! I leave it to psychologists to decide
whether or no there was any connection between my natural annoyance at the slight, and the
fact that I went to the trouble of opening a special box in order to put on my best and newest
motor bonnet and coat; but there it is, I did do it, and they were all the more becoming for
the accompaniment of flushed cheeks and extra bright eyes.  The colour was a soft dove grey,
the bonnet a delicious concoction of drawn silk, which looked as if it had begun life meaning
to adorn a Quaker's head, and had then suddenly succumbed to the fascinations of a pink lining
and a wreath of tiny pink roses.  When Delphine came into the room a moment later, she stopped
short on the threshold, and gasped with astonishment.

"Goodness!"  Her face flushed, she stared with wide, bright eyes; admiring, critical, disapproving,
all at once.  "Evelyn, what a get up! I never saw anything like it.  You look--you look--"

"Well!  How do I look?"

There was an edge in my voice.  She felt it, and softened at once, in her quick lovable fashion.

"You look a duck!  Simply a duck.  But, my dear, it's too good!  Why waste it here?  Any old
thing will do for these lanes.  There's time to change!"

"I don't intend to change," I said obstinately, and at that very moment there sounded an imperious
whistle from below.  Without another word we marched downstairs and out to the front gate,
where the two men stood waiting beside the car.  Automatically their eyes rolled towards my
bonnet; the Vicar smiled, and bent his head in a courtly little bow, which said much without
the banality of words.  The Squire had no expression!  Whether he approved, disapproved, or
furiously disliked, he remained insoluble as the Sphinx.  Oh, some day--somehow--some one--I
hope, will wake him into life, and whoever she is, may she shake him well up, and ride rough-shod
over him for a long, long time before she gives in!  He needs taking down!

After a faint--very faint--protest, Delphine took her seat in front, while I sat in solitary
state inside, leaning back against the cushions with an outward appearance of ease, but inwardly
uncomfortably conscious of a heart which beat more quickly than necessary.  This was all very
well, but what next?  What was to happen when the half-hour was up, and Delphine went off to
her library books and left us alone?

Could I sit still where I was?  It would seem absurd, not to say discourteous.  Would he ask
me to change seats?  Would he expect me to suggest it?  Suppose he did?  Suppose he didn't?
And when we were settled, what should I find to say?  My mind mentally rehearsed possible openings.
"How beautiful the country is looking."

"English villages are so charming."

"How was the General when you saw him last?"  On and on like a whirligig went the silly, futile
thoughts, while before me the two heads wagged, and nodded, and tossed, and a laughing conversation
was kept up with apparently equal enjoyment on both sides.  Delphine had a child's capacity
for enjoying the present; even when the car pulled up and she alighted before the door of the
"Parish Hall," the smile was still on her face.  The little treat had blown away the cobwebs;
she was refreshed and ready, if not precisely anxious, for work.

"Thanks awfully, Ralph.  That was as good as a hundred tonics!  I do think a car is a glorious
possession."  Then she looked at me and nodded encouragingly.  "Now it is your turn!  It's
ever so much more fun in front.  Ralph will be quite proud of sitting beside your bonnet!"

So after all neither of us said it, and I should never have the satisfaction of knowing if
he had meant--

He opened the door, and I meekly got out and took the other seat.  What was the use of making
a fuss?  Delphine disappeared behind the oak door, the engines whirled, and we were off again,
steaming out of the village, and down the sloping road which led to the lovely sweep of the
heath, the speed steadily increasing, until we were travelling at a good forty miles an hour.
Four milestones flashed past before either of us spoke a word; then in desperation I made a
beginning.

"She needs change, doesn't she?  It's quite touching to see how it cheers her up."

"She?" he repeated.  "Who?"  He turned his eyes on me as he spoke, and they were absolutely,
genuinely blank.  Astounding as it appeared, he really did not know.

"Delphine, of course!  Who else could I mean?"

"Oh-oh.  Yes, I had forgotten all about her."

He might have been talking of a fly that for a moment had buzzed by his side.  The cruel indifference
of his manner stung me into quick retort.

"Yet you seemed very kind--you were very kind to her a few minutes ago.  Do you always forget
so quickly?"

A movement of his hand reduced the speed of the engine.  We had left the village far behind,
and the wide high road stretched before us like a brown ribbon, sloping gently up and down
the grassy slopes.  For miles ahead there was not a soul in view.  Ralph Maplestone stared
at me and I stared back at him.  Seen close at hand, his plain face had an attraction of its
own.  It looked strong and honest; its tints were all fresh and clean, speaking of a healthy,
out-of-door life.  No little child had ever clearer eyes.  They didn't look so stern as I had
believed.

"What have I to remember?  Delphine came for a drive; I'm glad she enjoyed it, but it is over.
Why should I think of her any more?"

"Oh, no reason at all!"  I said testily.  I felt testy, as if from a personal injury.  "Only
when one has a friend, it is agreeable to believe that out of sight is not immediately out
of mind.  But, of course, I am a woman.  Women's memories are proverbially longer than men's."

The speed slackened still further.  Now we were rumbling along at a speed which made conversation
easy.  The blue eyes gave me another keen glance.

"Women burden their memories with a thousand trivialities.  Men brush them aside, and keep
to the few that count.  In the big things of life they are less forgetful than women!"

I smiled, a slow, superior smile, and spoke in a forbearing voice:--

"Do you think you--er--really understand very much about women?"

"No--I don't.  How can I?  I don't know any," he replied bluntly, and the answer was so surprisingly,
illogically different from what I expected, that involuntarily I laughed, and went on laughing
while he stammered and tried to explain.

"Of course I have my opinion--every fellow has.  One has eyes.  One can't go through life without
seeing.  But, personally, it's quite true.  I don't know any.  Never have done!"

"Your mother?"

"You would think so, but we are too much alike--tongue-tied--can't say what we feel.  She is
more at home with my sister, who chatters from morning till night, and has no reticences, no
susceptibilities.  We care for each other; to a point we are good friends, but beyond that--
strangers."

I didn't laugh any more.

"Your sister, then.  Don't you two--?"

"No.  She was educated abroad.  She married the year she came out.  She lives in Scotland.
Nominally we are brother and sister; actually the merest acquaintances.  She's a nice girl--generous,
affectionate.  But we don't touch."

"Delphine?"

"That child!"  His shoulders moved with a gesture of dismissal, as if the suggestion was too
absurd for discussion.  Poor Delphine, how her vanity would have suffered if she had been there
at the moment!  I suppose my face was expressive, for he added in quick explanation: "She's
a nice child.  I'm fond of her, but she is still waiting to grow up.  It's perfectly true,
Miss Wastneys, I know no women.  They have been a sealed book to me."

I was sorry for the big lonely thing.  It must be hard to be born with a temperament which
keeps one closed, as it were, within iron doors, while all the time the poor hungry soul longs
to get out.  I felt glad that I was made the other way round.  At the same time it seemed a
good opportunity to put in a word for my own sex.  I straightened my back, and tried to look
solemn and elderly.  I spoke in deep, impressive tones:--

"Mr Maplestone, I'm sorry, but you are illogical.  You acknowledge that this is a subject about
which you know nothing, yet almost in the same breath you criticise and condemn.  Men blame
women for having no sense of justice, but they are just as bad.  They are worse, and with less
excuse.  Women's perceptions are so keen that they see every side of a situation, so it happens
sometimes that they get confused, and appear contradictory.  Men are so blind that they only
see one side--their own side--and in utter ignorance of all the others they proceed to lay
down the law.  For my part, I prefer the woman's standpoint."

Such a blankly amazed face stared into mine!  The blue eyes widened, a glimpse of strong white
teeth showed between the parted lips.  He gaped like a child, and said vaguely:--

"Yes, but--I don't understand!  That may all be quite true, but what on earth has it got to
do with what we were talking of last?"

I bridled.  Nothing on earth is more exasperating than to enlarge on one's own pet theories,
and then to find that they have fallen flat.  I made my voice as chilling as possible.

"To me the connection seems obvious."

"Sorry.  My stupidity, I suppose.  I fail to grasp it.  Will you explain?"

"You said that Delphine was not a woman.  If that is so, it's her husband's fault--and yours!
And every other man's with whom she comes in contact.  You all treat her like a child, and
expect her to behave as a child, and then turn round and abuse her because she dances to your
tune."

"Excuse me.  Who abuses her?"

"You did.  You said--"

"I said she was a charming child of whom I was very fond.  Is that abuse?"

"In the--er--the connection in which you used it--in the way in which you said it, and meant
it, and avoided saying something else--yes, it is."

For a moment he looked as if he were going to laugh, then met my eyes, thought better of it,
and grunted instead.

"Sorry.  Again I don't quite follow.  But no doubt it is my illogical mind.  I should be interested
to know in what way you hold me responsible for Delphine's shortcomings?"

"I have just told you.  You treat her as a child who must be fed on sweetmeats, and bribed
with treats and diversions; conversationally you talk down to her level.  It never occurs to
you to expect her to be in earnest about any one thing."

"Well?"

"Well!  Isn't that enough?  Can't you see how such an attitude must affect her character and
development?"

"No, I can't.  To my mind it wouldn't matter what the whole world thought.  For good or ill,
I stand for myself.  What other people happened to think about me wouldn't affect me one jot."

I said loftily:--

"You are a man.  Women are different.  We do care.  We are affected. That's why it is so dreadfully
important that we should be understood. I know it by experience.  In different surroundings,
with different people, I myself am two or three totally different women--"

He asked no questions, but looked at me, silent, expectant, and lured by that fatal love of
talking about oneself which exists in so many feminine hearts, I fell into the trap, and prattled
thoughtlessly on:--

"At home with my younger sister, I was the one who had all the responsibility and management.
She depended on me.  I was the Autocrat of the Household, and everything I said was law."

"You would like that?"

I gave him a withering glance.

"Pray what makes you think so?"

"You like your own way, don't you?  I--er--I have received that impression."

"I was about to add," I said coldly, "that, since I have lived at `Pastimes,' I have not had
my own way at all.  I have not wanted it. Mrs Fane's character is stronger than mine.  I have
been content to abdicate in her favour.  If you asked her opinion of me, she would probably
tell you that I was too pliable--too easily influenced."

Silence.  The blunt, roughly-hewn profile stared stolidly ahead.  A granite wall would have
shown as much expression.  I was seized with an immense, a devastating curiosity to discover
what he was thinking.  I fixed my eyes steadily upon him, mentally willing him to turn round.

He knew I was doing it.  I could see the red rise above his collar rim, and mount steadily
to his ears.

He was determined that he would not speak.  I was equally determined that he should.

"Mr Maplestone!  I am waiting for a remark."

"Miss Wastneys, I--er--I have no remark to make."

"You don't recognise me in the latter role?"

"I--er--I can't say that I do!  On the few occasions on which we have met, you have appeared
to me to be abundantly--er--to be, in short, the ruling spirit."

I thought of that first interview in the inn when the brunt of the bargaining had fallen on
me; I thought of the tragic evening at the "Hall," when I had arranged a hurried departure,
without apparently consulting Charmion's wishes.  Appearances were against me, and it was impossible
to explain them away.  I said, in a cross, hurt voice:--

"Oh, of course, you think me everything that is disagreeable and domineering.  It is just as
I said--men see only one thing, and it colours their whole view.  If I lived a lifetime of
meekness and self-abnegation, you would never forget that affair of the lease.  And it was
your own fault, too!  You were the unreasonable one, not I; but all the same, you have never
forgiven.  Delphine told me how much you disliked me."

His eyes met mine, frankly, without a flicker of shame.

"Did she?  That was wrong of her.  She had no business to repeat--"

"You acknowledge it, then!  You did say so?"

"I did.  Oh, yes.  It's quite true."

It was a shock.  At that moment I realised that, in my vanity, I had never really believed
Delphine's statement.  The Squire had made some casual remark which she had misunderstood,
misquoted--such had been the subconscious explanation with which I had assuaged my complacency;
but now out of his own lips, openly, unhesitatingly, the verdict was confirmed!  I felt as
if a pail of water had been emptied over my head.

"And you--you really meant--"

"If I had not meant it, I should hardly have said--"

"I can't think why!  What had I done?  If it was that affair of the lease--"

"It was not.  I was amazed at the time, but I got over that.  It was just--"

"What?"

"It is difficult to say.  It's not an easy subject to discuss.  Need we go on?"

"I think so.  I think it is my right.  In justice to myself, I think you ought to tell me how
I have made myself so disagreeable.  It might be useful to me in the future!"

For all answer he steered the car to the side of the road, brought it to a standstill, and
descended from his seat.  There was an air of deliberation about the proceeding which sent
a shiver down my spine. The inference was that the enumeration of my faults was so lengthy
a business that it could not be undertaken by a man who had other work in hand.  I sat in nervous
fascination, watching him slowly cross to my side of the car, lean forward, and place both
hands on the screen.  His face was quite close to mine.  It looked suddenly white and tense.
He opened his lips and spoke:--

"Evelyn, will you be my wife?"

If I live to be a hundred, never--no, never shall I forget the electric shock of that moment!
To be prepared to listen to a lecture on one's faults and failings, and to hear in its place
a proposal of marriage-- could anything be more paralysing?  And to have it hurled at one with
no warning, no preliminary "leading up," and from Ralph Maplestone of all people--the most
reserved, the most unsusceptible, the most woman-hating of mankind!  I sat petrified, unable
to move or to speak, unable to do anything but stare, and stare, and stare, and listen with
incredulous ears to a string of passionate protestations.  Half of what he said was lost in
the dazed bewilderment of the moment, but what I did hear, went something like this:--

"You are the first woman--the only woman.  Before you came I was content.  Since we met, I
have been in torment.  You woke me up.  When a man is roused from a trance it gives him pain.
You brought pain to me-- sleeplessness, discontent, a craving that grew and grew.  I wished
we had never met--you had upset my life; I believed that I hated you for it.  Delphine questioned
me.  It was then I told her that I disliked you.  I meant it--I thought I meant it!  I longed
for you to disappear and leave me in peace, yet all the time I thought of you more and more.
Your smile!  Whenever we met, you smiled, and the remembrance of it followed me home.  Wherever
I went your face haunted me.  I planned to go away, to travel, to break myself loose; but it
was no use, I could not go.  I dreaded to see you, but I dreaded more to go away.  I hung about
the places you might pass.  That dress with the flounces!  I could see the blue of it coming
toward me through the branches.  That night you were ill!  All the colour went out of your
cheeks.  I would have given my life--my life!  I have never loved before.  I did not know what
love meant, but you have taught me.  You have waked me from sleep.  I'm not good enough--a
surly brute!  Couldn't expect any girl to care; but for seven years--twice seven years--I'd
serve, I'd wait.  Oh, my beautiful, my beautiful--if you could see yourself!  How can I stay
here, and let you go?  Marry me!  Marry me!  This week, to-morrow--what are conventions to
us?  I'll be good to you.  All the love of my life is waiting--I've never squandered it away.
It has been stored up in my heart for you."

I held up my hand, imploring him to stop.

"Oh, Mr Maplestone, don't!  It's all a mistake.  It must be!  How can you care?  You know so
little of me; we have met so seldom.  How can you possibly know that you would like me as a wife?"

He gave a quick, excited laugh.

"It's all true what those poet fellows write about love!  I used to laugh and call it nonsense;
but when it comes to one's own turn, it's the truest thing in the whole world!  How do I know?
I can't tell you, Evelyn; but I do know.  It's just the one certain fact in life.  I want you!
I'm going to have you!"

He stretched out his arms as if to seize me then and there, and I shrank back, looking, I suppose,
as I felt, frightened to death, for instantly his manner changed, his arms dropped to his side,
and he cried in the gentlest, softest of tones:--

"Don't be frightened of me!  Don't be frightened!  Forgive me if I seem rough.  Rough to you!
Oh, my sweet, give me a chance to show what I could be!  You have done enough caring for other
people; now let me take care of you!  Be my wife, Evelyn!"

It was all too painful and miserable, and--yes, too beautiful to put into words.  I cried,
and said, No! no!  I was sorry, but I didn't love him; I had never thought.  There was no one
else--oh, no; but it was hopeless all the same.  I could never--never--Oh, indeed, I was not
worth being miserable about.  He must forget me.  On Wednesday I was going away.  He would
find when I was not there that he would soon forget.

He looked at me with sad, stern eyes.

"That's not true!  You know it's not true.  I am not the sort to forget. And if there is no
one else, why should I try?  Evelyn, you don't know me, if you think one `no' will put me off.
I said I would wait seven years, and I meant what I said.  If you go away, I shall follow.
What's this nonsense of leaving no address?  Do you imagine, if I choose to look for you, you
can hide yourself from ME?"

He looked so big and masterful that for a moment I felt a qualm of doubt; then I comforted
myself with the reflection that it would be impossible to discover what did not exist.  For
a period of time Evelyn Wastneys was about to disappear from the face of the earth.  The spinster
of the basement flat was about to take her place.

"I don't love you!  I don't love you!"  I repeated helplessly.  "I have never once thought
of you except as a--a rather cross, overbearing man who had taken a dislike to me at first
sight.  How can I turn round all in a moment and look upon you as a--a lover?  And I have my
friend and my work--and we have just taken our house.  I don't want to be married! I couldn't
be married even if I cared!"

"You are going to be married.  You are going to marry me!  What is this `work' of which you
talk?  A woman's work is to make a home, and to help a man to find his soul.  Evelyn, do you
imagine for one moment that I am going to let you go?"

He was himself again: self-confident, resolute, overbearing.  I took refuge in silence, and
argued no more.

"Have you enjoyed your drive?"  Delphine asked.  "Was Ralph civil?  It was unfortunate that
I had to leave you alone.  Where did you buy your bonnet, Evelyn?  I must get one like it for
myself.  Does your head ache, dear?  You look quite pale."

I said it did.  Something ached!  It kept me awake all night with a dreary, heavy pain.  I
lay and thought, and thought, until my brain was in a whirl.  Had I been to blame in the past?
Honestly I could not see that I had.  What was I to do in the future?  Must I tell Charmion?
How could I ever return to "Pastimes"?  Round and round the questions whirled in a never-ending
circle, but no solutions came.  Then I said my prayers, with a special plea for guidance for
a very lonely, very worried girl, and gradually, surely, I grew calmer.  I reminded myself
that there was no need to worry over the future; and that all I had to do for the moment was
to decide on my duty for to-morrow.  For everybody's sake it appeared best that I should excuse
myself to Delphine and escape to town, since nothing could be gained by another interview with
Ralph Maplestone.  I would send him a letter, repeating my protestations that I could never
be his wife, and begging him to forget me with all possible speed.  When he called at the Vicarage
to answer it, he would find that the bird had fled.

The early morning sunlight was stealing in at the window.  I closed my tired eyes and fell asleep.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN.

A GLORIOUS THING.

The first day after taking possession of my flat, I paid a visit to a celebrated expert in
theatrical "make up," and paid for his help and advice.  It is not an easy thing for a young
woman to transform herself into an old one, and I have a weakness for doing a thing well, when
I set about it.  He was a delightful man!  I remember him with the liveliest appreciation.
I was nervous and embarrassed, but in two minutes he put me at my ease.  From his manner you
would have supposed that my errand was as ordinary and conventional as buying a postage stamp,
while his keenness, his cleverness, his professional zest were refreshing to behold.  He stared
at, and criticised my face, with as much impersonality as if it had been a picture on the wall.

"Always look for the predominant factor--the feature, or features, which give personality to
the face.  In your case they are undoubtedly the eyebrows and the curve of the upper lip. 
A few judicious touches to these will alter the whole expression to a surprising extent.  A
few more lines will give age.  The wig and spectacles are the refuges of the amateur.  In themselves
they can do little, but with the touches I suggest, and a deep-toned powder to darken the skin,
your disguise will be complete.  You shall see--you shall see!"

He motioned to a chair before a mirror, and set to work, explaining each detail as he went
along.  It was marvellous to see how beneath the sweep of a tiny brush my youth and good looks
faded and disappeared!  Then he made me wash it all off, and do the same thing for myself.
Three times over the process was repeated before I "passed" to his satisfaction.  To my relief
he laughed at the idea of the india-rubber pads, and indeed they were no longer required, but
he gave me a small appliance which could be used when I especially desired to alter my voice.
Then he sent me to a woman expert, who designed a nice little pad to round my shoulders.  I
can't say that it was exactly a hilarious afternoon!  And now a month has passed by.  For a
whole month Mary Harding has resolutely ignored Evelyn Wastneys, and devoted her time to the
service of others.  I was just going to say "her whole thought" also, but stopped short just
in time.  The plain truth is that the ignoring of Evelyn engrosses many thoughts.  She is a
regular Jack-in-the-box, who is no sooner shut in, than up bobs her head again, wailing miserably:--

"I'm lonely!  I'm lonely!  I want to go home!"  Then Mary, the aunt, snaps the lid more tightly
than ever, but through the chink a persistent whisper makes itself heard: "I'm lonely!  I'm
lonely!  I want some one to think of me."

The flat is comfortable enough, and I am well served with Bridget as housekeeper, and a clean
young orphan of seventeen to work under her and open the door.  The orphan was procured as
much as a safety-guard for myself, as an assistant to Bridget.  In case anyone who knows me
in my true role should by any possibility discover my hiding-place, and appear suddenly at
the door, it is better to keep Bridget in the background, and as Emily knows me only in the
character of aunt, I am necessarily kept up to the mark in the matter of disguise.

I wear elderly clothes, tinted spectacles, and a dowdy wig, and with a few touches alter the
shape of my upper lip.  That is all that is necessary for ordinary life.  The cheek pads are
reserved for occasions of special need!  Emily considers me a "nice old lady, and young in
my ways".  She likewise confides to Bridget that she shouldn't wonder if I'd been quite good-looking
in my day.  Why did I never marry?  Was it a disappointment like?

In outdoor dress especially I look genuinely middle-aged.  Young women get up in the Tubes
and offer me their seats!  Volumes could say no more.

As regards my work, I have discovered that in London it is as difficult to get to know one's
neighbours as it is to avoid knowing them in the country.  In my rustic ignorance I had imagined
that all the inhabitants of the "Mansions" would be keenly interested in the advent of a new
tenant, and curious about her personality.  I imagined them talking together about me, and
saying, "Have you seen the new lady in the basement?  What does she look like?  When shall
you call?" but in reality no one cared a jot.  There has been another removal since I came,
and I overheard one or two comments in the hall.  "Bother these removals.  They make such a mess!"

"Those tiresome vans block the way for my pram!"  Not one word of interest in the removal itself!
Not one word of inquiry as to the newcomers.  So far as interest or sympathy went, each little
shut-in-dwelling is as isolated as a lighthouse.  For the past few weeks I have been haunted
by a vision of myself beating an ignominious retreat, after having altogether failed in my
mission.  To console myself I began a second course of Red Cross training, to revive what I
had learnt two years before.  Perhaps some day one of the tenants will be ill, or have an accident,
which will give me a chance.  Watching the stream of children coming in and out of the "Mansions,"
I almost found it in my heart to wish that one of them would tumble down and break, not his
crown, but just some minor, innocent, little bone, so that his mother could behold how promptly
and efficiently I could render first aid!

A month passed by--four long, lonely weeks.  Not a line from Charmion. Not a line from Delphine.
Not a line from the big, blustering lover who had vowed never, no, never, to give up the pursuit.
With one and all, out of sight was apparently out of mind, and I am the sort of woman who needs
to be remembered and appreciated, and who feels reduced to the lowest ebb when nobody takes
any notice.  I wondered what Charmion was doing, I wondered how Delphine was faring, I wondered--did
he really care so much?  Would he go on caring?  Suppose I had cared, too?  Then another long,
lonely day came to an end, and I crawled into bed and cried.  Whatever my virtues may be, I
am afraid I am not strong-minded!

But at the end of a month--hurrah!  I started full tilt into a new and engrossing profession,
a profession which I may really claim to have invented, and which offers a wide field for idle
women.  It is healthy, moreover, and in its pursuit its followers can be of immense service
to their overtaxed sisters.  The vocation is called "Pram-Pushing for Penurious Parents," and
it consists simply of taking charge of Tommy, or Bobby, or Baby for his morning or afternoon
promenade, and thereby setting his mother free to take a much-needed rest!

The way it began was natural enough.  I smiled at a pretty baby in the hall, and the baby smiled
back at me, and threw a ball at my feet.  I picked it up, and gave it back to a worried-looking
little mother who was endeavouring to arrange the wrapping in the perambulator with one hand,
while with the other she clutched firmly at the arm of an obstreperous person of three.  She
smiled at me in wan acknowledgment, and I said, "May I help?" and tucked in one side of the
shawl.  Two mornings later I met the same trio returning from their morning's walk, a third
time I picked the small boy out of a puddle, and helped to wipe off the mud.  That broke the
ice, and the mother began to bow to me, and to exchange a passing word.  She is a delicate
creature, and has the exhausted air of one whose life is all work and no play.  One day we
walked the length of the block together, and she told me that she had been married for four
years, had had three children and lost one; that she kept only one maid, and so had to take
the children out herself.  It was tiring work, pram-pushing for four or five hours a day, but
they must have fresh air.  Nowadays doctors insisted that children should never stay in, even
on wet days.  She smiled mirthlessly.

"They are covered up and protected from damp.  It's different for the poor mothers!"

She coughed as she spoke, and then and there the great idea leapt into my head.  I did not
disclose it; she would probably have put me down for a baby-snatcher at once; but I made a
point of meeting her on her daily outings, and of ingratiating myself with the children, and
waited eagerly for an opportunity, which came in the shape of an increasing cough and cold.
Then I pounced.

"Why shouldn't I take the children out this afternoon, and let you go home and rest?  You are
not fit to push this heavy pram."

She gaped at me, amazed and embarrassed.

"You?  Oh, I couldn't possibly!  Why should you--"

"Because I should love it.  I have nothing to do, and the days seem so long.  I'd be very careful."

"Oh, it's not that!  I am sure you would!  And the children would love it.  They are so fond
of you already; but--"

"Well?"

"I couldn't!  It is too much.  But I do thank you all the same.  It's sweet of you to have
thought of it!"

For the moment it was plainly tactless to urge her further, so I just repeated:--

"Well, I mean it!  Please send for me if you change your mind," and retreated forthwith.

Behold the reward of diplomacy.  That very evening Mr Manners, the papa, knocked at my door
and requested to see Miss Harding.  I was reading comfortably, sans wig and sans spectacles,
behind the locked door of my bedroom.  The little maid, having been repeatedly instructed that
all callers were to be shown into the drawing-room, was no doubt elated to have an opportunity
of turning precept into practice.  I arose, hastily made myself look as elderly and discreet
as possible, and sallied forth to greet him.

It was the funniest interview!  He had brought down a copy of Punch (a week old), with his
wife's compliments "in case I should like to see it".  That was the excuse; the real reason
was obviously to survey the extraordinary spinster of the basement flat, and discover if she
were quite mad or just innocently eccentric.  I could see him peering at me out of his tired,
worried eyes, and if ever I worked hard to worm myself into a man's good graces, I did it during
the next half-hour.

I pricked my ears, listening for "clues," and when one came, I played up to it with all my
skill, agreeing with him, soothing him, hanging on his words.  He looked almost as tired as
his wife; there were shiny patches on his coat; his hair was turning white above the ears;
he had the look of a man driven beyond his strength.  I made him a cup of coffee, good coffee!
over which he sighed appreciatively.  I told him I liked the smell of smoke.  I offered him
the Spectator in exchange for Punch. At the end of half an hour he was looking at me wistfully,
and saying in quite a natural, boyish voice:--

"I say, it was nailing good of you to offer to take out the kiddies to save my wife.  She was
quite touched.  She does need a rest, poor girl, but, of course--"

"Don't say `of course' you cannot accept!  The only `of course' is to take me at my word. 
Mr Manners, may I say exactly what I think?"

He looked startled and said, "Please do!"  (Mem.  I must try to remember that an impulsive
manner is not suitable to grey hairs!)

"Well, it's just this; if you won't allow me to help your wife to have a little rest now, she
will be obliged to take a longer one later on! That cough needs care.  I know something about
nursing, and I'm sure that if she goes on as she is doing now, she'll break down altogether."

"I know it," he said miserably.  "I've been feeling the same myself. That was why--to-night--when
she told me, I--"

"Came down to see for yourself if I could be trusted!"  I said laughing. "And what is your
verdict, Mr Manners?  Do I look as if I would kidnap babies?  Do I look as if I had strength
enough to push a pram?"

He glanced at my grey locks, and said tactfully:--

"Bobby could walk part of the time.  Kensington is fortunately flat. Miss Harding, I--I am
very grateful.  It's most awfully good of you to worry about such perfect strangers.  If you
will relieve my wife for a few days, I shall be most awfully grateful!"

So it was arranged.  I danced a jig of joy when I went back to my room, and caught sight of
my elderly reflection doing it in the glass, and laughed till I cried.  My work had begun.
The thin end of the wedge had wormed its way in.  Now to push forward.

Mrs Manners has another malady besides her cough.  It's an obscure disease, but I have diagnosed
it as "chronic inflammation of the conscience".  For four long years she has been kept incessantly
at work, looking after house and children, and has been unable to have one undisturbed hour,
either by day or by night.  Now, when she gets the chance, her conscience is horrified at the
prospect.  The first time I took the children for their afternoon walk I found, on my return,
that she had used the time to turn out a cupboard, and looked more tired than ever.  The next
day I sent the maid downstairs to settle the children in the perambulator, when I produced
a hot-water bottle from under my coat, and had a heart to heart talk with her there and then.

"Mrs Manners, I am going to take you into your bedroom, tuck you up under the quilt, give you
this hot-water bottle to cuddle, pull down the blinds, and leave you to rest there till we
come in."

She positively shook with horror.

"Oh, Miss Harding, I can't.  It is quite impossible!  All that time? If you knew all I have
to do.  There is another cupboard--"

"Mrs Manners, if you think I am taking charge of the children out of consideration for your
cupboards, you are mistaken.  I am doing it so that you may rest.  A bargain is a bargain,
and you are not playing fair.  Now, are you coming, or are you not?"

She came, not daring to refuse, but protesting all the way.

"Well, if I must--For a little time.  For half an hour.  I couldn't possibly rest more than
half an hour."

"You've got to try.  If I'm on duty for two hours, so are you.  Don't dare to move from this
bed till I give you leave."

It was pathetic to see her thin little face peering at me over the edge of the eider-down,
quite dazed, if you please, at the idea of a two hours' rest!  I felt as happy as a grig as
I ran downstairs; happier still when we re-entered the flat two hours later, and not a sound
came from behind that closed door.  I undressed the children, and the maid tiptoed in with
their tea with the air of a conspirator in a dark and stealthy plot.

"Not a sound out of her since you left!  Poor thing!  First chance of a bit of peace and quietness
she's had for many a long day."

"Well, Mary, you and I are going to give her plenty more!"  I said graciously, and Mary made
me a slice of buttered toast on the spot to seal the partnership.

Tea was over when the door opened, and a sleepy, flushed face peeped round the door to look
at the clock.  When she saw the hands pointing to five, she looked as guilty as if she had
robbed the bank.

Oh, it's a glorious thing to be able to help other people!  It gives one a warm, glowey feeling
about the heart which comes in no other way. These last days I have just lived for the moment
when I could tuck that poor little woman in her cosy bed, and the other moment when I saw her
rested, freshened face on rising.  Even at the end of one week she looked a different creature,
and felt it too.

"Actually, dear Miss Harding, I begin to feel as if I--I should like a new hat!" she said to
me one day over tea.  "Do you know the feeling?  I think it is the best sign of convalescence
a woman could have.  For months, almost for years, I have not cared what I wore.  Something
to cover my head--that was all that was needed.  To be always tired-- deadly, hopelessly tired--takes
the spirit out of one."

"No one should go on being too tired.  It's very wrong to allow it."

She looked at me; a long look, affectionate, grateful, reproachfully amused.

"My dear, you live alone, and you have two maids.  Evidently--excuse me--you have a comfortable
income.  My husband's business has been steadily falling off for the last two years.  It is
not his fault; he works like a horse; no man could have done more, but circumstances have been
against him.  We keep one maid, who washes, bakes, and cooks, while I tend the babies, make
their clothes and my own, knit, and mend, and patch, and darn, take the children out, bathe
them, put them to bed, attend to them through the night, do the housekeeping by day, and struggle
over the bills when they are in bed.  Bobby is three years and a half old, and has had bronchitis
and measles.  Baby is eleven months, and cuts her teeth with croup.  Between them came the
little one who died.  And then you sit there and tell me I ought not to be tired!"

"I beg your pardon.  I'm sorry.  I spoke without thinking.  You are quite right--I know nothing
about it.  People who preach to others very often don't.  Forgive me!"

"Don't be so penitent!  It is really almost a relief to meet a woman who doesn't understand.
All my friends are in pretty much the same case as myself, and they haven't got"--she stretched
out her hand and timidly patted my arm--"my kind neighbour to help.  Miss Harding, I think
you must have been a fascinating girl!"

"Oh, I was!"  I said warmly, and then made haste to change the conversation.  "What about that
hat?  I'm quite a good amateur milliner. Look out your oddments and let me see what I can do."

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.

NEIGHBOURS--AND REAL WORK.

The fame of me has gone abroad.  I have been observed taking the Manners' infants in and out,
and the result has been a simultaneous increase of interest, and--loss of prestige.  Number
22, like Mrs Manners, pushes her own "pram," but there the resemblance ends.  She is a healthy,
full-blown young woman, smartly--and unsuitably--attired in the very latest fashion of Kensington
High Street.  She wears large artificial pearls round her neck, and wafts a strong odour of
lily of the valley perfume.  Never for the fraction of a second did it occur to me to offer
to relieve her of any of her duties; but she cast a pale-blue eye at me, and wove her own little
schemes.  One afternoon, as I was tucking the coverings round Baby Margaret's feet, she came
up to my side, and said in an exceedingly casual manner:--

"Oh, good afternoon.  You are Miss Harding?  I was just wondering--have you any engagement
for the mornings?"

I looked at her calmly, and said I had.  Several!  Most householders had.  She jerked her head,
and said impatiently:--

"I didn't mean that.  You take Mrs Manners' children out, I see.  I might be glad of a little
help myself.  It's such a bore pram-pushing every day.  How much do you charge?"

It is difficult to look haughty through blue spectacles, and while I was trying, it occurred
to me that it was a waste of time.  It was a plain business question.  She did not mean to
be insulting, so I smiled instead--rather feebly, I confess--and said:--

"I don't charge.  Mrs Manners is not well.  It is a pleasure to me to take charge of the children,
so that she may have a little rest."

She "begged pardon" hastily, and with repetition, staring the while with incredulous eyes.
Quite evidently she considered me a benevolent lunatic, and marked me down as a useful prey.
I might not be willing to push her pram, but--The very next evening a small servant knocked
at the door with Mrs Lorrimer's compliments, and could Miss Harding lend her a fresh egg? 
(Her name is Lorrimer, and the children are called Claudia, Moreen, and Eric, and look it.)
A fortnight has passed since that encounter, and the tale of her indebtedness to me is now
as follows:--

One egg.

A cup of sugar.

Two lemons.

"A bit of butter, as we're run out."

A box of matches and a candle.

"One scuttle of nice cobbles, please.  We have only slack left."

Three stamps.

"Just a pinch or two of tea, as we forgot to order over Sunday."

Bridget opines that it will go from bad to worse, and recommends putting a foot down.  Gossip
from the "Well" has it that if you "give in to them, they'll take the very dinner off the table".
When it comes to that point, I shall certainly stamp hard; but in the meantime I let things
slide.  I suspect Mrs Lorrimer of being too much engrossed in herself to trouble about such
a detail as providing meals for her spouse.  Without my aid he would probably have eaten his
pancakes without any lemons, and feasted on dry bread by a smouldering fire.  I like myself
in the role of an unknown benefactor!

Number 19, who lives directly overhead, does not borrow my food or hire my services, but she
does something far worse.  Whenever I dare to poke a fire, or play on the piano, or shut a
window, or let a door bang, as any ordinary domestic door is bound to bang in the course of
a windy day, rap, rap, rap comes a premonitory knocking on the floor, as if to say, "Inconsiderate
and selfish worm!  How dare you attend to your own comfort at the expense of your neighbours
overhead?  Have the goodness to be quiet at once!"  It's awfully unfair, because when they
stoke their anthracite stoves, or throw their boots on the floor at 1 a.m. over my sleeping
head, I could only retaliate by climbing to the top of my wardrobe, and knocking the whitewash
off my own ceiling.  Such are the ironies of life for the tenants of basement flats.

Besides the shoe-dropping, I am often kept awake at night by the sound of angry voices.  I
sadly fear that Mr and Mrs 19 do not live together in the peace and harmony which could be
desired.  Subjects of dissension seem generally to arise about 10 p.m., and thereafter deep
masculine growls and shrill feminine yaps alternate until the small hours.  On these occasions
I make up my mind never, never to marry.  Especially a bad-tempered man.  Especially one bad-tempered
man!  But, of course, that question was settled long ago.

Hurrah!  I am getting on.  A most exciting thing has happened.  The Manners know Mr Thorold,
and last night, when I was sitting with then after dinner (by request!) he came in to call,
and we were introduced. He is a delicate, wearied-to-death, and wish-I-were-out-of-it-looking
man, but when he smiles or gets interested his face lights up, and he is handsome and interesting.
He looked profoundly bored at finding me installed by the fire, but thawed later on, and asked
my advice on various domestic problems which lie heavily on his soul.

"My housekeeper has such sensitive feelings.  If I find fault, or even mildly suggest an improvement,
she collapses into tears, and the children have a poor time of it for the rest of the day.
Sometimes I think I must send her away, but I might get some one worse; and I am busy in the
city, and have no time to look round."

I did not feel capable of giving advice on this subject, but said soothingly:--

"I wish you would allow the little girls to come to tea with me sometimes.  I have seen them
coming in and out, and have longed to know them.  I'm fond of children, and Mrs Manners will
tell you that I can be trusted."

His face lit up; he actually beamed.

"It is good of you!  They get so few changes.  It would be the greatest treat!  If I may I'll
bring them myself next Saturday."

Shades of Aunt Eliza!  For a moment I felt quite guilty; then I raised my eyes to the Chippendale
mirror hanging on the opposite wall, and beheld the douce figure of Miss Harding with a Paisley
shawl draped over her black silk shoulders, and I breathed again, and said primly that I should
be very pleased, and were the dear little ones allowed currants, or were they limited to plain
sponge cake?  He said impatiently:--

"Oh, poor kiddies!  Anything you like.  If they're ill afterwards, it's worth it.  I'm afraid
I am not much of a disciplinarian, Miss Harding. Life takes that role out of one's hands. 
Let them be happy--that's what I ask."

His face puckered; he looked so sad, so helpless, so baffled, poor, big, helpless thing, that
my heart just ached for him.  Aunt Eliza was right--Evelyn Wastneys is not a suitable person
to play good fairy to good-looking widowers!  If this one looked particularly helpless and
harassed for an hour at a stretch, and then asked her to marry him on Tuesday week, she would
not have the strength of mind to say no, however much she dreaded the prospect.  As he is a
susceptible, appealing type of a man, and tired to death of that housekeeper, and Evelyn has--she
really has!--a "way with her," it would probably have come to that in the end.  But Evelyn
Harding may serenely do her best.  She will never be put to the test.

The little girls are called Winifred and Marion.  They have long pale faces, long fair hair,
and charming dark-lashed eyes.  Winifred looks delicate, and has an insinuating little lisp;
Marion, when amused, has a deep, fat chuckle, which makes one long to hug her on the spot.
They are badly dressed, badly shod, their stockings lie in wrinkles all the way up, but they
look thorough little ladies despite of all, and "behave as sich".  They came to tea on Saturday,
and we had hot scones, and jam sandwiches, and cake, and biscuits, and a box of crackers containing
gorgeous rings and brooches and tie-pins and bracelets, and of the whole party I honestly believe
"Father" enjoyed himself the most.  He had four cups of tea, and ate steadily from every plate;
and we all played games together afterwards, in the most happy, domestic fashion.  Quite evidently
he is a home lover, a man whose deepest interests will always centre round his own fireside.

Poor little dead wife!  It seems sad that she should be taken away, while unhappy women like
Mrs 19 live on and on.  If the issues of life and death were in mortal hands, how differently
we should arrange things!  I know at this moment half a dozen weary old creatures whose lives
are no pleasure to themselves or to anyone else, but they live on, while the young and the
happy fall by the way.  Oh, how many mysteries there are around us!  How wonderful, how absorbingly
interesting it will be, when the time comes, to hear the explanation of all that seems so tangled
to our present understanding!  When I realise how uncertain life is, I am all in a tingle to
be up and doing, to make myself of real, real use while I am still here.  A married woman has
her work cut out to make a home; a real happy home is as big an achievement as any one can
wish, but when one is single and lonely--

Pause to shed a few self-pitying tears.  Pause to wonder if it might not be better to make
a man happy rather than to live alone, even if one were not really in love?

Pause to decide.  Certainly not!  Don't be weak-minded.  A grave injustice to him, as well
as to yourself.

Pause to dream of Charmion and Kathie, and feel lone and lorn because they don't write.

Grand decision.  Always to be kind and considerate.  To write regularly to lonely friends.
Never to wax cross or impatient, neglect a duty, nor fail to render a service.  To devote special
attention and lavish special sympathy on spinsters in basement flats.

The orphan came into the room just as I was in the full flush of my resolutions.  I snapped
her head off, and found fault for five minutes on end.  She departed--in tears.

Three weeks have passed by.  I have written to Charmion, a letter full of love, and without
one complaining word.  I have written to Kathie, taking an interest in all the details of her
new life; I have written to Delphine, dropping words in season.  I have worked hard for the
Red Cross classes.  I have wheeled out the small Manners, and dispensed various teas to Winifred
and Marion Thorold.  I have met their father several times at the Manners' flat, and have likewise--low
be it spoken--received two evening calls from him in my own domain.  He says it is such a comfort
to find a kind, motherly woman with whom to talk over his difficulties!  He hesitates to trouble
Mrs Manners, who is already overworked.  Winifred holds one shoulder a little higher than the
other.  Does that mean anything wrong with the spine?  Ought she to lie down flat?  Billie,
the curly two-year-old, is always catching cold. Do I think his perambulator gets damp in the
basement store-room?  The grocer's bill was nineteen shillings last week.  In "my girl's time"
(I love to hear him say "My girl!") it was never above thirteen.  Miss Brown, the housekeeper,
is hinting that she needs a holiday.  It would be a relief to be rid of her, but--who would
take charge while she was away?

"Why not make it a general holiday?  Lend me the little girls, farm out the babies to relations,
throw off responsibilities, and have a real laze yourself.  You know you would love it!"  I
said.  "Haven't you a man friend who would take you away?"

"Oh, rather.  The best of fellows.  We were boys together.  He's had a stiff time, too, so
he understands.  Miss Harding, what a brick you are! Will you really take the girls?  I say"--his
face lit up with the boyish smile--"it would be a chance to buy them some clothes.  Would you
do it?  Miss Brown has no taste.  It's been one of my trials.  My girl was so dainty.  A pretty
hat apiece, and a frock, and stockings to match--that wouldn't break the bank, would it?  Do
you think five pounds--"

I waved a protesting hand.

"Heaps!  Heaps!  Leave it to me.  I'll make them as pretty as pictures. When--er--when I was
young, I was fond of dress.  I was considered to have good taste."

He smiled at me in the kind, forbearing manner in which people do smile at elderly women who
exploit their own youth, and said vaguely:--

"Yes, I am sure--I am quite sure.  Well, I must be off.  Thank you for all your kindness."

He departed, but the very next night the maid brought a message to ask if Miss Harding had
a thermometer.  If so, would she be so very kind as to take Billie's temperature, as he seemed
restless and feverish?  I draped myself in the Paisley shawl in which I flatter myself I look
my plainest and most ancient, ran upstairs, and was shown into Billie's bedroom.  He was sitting
up in his cot, looking so pretty with his dishevelled golden curls, his big bright eyes, and
the fever flush on his cheeks.  I guessed 102 at sight; but it was worse than that--close on
103.  I gave the thermometer the professional shake, looking, as I felt, pretty serious and
troubled, whereupon Miss Brown took alarm at once, being evidently the useful kind of woman
who loses her head in illness.

"Is he going to be ill?  I don't understand poultices and fomentations; couldn't take the responsibility!
As things are, there is more work than I can get through.  I hope you will tell Mr Thorold
that if Billie is going to be ill, it is absolutely necessary to have help."

I calmed her, and went into the dining-room to report.  The air was full of smoke, and Mr Thorold
was sitting at one side of the fireplace, talking to another man who was facing him from another
big leather chair.  They both sprang up at my entrance, and Mr Thorold said:--

"This is my friend, Mr Hallett, of whom I spoke to you lately.  We are discussing the possibility
of a short trip.  Edgar, this is Miss Harding, a very kind neighbour.  She has come up on an
errand of mercy to see one of the babies, who is a bit off colour.  How do you find the small
man, Miss Harding?"

He was not a bit anxious.  In the interest of the talk with an old friend, the baby ailment
had faded from his mind.  I hated to bring the shadow to his face, but it had to be done.

"Billie has a high temperature, Mr Thorold.  I think a doctor ought to see him."

He looked shocked--incredulous.

"To-night!  Wouldn't to-morrow morning--?"

"I should advise you to see him to-night.  It may be nothing but a feverish cold, but it is
half the battle to start treatment in time.  He is nearly 103."

"I will telephone at once," he said shortly, and marched out of the room.

The tenants of Heath Mansions do not, as a rule, run to the extravagance of possessing a private
telephone, but down in the basement there is a species of ice cupboard, where, in surroundings
of abject dreariness, we deposit our pence and shout messages, to the entertainment and enlightenment
of the maids at "Well" windows.  Mr Thorold was bound for this haunt, and the nice Mr Hallett
and I sat down to entertain one another during his absence.

He is nice!  I liked him the moment I saw him, and I went on liking him more and more.  He
is a big, powerfully-built man, but his face is thin, the fine moulding of the bones showing
distinctly beneath their slight covering.  The clean line of his jaw is a joy to behold; his
eyes are dark and unusually deep-set--I would say "cavernous," if I had not a particular dislike
to the word.  He has large, expressive hands, and a low-pitched, unusually deliberate way of
talking.

"I hope the youngster is not going to develop anything serious!"

"I hope not.  He is a dear little fellow.  It is so sad to see a child ill."

"It is; but--frankly!" he said, with a slow, grave glance, "I was thinking more of my friend.
He has had more than his share of trouble, and another spell of anxiety would be hard luck.
It's a big strain on a man to play father and mother to a growing family."

"There is one thing which would be harder!  To have no growing family to look after, and to
take his mind off himself."

He looked at me sharply, and as sharply looked away.  I had a lightning impression that I had
touched a tender spot, but it passed the next moment at sound of the perfectly calm, perfectly
controlled voice:--

"You think that is so?  I should be glad to agree, but Frank has lost an ideal companion. 
I did not imagine that such young children could fill the gap--"

"In a sense they never can, but they fill so many smaller gaps that it is impossible to think
of the big one all the time.  If you had any idea what it is to live in a flat this size, with
five small children tumbling over each other all day long, laughing and quarrelling and getting
into mischief on every conceivable occasion, behaving like perfect little fiends one hour and
angels straight from heaven the next--well, you would realise that there isn't much time left
over to sit down and nurse a private woe!"

He smiled.  He smiles, as the Scotch say, "with deefficulty".  The lines of his face are all
set for gravity and reserve.

"That is so.  But at night?  After such a tornado the solitary evenings must seem lonelier
than ever."

"I don't imagine there is much time for reflection.  There is generally some work to keep him
going.  Rupert has a weakness for dropping things down the sinks.  Last week, for a change,
he drove a nail into a gas-pipe.  And there are the bills to pay, and new things to order,
and endless notes of inquiry and arrangements to be written.  His evenings are well filled up."

"I see you are a believer in counter-irritants."  The deep-set eyes rested on me with a speculative
glance.  A practical, unimaginative woman, who has neither understanding nor sympathy for romance--that
was obviously the verdict.  If he only knew!  If he only knew!

Presently Mr Thorold came back and said the doctor would come round almost at once.  Would
I be so very good as to stay to hear his verdict? Miss Brown was not much use in cases of illness.
She lost her head. The trouble to me seems to be that she has lost her heart--if she ever had
one to lose!

The doctor said that Billie had bronchitis, and that his lungs were not quite clear.  Someone
must sit up with him, keep a bronchitis kettle going, and see that he did not kick off the
clothes.  His temperature must be taken at certain hours.  A great deal might depend upon the
next few hours.  He was afraid it might be difficult to get in a nurse before morning.  Was
there anyone who could--

Miss Brown promptly put herself out of the running, so what was there left for me to do but
modestly to confess that I had passed two Red Cross examinations, could flick a thermometer
with the best, and baffle the tricks of the most obstinate bronchitis kettle that ever overbalanced
itself, or spat hot water instead of steam.

The three men stood round looking at me with big, grateful eyes, and though I was honestly
sorry about Billie, deep down at the bottom of my heart I glowed.  This was in very deed being
of use!  Here was real work lying ready at my hand!

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.

A STRUGGLE FOR A LIFE.

Billie has been desperately ill.  For three weeks he has lain at the point of death, his little
life hanging by a thread.  Two trained nurses have been in attendance, and a third unofficial
one, in the person of old Miss Harding!  Winifred and Marion are living in my flat; Bridget
looks after them, and does our own housekeeping, and also supplements Miss Brown's efforts,
which are, to put it mildly, inadequate for the occasion.  She does not seem to realise that
when people are torn with anxiety they don't appreciate boiled mutton; and that when they sit
up half the night, waiting in sickening suspense to hear the next temperature, a hot cup of
chocolate can be more precious than rubies.

Therefore Bridget and I manufacture dainties, and carry them upstairs to supplement the supplies.

For the first few days the illness took a normal course, and anxiety, though real, was not
acute; but on the fourth day strength failed noticeably, and oxygen was ordered to help the
clogged lungs to work. At first it was given every two hours, then hourly, then every half-hour,
and every woman who knows anything about nursing understands what that means, plus doses of
brandy, struggles to pour as much milk as possible down an unwilling throat, and a constant
taking of pulse and temperature, to say nothing of hypodermic injections at those awful moments
when there seems no pulse to feel.  It means that no one woman, be she ever so competent, can
keep up the fight single-handed for twelve hours at a stretch, and that an understudy to work
under her may mean the very turning of the scale.  I have been understudy by night, and proud
I am to record that Nurse proclaims me unusually "handy" for a member of the "laity".  Hour
after hour we have fought together for the little darling's life, while he lay unconscious
against the piled cushions, a waxen image, unrecognisable as the bonnie curly-headed Billie
we had loved.  We racked our brains to think of new means and new contrivances to fight the
ever-increasing danger.  With the aid of screens and a sheet we contrived a tent over his cot,
through a hole in which the elongated cardboard funnel of the steam-kettle could enter and
give increased relief to the breathing.  We made mustard poultices with white of egg instead
of water, to save needless irritation of the skin; we used the French expedient of putting
quinine pads under the armpits to reduce the terrible temperature.  Nurse was indefatigable--a
miracle of energy and resource--but through all her anxiety and tenderness for the little patient,
it was impossible not to recognise the keen professional zest in a "good case."

"Give me a bad pneumonia, and I'm happy!" said she, frankly, and she meant what she said.

At those rare intervals when Billie fell into a fitful sleep, I used to steal out of the room
and pay a visit to the dining-room, where, on two arm-chairs on opposite sides of the fire,
the poor father and his friend sat drearily smoking, and waiting until the small hours of the
morning. It was useless to tell Mr Thorold to go to bed.  His wife had breathed her last at
two o'clock in the morning, and he was possessed by a dread that Billie would do the same.
At three or thereabouts he might be persuaded to move, but until then it was but a waste of
breath to ask it.  Poor fellow!  To have his old friend by his side was the best comfort that
was left, but how he must have missed his wife, and how endlessly, breathlessly long the hours
must have seemed, sitting with folded hands, with nothing to do but to wait!  Even I--an outsider--was
oppressed by the difference in the atmosphere of the two rooms.  In the sick-room there was
suffering indeed, but there was also a constant, earnest fight; here, the heavy, smoke-filled
air seemed to breathe of despair!

On those midnight visits, the first thing I did after giving my report, was to open the window,
and the second to make a jug of chocolate, beating the powder in the milk till it foamed, in
tempting continental fashion.  The men shivered and protested.  They were in a draught; they
were not hungry; they wanted neither chocolate nor sandwiches; but I went on with my preparations
in an elderly, persistent fashion, and said if they didn't--well, I did, and I hoped they would
not grudge me a little refreshment in the midst of my labours.  By the time that the little
meal was prepared, the smoke had cleared away and left a little air to breathe, so then I made
a favour of shutting the window and poking the fire, and we would sit down together, and--it
was wonderful how much we could eat!  If Aunt Eliza could have seen me then, what--oh, what
would she have said!  How I blessed the grey wig and the spectacles, and the few deft, disfiguring
touches which made my presence so easy and comfortable, not only for myself but for those two
poor, sad, helpless young men.  However much one may rail against convention, it remains an
unalterable fact that youth and good looks are not the best qualification for indiscriminate
work among one's fellow-creatures. I must remember this fact when I grow really old, and apply
it as balm to my wounded vanity.

Over the chocolate and sandwiches we would talk--not about Billie, if possible; and I learnt
that the two men had first met at Harrow, had then been separated for many years, and had renewed
the old friendship during the last two years.

There is evidently a strong sympathy between them--a sympathy of suffering, I think, for with
all his charm, it is evident that Mr Hallett is not a happy man.  He says little about himself,
but I gather that he travels a great deal, that he writes for various reviews, and that--to
say the least of it--he is not overburdened with wealth.  He never mentions any "belongings,"
and is evidently unmarried.  I wonder why, for he is certainly unusually attractive.  Sometimes
when we have been sitting talking together, I have been so conscious of this attraction that
I have had quite a violent longing to be Evelyn Wastneys once more, and to meet him, so to
speak, on his own ground!

He is most nice to me--oh, most nice!  He thinks me a kind, sensible, generous old dear; says
I deserve a Victoria Cross, and that no block of mansions is complete without me.  One night
he asked me smilingly if I would come and nurse him if he were ill; another time he said he
could almost find it in his heart to wish that my money would disappear, so that he could engage
me as a permanent housekeeper.  Then Mr Thorold interrupted, and said that the first claim
was his, and that if my services were to be bought, no other man should have them unless over
his own dead body.  They argued jestingly, while I blushed--a hot, overwhelming blush, and
seeing it, they paused, looking mystified and distressed, and abruptly changed the conversation.
Did they think me ridiculous and a prude, or did that blush for the moment obliterate the sham
signs of age, and show them for the moment the face of a girl?  I should like to know, but
probably I never shall.

For four long weeks Billie's life hung in the balance, for after the pneumonia crisis was passed,
unconsciousness continued, and the terrible word "meningitis" was whispered from lip to lip.
There were heart-breaking days to be lived through, when the terror was no longer that he might
die, but that he might live--deprived of speech, of hearing, possibly of reason itself.  Never
while I live shall I forget those days; but looking back, I can realise that they have taught
me one great lesson, branded it on heart and brain so that I can never, never forget.  The
lesson is that death is not the last and worst enemy which we are so apt to think it when our
dear ones are in its grasp.  Oh, there were hours of darkness in which death seemed to us a
lovely and beautiful thing, when we blamed ourselves for shrinking from the wrench of giving
back a little child into God's tender care.  Who could compare a darkened life on earth with
the perfected powers, the unimaginable glories of eternity?  There were times when our prayers
were reversed, and we asked God to take Billie home!

But he lived; he spoke; he opened his dark eyes and smiled upon us; he demanded a battered
"boy stout" doll, and hugged it to his pneumonia jacket; he drank his milk, and said "More!"
he grew cross and fractious--oh, welcome, gladdening sign!--and said, "Doe away!  No more daddies!
No more nursies!  Don't want nobodies!  Boo-hoo-hoo!" and we went and wept for gladness.

Illness, the really critical touch-and-go illness which nurses call "a good case," turns a
home into an isolation camp.  The outer world retreats to an immeasurable distance, and the
watchers stare out of the windows, and behold with stupefaction hard-hearted men and women
walking abroad on two legs, with hats on their heads, and umbrellas in their hands, talking
and laughing and pursuing their petty avocations, not in the least affected by the fact that
the temperature had again soared up to 104, and the doctor spoke gravely about heart strain.
It seems inconceivable that human creatures, living a few yards away, are actually going to
parties, and attending theatres, trying on new clothes, and worrying about cracked cups.

It was with much the same shock of incredulity that, on descending to my flat one afternoon,
I was met with the news that a gentleman was in the drawing-room waiting to see me.  Bridget
was out walking with the little girls, and the orphan, as usual, had opened the door.  I demanded
to be told "all about it," upon which she inhaled a deep breath, and set forth her tale after
the manner of a witness in the police court.

"He says to me, `Is Miss Harding at home?'  I says, `Yes, sir, she's at home, but she's out
at the moment nursing a little boy upstairs'.  He says to me, `Is Miss Evelyn Wastneys at home?'
I says, `She don't live here, sir.  There has some letters come--' He says, `When will Miss
Harding be in?'  I says, `She generally gives us a look, as it might be, about six, before
the young ladies settles to bed'.  `Then I'll wait!' he says, takes off his hat, and walked
in.  I said, `What name shall I say, please?'  He said, `It doesn't matter about my name. 
She doesn't know it.'"

I stood silent, digesting the news.

"What sort of a gentleman is he?  What does he look like?"

The orphan considered, silently chewing the cud.

"He looks," she opined deliberately, "as if he could give you what for!"

At that, without one second's pause, I scuttled into my own room and locked the door behind
me.  (I would have "locked and double locked" it, as heroines of fiction do on such occasions,
but it has always remained a mystery to me how they manage to do it!)  That being done I fell
into a chair, and breathlessly confronted--the worst!

It was the Squire!  I knew it without a doubt.  If the orphan had devoted an hour to her description,
she could not have been more apt. In some mysterious way he had tracked me to my lair.  I might
have known he would do it!  He was not the sort of man to be daunted by a closed door.  He
would put out the whole of his big, indomitable force, till by hook or by crook it flew open,
and the secret was revealed.  Mercifully, however, it was so far only Miss Harding whom he
had discovered; Evelyn Wastneys still eluded his grasp, and if I could summon enough nerve
and courage to carry through one final interview, all might yet be well.  It was useless to
say I would not see him.  He would simply wait until I did.  The only result would be to arouse
his suspicions.  I rose slowly and confronted myself in the glass.

The disguise was good, but was it good enough?  I hastily opened my "make up" case, and accentuated
the lines which the expert had shown were most telling--the curve of the upper lip, the kink
in the eyebrow, the long wrinkle from nose to chin.  I wrapped my Paisley scarf round my shoulders,
took my courage in both hands, and opened the door.  I decided to go into the dining-room,
draw the casement curtains, seat myself with my back to the light, and--send the orphan to
summon him to my presence!  I was nervous and scared, but--let me confess it--the moment was
not without a fearful joy!  My heart was beating with quick, excited throbs.  It was the oddest,
most inexplicable thing, but I--I really wanted to see him.  If a wish could have spirited
him away, I could not have brought myself to breathe it.  It seemed suddenly as if, unknown
to myself, I had missed him, been missing him for a long, long time--

The door opened and he came in.

CHAPTER NINETEEN.

A DOUBLE EXCITEMENT.

He wore a dark suit, and carried a silk hat in his hand.  The conventional dress made a great
difference in his appearance; it always does when one is accustomed to see a man in the easy,
becoming garb of the country.  He looked older, more imposing; in the dim light it seemed to
me that he was thinner too, had lost some of his deep tan.

I rose from my chair and bowed.  He bowed too, and said:--

"Miss Harding, I believe?"

Long might he believe it!  I waved him to a chair, and said suavely, "Pray sit down."

"I--er--I called to ask if you would be kind enough to give me Miss Wastneys' address.  I believe
her letters are sent to this address."

"May I ask who gave you that information?"

"I'm sorry; but I'm not at liberty to say.  It was a discovery which has given me considerable
difficulty to make."

"Excuse me, Mr--er--" I stopped short with an admirable air of inquiry.

"My name is Maplestone."

"Thank you!  I presume, Mr Maplestone, that you are aware of Miss Wastneys' wish to keep her
address private for the moment.  Do you consider yourself justified in acting in direct opposition
to her wishes?"

"I do," he said sturdily.  "I warned her that I would do everything in my power to find her.
I am only sorry that I have been so long in doing it."

"I am afraid she would not share your regret.  In any case, I cannot take the responsibility
of helping you any further."

"You refuse to tell me where to find her?"

"I am sorry to appear discourteous, Mr Maplestone, but I have no choice."

He looked at me, a cool, casual glance, and impatiently frowned.  There was no flicker of recognition
in his look.  To him I was obviously a mere figure-head, an obstinate, elderly woman who stood
as an obstacle in his path.  He hesitated for a moment, and then said emphatically:--

"My business is imperative.  It is absolutely necessary to see Miss Wastneys."

"I think she must decide this point."

"Madam!"--he glared at me reproachfully--"you are probably not aware that I have asked Miss
Wastneys to be my wife?"

"I was not aware, Mr Maplestone, that Miss Wastneys had accepted that offer."

"She has not.  That is just the point.  If she had, I should not need help.  But she is going
to!  That is why I am so anxious to find her--to prevent further waste of time."

Braced against my cushions, I gasped in mingled exasperation and dismay. That tone of certainty
impressed me against my will.  It required an effort to preserve an unruffled appearance.

"I cannot give you any help, Mr Maplestone.  To the best of my belief, you are wrong in your
expectations."

"Evelyn--Miss Wastneys is your niece, I believe?"

I bowed, mentally quoting the orphan's qualification:--

"Sort of!"

"May I ask if she has confided in you--told you the history of our acquaintance?"

For one moment I hesitated, then:--

"I think I may say that I know practically all that there is to tell."

He leant forward suddenly, rested an arm on the table, and fixed me with eager eyes.

"Miss Harding, I want a friend!  I want an ally.  I came here to-day, hoping to find one in
you.  Will you be on my side?"

I drew back; but, before I had time to protest, he hurled another crisp, sharp question at
my head:--

"Do you love your niece?"

The question appealed to me.  I answered promptly, as it were mentally licking my lips:--

"I do!  I may say I am much attached to Evelyn.  She has faults (judicially), but she is a
pleasant, well-meaning girl.  She has been (unctuously) very kind to me."

"She is kind to everyone," he said shortly, "except myself!  Of course she has faults!  Plenty
of them.  You could not know her without seeing that."

I glared, outraged.  Oh, indeed!  If my faults are so many and so obvious, why on earth does he--?

"You are very keen-sighted for a lover, Mr Maplestone," I said coldly. "If I were Evelyn, I
should prefer the idealism which is usual under the circumstances.  But perhaps you do not
pose as an ordinary lover."

"I don't know," he said shortly--"I don't know.  This is a new experience to me.  I can only
say one thing"--his voice softened, swelled into deep, low notes--"she is my life.  She means
everything-- the beginning and the end.  I shall fight on and on until she is mine."

Miss Harding coughed, and twitched at her shawl, and blinked at the ceiling, and feebly shook
her grey head.

"It is a pity," she said weakly, "to make too sure!  In these matters force is--er--is out
of place.  Evelyn must decide.  She should not be coerced.  If I know her nature, coercion
will do no good.  She is inclined to obstinacy."

"Coercion would fail, but love--Your niece is very feminine.  She would be unhappy alone. 
She needs to be loved.  I have love to give her--enough to satisfy any girl--more than enough!
At the bottom of her heart she knows it.  She ran away because she was afraid.  Left no address."

"Mr Maplestone, I am sorry to appear unkind, but Miss Wastneys' plans were made before she
guessed your wishes."

That was true, and hit him hard.  His face fell, and he looked so quelled, so dejected, that
my heart ached with remorse.  What foolish thing I might have said I don't know, but at that
moment the door burst open, and Winifred and Marion precipitated themselves into my arms. Taking
no notice of the strange man, they proceeded to confide the adventures of their walk.  It was
"Miss Harding, this; darling Miss Harding, that; Miss Harding, dear, the other," while I undid
their mufflers, and smoothed their hair, and smiled in benevolent interest. What could be a
finer testimony to Miss Harding's verisimilitude than the blandishments of these sweet innocents?

For some minutes Mr Maplestone's presence was ignored, but when I looked at him again it was
to realise with surprised curiosity that his bearing had undergone a startling change.  His
cheeks had flushed, the weary lines had disappeared, he looked young, brisk, assured.  Nothing
had happened to account for it; nothing had been said, bearing in the remotest sense on his
affairs.  I had made no slip of any kind, but had been laboriously elderly and restrained,
and yet, there it was--an unmistakable air of satisfaction and relief.

He rose, held out his hand.

"I see you are busy.  I won't detain you longer.  If you will allow me I will call again."

"Mr Maplestone, excuse my want of hospitality, but it is quite useless."

He retained my hand in his; he spoke in a pleading voice.

"I am a very lonely man.  I have no one else to whom I can speak.  It would be a pleasure just
to see anyone who belonged--I will promise not to be a nuisance.  Please let me come!"

"Well!"  I said helplessly.  "Well!"

Short of being absolutely brutal, what else could I say?  Besides--it may be a pleasure to me, too!

That same evening a letter arrived from Charmion.  Nothing like having all one's excitements
at the same time.  It was good to see the dear writing again, and I was in the mood when I
badly needed some words of comfort.  I tore open the envelope, hoping to find them inside.

This is the letter:--

"Evelyn, Dear,--How is it faring with you, I wonder, in your grey London world, while I laze
beneath Italian skies?  It is a rest to know that you understand my silence, and don't need
to be reminded that it does not mean forgetfulness.  That big heart of yours can be very patient
and forbearing.  I have good cause to know that, but I also know that no one in the world more
keenly enjoys a word of love and appreciation, so here's a confession for you, dear.  Read
it, lock it up in your heart, and never, never refer to it in words!  This is it, then.  During
these last weeks, when I have been fighting the old battle of the last six years, I have discovered
to my surprise, and--let me confess it--dismay, that my point of view has strangely altered.
I still consider that I have been the victim of one of the cruellest deceptions which a woman
could endure; I still believe that in that first ghastly hour of discovery, flight was justified
and natural, but--Well, Evelyn, dear!  I have been living for months in very close intimacy
with a little girl who thinks no evil, and is always ready to find a good explanation for what
may on the surface appear to be unkind, and it has had its effect.

"I keep asking myself, `In my place, what would Evelyn have done?' and the answer disturbs
my sleep.  You are impulsive, my dear, and your temper is not beyond reproach.  If you loved
deeply you would be exacting, and would fiercely resent deceit.  You would have run away even
more impetuously than I did myself, but--but--you would not have kept up your resentment for
six long years, or refused the offender a right to speak!  If I know my Evelyn, before a month
had passed her heart would have softened, and she would be turning special pleader in his defence,
racking her brain for extenuating explanations.  And if there had been none--I can imagine
you, Evelyn, shouldering your burden with a set, gallant little face, going back to your husband,
and saying to yourself, `Am I a coward to be daunted by the failure of one little month?  He
married me for my money--very well, he shall have his price! I will give it to him, freely
and willingly, but I will give him other things too--companionship, interest, sympathy, so
that in time to come he shall love me for myself!  I am young and pretty and intelligent--I
can do it if I care enough to be patient and unselfish.  I married him for better or worse.
With God's help, I will turn this "worse" into "better" before our lives are done!'

"Oh, I assure you, my dear, I cut a poor figure in my own eyes, when I contrast my conduct
with what yours would have been in my place.  If we had met years ago things might have gone
differently, but now it is too late.  Too late for apologies and recantations, that is to say,
for they would not be acceptable, even if I could bring myself to the point of offering them.
This sounds as if your example had had no real effect after all, but it is not so.  Outward
circumstances may remain the same, but some of the inward bitterness has gone!  Do you remember
the old fairy story about the unfortunate king who had three iron bands clamped tightly round
his heart?  It was the result of a spell, of course, and the only thing which could break their
hold was when some mortal did some really fine and noble deed, then with a great bang one of
the bands broke loose and conveniently disappeared.

"Well, dear little girl, if your present crack-brained mission is not working out to your satisfaction,
if your neighbours in the `Mansions' (?) are unappreciative or appreciative in objectionable
ways--comfort yourself with the reflection that your sweet example has burst one of Charmion's
iron bands.  I think on reflection one might almost say two, and that she daily blesses you
for the relief!

"I can't send you an address.  I have no idea where I am going next, but before very long you
will see me again.  I'll burst in upon you some day, with a Paris hat on my head (and another
in my box for a pretty friend!) and snatch you away from your fads and fancies, and carry you
off to `Pastimes,' to gloat over, all to myself!  Don't have anything to say to any presumptuous
man who may try to lure you away.  For the period of our lease you belong to me, and I am not
going to give you up.

"Charmion."

I smiled, wiped a furtive tear, and carefully folded up the sheet.  It did comfort me to know
that I had helped Charmion.  I thought happily of seeing her again, of all the long interesting
talks we would have together.

Incidentally I thought of our lease.  If we paid a penalty, we could break it at three years.

CHAPTER TWENTY.

STRANGE CONVERSATIONS.

Billie is slowly recovering.  He is sitting up in his cot, languidly permitting himself to
be adored, waited upon by obsequious attendants, and fed upon the fat of the land.  This is
the period when outsiders cry gushingly to an invalid's relations, "How happy you must be!"
But as a cold matter of fact they usually feel very depressed and snappy and bored.  This sounds
thankless, but it is nothing of the sort; the thankfulness is all there, stored up for later
realisation, but for the moment tired nerves are in the ascendant, and pay one out for the
long-drawn strain.

Relieved from acute anxiety, Mr Thorold began to think of the cost, count up doctors' visits,
and sigh like a furnace; Miss Brown gave notice.  "She wasn't blind and she wasn't deaf.  She
was aware that she was not giving satisfaction, and it would be better for both parties--"
The general servant, who had been quite heroic during the time when work went on the twenty-four
hours round, now took to banging dishes and muttering as she left the room.  Old Miss Harding,
having lost much sleep, and spent her few leisure hours in reading aloud to her small guests,
exhibited a tendency to tears and self-pity.  Mr Hallett, disappointed of a hoped-for holiday
with his friend as companion, shrugged his shoulders, and inquired dismally: "What can you
expect? Things always go wrong in this miserable world!"

Each man in turns paid visits to my flat, and discussed his troubles at length.  Mr Thorold's
were mostly financial.  What could he do to cut down expenses?  Would I recommend sending the
children to live in the country?  Ridiculously cheap houses could be had, if one did not mind
living miles from a station.  He himself must, of course, remain in town; but in a cheap boarding-house
he could manage to live on very little--say a hundred a year--and when he took a holiday he
could "run down to the country".  It would be good for the children.

"While it lasted," I said drily.  "Their father might live--with luck-- for a year or eighteen
months.  It seems hardly worth while having the expense of a removal for such a short time."

He sighed, looked for a moment as if he were going to declare that he would be glad to be out
of it, then pulled himself together and said:--

"Well, but I must pull in somehow to pay for all these extra expenses! Have you anything to
suggest?"

"You might let this flat furnished for a few months in spring.  The porters tell me there are
tenants to be found at that time.  Odd, isn't it, that the season should affect `Weltham Mansions'?
It's the lap of the waves, I suppose, but it seems a long way to flow.  I could help you to
find cheap country quarters, and you could fit in your own holiday at the same time, and so
save travelling expenses.  Lazing about in a garden may not be exciting, but it's the rest
you need.  I knew a very tired man who went off for a golfing week with a friend.  His wife
told me he took a fortnight to recover.  She said so to the doctor, and he said, `Of course!
What did you expect?  It would have been better if he had gone to bed.'"

He shrugged impatiently.

"Maybe it is quite true.  I suppose it is.  But when a man has only one fortnight in the year,
he might be allowed to enjoy it in his own way! It's an idea, though--letting the flat.  Thanks
for the suggestion. I'll speak to an agent."

Mr Hallett rested his big shoulders against my cushions, and said in his low, grave tones:--

"You are a woman--you understand these things.  Is there any way in which I can help?  It's
pretty tough to see an old friend worried to death, and just sit and look on--but Thorold's
proud, and it's difficult to interfere.  It seems a cruel thing that illness should fall so
heavily upon the middle classes.  The rich are independent, the poor have hospitals; but a
man in Thorold's position is no sooner through with the mental torture than he is up against
an army of bills.  It seems that Billie is bound to keep his nurses for several weeks longer.
That's a big item in itself."

It was!  Often during these last weeks I had thought to myself what a grand occupation it would
be for an independent woman to train as a nurse, and then give one or two doctors leave to
call her in to serve-- without payment--in cases like the present, where need was great and
means were small.  I went off into a day-dream in which I saw myself, in cap and apron, acting
as ministering angel to the suffering middle class, to be roused by Mr Hallett's voice saying
tentatively:--

"I'm a poor man, but I am alone in the world, so there's no object in saving.  Why shouldn't
I settle a few of the bills for Billie's illness and say nothing about it?"

I shook my head.

"Mr Thorold would find out and be furious.  You must help openly, or not at all.  You have
helped by keeping him company all these weeks."

He hitched his shoulders, and made a grimace of disparagement.

"It's a long time since my company could be called cheering, I'm afraid. Thorold is `down and
out' himself, and he ought to have happy people about him."  He turned his dark eyes upon me
with sudden interest. "Like you!" he said emphatically, "like you!  Excuse a personal remark,
Miss Harding, but you seem to have an eternal flow of vitality. Thorold and I were talking
about you last night, comparing you with other women of your--er--your generation.  We agreed
that you left an extraordinary impression of youth!"  He looked at me with wistful eyes. He
was a lonely man, and I was a woman, conveniently at hand, and possessed of a "feeling heart".
An impulse towards confidence struggled to birth.  In his eyes I could see it grow.

"I suppose," he began tentatively, "you have had an easy life?"

"In a material sense--yes!  But I have had my trials."  A wave of self-pity engulfed me and
quivered in my voice.  "I have been separated, by death or distance, from all my relatives.
My best friend is abroad."

"Death--or distance!" he repeated the words in his deep, slow tones, as though they had struck
a note in his own heart.  "But distance is death, Miss Harding!  The worst kind of death. 
Desolation without peace!  Thorold thinks himself brokenhearted, but there are men who would
envy him his clean, sweet grief.  His sorrow is for himself alone. She is at peace!"

"Ah," I said quickly, "I know what you mean.  When we are quite young, death seems the crowning
loss, but there are worse things--I've discovered that!  I realised it in those terrible days
when we feared for Billie's brain.  When you love people very much, it would be a daily death
to know that they were suffering."

He gazed gloomily into the fire.

"It is extraordinary--the capacity for suffering of the human heart! Physically we are so easily
destroyed.  An invisible germ will do it, the prick of a finger, a draught of cold air; but
a man can live on, suffering mental torture, month after month, year after year, and his weight
will hardly decrease by a pound.  You read of broken hearts, but there are no such things!
Hearts are invulnerable, torture-proof, guaranteed to endure all shocks!"

It occurred to me that it was time that Miss Harding exerted her vitality and stopped this
flow of repining.  The poor man had evidently had some tragedy in his life which had warped
his outlook.  He needed cheering--we all needed cheering; proverbially the surest way of cheering
yourself is to cheer other people; therefore the sane and obvious way of spending his money
was in providing cheer for the company.  I said as much, and he said, "Certainly; but how?
It was winter time.  A winter's day in London holds an insuperable barrier against any possibility
of enjoyment."  I said, "Not at all!  There were heaps of things--heaps of ways."  He said,
"Would I kindly specify one or two of the `heaps'?"  I said, "Certainly not!  The essence of
a treat lay in its quality of surprise.  It was for him to think."  He smiled at me with whimsical
amusement, and cried, "You said that just like a girl. You are a girl at heart, Miss Harding,
in spite of your grey hairs. What a pity you did not marry, you would have given some man and
some kiddies such a thundering good time.  I know, of course, that it was your own doing. 
There must have been--"

"Oh, there were!"  I cried glibly.  "Several!"

"But you couldn't--You were never tempted?"

"No, never.  At least--" Suddenly I found that it was necessary to qualify that denial.  "There
are two things which are always tempting to a woman, Mr Hallett--love and strength!  Every
woman would be glad to have a strong, loving man to take care of her--if he were the right man!"

"Well!" he sighed, and rose heavily from his seat.  "No doubt you knew best, but--I hope you
gave him his chance!  We men have many sides, but the best side is apt to remain hidden until
some woman brings it out. If he loved you, you owed him something.  I hope you played fair
and gave him his chance!"

He turned towards the door; we shook hands, and he left without another word.  I turned back
to the fire, sat me down, and thought.

Ralph Maplestone had demanded his chance, and I had thought myself noble and brave in refusing
to give it.  He was strong and he was loving; he had asked nothing better than to take care
of me.  Would the time ever come, when I was really old, when I should sit by a lonely hearth
and look back and regret?  I thought of Mr Hallett's voice as he spoke those last words, and
saw a vision of his face.  It is a beautiful face, and I dearly love beauty.  What a satisfaction
it would be to go through life looking at the curve of that nose and the modelling of that
chin and jaw!  I thought of the Squire's stern voice, and his blunt, plain-featured face. 
Always, always, so long as I lived, I should long to take a pair of pincers and tweak that
nose into shape, and nip little pieces of flesh from the neck, and pad them on the hollows
beneath the cheek-bones.  Suddenly I began to laugh.  I imagined myself doing it-- saw the
expression in the blue, startled eyes.

Strange how plain faces can fascinate more than beautiful ones!  My laughter died away.  It
is difficult to keep on laughing by oneself.  I was tired, and had been giving out sympathy
all day; depression clutched me, and a restless irritability.  At this auspicious moment the
orphan knocked at the door and announced that Number 19 would be glad to speak a few words.

"Show her in!"  I said, and in she came--a pretty, thin, little woman, with a tempery eye.

"I am sorry to intrude, but you must really understand that this is too much!  When people
live in flats, it is essential that they show some consideration for their neighbours.  Will
you kindly listen to that?"

I listened.  Winifred and Marion were playing at "bears," and chasing Bridget to her death.
Engrossed in my own thoughts, I had paid no attention, beyond a subconscious satisfaction that
they were enjoying themselves.  The roars did not annoy me, but they were certainly fairly
loud.  I tendered a civil explanation.

"It's Mr Thorold's little girls.  Their brother has been dangerously ill.  They are staying
with me."

"Is there any necessity for them to shriek at the pitch of their voices?"

"They are out for hours every day.  This is their play-time before they go to bed.  They go
at seven."

"And wake at six!  For the last fortnight we have been disturbed every morning.  My husband
wishes me to say that if it goes on he will complain to the landlord.  I have complained before,
as you know, but without effect.  Ever since you came we have been annoyed."

I was furious.  Whatever had happened during the last fortnight, no one could have been quieter
before.  "And what about themselves?"  I said coldly.  "Do you imagine that the landlord will
be able to make children sleep beyond their usual hour?"

"Certainly not, but they can be kept quiet.  When people go to bed late"--she stopped short,
arrested by my expression, stared for a moment, and then concluded--"they naturally object
to being disturbed in the morning.  We breakfast at nine.  This morning we were kept awake
by quarrelling voices for over an hour."

I bowed politely.

"I am sorry.  It is most disagreeable.  I have had the same experience myself, but at the beginning
of the night."

The words jumped out.  The moment I had said them I was sorry, and when I saw her poor startled
face I could have cried.  The slow red rose in her cheeks; we stared into each other's eyes,
and both spoke at the same time.  She said:--

"Oh-oh!  Can you hear?"

I said:--

"Oh, I'm sorry!  I should not have said it.  Forgive me!  I'm tired and cross after nursing
upstairs.  I want to quarrel myself.  I'm sorry! I'll keep the children quiet.  They will soon
be going home.  Please always let me know if I'm a bother.  I'll do everything I can!"

She looked at me--a puzzled look--and mumbled cold thanks.  This was a case when my apparent
years were against me.  If I had been Evelyn--a girl like herself--we would have clasped hands
and made friends.  As it was, she distrusted the elderly woman who showed an impulsiveness
foreign to her years.  She departed hurriedly, leaving me plunged in fresh woe.

A nice person I am, to blame a man for having a bad temper!  I have hurt a sister woman, who
has the hardest lot which any woman can have in life--a loveless home!

CHAPTER TWENTY ONE.

MR MAPLESTONE IS PLEASED.

As a result of my suggestion, Mr Hallett has taken Mr Thorold to several concerts, and as a
crowning effort actually lured him to a week-end at Brighton.  That was last week; and as the
day was mild and-- almost!--sunny, I suggested to the little girls that we should go holiday-making
on our own account, and pay a visit to the Zoo.

The proposal excited great enthusiasm, and an early lunch was ordered so that we could set
forth in good time, so as to have a couple of hours with the animals before adjourning to a
confectioner's for tea.  I remembered my own childhood too well to suggest returning home for
the meal.  To drink tea out of strange cups, in a strange room, to have a practically unlimited
choice of strange cakes--this is a very orgie of bliss to anything "in one figure," and when
the tea is followed by a drive home in a taxi, satisfaction approaches delirium.  I remembered
Mr Thorold's pathetic "Make them happy!" and determined that, if it were in my power, this
should be a day to be remembered.

Lunch was finished, I dressed the little girls in their new hats and coats, wriggled their
fingers into new gloves, saw to it that there was not a crease in their stockings nor a chink
in the lacing of their boots, and had just settled them on the sofa in the drawing-room to
wait quietly until I rushed through my own hasty toilette, when--the door opened, and who should
walk in but Ralph Maplestone himself!

For different reasons his appearance struck consternation into the breasts of all three beholders.
I was naturally overcome with embarrassment as to what he had come for now; the little girls
were seized with a devastating fear lest his arrival should interfere with their treat.  They
leapt to their feet, and rent the air with protestations.

"Oh, oh!  It's the Same Man!"

"We're going out!  We're going out!  We've got on our hats."

"To the Zoo!  So's Miss Harding.  She's just going to put on her hat."

"It's our treat.  Father's away.  He's having a treat, and she promised--she promised we could go!"

Tears sounded in the voices, showed in suspicious redness round the eyes.  Mr Maplestone smiled--like
many grave people he has a beautiful smile--he laid one big hand on the top of each little
hat, and swayed them gently to and fro.

"Well, and why not?  Of course you are going!  All good little girls go to the Zoo, and ride
on the elephants, and throw buns to the bears.  You are extra good little girls, and so you
can see something else--a little bird, not much bigger than a canary, who can talk and say
words almost as well as you can yourselves.  And think of the monkeys!"

He withdrew one hand and held it out to me across the children's heads, smiling and apologetic.

"I'm afraid I am looked upon as an obstacle.  Please don't let me detain you.  I would not
disappoint them for the world.  I can call another day."

But by this time fear had given place to gratitude and the quick affection which children show
to grown-ups who understand!  Winifred and Marion leapt at his arms, clung, wheedled, and implored.

"You come too!  You come too!  Show us the bird that talks.  We want you.  We want you to come
with us.  Miss Harding wants you.  You do want him, don't you, Miss Harding?"

The leap of my heart showed that I did!  The very suggestion had been enough to give an altogether
different aspect to the expedition; to invest it with a spice of adventure, not to say romance,
which was most refreshing to a spinster living in a basement flat!  I fought down an inclination
to laugh, hoped that I conquered an inclination to blush, and said primly:--

"My dears, you must not be exacting.  Mr Milestone has no doubt engagements--"

"Not one!" he contradicted eagerly.  "Not one!  Please let me come, Miss Harding.  It would
be a charity, for if you turn me away I shall be at a loose end all the afternoon.  I am like
a fish out of water in town!"

"You should return to the country," I said sternly.  "It is wasting time to remain here."

The children caught at the last sentence, naturally applied it to their own plans, and pranced
with renewed impatience.

"Yes!  Yes!  You said directly after lunch.  Put on your hat, Miss Harding--do put it on! 
We want to see the bird."

He looked at me, lifted his eyebrows, and smiled as if to say that further protest was useless,
and indeed it seemed that it was.  There was nothing for it but to retire to my room, and put
on the boat-shaped hat, the thick, unbecoming veil, and the badly-cut coat, which aided my
outdoor disguise.

I looked plain to a degree.  Nothing in the world can disfigure a woman more successfully than
an unbecoming hat and a cheap black veil, which imparts a dingy, leaden tint to the complexion.
I had every reason to be satisfied with my disguise that afternoon, but I wasn't.  Not a bit!
I felt cross, and irritated, and balked!

We took a taxi and drove straight to the Albert Road entrance, made our way down the steep
incline, under the bridge, and up again towards the lion houses.  Marion and Winifred hung,
one on each of Ralph's arms, chattering in a continuous stream.  Child-like, they ignored me
in the fascinations of a new friend; also--and this interested me very much!-- he was charming
with them, hitting just the right combination of sense and nonsense, entering into their ideas,
and adapting himself with an enjoyment which was obviously real, not feigned.  I reminded myself
that this was the first time I had seen him in the company of children.

Mem.  Every woman ought to see a man in several circumstances before she accepts him as a husband.

1.  In his own home.

2.  With his dependents.  With children and old people.  With his best friend.

3.  When he is angry.

4.  Tried by the money test.

5.  Flirted with by a woman prettier than herself.

We visited the larger animals in turns, and whenever there was a seat the Squire thoughtfully
pressed me to sit down, while the children pranced about to let off the steam of their enjoyment.
After a few minutes he invariably joined me, and led the conversation to the same topic.  Above
the roar of the lions, above the jabber of the monkeys, he shouted in my ears to know if I
were still obdurate.  Wouldn't I help him?  Why wouldn't I help him?  If I really loved Evelyn,
and cared for her welfare, how could I stand aside?  I must see--surely I must see that she
belonged to the essentially feminine type of women who needed a home!

"I believe there are many women nowadays who are honestly satisfied with an independent career,
but she is not one.  She is made to love and be loved.  She needs a man to look after her."

"The right kind of man!"  I said primly.  "I agree with your diagnosis, Mr Maplestone, but
Evelyn's nature makes it peculiarly essential that she should make a wise choice.  If her marriage
was a failure, she would suffer greatly.  No one but herself can decide who is the Right Man."

Feeding hour was approaching; a furious outburst of roars proclaimed the lions' knowledge of
the fact.  Mr Maplestone leant his arm on the back of the seat and shouted into my ear:--

"But you know her so well; she has spoken to you.  There could be no harm in giving me some
hints.  Some things might be altered, though others could not.  Does she think me an ugly brute?"

His face was close to mine.  I looked at the blunt features, the clear, healthful tints, and
found nothing that offended my eye.

As I had realised in Mr Hallett's presence, expression counts for more than mere correctness
of outline.  I turned aside and shook my head.

"The question of appearance does not count.  In that respect you have the one qualification
which a woman demands."

"Which is?"

"Manliness--strength.  Evelyn would care little for handsome features."

He sighed relief.

"Disposition then!  I made a bad impression at our first meeting.  My temper is hasty.  I dislike
opposition, but if we loved one another we should agree.  There would be no opposition."

I smiled at his innocence.  It is astonishing how guileless these big, strong men can be. 
I was about to undeceive him, but before I had time to speak the children were back with a
rush, dragging at our arms, and demanding to move on.  For the next half-hour we had no private
conversation, but at the first chance he began once more.

"Evelyn has been accustomed to the country.  I could give her the life she likes.  If she wished
it I would take a house in town for the season.  To a certain extent I believe in women's rights.
I should not interfere with her pursuits.  I should want her to be happy in her own way."

"Always providing that her husband was the chief consideration, and came before everything else?"

"Of course!" he cried loudly.  "Why, of course!  What else could you expect?"

I waved my thick dogskin gloves.

"Oh, Mr Maplestone, what is the use of arguing?  It all comes back to the one thing.  If she
loved you the other things would adjust themselves.  Without love, without sympathy, all would
go wrong."

"There is sympathy.  She may not realise it, perhaps, but if she thinks, if you ask her to
think, she must acknowledge that, in spite of small surface disagreements, our real selves
have drawn together, closer and closer.  Ask her if she feels to me as she does towards other
men?  If there seems no difference between us?  I know she does not love me--yet; but if she
gave me my chance, I could make her.  No, she would not need to be made.  You can at least
tell her that."

Mr Hallett's words sounded warningly in my ears.  I hesitated, weakly compromised.

"Yes--I might go so far.  She shall hear what you say, and judge for herself.  And now we have
really talked enough.  Suppose we hear your bird for a change?"

An hour later we drove to Fuller's and indulged in tea.  It was curiously enough the sight
of one of the well-known angel cakes which recalled Delphine Merrivale to my memory, for she
had shown a child-like appreciation of these dainties when they had appeared on our tea-table
at "Pastimes".  Poor little Delphine!  I felt a pang of compunction when I remembered what
store she had set on my friendship, and how little, how very little, I had concerned myself
about her during the last months!  With due caution I proceeded to seek information.

"I hope the tenants at `Pastimes' are well, and the Vicar and his wife-- that pretty little
`Delphine' of whom Evelyn is so fond?"

"The Vicar is not well; been ailing all autumn, but Delphine is going strong.  Quite launched
out this autumn.  Become quite a leader of fashion in our small world."

I felt another pang--of foreboding this time, and said sharply:--

"How very unsuitable!  Are you speaking figuratively, Mr Maplestone? Surely a clergyman's wife--"

"Clergymen's wives differ, Miss Harding, as greatly as the wives of other members of society.
They are not turned out by a machine, and this particular one is very young, and not particularly
wise."

"Apparently not.  In what way has she `launched out'?"

"Oh-oh--" he vaguely waved his hands.

"Smart clothes, you know.  Lots of 'em.  Dinner parties.  Luncheons. Less parish work, and
more amusement.  Always trotting over to the `Moat'."

The present owners of the "Moat" were rich City people who gave lavish entertainments, and
obviously chose their friends with a consideration of how much amusement could be counted upon
in return.  Pretty, gay Delphine was a valuable addition to a house-party, and would no doubt
receive as many invitations as she cared to accept; but the influence could not be good.  Continual
association with smart, worldly people would of a certainty heighten her discontent, and lure
her into extravagance.

I munched my cake in gloomy silence, which was not lightened by the next remark.

"I'm sorry for Delphine's sake that--she--is away!  If you worry it out, this development is
her doing.  She ought to be there to put on the brake!"

"What do you mean?  In what possible way is Evelyn to blame?"

"Who spoke of blame?  I didn't!  It is natural to her to be dainty and beautiful.  She has
the money, and she has the taste.  What is wrong for the wife of a poor man is a virtue in
a rich woman.  Even I--a man--who never noticed such things before, found pleasure in her clothes.
She had one blue muslin--"

He looked at me with dumb, awed eyes.  Surely never did a muslin gown at somewhere about a
shilling a yard, reap such a harvest of appreciation. I shall preserve that dress in lavender
and rose leaves for evermore.

"Until She came, Delphine had the field to herself in our little village.  Any comparisons
must have been in her favour.  Then suddenly she found herself up against a new standard. 
Being young and-- er--vain, she evidently felt it necessary to her peace of mind to follow
the leader.  From a spectacular point of view the effect is good."

Spectacular indeed!  I was too perturbed, too anxious to speak. Evidently Delphine had been
going in for an orgie of extravagance; a pretty serious one too, since it had attracted the
attention of a mere man; and some of the responsibility seemed to fall on my own shoulders!
I determined to write her a letter that very night, and in absent-minded fashion began to compose
its sentences as I poured out second cups of tea.  "Although I have not written, you must not
think that I have forgotten you.  I am leading a busy life, and have little time to spare,
but if you should ever need me; if there ever comes a time when you feel I can be of real help,
write to me through my lawyers, and I could meet you in town, or even run down for the day."

Yes, that would do!  That would open the way for confidences, if she were in a mood to make
them.  In any case, I should feel more satisfied in my own mind when I had sent off the message,
and shown that I was to be found if needed.

Looking up suddenly from the tea tray I beheld Ralph Maplestone smiling to himself across the
table, with precisely the same mysterious accession of complaisance that I had noticed on his
first visit to the flat.  Our eyes met, and he turned aside, drawing in his lips to hide the
smile, but the light danced in his eyes, and refused to be quenched.

Most mysterious and perplexing!  His moods are evidently very variable. I am glad he was pleased,
but I should very much like to know why!

CHAPTER TWENTY TWO.

MRS MERRIVALE'S APPEAL.

Every one has noticed that the thought of a friend after a spell of forgetfulness is frequently
the harbinger of a sudden meeting, or of the receipt of a letter or message.  Such happenings
are called "curious coincidences"; but personally I don't consider them curious at all, or
at least no more curious than it is to send a message by telephone, and to hear in reply a
familiar voice speaking across the space.  When the heart sends forth a wireless message of
love and goodwill, surely, if we have in any sense grasped the wonderful power of thought,
we must believe that the message reaches its destination, and calls forth a response!  Right
thoughts--thoughts of love and pity and helpfulness-- are prayers winged to heaven and earth;
bad thoughts--mean and grudging and censorious--well, they injure the person who thinks them
so much, that there can't be much poison left for the recipient.  In any case, such leaden
things can't rise.

This moralising leads up to the fact that while my own letter to Delphine lay unfinished on
my desk, a note arrived from Ralph Maplestone, to give me grave news of her husband.

"I am summoned home," he wrote, "in my capacity of vicar's warden. While I have been in town,
poor Merrivale has had an attack of influenza, which has been pretty serious, and has left
him rather alarmingly weak.  I insisted upon calling in a consultant from B--, whose verdict
is that the lungs are seriously threatened.  I have feared it for some time, and am glad that
he is now forced to take care.  He is ordered complete rest, and is to get out of England for
the spring months.  I shall be kept busy here for some weeks, but expect to run up to town
for a day's business now and then, when I will give myself the pleasure of calling on you.
Meanwhile, will you kindly pass on the news to Miss Wastneys.  I know she will be interested.
I rely on you to fulfil your kind promise."  By the same post came a letter from Charmion,
tentatively breaking the news that she would not return for Christmas.  Several minor reasons
had contributed to this decision, but the big one was that she was still "working out her cure"
and could do it better in solitude.  What about me?  Would I go to Ireland?  Could I work in
a visit to friends?  Rather than think of me sitting alone in my dreary little flat, she would
put everything on one side, and come rushing home.

"Dreary little flat, indeed!"  I looked round the dainty, rose-lit room, and laughed a derisive
laugh.  It was strange.  I did not feel a bit depressed.  Life in the basement flat was very
full, very interesting, of late days thrillingly exciting into the bargain.  I was not at all
sure that I wanted to go back to "Pastimes" so soon.  Christmas in the flat offered endless
possibilities.  I would have a tree!  Mrs Manners should help me.  Her children would come,
and all the Thorolds, and their father, and Mr Hallett.  There should be lots of toys, and
lots of baubles, but useful things too!  Things which should truthfully be "just what I wanted!"
Perhaps I would be noble and forgiving and ask Eric and Claudia and Moreen.  Poor mites, it
wasn't their fault that their mother wore false pearls!  The tree should be on Christmas Eve,
and on Christmas night I would invite the grown-ups to dinner, and give them a light, dainty
feast, with never a shadow of roast beef or plum pudding!  They could do their duty by convention
at the midday meal.

In two minutes' time I had thought out the whole menu, even the decorations on the table. 
What fun it would be!  How they would all enjoy it!  How little Mrs Manners would revel in
the shopping expeditions!  Her present should be a pretty blouse--something pretty, bought
with a view to what is becoming, and not to what will be useful, and wear for several seasons,
and then cut up into dusters.  An occasional extravagance is such a tonic to a feminine mind!
As for the men, Mr Thorold should have a box of cigars.  Mr Hallett should have the same. 
And in the deadliest secrecy I would commission each to buy for the other.  Then they would
be sure to get the right brand.

As for "Pastimes"--our guest tenant would be delighted to have her stay extended.  I wondered
if the gardener would pine for Bridget!  I wondered if--anyone--would pine for me!  Personally
the prospect of occasional "calls" pleased me better than the thought of meetings in the country,
under the Argus eye of village gossips.  In the latter case one would be self-conscious and
restrained; in the former, safe from observation, doubly sheltered behind wig and spectacles,
there could be no doubt as to which position afforded the better opportunity of getting to
know a man's character.

I wrote a letter to Charmion, reassuring her as to Christmas in my "dreary flat"; I tore up
the unfinished note to Delphine, and sent another, assuring her of my sympathy, repeating my
offers of help.  Poor little girl!  Her real love for "Jacky" would be in the ascendant now,
and all the pleasure and vanities for which she had pined would seem trivial things, compared
with his dear life.

I did not write to Mr Maplestone.  The difficulty of handwriting came in, and there was no
real necessity to answer his note.  If I knew Delphine, she would find it a relief to pour
forth her woes on paper.  I waited confidently for a letter to appear.

Two days passed by, three; I was growing anxious, and debating if I should write again, when
there came a loud rat-tat at the door, and a reply-paid telegram was handed in, addressed to
Miss Wastneys:--

"Letter received.  Need urgent.  Unable to leave.  Can you come to-morrow.  Beg you not to
refuse.  Delphine."

I seized a pencil, scribbled a hasty "Expect me by train arriving twelve," and having despatched
the promise, sat down to consider how I was to keep it.  What an excitement to think of feeling
young again, and being able to devote my attention to looking as nice as I could, instead of
laboriously contriving disfigurements!  Under my bed lived a box wardrobe on wheels, in which,
carefully stretched and padded to avoid creases, reposed a selection of garments which were
certainly not suited to old Miss Harding's requirement.  Mentally I reviewed them, selected
the prettiest and most becoming, saw a vision of myself putting the last touches before the
glass, with Bridget's beaming face watching every stage.  Oh, it would be an exhilarating variety,
and easy, too-- perfectly easy.  I would give the orphan leave of absence for two days, and
send her rejoicing to stay with "me aunt".  Then in leisurely enjoyment I would make my toilette
and march complacently into the street.  We possess no porter in our modest mansions; ten to
one I should pass through the hall unseen, and even if I had the ill-luck to encounter a neighbour--well,
if my disguise is good enough to deceive Ralph Maplestone, it can surely defy less interested eyes!

Bridget was as excited as I was.  She hustled the orphan out of the flat, and superintended
my toilette as eagerly as though I were dressing for a wedding, instead of a country visit.

"Praise the fates, we'll see you looking yourself again!  I never was in favour of this dressing
up, and playing tricks with a face which anyone else would be proud to have, and to take care
of.  Not that you hadn't more sense than I gave you credit for!  We've been a godsend to this
place, and if anyone doubts it, let 'em look at the kitchen book, and see the pounds of good
meat I've made into beef tea with me own hands. And you running about by day and by night,
waiting on 'em all in turns. There's no doubt but we've done good, but what I say is--why not
do it with your own face?"

"Don't be foolish, Bridget!  I couldn't do it!  Look at me now!"--I swirled round to face her,
with a rustle of silk and a flare of skirts. "Do I look the sort of person to wheel out prams,
and give tea parties to widowers, and be looked upon as a prop and support by my neighbours?"

Bridget chuckled.

"Go away wid you then!" said she, and that was the end of the discussion.

I met no one in the hall.  I met no one in the street.  I jumped into a taxi at the corner
and drove off to the station without running the remotest chance of detection.  It was so easy
that I determined to do it again!  Every now and then just for a change--just to remember what
it was like to look nice!  I arrived at the station and took my ticket. There was no one I
knew upon the platform.  I walked to the further end, and took a seat in an empty first-class
carriage.  The collector came round and looked at the tickets; there was a banging all down
the length of the train, a sharp call, "Take your seats, please; take your seats!" The door
of my compartment opened and shut.  Ralph Maplestone seated himself in the corner opposite mine!

"How do you do, Miss Wastneys," said he, as cool as a cucumber.

"How do you do, Mr Maplestone," said I, as red as a beetroot.

Was it chance?  Was it coincidence?  Was it a deep and laborious plan? Had he heard from Delphine
of my coming and rushed to town for the express purpose of returning in my company?  It looked
very like it.  My wire could not have arrived at the Vicarage until after five in the afternoon,
and the next train to town left at nine p.m.  There was also an early morning one at eight-thirty.
My brain seethed with curious questions, but there seemed only a moment's pause before I spoke
again:--

"Have you been staying in town?"

"Er--" his eyes showed a faint flicker of amusement--"not long.  You are going down to see
Delphine, I suppose.  That's good of you.  She needs bucking up.  The Vicar's pretty bad, but
with rest and change there's no reason why he shouldn't pick up.  We are arranging to make
things easy for them.  It will do him no good if she makes herself miserable."

"That's the sort of futile remark that outsiders generally make on these occasions.  They make
me furious!"  I cried, glad of an excuse to work off my self-consciousness in a show of indignation.
"Perhaps it won't; but as he belongs to her, and she loves him, she can hardly be expected
to be happy!  In illness all the sympathy is lavished on the invalid. In reality, the relations
are more to be pitied.  It's far easier to lie still and bear physical pain than it is to be
wracked with anxiety, and fatigue, and responsibility all at the same time."

He said, looking at me with an air of the most profound attention:--

"You are thinner than you were.  Your face is thinner--"

"We were not talking about my face.  How long has Mr Merrivale really been ill?"

"It's difficult to say.  He is the sort of fellow who never thinks about himself, and Delphine
is not--not exactly noticing!  I fancy she blames herself now; but he never complained, and
always went on working at full pressure, till this attack came on, and he went down with a crash."

"And now?  How does he seem now?"

His forehead wrinkled into lines.

"Depressed.  Nervous.  Inclined to be jumpy.  He has lived for his work, and hates the idea
of giving up, even for a time.  He has overtaxed his strength for years, and his nerves are
bound to play up.  However, once we get them off to the sun, he'll soon pull round."

"And when do they--"

"As soon as possible.  It is Delphine who is putting things off.  So far as Merrivale himself
is concerned, the sooner he starts the better. He'll not grow any stronger where he is.  When
are you coming back to `Pastimes'?"

"It's uncertain.  Not before Christmas.  Is your mother quite well?"

"Quite, thanks.  You know that I have made Miss Harding's acquaintance. She is a charming old
lady."

"I'm so glad you like her.  I knew you had called.  Nice little flat, isn't it?"

He growled, his face eloquent with disapproval.

"If you call it `nice' to live burrowed underground!  How sane people can consent to live in
town, herded together in a building more like a prison than a home--"

"`The goodness and the grace' did not make us all country squires!"  I said shortly, whereat
he laughed--quite an easy, genial laugh, and twinkled at me with his blue eyes.  It was extraordinary
how natural and at his ease he appeared; so different from the stiff, silent man I had known
at Escott!

The journey takes exactly sixty minutes, and we talked the whole way. For the first twenty
minutes I was on my guard, nerving myself to say "No" for the second time, with due firmness
and finality.  For the next twenty I was friendly and natural.  He was behaving so well that
he deserved encouragement.  During the third twenty I said less, stared out of the carriage
window, and felt a disagreeable feeling of irritation and depression.  He went on talking about
books and gardens and parish difficulties, and I wasn't interested one bit.  One may not wish
a man to propose to one for the second time; but, with the echo of vows of undying devotion
ringing in one's ears, it is rather daunting to go through an hour's tete-a-tete without one
personal remark!  He had said that I was thin.  Perhaps he found me changed in other ways.
Perhaps on meeting me again he found he did not like me as much as he had believed.  Perhaps
he was glad that I had said "No".  We parted at the Vicarage gate; he apparently quite comfortable
and composed, I in the lowest depths.  What a change from last time!

The door opened, and before I had time to blink Delphine's arms were round me, and a hot, wet
cheek pressed against mine.  She was sobbing in a hard, breathless way which made my heart
leap; but even on the way to her sitting-room I gathered that my first fear was unfounded.

"Jacky was--the same!  In bed.  So tired--always so tired!  Seems to care for nothing.  Hardly
even"--the blue eyes opened in incredulous misery--"for me!"

"When people are very weak, they can't care.  It takes strength even to love--at least, to
realise that one loves.  I never knew a man who adored his wife more than Mr Merrivale does
you; but I expect it suits him better just now to lie quietly and snooze rather than to hold
your hand and watch you cry."

She looked guilty at that, and tossed her head with a spice of her old spirit.  But the next
moment her breath caught in a sob, and she cried desperately:--

"Oh, Evelyn, it's all awful!  Other things--everything--far worse than you know.  I'm the most
miserable creature in the world.  I think I shall go mad.  I sent for you because--"

"Hold hard for one moment!  I'm hungry!  I need my lunch!  So do you, by the look of you. 
Shall we have it first, and tackle the serious business afterwards in your room, where we shan't
be interrupted.  There will be plenty of time; I needn't leave till five."

"I ordered cutlets, and an omelette, and coffee afterwards.  All the things you liked best
when you were here.  But I can't eat a bite.  It would choke me.  I hate the sight of food."

"Very well then--you can watch me eat mine," I said, with the callousness of one who had heard
dozens of people declare the same thing, and then watched them tuck into a square meal.  Delphine
proved another protester to add to the list.  She ate her share of the meal with no sign of
choking, and brightened into acutest interest at hearing of my escort from town.  The fork
stopped half-way to her mouth; her eyes widened to saucer size.  In the sheer surprise of the
moment she forgot her grief and anxieties.

"But--but--how could he be there?  He was here last night.  Quite late.  Ten o'clock.  Walked
down after dinner to hear how Jacky was!"

I made a vague sweeping gesture, which was designed to express a lack of all responsibility
concerning the Squire's eccentricities, but Delphine's suspicions were aroused, and she was
not to be easily put off.

"He must have gone up by the workman's train.  And yours left at eleven. How very peculiar!
And he said nothing last night. ...  Did I tell him you were coming?"  She wrinkled her brows
in the effort to remember. "Yes, I did.  He said something about taking me for a drive to freshen
me up, and I said you would be here before lunch.  Evelyn, he couldn't possibly have gone to
meet you!"

Evidently she suspected nothing.  I tried to look composed and natural, and said lightly:--

"It seems preposterous, doesn't it.  He certainly did not say so."

She stared at me curiously.

"What did you talk about?  About us?  Did he say anything about me?"

"Of course.  What do you suppose?  We had quite an argument, because he seemed to think it
a pity that you should injure yourself by fretting, and I said I didn't see how you could do
anything else."

She smiled, and tilted her head, her complacency restored.

"That was it, I suppose!  He wanted to talk to you before you saw me. He is good.  And you
argued with him, you say?  Disagreed, I suppose. Oh, well--men are always more tender-hearted
than women."

I felt annoyed, and munched in silence, staring fixedly at my plate.  If this particular man
was so much more understanding, why had she summoned me from town?

After lurch Delphine ran upstairs to see her husband for a few minutes, and then returned to
me in her little sitting-room.  He was tired, she said, and hoped to sleep until tea.  She
had not told him of my visit; he was so listless and apathetic that it worried him to talk,
or to have people talk to him.  "I don't believe he will ever be the same again!"

"People always say that in the middle of an illness, but they find their mistake later on.
After a long rest the Vicar will be better than he has been for years, and it will be your
business to see that he never works so hard again.  You were always longing for a change, Delphine.
Think how you will enjoy Switzerland, sitting out in the crisp clear air, looking at those
glorious mountains, with no house or parish to worry over--nothing to do but wait on your dear
man, and watch him growing stronger every day!"

She looked at me dumbly, while the colour faded out of her cheeks, and the pretty curved lips
twitched and trembled.  I saw her clasp her hands, and brace herself against her chair, and
knew that the moment for confession had come, and that it was difficult to find words.

"No worry!" she repeated slowly.  "No worry!  But that's just what is killing me.  I'm so worried,
so worried that I feel sometimes, Evelyn, as if I were going out of my mind!"

"You mean--about your husband?"  I asked, but the question was really put as a lead; I knew
she was not referring to illness.

Delphine shook her head.

"That is bad enough, but it is not the worst.  The worst is that through me--through my wretched,
selfish, vain, discontented folly, I--I have made it difficult for him even to get well.  I--I
have got into a horrible mess, Evelyn, and when he hears of it--when he has to hear, he will
be so worried, so miserable, so disappointed, that it will bring on a relapse, and he will
probably be worse than before.  We can neither of us be happy again--never, never, any more!"

"Sounds pretty bad!"  I said, startled.  "But there must be some way out, or you would not
have sent for me to help you.  You are going to tell me the whole truth, Delphine!  Half confidences
are no use.  You will speak honestly, and--let me speak honestly to you?"

"Oh, yes!  You will do, whether I allow you or not.  I know you!"

"Well, then"--I bent forward, staring full in her face--"let's get to the point.  Is it another
man?"

Her face answered, without the need of words.  Amazed resentment blazed out of her blue eyes.

"Another man!  I should think not!  How hateful of you, Evelyn!  I'm despicable enough, but
I love Jacky.  There's no other man in the world for me.  Of course," she paused, and faintly
smiled, as at a soothing recollection, "people admire me.  I can't help that, and there's no
harm so long as I don't flirt.  There's the Squire.  I think if I were not married, he might
want--but I am married, and it's the honest truth that I've never said a word to a man since
our marriage that I shouldn't be willing for Jacky to hear.  No! it's not that--"

"It's money, then," I said quickly.  (So the Squire would "want," would he?  Oh, indeed!) "Delphine!
you have been getting into debt?"

"Oh, how did you guess?"  She turned her head over her shoulder, as though afraid some one
might overhear.  "Oh, Evelyn, nobody knows but you.  I think I have been mad.  Goodness knows
what I expected to happen in the end.  I was in a crazy, rebellious mood, tired to death of
being dull and careful, and I had a wild spell of extravagance, ordered whatever I wanted,
ran up bills in town.  I went to your dressmaker.  I was sick of making my own clothes, and
looking a frump.  I'm young, and I'm pretty, I wanted to look nice while I could.  Every one
said I did look nice; but she is a terror, that woman of yours!  I had no idea of the bill!"

"You did not ask for estimates in advance?"

"How could I?  I didn't even know what to order.  I just said, `A pretty dress for the afternoon.'
`A hat with roses.'  `An evening cloak.' Descriptions like that.  And there was the habit,
too, and little things--oddments.  They grow into mountains!  And I bought furniture to make
my room look pretty and homelike.  You remember you said I deserved to have one nice room!"

Apparently this extravagance also could be traced to my influence!  It was useless to waste
any more words.  I went straight to the point.

"How much?"

"Oh!" she started and shivered.  "I'm ashamed to say.  And now--we are going away, and the
bills have to be paid.  I'm a new customer, and they keep sending them in.  And the house books!
They have run on.  Jacky gave me some money.  I meant to pay them, honestly I did, Evelyn,
but somehow the money frittered away till there wasn't enough left.  I paid some--but there
are others left.  Jacky would hate it, if we left the parish in debt."

"How much?"  I repeated, and she flushed to the roots of her hair.

"Over--a hundred!  Nearer--two, I'm afraid, Evelyn!"

It was more than I had expected.  I had to make fresh calculations, and revise several plans.
Subconsciously, I had known that the trouble was monetary, and had made a special study of
my pass book before leaving the flat.

"I can let you have a hundred at once, and settle the rest of the bills for you next month,
if that will do."

She looked at me with tear-filled eyes.

"Do you think I deserve it?"

"I'm not sure that you do, but Mr Merrivale does!  He shan't have any new worry just now, if
I can prevent it.  You are sure you have told me everything, Delphine?  That is all!"

"I'll show you the bills.  I knew you would help.  You were the only person I could bear to
ask; but you did not wait to be asked.  I do love you, Evelyn, and I shall never forget!  You
understand, don't you, that it is only a loan?  I shall pay you back!"

"I know you will, when you can.  It's a comfort that you need not hurry. I can wait for years."

"You will have to, I'm afraid.  Three years!  I hadn't a penny of my own when I married, but
an old aunt left us all two hundred and fifty pounds, to be paid when we were twenty-five.
That's my fortune!  Jacky teases me about it, for I was always planning what I will do when
it comes.  I had decided to buy a tiny two-seater, and learn to drive.  I told him that it
would be useful in the parish, but really I was thinking of the fun for myself.  Are you shocked?"

"Not a bit!"

"Well, it would be a waste of energy if you were, for I shall never have it now.  The money
will go to repay you--and to pay interest on the loan.  I shall pay five per cent."

"I only get four."

"I insist upon five!  I should like to feel that you had made a good investment."  She waved
her hand with a lordly air which made me laugh. And she laughed, too, with obvious enjoyment.
"Oh, my dear, what a relief!  I shall sleep happily to-night for the first time for weeks.
I can never tell you how wretched I've felt; so worried, and guilty, and trapped!  Honestly
it will be a lesson for life.  You have helped me for the moment, but my worst punishment is
to come.  When he is well again, quite strong and fit, I must tell Jacky!"  Her face clouded.
"He won't say much, but his face!  It will be an awful ordeal, but I suppose it will be good
for me!"

I thought--but did not say--that it would be good for him too.  The shock might teach him to
be more understanding in his treatment of his girl wife.

Soon after that I suggested paying a flying call on the General, and Delphine assented eagerly,
no doubt feeling, as I did myself, that it would be a relief to be spared a further tete-a-tete.
The dear old man was delighted to see me, and was eager to hear when Charmion and I were coming
back to "Pastimes".  Something in his manner, in the way his old eyes searched my face, made
me suspect that he knows.

I travelled to town alone, and arrived at the flat feeling tired and dispirited.  Bridget wanted
to know if I had seen anything of her man. She also seemed a trifle out of temper.

"Some people," she said darkly, "don't know when they are well off!"

CHAPTER TWENTY THREE.

A BRUTE--AND A REVELATION.

Christmas has come and gone.  The little girls left us a fortnight before, and the flat felt
very quiet without them, but I busied myself arranging for the fray.  The tree was a huge success;
so was the dinner next day.  Nevertheless, I shed tears on my pillow when I went to bed, for
if a solitary woman is ever justified in feeling "lone and lorn," it is certainly at the season
when everybody who possesses a family rushes to it as a matter of course.

It was very gratifying to have made other people happy, but I had a hungry longing to be made
happy myself.  By an unfortunate coincidence, neither Kathie's greeting, nor Charmion's, nor
Delphine's, arrived until the twenty-seventh, and Aunt Eliza's turkey never arrived at all,
having presumably lost its label, and been eaten by the postman as treasure trove.  The one
and only parcel from a distance came from--Mr Maplestone!  He had called the week before, and
asked permission to send evergreens from the "Hall".  He said it was so difficult to get holly
with berries on it in town, and all children loved red berries. Presumably his trees grew crackers
as well as berries, for about a dozen boxes of the most gorgeous varieties were enclosed in
the crate.  There was no letter, but just a card with "For the children," written in a corner.

On Boxing Day I made Winifred and Marion write letters of thanks--a weary process from which
they emerged splattered with tears and ink.

"Why are you laughing, Miss Harding?" they inquired resentfully.  I did not tell them that
I was chuckling at my own cleverness in avoiding a personal acknowledgment.  I did not know
that the Squire had ever seen my writing, but he might have done.  No risks should be run.

Delphine and her husband are settled at Davos, and he is beginning to improve.  She writes
sweet little letters, and I'm sure this illness has arrived at a providential moment.  The
shock of realising that her Jacky's life was in danger was like a lightning flash lighting
up a dark landscape.  In its blaze she saw revealed the true value of things, and the sloping
path on which her feet were set.  I don't expect her to grow up all at once, settle down to
all work and no play, and behave as though she were forty instead of twenty-two; I don't expect
the Vicar to give up being absent-minded and exacting; but I do honestly believe that it will
do him good to have his shock, and that he is just enough to realise his own share of the blame.
Then they will kiss and begin again, and things will go better, because there will be understanding
to leaven love.

Talking of understandings, there was a marvellous calm in the flat overhead for some nights
in early January, and Bridget informed me that Mr Nineteen had been taken to a nursing home
to have an operation. Since our tragic encounter, Mrs Nineteen (her real name is Travers) and
I have exchanged furtive bows when we have met in the hall.  I always felt guilty, and anxious
to "make it up," and had an instinct that she felt the same, though neither had the courage
to speak; but, of course, after the operation I had to stop and inquire.  She flushed, and
said, "Pretty well, thank you.  The doctors are satisfied, but it will be a long cure."  A
week later I met her coming in with a book under her arm. She had been "reading aloud.  Her
husband felt the time so long.  For an active man, it was a great trial to lie in bed."  To
judge by her face, it was an exhausting experience to his wife to sit by his side.  I said
impetuously: "If Mr Travers would allow me, I should be so glad to read aloud to him sometimes,
when you are not able to go.  I am fond of reading aloud; I believe I do it pretty well."

"I don't," she said dejectedly.  "It makes me yawn.  John says I mumble."  She looked at me
sharply, distrustfully.  "You are very kind, but--it's too much!  Why should you--"

"I'd like to, if you will let me.  I--I was rude to you--that day!  I've been remorseful ever
since.  If you'd allow me to do this, I should feel that I was forgiven."

"You spoke the truth," she said shortly.  "And I brought it on myself. I had no business to
complain about those poor children, knowing why they were here; but there are some moods in
which one is bound to have a vent.  You hurt my pride, of course, but--it's not the first time!"
She bit her lip, turned aside for a moment, then added quickly, "I didn't tell John!"

"Thank you.  I'm glad of that.  He'll be more willing to let me come. Please tell him that
I'm so sorry to have disturbed him, and want to `make up' by helping him while he is ill. 
My time is my own.  I can go any day--at any time--to read any book."

She made no promise, and for several days seemed to avoid meeting me face to face, then one
morning she came to the door and asked to see me. Some business had arisen which necessitated
a day out of town.  Her husband dreaded being left alone.  Did I really mean my kind offer,
and if so would to-morrow afternoon--

I went.  He is a dark, sharp-featured man, with thick eyebrows and a chronic scowl.  He also
looks shockingly ill, and is growing a beard. The combination is enough to strike terror into
the feminine soul.  The very maid who opened the door looked pityingly at me when I pronounced
his name; as for his nurse, she fairly bounced with relief when I was announced.  Her expression
said as plainly as words, "I've had my turn-- now you can have yours!"

"Harding?" he said graciously.  "Oh, yes!  You are the woman who bangs the doors."  He let
me read for two hours on end, and then said, "Stupid book.  I can't think how they ever get
published!" but when I left, he asked, "When will you come again?" which was as far in the
way of thanks as it is possible for him to get.

For the next three weeks I went constantly to the Home, and never once did that man say a gracious
word.  If I arrived late, he growled and said, "Thought you were never coming!  Hardly worth
beginning at all." If I was early, his greeting was, "I was just having a nap!  Haven't closed
my eyes since two this morning, and now you have roused me up!" If I read a book, he preferred
a newspaper.  If I read a newspaper, it crackled, and worried his head.  If I made a remark,
he disagreed; if I was silent, "Was there no news?--nothing going on to tell a poor wretch
tied to his bed?"  If I said he looked better, he would have me to know that nurses and doctors
alike were deluding him with lies.  He knew for a fact that he was dying fast.  If I said he
looked tired, he felt better than he had done all the week.  It was impossible to please him--impossible
to win a smile or a gracious word.  Never have I met a human being so twisted and warped in
mind.  To go into his room is like entering a black tunnel--one leaves it with the feeling
of breaking bonds.  The matron of the Home is a brisk, capable woman, with a face full of kindly
strength; we generally met and exchanged a few words on stairs or landing, and it was easy
to see that her patience was wearing thin.  There came a day when she met me with a red face,
beckoned me into her private room, and poured forth a stream of angry confidences.

"I really must speak to some one about Mr Travers.  His poor wife has enough to bear.  I can't
trouble her.  The man is insufferable; he upsets the whole house.  His nurse has just been
to me in tears. Nothing will please him.  He rings his bell all day, and half the night, and
for nothing--literally nothing!  Just an excuse to give trouble.  We have honestly done our
best--more than our best.  With such a patient it is easier to give in than to protest, but
I'm beginning to think we've been wrong.  He is not getting on as quickly as he should.  I
believe his temper is keeping him back."

"I'm sure of it!  You are an expert at healing, and I'm a beginner, but I'm a great believer
in the power of the mind.  He is poisoning himself."

"He is poisoning every one else!  I can't submit to have my whole house upset.  If he were
fit to be moved, he should be out of it to-day.  It's all I can do to be civil, and not blaze
out, and tell him what I think!"

"I shouldn't try!"

"What?"  She looked at me sharply.  "Ah!  You agree?  You feel the same? You think I dare?"

"I do.  I go a step further, and say it's your duty.  He is a bully, and probably no one has
ever dared to show him how he appears to other people, but for the time being you are in command;
while he is here, he is supposed to obey.  Give it to him hot and strong!  Tell him that he
is injuring himself, and is a misery to every one else--that you are only keeping him, because
it would do him harm to be removed."

"It's true!" she cried.  "It's every word true.  The man is a miasma." She stared at me in
sudden amaze.  "Why do you laugh?"

"Oh, I was just thinking!  Thinking of a man whom I used to denounce as bad-tempered!  A dear,
kind, thoughtful, unselfish Englishman with a--a bluster!  I can never call it temper again,
after knowing Mr Travers! He has taught me a lesson."

She laughed, too, and shrugged her shoulders.

"Oh, that!  I like a man with a will of his own, and the pluck to speak out.  A `bluster,'
as you call it, clears the air, and is quite a healthful influence; but this other!--Well,
Miss Harding, you have given the casting vote.  When are you coming again?"

"Thursday afternoon, I think.  Mrs Travers is busy then.  Has to go out of town."

"That's all right!  Then I'll have it out with him before lunch, and leave you to calm him
down in the afternoon."

"Oh--mean!"  I cried, but she only laughed, opened the door, and hustled me into the hall.
Evidently her mind was made up.

When Thursday afternoon arrived, it found Miss Harding entering the ogre's bedroom with a smile
tightly glued on her lips, and a heart beating uncomfortably fast beneath her ugly flannel
blouse.  From the bed a pair of gimlet-like eyes surveyed her sharply, pale lips twisted, and
showed a snarl of teeth.  He volunteered no remark, however, and I wasted not a second in opening
my book, and beginning to read as a refuge against conversation.  I could feel the scrutiny
of his eyes on my face, but I read on steadily, never looking up for nearly an hour, when the
story came to an end.

"Have you had enough reading for to-day, or would you care to hear one of the articles in this
review?"

He glared at me, and said coldly:--

"So you are in the conspiracy, too!  Women are all alike!  Sitting here, all smiles and flummery
to my face, and then going away to abuse me behind my back!"

"That's not true!"

I cried hotly.  "At least, it's a very unfair representation.  There was no necessity for me
to come here at all.  I have done it because you were a neighbour, and ill, and I wanted to
help you--and even more to help your wife.  As for `smiles and flummery,' as you express it,
there has been no chance of anything so friendly.  You have allowed no chance!"

"You don't deny, I suppose, that you joined with matron in abusing me as a monster of wickedness?"

"I said you had the worst temper I had ever met.  So you have.  I said I believed that you
poisoned yourself, as well as every one near you.  So I do.  All the more credit to me for
giving you so much of my time."

He lay silent, staring into my face.  It was plain that the man had received a shock.  For
once in his life he had been shown a picture of himself as others saw him, and in the seeing
something had been hurt-- conscience, vanity, amour-propre--it was impossible to say which,
and now his brain was at work, trying to assimilate the new thought.  All the time I had been
reading, he had been pondering and raging.  Probably he had not heard a single word.

"You women," he began again.  "You women!  Talk of ministering angels-- all very fine for a
few days, while the novelty lasts--after that a poor beggar can suffer tortures, and get nothing
but revilings for bad temper.  Would you be an angel of meekness if you had to go through what
I am bearing now?"

"I should probably be exceedingly difficult and fretful.  At times! There would be other times--especially
when I was getting better--when I should feel overflowing with gratitude, and should say so,
to the people who had been patient with me through the bad times!"

"Words!  Words!" he snarled scornfully.  "Men judge by deeds.  If you want my character, you
can hear it from the men with whom I have had to do.  I am a Churchman.  I go to church every
Sunday of my life.  I was once Vicar's churchwarden for three years."

Poor Vicar!  What those three years must have been!  I have known whole parishes "set by the
ears" by just one warped, self-opinionated man, who put his own pet theories before anything
else, and went about sowing dissension--splitting up a hitherto united people into two opposing
camps.  I said, with an air of polite inquiry:--

"And--did you part good friends?"

He did not answer, but the expression on his face was eloquent enough. I knew, without being
told.  Suddenly he broke out at a fresh tangent.

"I suppose my wife--"

I held up my hand authoritatively.

"No, please!  Don't blame your wife.  She has never mentioned you, except to pity and sympathise.
Her one thought has been for you--how to help, how to please.  Of course, Mr Travers, the people
here and myself have only known you lately, and this illness must have been coming on for some
time.  Probably it has--well, it has made you bad-tempered, hasn't it?  But your wife knew
you before, when you were loving and gentle, so her judgment must be more true."

With my usual "softness" I was beginning to pity the poor wretch, and to try to let him down
gently; but once again his face was eloquent.  At the words "loving and gentle," an involuntary
grimace twisted the grim features.  Memory refused to reproduce the picture.  He said abruptly:--

"My wife is a good woman.  That virago of a matron told me this morning that if she'd been
in her place, she'd have run away years ago.  Well, Mary has stuck to me.  She doesn't want
to go!  It's not always the softest-spoken men who make the best husbands.  That Hallett fellow,
whom Thorold is so thick with--he belongs to my club; I knew something about him when I lived
in America long ago.  How do you suppose he treated his wife?"

"His wife?  He hasn't got a wife!"

"Oh, hasn't he?  Not now, perhaps.  But he had!  A little of him went a long way.  She ran
away from him on her honeymoon.  What do you think of that?  What kind of a man can he have
been to make a woman leave him in a month?"

Something happened inside my head.  There was a shock, a whirl, a blinding darkness, followed
by a flash of light.  Mr Travers had said "America," and the word had a terrible significance.
I sat stunned into silence, and Mr Travers obviously gloated over my discomfiture.

"Pretty condemning, eh?  She was an heiress--pots of money. Fine-looking girl, too.  I saw
her once.  Too pale and washed out for my taste, but with an air.  Forget her name--something
high-flown and romantic, like herself.  Well, she left him, and that was the end of it. Never
heard a word of her since."

Romantic name--an heiress--fine-looking--pale.  One by one the clues accumulated--step by step
the evidence mounted up.  I said faintly:--

"Has he tried?"

"Tried to find her?  Searched the world!  Almost went off his head, I believe.  He'd made a
mess of it, of course, but he was crazy about her--broken his heart ever since.  You can see
it in his face.  My wife has no patience with her.  She'd married for better or worse.  Whatever
happened, she was a poor thing to throw up the sponge in a month. What's the matter?  You look
faint."

"I--I am!  I must go.  Some other day," I gasped vaguely.  I went out into the passage, and
sat down on an oak chest.  The world seemed rocking around me.  I was so stunned that I could
not feel!

CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.

IT'S A QUEER WORLD.

Edward Hallett and--Charmion!  Charmion and--Edward Hallett!  The combination of those two
names struck me dumb.  Oh, it was madness--the most inconceivable, the most preposterous madness.
And yet, and yet-- the more I thought, the more the links seemed to "fit in".  He was of the
right age, the right nationality: the few words of description which had fallen from her lips
applied accurately to his appearance.

I went home, and sat in stunned silence, staring into space.  I went to bed and lay awake for
hours, still pondering, still puzzling.  I rose in the morning, and wandered about the flat
like a lost dog, unable to work, unable to rest, unable to eat.  By evening I was in such a
state of nerves that it seemed impossible to endure the suspense a moment longer.  The prospect
of another wakeful night gave the final touch to my impatience.  I scribbled a note to Mr Thorold,
begging him to come down at once, and sent the orphan upstairs to deliver it.

He came at once; quite anxious and perturbed.  Was I ill?  Had I had bad news?  Was there anything
he could do?  I motioned him to a chair, and began vaguely:--

"Not bad news--at least--a shock!  I've had a shock!  It has distressed me terribly!  I couldn't
sleep.  It was Mr Travers.  I was reading to him again yesterday, and he said something about
Mr Hallett.  It appears that he knew him years ago."

Mr Thorold's face hardened.  I had seen him in almost every phase of sadness and anxiety, but
never with that flash in the eye, that sternness of the lips.  His voice was cold and sharp.

"Travers?  Indeed!  And what had Travers to say?  Nothing good, if I know the man."

"He--he spoke of Mr Hallett's wife--"

"And you were not aware that he had a wife?  It is an old story, Miss Harding; an old sore.
Is it necessary to tell one's whole life history to--er--an--"

"An acquaintance?  No, no--of course not.  Don't think me presumptuous and inquisitive.  I
should never have mentioned it, if I had not a reason--a good reason.  Have I ever seemed to
pry into your affairs?"

He softened at that.

"Never!  Never!  You have been all that is tactful--all that is kind.  I do trust you, Miss
Harding, but this affair of Hallett's gets me on the raw.  He has suffered tortures.  I have
seen his suffering, and I can't help feeling bitter against that woman.  She--left him!  That's
what you heard, I suppose?"

"Yes.  And so soon!  It was a tragedy indeed.  Mr Thorold, will you answer just one question?
It can do no harm; it can give away no secrets.  What was her Christian name?"

He looked at me keenly for a moment, and then said quietly:--

"Charmion."

I lay back in my chair, and shut my eyes.  Never in my life have I fainted, but I think I must
have come very near it then.  Everything turned black; for a moment my very heart seemed to
stop.  Mr Thorold's voice sounded far away, as he cried anxiously:--

"You are ill--faint!  I'll open the window--give you more air."  Then with an eagerness which
could not be suppressed, "You know her? Hallett's wife?  Is it possible?  You have met her;
or--have you only heard--"

His anxiety made his voice shake.  He was as much overcome as I was myself.

"For six years," he added tragically--"six years he has searched the world--."

"I--I know a Charmion.  She left her husband.  It may be a coincidence, but it seems strange.
She had good cause--"

"Oh, I don't deny it.  Enough to alienate any woman.  I don't wonder at her going--at first--but,
it was cruel to give him no chance to explain."

"It was about money.  He pretended to love her for herself, to know nothing about her fortune,
and afterwards--a letter came.  That is my Charmion's story.  Is it his?"

"Yes! yes! this is a wonderful thing!  That the discovery should have come through you, and
that you should have appealed to me of all people--the only man on this side who can tell you
the truth!  Is it coincidence, Miss Harding?"

I clasped my hands to still their trembling.

"Better than coincidence!  It is Providence.  We have prayed for them, you and I, for the friends
we love most, and now--now it seems as if through us--Oh, Mr Thorold, explain!  Explain!  You
believe in him still, yet you confess that he was wrong.  What `explanation' can he give!"

"I love Hallett," he said solemnly, "like a brother--more than a brother!  I believe him to
be, at this moment, the best man I know.  We were at school together.  He was the only son
of a wealthy man.  Until he was twenty-one he was brought up in an atmosphere of such luxury
as we in England can hardly imagine.  Americans are fond of going `one better' than the rest
of the world.  In some cases the extravagance of their moneyed classes amounts to profligacy.
Hallett's father was a notorious example for many years, then--just as Edward came of age,
there was a colossal smash; he lost everything, practically fretted himself to death, left
the lad to fight his own way.

"To expect the boy to understand economy after such an upbringing was preposterous.  He literally
did not understand the value of money.  He got into debt, more and more deeply into debt, as
the years went on.  I am not defending him as blameless; of course, he should have pulled up,
faced the worst, and started afresh; but I do say that it was a hard test, and that he had
many excuses."

I nodded.  Ideas of economy, like most other ideas, are comparative.  I have never known fabulous
riches, but I should manage badly as a poor woman.  Up to this point I could sympathise with
Edward Hallett.  Mr Thorold continued eagerly:--

"Well! just when matters were at their worst, a casual acquaintance happened to speak of a
young English heiress, and it occurred to Edward for the first time that marriage might cut
the knot.  He arranged to meet the girl--it was a deliberate plan.  Ah!  I see you have heard
her story; but what she evidently did not, would not, understand, was, that when they did meet,
he fell in love with her for herself!  She was his mate, his ideal, the one woman in the world
who had power to awake his best self; to make him selfless, and in earnest about life.  He
was overcome with shame at the remembrance of his own scheming.  At one time he believed it
to be his duty to punish himself by leaving her without saying a word, but his passion was
too strong, and circumstances hurried on the marriage.  Her aunt died--"

"Yes.  She told me.  Oh, but why did he pretend?  Why didn't he tell her that he knew about
the money?"

His face fretted into lines.  He looked terribly distressed.

"Ah! that hits me hard.  He wrote to me, Miss Harding--we had kept up a correspondence at intervals
since our school days--and he had an exaggerated faith in my advice.  His conscience was torturing
him.  He put the whole case to me.  Should he tell her--should he confess?  He hated the idea
of marrying under false pretences.  On the other hand he hated, as any lover would hate, to
lower her opinion, perhaps to plant the seeds of future suspicions.  Her silence as to her
own wealth seemed to show that she had dreaded a mercenary love, that it was sweet to her to
feel that he was in ignorance.  He guessed that she was storing up the news as a sweet secret
to be revealed to her husband.  Well, as I say, he put the whole case before me, and I--I advised
him to keep silent.  He had wronged her in intent, but not in deed, for no man could love more
deeply, more disinterestedly than he then loved her.  Every word proved that.  It was a wonderful
letter, written straight from the heart--"

I interrupted in breathless haste:--

"Have you got it?  Did you keep it?  Can you find it now?"

To my unspeakable relief he nodded his head.

"I can.  It's not often that I keep letters, but this was an exception. I was naturally anxious
about giving the right advice.  I put the letter in my pocket-book, to read and re-read.  Then,
just the day before the wedding, I caught a chill, was in bed for a month with pleurisy.  The
first news I heard on getting up was--that she had gone!  At once I thought of the letter,
and was thankful I had kept it; I locked it away in my safe.  I felt that some day, when she
was found--Later on I wrote to her lawyers, and tried to bully them into giving me her address.
I meant to send it to her myself, and force her to believe.  But they swore that they knew
no more than I did myself.  Liars!"

"No!  It was true.  She was ill for months; in bed! absolutely cut off--"

"Ah, well!"  He shrugged helplessly.  "We were all at cross purposes, it seems.  I believed
that they were lying, and would continue to lie.  I never tried them again.  But the letter
is there in my safe, and it is his best witness, Miss Harding.  Where is she?  How do you come
to know her?"

"She's in Italy.  She's coming home.  To me.  She's my friend.  We--we live together.  Not
here, but in the country.  We share a house--"

He stared.  I realised how incongruous the arrangement must appear.  I realised something else,
too, and that was that the time had come when to this man, at least, Miss Harding must show
herself in her true colours.  Charmion must hurry home.  I must wire to demand her presence.
Happiness was waiting for her, and not one day, one hour, should the darling wait in ignorance.
The dreary little flat was about to become the scene of blissful reconciliation; of a new radiance
of life and hope.  It was not conceivable that I could mar the sacredness of such a time by
masquerading in an assumed character.  As Mr Thorold was bound to know, it would simplify arrangements
if he knew at once!

I jumped up; tingling with excitement, almost too impatient to speak.

"Mr Thorold--this is a most adventurous afternoon!  I have something to tell you about myself.
It will explain how it comes about that Charmion and I--Wait for me here for a quarter of an
hour.  I'll come back,--but there is something I must do first.  You'll understand when I come
back. Please wait!"

I hurried out, rang for Bridget, ordered her to get rid of the orphan, and come back to help.
The wardrobe was pulled from beneath the bed, off came spectacles and wig, my face was washed
free from the disfiguring marks, my hair was coiled, a dainty blue gown slipped over my head.
The quarter of an hour grew into a half, the sound of pacing footsteps sounded through the
wall.  I laughed, slipped my feet into satin slippers, and threw open the drawing-room door.

He had his back towards me at that moment; he wheeled round, started, stared, made a curious
jerking bow.  His face showed no sign of recognition, only surprise and a veiled impatience.

"Mr Thorold, I believe?"  I said smiling.

His forehead knitted into lines; he stared more closely.

"Billy's father, I believe?"  I said, smiling more broadly.  "The man who ate up my sandwiches!"

"Oh! you--you--you minx!" he gasped loudly.

Oh! it was gloriously amusing!  Edward Hallett and Charmion were nowhere for the moment; he
could do nothing but gasp and stare, walk round me, examine me from one point of view and then
another, gasp and exclaim again.

"You--; you are Miss Harding!  Miss Harding was you!  Am I dreaming, or is this real life?
How did you do it?  Why did you do it?  But your mouth is a different shape!  This beats anything
I ever knew!  You used to look round-shouldered.  Why?  Why?  Why?  How could you be so mad?"

Then I made him sit down, and told him the whole story from the beginning; and, like every
one else, he disapproved violently at first, and then, by slow degrees, came round to my own
point of view.  Like Bridget, he wanted to know why I couldn't play fairy godmother to the
"Mansions" with my own face; but when I asked him if I could have done so much for him, he
acknowledged hastily that I could not.  His expression, half horrified, half shy, spoke more
eloquently than his words.

"No! you see it would not have worked.  Old Miss Harding had a pull over Evelyn Wastneys. 
My name is Evelyn Wastneys, by the way, but that is a secret between us for the moment.  And
I am Charmion Fane's friend, just as you are Edward Hallett's, and the good, good God is going
to give us the joy of seeing them happy together again.  Mr Thorold! they have both been to
blame, they have both had a share in spoiling their own lives--we won't give them another chance!
You and I, as staid, level-headed outsiders, are going to stage-manage their reconciliation."

"How are we going to manage it?"

"Listen!"  I said.  "Listen!"

It's a queer world.  It's a very queer world!  People have said so before, but I wish to say
it again, to shout it aloud at the pitch of my voice.

Hardly had I changed back into Miss Harding, and finished my evening meal, when a knock came
to the door, and there entered Mrs Travers. Furious!  She had returned from her day in the
country; had seen her husband that afternoon; had heard from his lips what I had dared to think
and to say!  If she had been defending a homing dove, she could not have been more outraged,
more aflame.  She wished me to understand, once and for all, that for the future no communication,
no acquaintance of any kind was possible between us.  She would pass me by in the street without
a glance.

Oh, very well!

CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.

TWO GLORIFIED BEINGS.

I wired to Charmion, "Return at once.  Urgently needed," and her reply came back with all possible
speed, "Meet me Euston--Thursday".  I knew she would come!  She would imagine that the need
was mine, and, bless her! would speed night and day to my aid.  And what would she find?  My
reeling brain refused to realise the dramatic scenes which lay ahead!

After much cogitation I determined to close the flat, and take a small suite of rooms at an
hotel for the next week.  Under the circumstances, it would be a relief to be among strangers,
and away from interested neighbours who might take it into their heads to pay a call at the
most crucial moment, to say nothing of the orphan and her friends in adjoining flats, who would
be exercised about the strange doings in the basement flat!

So it was as Evelyn Wastneys that I sallied to Euston on that eventful Thursday, and a somewhat
tired and sleepy Charmion was obviously a trifle disappointed to find that she was not to be
taken "home."

"I have had such a dose of hotels!"

"Darling, you talked of my `dreary little flat!'"

"And you wrote back that it was a bower!  It has suited you--it is easy to see that, and your
mad scheme has been a success.  You were very vague in your reports; gave me no particulars."

"You didn't want letters.  For a long time you didn't write at all."

"Oh, well!  Now we can talk.  You must tell me all your adventures.  You look well--very well!
What's the trouble, Evelyn?"

"I never said it was trouble."

She looked at me sharply, fearfully.  Instead of being reassured, my answer seemed to have
excited her fears.

"Not trouble!  Then--Evelyn! what is it?  Tell me quickly.  Don't quibble!  Are you in love--engaged?"

"Don't be absurd.  I've been Miss Harding, remember!  Wait till you see me!  I had lessons
in making up, and I really look the part.  In love, indeed!"

But I knew that my colour was mounting, I could feel the burn of it in my cheeks.  Charmion's
lips twitched, and her dear eyes grew misty and sad.

"It's hateful of me, but--I don't want to lose you!  I'd be a lonely soul!"

I put my hand over hers, but said nothing.  Her words had saddened me, for they accurately
described my own feelings.

"You are well--there is no trouble--you are not in love.  Then what was the urgent need?"

"Are you sorry to be here?"

"Yes! if you are going to prevaricate and hedge.  I've thrown every plan to the winds to come
tearing back.  The least you can do--"

"I know!--I know!  And I will--after dinner.  Give me till eight o'clock, to enjoy you, and
to calm my nerves.  It's good news, but--it upsets our plans.  I needed you here to talk over
and to arrange.  Can't you leave business, and just be `homey' with me for an hour or two,
after all this time?"

She laughed.  How good it was to hear that soft, low laugh, and to feast my eyes on her exquisite
self!  Even after a two days' journey Charmion looked elegant.  I believe she would look well
groomed on a desert island.  Some women seem born with this gift.  It wasn't given to me. 
I can be untidy on the slightest provocation!

"Indeed I can.  There's any amount of chit-chat to get through, apart from serious problems.
You have done me out of my Paris shopping, Evelyn, but I've a box full of trophies for you
all the same.  Wherever I went, I picked up some token to prove that I remembered you all the
time."

"Oh! cheers! cheers!"  I cried fervently.  "That's a good hearing!  It is more blessed to give
than to receive, but now and then, as a variety, it is refreshing to have an innings one's self!"

She laughed at that, gripped my arm, and said:--"Oh, Evelyn, you are a dear!  It's good to
be with you.  It's good to be back."  And we chatted in great contentment for the rest of the
drive.

There were several hours to spare before dinner.  I made Charmion take a bath, and then go
really and truly to bed, until seven o'clock, when I woke her and issued orders for her prettiest,
most becoming frock, grey, of course, a mist of silver and cloudy gauze.  When she came into
the little sitting-room she looked fresh and radiant--younger than I had ever beheld her. 
Looking at her, I was suddenly reminded of a line in one of dear Robert Louis Stevenson's beautiful
prayers--"Cleanse from our hearts the lurking grudge!"  How can any immortal being, made in
God's own image, expect to be happy and healthful while he or she is cherishing bitter grudging
feelings against a fellow-man?  Charmion's battle had been a long, up-hill fight, but it was
won at last.  The sign of victory was in her face.  Now for the victor's crown!

Dinner was cleared away.  The waiter placed coffee on a small table and disappeared.  Charmion
piled up the cushions at one end of the sofa, nestled against them, and said smilingly:--

"Now!  I've been very patient, but not another moment can I wait. There's an air of mystery
about you, Evelyn, a muffled excitement which intrigues me vastly.  Oh! you've tried very hard!
you kept up the chatter, but it's been hard work.  Your thoughts have strayed; half the time
you have not heard my replies.  Your eyes are dark and big-- dilated, like an excited child's!
If you had not denied it so stoutly, I should feel convinced that there was a man--"

"My dear, this concerns you, not me.  Charmion, can't you guess?  It is wonderful, wonderful
news.  Can't you imagine whom it is about?  You told me your story, but not his name--your
name!  When I heard it, it conveyed nothing to me.  When I met him--"

She held out her hands, as if to ward off a blow.  After all my fencing, the great news had
come blurting out, without preface or preparation. White as a sheet, she stared at me with
anguished eyes.

"Met!  You?  Edward?  You have met, and--spoken?"

"I know him well.  He is a close friend, almost a brother of the man whose child was ill, and
whom I helped to nurse--another tenant in the flats.  I think I mentioned him--a darling child.
We thought he would die.  We grew intimate, comforting one another, waiting day after day--"

"You mentioned me?  He recognised the name?"

"No!  I was Miss Harding.  Evelyn and her life were things apart.  I have never spoken of them
to my neighbours.  It was pure chance--pure Providence!"

"But he knows?  You have told him.  He knows I am here?"

"Not yet.  You had to know first, and to hear--to read his defence; but he is to know to-night.
His friend will tell him.  It will break your heart, Charmion, for you have done him a wrong,
and have wasted all these years; but it will fill you with joy as well, for at last you can
believe--you must believe in his loyalty.  It is there for you to see, in a letter to his friend,
received just before you were married.  Mr Thorold has kept it--he gave it to me, so that you
might see it with your own eyes."

But still she sat motionless, half paralysed, it would appear, by the suddenness, the unexpectedness
of the revelation, making no effort to take the letters which I held out.  I put them into
her hand, speaking in slow, gentle tones:--

"Read, darling--read!  There are two letters, for Mr Thorold has drafted out the substance
of his own reply.  He feels that much of the responsibility lies on his shoulder.  It is such
a joy to him--such a joy!--to feel that he has this chance to `make good'.  It's not a dream,
darling--it's true!  The long, long nightmare is over; read your letters and--wake up!"

I pressed the envelope into her slack hands, kissed her cold cheek, and hurried from the room.
She must be alone when she read those healing words; even the dearest friend would be an intruder
at that moment!

My own heart was beating at express speed as I descended the stairs, and walked along the corridors
which led to the drawing-room.  I did not hurry, but rather intentionally lingered by the way.
The great mirrors on the walls reflected a bright-eyed, eager girl, whom even at this engrossed
moment it was a pleasure to recognise as myself.  I am so tired of the reflection of old Miss
Harding!

In a far corner of the room the two men were waiting.  Mr Thorold came quickly forward.  I
nodded, and he took his friend by the arm, and led him towards the door.  Edward Hallett's
face was fixed--tense with emotion.  He glanced neither to right nor to left--was oblivious
of the outer world.  Mr Thorold was to lead him to the room where Charmion sat, close the door,
and leave them face to face.  Hardly would she have finished reading the letters than her husband
would stand before her. Oh, what a meeting--what a meeting!  What a rolling away of the stone!
Thank God for giving me my share in bringing it about!

Wenham Thorold came back, and sat by my side.  We were both shaking with excitement, but we
talked resolutely to pass the time.  I asked him if Mr Hallett had been told of my dual personality,
and he smiled, and said:--

"Oh, yes, he was interested--as much interested as he could be in anything outside!  But not
surprised!  He and I were constantly puzzled by your extraordinary youth!  The get-up was excellent,
but your manner, your movements--they did not belong to an elderly woman.  Circumstances favoured
you, of course!  You were naturally quiet and reserved on our first meeting, and then Billy's
illness cast a gloom over us all.  Every one seems older in a period of anxiety; but as soon
as the cloud lifted your vitality asserted itself."  He looked at me anxiously.  "This--this
reunion will make a difference to your life?  It will take away your friend."

"Yes, it will.  My friends all go," I said a little bitterly.  "I am trying not to think of
myself, but only to rejoice for her; but it is hard!"

"That house in the country!  You shared it together?  Couldn't you make it your home instead
of the flat?  It would be more--suitable.  This fairy godmother scheme is possible for a few
months, with a home in the background, to which you can return at any moment, but now that
you will be alone, you are too young.  It does not seem right.  Couldn't you"--he looked at
me apologetically--"carry on the same work in the country in your own name?  Make the house
a country resort for lame dogs who need a rest, for example?  There would be plenty of applicants."

"It's impossible!  I can't explain.  I can never return to `Pastimes' alone."  I spoke shortly.
The subject was difficult.  So far, I had not thrashed it out even in thought.  Mr Thorold
shot a quick, keen glance. Instinctively, I knew where his thoughts were wandering.  He was
thinking of the bluff country Squire who had been so kind to his own little girls, remembering
that he came from the same neighbourhood; that Evelyn Wastneys and he had been friends.

The stupid colour flamed in my cheeks.  I made haste to turn the conversation from myself.

"It will make a difference to you, too.  You will miss your friend!"

"Yes, but--I have borne the great loss, Miss Wastneys; I can spare him gladly, to his joy.
When one has known the completeness of a real marriage, and then been left alone, it would
be impossible to grudge--My friends urge me to marry again; my girl herself said she wished
it.  If I had been less completely happy, I might have done it for the children's sake.  As
it is, I can never put another in her place.  But I need a woman in my life.  I feel that--but
I want a mother, a sister, not a wife.  Can't you evolve a real Miss Harding, who will look
after me and my poor bairns?"

It was an hour later when the message came summoning us to return to the sitting-room.  The
two were standing to receive us--glorified beings, exalted above the earth.  Oh, I can't write
about it!  We clung together.  They spoke glowing words of love and thanks and appreciation;
they looked past us into each other's eyes.  It was wonderful, wonderful; but, oh, it made
me feel desperately, desperately lonely!

CHAPTER TWENTY SIX.

LOVE'S A NEW LIFE.

Late that night, after the two men had left, Charmion and I sat together over the bedroom fire,
and talked and talked.  Her lips were opened now, and she could talk without the old restraint.
It seemed a relief to her to talk.  I asked if "Edward" had ever discovered who was the sender
of the fatal letter.  "No," she said, "not actually.  He is practically certain, but he did
not trouble to bring it home.  The mischief was done.  Anyone who had a heart must have been
sufficiently punished by the knowledge of the misery she had caused.  He left her to that,
but, oh!  Evelyn, what a conception of love! to try to poison a man's home because he had chosen
another woman as his wife!  Not that I am much better!  I have no right to speak."

Her lips quivered.  She confessed to me that, on reading the two letters, she had been overcome
with sorrow and remorse, but that Edward had refused to listen to her laments.  They had both
been wrong; each had an equal need of forgiveness, the suffering in either case had been intense--not
another moment must be wasted!  Away with bitterness, away with remorse, the future lay ahead,
it should not be wasted in vain regrets.  Then, blushing and aglow, she told me her plans.
"To-morrow-- to-day," she raised her eyes to the clock, and glowed anew, "we are going by train
to a sunny bay in Cornwall, to spend a second honeymoon. Edward's writing engagement could
be fulfilled better in the country than in town.  He had lingered in London for Thorold's sake,
not his own.  One month, two months to themselves, they must have, and then"-- she straightened
herself as in eager anticipation--"America!  I must take him back, Evelyn!  Back to his old
home, and his old friends--to let them all see!  Oh! all my life must be spent in making good
the shame I have brought upon him, the misery and blame!"

I laid a restraining touch on her arm.

"Remember you are not to grieve!  You have promised.  That is forbidden ground!"

"Yes--yes, I know, but my heart, Evelyn!  My heart will always remember."  She turned to me
tenderly.  "Darling girl! we talked about you--it is through you that this happiness has come.
We cannot be parted.  When we are settled in our new home we want you to come over, to pay
us a long, long visit.  You could see your sister, too.  You would enjoy that?"

I felt a momentary rising of bitterness, a momentary impulse to say caustically that it would
indeed be soothing for a lonely woman to visit two devoted married couples, but there was a
wistful tone in her voice which showed that she understood.  I made a big effort to laugh naturally,
and made a vague promise.  This was Charmion's night.  I should be a poor thing if I damped
her joy!

"And about `Pastimes,'" she said slowly.  "The agreement stands, of course.  I pay half expenses
for the next three years.  Live in it, lend it, rent it as you think best.  I should love best
to think of you living there, until you come to us.  You could find some friend--"

"Oh, yes!  I have made enough friends at the `Mansions' to keep me supplied with visitors for
months to come.  If I go back.  But I'm not sure.  This has come upon me with a rush, Charmion.
I shall have to sit down, and think quietly.  I shall see you again before you sail?"

"Of course."  She looked at me with reproach.  "You are the dearest person in the world to
me, Evelyn--except one.  Do you suppose I could leave England without seeing you again?  We'll
arrange a meeting somewhere, and have a week together.  You and I, and Mr Thorold, and Edward."
She turned a sudden scrutinising glance upon me.  "Evelyn, I have a haunting conviction that
you are changed; that some man has come into your life.  You aren't by any possibility going
to marry Wenham Thorold?"

"Indeed I am not.  He hasn't the faintest desire to marry me, or I to marry him.  We are excellent
friends, but nothing more.  I honestly believe he regrets Miss Harding.  You are growing too
personal, my dear. I shall go to bed."

She laughed, kissed me, but refused to move.

"I'm not tired.  I don't want to sleep.  Sleep means forgetfulness," she said.  "It will rest
me more to remember!"

I left her leaning forward, with hands clasped round her knees, gazing into the fire.

Charmion left the next morning, and I prepared, with the strangest reluctance, to turn back
into Miss Harding, and return to the basement flat.  For the last week I had been living in
an atmosphere of romance, which had put me out of tune with ordinary life.  Bridget showed
her usual understanding.  "'Deed, I always did say a wedding was the most upsetting thing in
life!" she declared.  "A funeral's not in it for upsetting your nerves, and setting you on
to grizzle, the same as a wedding.  Not that Mrs Fane's--Hallett, I suppose--was a wedding
exactly, but it sort of churned you up more than if it was.  To see her all a-smiling and a-flushing,
and looking so young!  Her as always held herself so cold.  And now to have to go back to live
underground, with you mumping about in a shawl!"

"Cheer up, Bridget dear," I said soothingly.  "It won't be for long.  I feel myself that I
need a change.  Perhaps we'll go to Ireland.  The Aunts are grumbling because I don't go. 
Just a few weeks more, while I think things over and make my plans.  Make the best of it, there's
a good soul!"

She looked at me, more in sorrow than in anger.

"I'll make the best of it, with the best, when there's a call to do it," she said firmly; "but
you'll only be young once, my dear.  You may throw away things now as you'll pine to get back
all the days of your life.  When you're thinking things over just remember that!"  She stumped
from the room, leaving me to digest her words.

The next week passed heavily.  I saw little of Mr Thorold, and suspected that the revelation
of Evelyn would work against further intimacy.  It was impossible that he could feel the same
freedom and ease; impossible that he should commandeer my help as he had done in days past.
There was no blame attached to the position, it was natural and inevitable; but the loss of
the easy, pleasant intercourse left a gap in my life.

Mrs Manners had gone with her children to visit her mother; Mrs Travers cut me in the hall.
Poor Miss Harding was having a bad time! Nobody needed her; her absence had passed unnoticed;
her return awoke no welcome.  Bridget besought me to go out and amuse myself, but I obstinately
refused to go, and stayed glued in the flat.  Not for worlds would I have acknowledged it to
a living creature, but--I was afraid that while I was out some one might call.  Ralph Maplestone
had said that business would bring him to town.  Now that the Merrivales were in Switzerland,
and that anxiety was off his hands, he could come when he liked.  If he did not come it must
be because he did not like!

The reflection did not help to raise my spirits, nor to pass the long-houred days; but it did
give me an insight into my own heart.  For the first time I was honest with myself, and acknowledged
that I wanted him to come!  I faced the possibility that I might wait in vain, and felt suddenly
faint and weak.  It had come to this, that I needed his strength, that I felt it impossible
to face life without him by my side.  I determined, if he did come, to show signs of weakness
in my resolution; possibly to go so far as to arrange a meeting with my niece.
