[11] Such a sledge, drawn by the national team of three horses, will hold five or six persons

[12] The word he used, mytárstvo, has a peculiar meaning. It refers specifically to the experiences
of the soul when it leaves the body. According to the teaching of divers ancient fathers of
the church, the soul, as soon as it leaves the body, is confronted by accusing demons, who
arraign it with all the sins, great and small, which it has committed during its earthly career.
If its good deeds, alms, prayers, and so forth (added to the grace of God), offset the evil,
the demons are forced to renounce their claims. These demons assault the soul in relays, each
"trial," "suffering," or "tribulation" being a mytárstvo. One ancient authority enumerates
twenty such trials. The soul is accompanied and defended in its trials by angels, who plead
its cause. Eventually, they conduct it into the presence of God, who then assigns to it a temporary
abode of bliss or woe until the day of judgment. The derivation of this curious and utterly
untranslatable word is as follows: Mytár means a publican or tax-gatherer. As the publicans,
under the Roman sway over the Jews, indulged in various sorts of violence, abuses, and inhuman
conduct, calling every one to strict account, and even stationing themselves at the city gates
to intercept all who came and went, mytárstvo represents, in general, the taxing or testing
of the soul, which must pay a ransom before it is released from its trials and preliminary
tribulations.--TRANSLATOR.

[13] A folk-tale narrates how the Tzar Arkhídei obtained his beauteous bride by the aid of
seven brothers called "The Seven Semyóns," who were his peasants. The bride was distant a ten
years' journey; but each of the brothers had a different "trade," by the combined means of
which they were enabled to overcome time and space and get the bride for their master.--TRANSLATOR.

of Russian Literature" (I. F. Hapgood). This particular ballad is mentioned on page 22 of the

whatever can be had concerning these ballads or this ballad.--I.F.H.)

[24] Ecclesiastics are regarded as plebeians by the gentry or nobles in Russia.--TRANSLATOR.

[25] In the Catholic Church of the East the communion is received fasting. A little to one
side of the priest stands a cleric holding a platter of blessed bread, cut in small bits, and

by each communicant after the Holy Elements, in order that there may be something interposed

priest with the sacramental spoon. --TRANSLATOR.

[27] Turgénieff labelled this story and "A Reckless Character," "Fragments from My Own Memoirs

Petróvsky Park and Palace. Here the disaster took place during the coronation festivities of
the present Emperor.--TRANSLATOR.

[42] It is very rarely that a bishop performs the marriage ceremony. All bishops are monks;
and monks are not supposed to perform ceremonies connected with the things which they have
renounced. The exceptions are when monks are appointed parish priests (as in some of the American
parishes, for instance), and, therefore, must fulfil the obligations of a married parish priest;
or when the chaplain-monk on war-ships is called upon, at times, to minister to scattered Orthodox,
in a port which has no settled priest.--TRANSLATOR.

fine a voice he may possess. The deacon, on the contrary, or the proto-deacon (attached to

the top of his lungs. He sometimes cracks his voice--which is what the sympathetic neighbour
was hinting at here.--TRANSLATOR.
