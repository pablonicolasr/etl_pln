The relations of the bishop to the inhabitants of the cities during the period we are considering
were pretty nearly such as described in the first part of this paper. He stood forth as protector
of the weak and the oppressed; as mediator between an unfortunate prisoner and an unjust judge
who was seeking his private interest rather than following the spirit of impartial justice;
or between a downtrodden vassal and the almost unlimited power of his feudal superior. He lessened
the severity of harsh judgments, he protested the imposition of unjust fines and penalties.
In very many cases he was even appointed by the king or his representatives as co-judge to
assist the judex or the missus in hearing cases where oppression or injustice was to be feared.
But it is important for us to avoid confusing this kind of jurisdiction with that which he
enjoyed in the century after he had attained the power and the office of count, and had combined
the religious functions of head of the diocese with the secular ones of political ruler of
the city. Any judicial authority possessed by the bishop at this earlier period was not in
virtue of any political position he himself held, but came to him entirely in what might be
called an extraordinary manner, that is, by delegation from the king, for definite specified
occasions. As an example of this extraordinary delegated jurisdiction, I will refer to a document
in the Archivio of the Canons of Arezzo[79] of the year 833, relating to the judgment of a
dispute between "Petrum Episcopum Arretinum et Vigilium Abatem Monasterii Sancti Antemi," situated
in the territory of Chiusi, over a privilege ceded to that monastery by Lewis the Pious in
813.[80] The bishop of Arezzo gained a favorable decision from a court constituted of some
judices, missi of the emperor, and of the bishops of Florence, Volterra and Siena, Agiprandus,
Petrus and Anastasius. According to the terms of the document with regard to the composition
of this court, the bishops sitting in it were "directi a Hlotario magno Imperatore"; and their
powers are several times referred to as being "juxta jussionem et Indiculum Domni Imperatoris."
Here, as in all other similar cases, we see plainly that there is no indication of any purely
personal jurisdiction.

That the influence of the bishop in affairs of state at this period was only of an individual,
extra-official character can be seen also from the fact that the king considered the bishops
themselves to be under his judicial jurisdiction in all secular matters, just as the lesser
clergy came under the jurisdiction of the judices:[81] and further, that after the election
to a church, the decision of the judex must confirm the choice of the community in order to
render it valid.[82] All disputes also between bishops and their clergy, between members of
the body of clergy, and between these and members of the laity, were settled by the royal authority;[83]
and what is most significant, there was a universal and freely used right of appeal for the
clergy or laity from the decision of a bishop to the person of the king, who seems to have
exhibited no hesitation in modifying or reversing sentences, even in matters relating to purely
clerical discipline.[84]

Even in the time of the Franks, when the consideration shown to the church and its representatives
was much greater than under any of the Lombard kings, we find Charlemagne,[85] on suspicion
of infidelity to his government, having sent to him and retaining as prisoners the bishops
"Civitatis Pisanae seu Lencanae" and Pottoni, Abbot of the monastery of Volturno; and Lewis
the Pious[86] sends into exile "Ermoldo Nigello Abatis," and in the year 818 several other
bishops, including Anselmus "Mediolanensis Archiepiscopus," "Wolfoldus Cremonensis" and "Theodolphus
Amelianensis."[87] None of these restrictions and limitations, however, although they arose
chiefly from the strong opposition always existing between the local temporal rulers of the
people and their spiritual rulers, could hinder the bishops from occupying that important position
of mediators and of protectors of the people which we have ascribed to them.

Turning now to a consideration of the earliest steps which may be said to have cleared the
way for the political power of the bishops, we are met by a subject which, though of great
interest in itself, is not sufficiently a part of this investigation for us to do more than
indicate the lines of its progress. This subject is the development of the practice of giving
certain immunities and privileges to churches and monasteries, adopted by the Frankish kings,
faithful sons of the church, and then followed by all their royal and imperial successors.
In considering the important influence exercised by these immunities on the development of
the espiscopal power and the effects of this on the growth of the communes, there are two essential
facts which we must always keep prominently in mind. In the first place we must remember that
the granting of immunities was a question of privilege to particular individuals or ecclesiastical
institutions, and not a universal grant which affected in an equal degree all the dioceses
of the realm. This led to the marked differences in rank and importance which existed between
the various bishoprics, and in the tenth century, when the temporal power became in many cases
an adjunct to the spiritual, caused some bishops to become powerful temporal princes, while
others, unable to gain this pre-eminence, remained simply spiritual heads of their respective
dioceses. So in the contest between the counts and the bishops we find the latter only victorious
in certain cases, and consequently having only certain of the cities under their jurisdiction;
a fact which is illustrated as late as the Peace of Constance, where in the ninth article the
cities are still divided into episcopal and non-episcopal cities.[88] In the second place we
must keep clearly before us an important fact, the truth of which any chronological account
of the development of the principle of immunity would easily demonstrate, namely, that with
the advance of time and with the growth of that principle, the changes which took place in
the different sorts of immunities were not simply those of degree, but essentially and principally
those of kind.

A descendant of Charlemagne may have granted to some monastery or bishopric a greater alleviation
of some of the fiscal burdens borne by it under his immediate predecessor, but a successor
of Berenger when he granted a privilegium did not simply perform the negative benefit of alleviating
burdens; he endowed the head of the bishopric--probably in return for some service he had received
at his hands or expected to receive--with the positive benefit of the political headship and
possession of some city or district of a former count. I mean by this that the earlier immunities--and
in these are included all given during the period we are discussing--were all of them what
are termed simple or ordinary immunities; that is, those which deal with exemption--whether
from burdens for which the receivers would otherwise be liable, or from jurisdiction to which
they would otherwise have been subjected--of what may properly be called the private possessions
of the churches concerned. They had nothing to do with the privileges of a later time, by which
a power to exact burdens was granted and a positive jurisdiction over others allowed: that
is, public functions bestowed rather than private rights conceded.

That a distinction of such a character was a difference of kind and not of degree is so plainly
apparent that it is unnecessary to dwell longer upon it, and it only remains for us to consider
briefly the chronology of some of the changes that took place. If we adhere strictly to the
proper signification of the terms used, the development can be somewhat succinctly described
by the simple enumeration of the three characteristic features of its progress, viz. protection,
exemption, privilege that is jurisdiction or temporal power; and the three periods which are
covered respectively by the prominence of these ideas can be roughly stated to be: for the
first, the reigns of Charlemagne and his successors down to the time of Charles the Bald--including
any indication of this idea which we may find during the reigns of the last rulers of the first
Lombard kingdom; for the second, the reigns of Charles the Bald, Karloman, and Charles the
Fat; and for the third, the full development of the episcopal power in the tenth century, down
to the period of its final decline, and the rise of actual municipal government within the
communes.

It is doubtful whether immunities of any importance were granted even by the latest kings of
the Lombards, before the invasion of the Franks. Under the first Lombard monarchy the church
held a very subordinate position with regard to the state, and if privileges were granted to
any of its members, they had attached to them no greater meaning than the simple extension
to them of the mundibrium of the king, such as was often allowed to private individuals; that
is, they were simply grants of royal protection, and were not similar to the later grants which
included both protection and privilege.[89]

With the advent of Frankish rule under Charlemagne, marked consideration immediately appears
for the church and its representatives. Ascending still higher in the scale, we come at last to
man—man, the highest, noblest workmanship of God on earth—the lord of this sphere terrene—for
whose behoof all earthly things exist. In common with all animals, he has that perfect adaptation
of part to part, and of all the parts to general objects, which demonstrate consummate wisdom in the Cause
which thus adapted them. His eyes are so placed as to look the same
way in which his feet are placed to walk, and his hands to toil. Consequently the aim of every
bishop and of every abbot was to obtain for the possessions of his diocese or his convent an
exemption more or less complete from the civil administration of the neighboring secular ruler.
For a long time there was no thought in the mind of the bishop of gaining for himself the functions
of temporal jurisdiction, but simply that the power of the count should be restrained with
regard to church property, that is, that he should not be able to exercise his judicial control
over lands belonging to the church, except by the express permission, "per licentia data,"
and with the concurrence of the bishop himself. This and nothing more is what is meant by all
of the charters of exemption granted by the Carlovingian rulers, down to the time of Charles
the Bald, when, as we shall presently see, a change was introduced.
