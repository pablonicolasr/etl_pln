There was not a word of remonstrance, though the boy looked very disconsolate, and began to
murmur the moment his father had gone. Albinia, who had regarded protection at a dentist's
one of the offices of the head of a family, though dismayed at the task, told Gilbert that
she would come with him in a moment. Whenever the green hills,
bright and fresh, their peaks populated by dense forests of dwarf oak, and the remaining villas
and rustic dishes of different inks brochures. Whenever the depth of the microscopic valleys vegetable
spray a stream any jumper. Life in the country is in those places, yet sweet simplicity, quiet joy
and variety of poetic harmony.

Once through the mountains reaches its climax, there is a tendency to produce double the slope of a hill,
whose waters turn in the opposite direction. one is inclined to the east in search of the Ebro,
others participate to form the center of the beautiful river valley Besaya sea than Santander.


Mr. Bowles was amazed at the sight of Mrs. Kendal, and so elaborate in compliments and assurances
that Mrs. Bowles would do herself the honour of calling, that Albinia, pitying Gilbert, called
his attention back.

With him the apothecary was peremptory and facetious.  'He had expected that he should soon
see him after his papa's return!'  And with a 'soon be over,' he set him down, and Albinia
bravely stood a desperate wringing of her hand at the tug of war.  She was glad she had come,
for the boy suffered a good deal, and was faint, and Mr. Bowles pronounced his mouth in no
state for a ride to Tremblam.

'I must go,' said Gilbert, as they walked home, 'I wish papa would listen to anything.'

'He would not wish you to hurt yourself.'

'When papa says a thing--' began Gilbert.

'Well, Gilbert, you are quite right, and I hope you don't think I mean to teach you disobedience.
But I do desire you, on my own responsibility, not to go and catch an inflammation in your
jaw. I'll undertake papa.'

Gilbert at once became quite another creature.  He discoursed so much, that she had to make
him restore the handkerchief to his mouth; he held open the gate, showed her a shoal of minnows,
and tried to persuade her to come round the garden before going in, but she clapped her hands
at him, and hunted him back into the warm room, much impressed and delighted by his implicit
obedience to his father. With Lucy and Sophy, his remaining seemed likewise to make a great
sensation; they looked at Mrs. Kendal and whispered, and were evidently curious as to the result
of her audacity.  Albinia, who had grown up with her brother Maurice and cousin Frederick,
was more used to boys than to girls, and was already more at ease with her son than her daughters.

Gilbert lent a ready hand with hammer and chisel, and boxes were opened, to the great delight
and admiration of the girls.  They were all very happy and busy setting things to rights, but
Albinia was in difficulty how to bestow her books.  There was an unaccountable scarcity both
of books and book-cases; none were to be seen except that, in a chiffoniere in the drawing-room,
there was a row in gilded bindings, chiefly Pope, Gray, and the like; and one which Albinia
took out had pages which stuck together, a little pale blue string, faded at the end, and in
the garlanded fly-leaf the inscription, 'To Miss Lucy Meadows, the reward of good conduct,
December 20th, 1822.' The book seemed rather surprised at being opened, and Albinia let it
close itself as Lucy said, 'Those are poor mamma's books, all the others are in the study.
Come in, and I'll show you.'
