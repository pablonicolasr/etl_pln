6.  Does the reader suppose that that was the end of it?  Does he suppose those diffident Fishers
we: satisfied?  Let the evidence show.  The Fishers were quiet just two years.  Then they came
swarming up out of the fertile swamps of Florida with their same old documents, and besieged
Congress once more.  Congress capitulated on the 1st of June, 1860, and instructed Mr. Floyd
to overhaul those papers again, and pay that bill. A Treasury clerk was ordered to go through
those papers and report to Mr. Floyd what amount was still due the emaciated Fishers.  This
clerk (I can produce him whenever he is wanted) discovered what was apparently a glaring and
recent forgery in the paper; whereby a witness's testimony as to the price of corn in Florida
in 1813 was made to name double the amount which that witness had originally specified as the
price!  The clerk not only called his superior's attention to this thing, but in making up
his brief of the case called particular attention to it in writing.  That part of the brief
never got before Congress, nor has Congress ever yet had a hint of forgery existing among the
Fisher papers. Nevertheless, on the basis of the double prices (and totally ignoring the clerk's
assertion that the figures were manifestly and unquestionably a recent forgery), Mr. Floyd
remarks in his new report that "the testimony, particularly in regard to the corn crops, DEMANDS
A MUCH HIGHER ALLOWANCE than any heretofore made by the Auditor or myself."  So he estimates
the crop at sixty bushels to the acre (double what Florida acres produce), and then virtuously
allows pay for only half the crop, but allows two dollars and a half a bushel for that half,
when there are rusty old books and documents in the Congressional library to show just what
the Fisher testimony showed before the forgery--viz., that in the fall of 1813 corn was only
worth from $1.25 to $1.50 a bushel.  Having accomplished this, what does Mr. Floyd do next?
Mr. Floyd ("with an earnest desire to execute truly the legislative will," as he piously remarks)
goes to work and makes out an entirely new bill of Fisher damages, and in this new bill he
placidly ignores the Indians altogether puts no particle of the destruction of the Fisher property
upon them, but, even repenting him of charging them with burning the cabins and drinking the
whisky and breaking the crockery, lays the entire damage at the door of the imbecile United
States troops down to the very last item!  And not only that, but uses the forgery to double
the loss of corn at "Bassett's Creek," and uses it again to absolutely treble the loss of corn
on the "Alabama River."  This new and ably conceived and executed bill of Mr. Floyd's figures
up as follows (I copy again from the printed United States Senate document):

      The United States in account with the legal representatives
                      of George Fisher, deceased.

He puts everything in this time.  He does not even allow that the Indians destroyed the crockery
or drank the four dozen bottles of (currant) wine. When it came to supernatural comprehensiveness
in "gobbling," John B. Floyd was without his equal, in his own or any other generation. Subtracting
from the above total the $67,000 already paid to George Fisher's implacable heirs, Mr. Floyd
announced that the government was still indebted to them in the sum of sixty-six thousand five
hundred and nineteen dollars and eighty-five cents, "which," Mr. Floyd complacently remarks,
"will be paid, accordingly, to the administrator of the estate of George Fisher, deceased,
or to his attorney in fact."

But, sadly enough for the destitute orphans, a new President came in just at this time, Buchanan
and Floyd went out, and they never got their money.  The first thing Congress did in 1861 was
to rescind the resolution of June 1, 1860, under which Mr. Floyd had been ciphering. Then Floyd
(and doubtless the heirs of George Fisher likewise) had to give up financial business for a
while, and go into the Confederate army and serve their country.

Were the heirs of George Fisher killed?  No.  They are back now at this very time (July, 1870),
beseeching Congress through that blushing and diffident creature, Garrett Davis, to commence
making payments again on their interminable and insatiable bill of damages for corn and whisky
destroyed by a gang of irresponsible Indians, so long ago that even government red-tape has
failed to keep consistent and intelligent track of it.

Now the above are facts.  They are history.  Any one who doubts it can send to the Senate Document
Department of the Capitol for H. R. Ex. Doc. No. 21, 36th Congress, 2d Session; and for S.
Ex. Doc. No. 106, 41st Congress, 2d Session, and satisfy himself.  The whole case is set forth
in the first volume of the Court of Claims Reports.

It is my belief that as long as the continent of America holds together, the heirs of George
Fisher, deceased, will still make pilgrimages to Washington from the swamps of Florida, to
plead for just a little more cash on their bill of damages (even when they received the last
of that sixty-seven thousand dollars, they said it was only one fourth what the government
owed them on that fruitful corn-field), and as long as they choose to come they will find Garrett
Davises to drag their vampire schemes before Congress.  This is not the only hereditary fraud
(if fraud it is--which I have before repeatedly remarked is not proven) that is being quietly
handed down from generation to generation of fathers and sons, through the persecuted Treasury
of the United States.
