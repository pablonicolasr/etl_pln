In 1773 some of the Pietist monks were still living in their rude monastery whose ruins are
visible on the banks of the Wissahickon. Chief among these mystics was an old man who might
have enjoyed the wealth and distinction warranted by a title had he chosen to remain in Germany,
but he had forsworn vanities, and had come to the new world to pray, to rear his children,
and to live a simple life. Some said he was an alchemist, and many believed him to be a prophet.
The infrequent wanderer beside the romantic river had seen lights burning in the window of
his cell and had heard the solemn sound of song and prayer. On a winter night, when snow lay
untrodden about the building and a sharp air stirred in the trees with a sound like harps,
the old man sat in a large room of the place, with his son and daughter, waiting. For a prophecy
had run that on that night, at the third hour of morning, the Deliverer would present himself.
In a dream was heard a voice, saying, "I will send a deliverer to the new world who shall save
my people from bondage, as my Son saved them from spiritual death." The night wore on in prayer
and meditation, and the hours tolled heavily across the frozen wilderness, but, at the stroke
of three, steps were heard in the snow and the door swung open. The man who entered was of
great stature, with a calm, strong face, a powerful frame, and a manner of dignity and grace.

"Friends, I have lost my way," said he. "Can you direct me?"

The old man started up in a kind of rapture. "You have not lost your way," he cried, "but found
it. You are called to a great mission. Kneel at this altar and receive it."

The stranger looked at the man in surprise and a doubt passed over his face. "Nay, I am not
mad," urged the recluse, with a slight smile. "Listen: to-night, disturbed for the future of
your country, and unable to sleep, you mounted horse and rode into the night air to think on
the question that cannot be kept out of your mind, Is it lawful for the subject to draw sword
against his king? The horse wandered, you knew and cared not whither, until he brought you here."

"How do you know this?" asked the stranger, in amazement.

"Be not surprised, but kneel while I anoint thee deliverer of this land."

Moved and impressed, the man bowed his knee before one of his fellows for the first time in
his life. The monk touched his finger with oil, and laying it on the brow of the stranger said,
"Do you promise, when the hour shall strike, to take the sword in defence of your country?
Do you promise, when you shall see your soldiers suffer for bread and fire, and when the people
you have led to victory shall bow before you, to remember that you are but the minister of
God in the work of a nation's freedom?"

With a new light burning in his eyes, the stranger bent his head.

"Then, in His name, I consecrate thee deliverer of this oppressed people. When the time comes,
go forth to victory, for, as you are faithful, be sure that God will grant it. Wear no crown,
but the blessings and honor of a free people, save this." As he finished, his daughter, a girl
of seventeen, came forward and put a wreath of laurel on the brow of the kneeling man. "Rise,"
continued the prophet, "and take my hand, which I have never before offered to any man, and
accept my promise to be faithful to you and to this country, even if it cost my life."

As he arose, the son of the priest stepped to him and girt a sword upon his hip, and the old
man held up his hands in solemn benediction. The stranger laid his hand on the book that stood
open on the altar and kissed the hilt of his sword. "I will keep the faith," said he. At dawn
he went his way again, and no one knew his name, but when the fires of battle lighted the western
world America looked to him for its deliverance from tyranny. Years later it was this spot
that he revisited, alone, to pray, and here Sir William Howe offered to him, in the name of
his king, the title of regent of America. He took the parchment and ground it into a rag in
the earth at his feet. For this was Washington. MARION

Blooming and maidenly, though she dressed in leather and used a rifle like a man, was Marion,
grand-daughter of old Abraham, who counted his years as ninety, and who for many of those years
had lived with his books in the tidy cabin where the Youghiogheny and Monongahela come together.
This place stood near the trail along which Braddock marched to his defeat, and it was one
of the stragglers from this command, a bony half-breed with red hair, called Red Wolf, that
knocked at the door and asked for water. Seeing no one but Marion he ventured in, and would
have tried not only to make free with the contents of the little house but would have kissed
the girl as well, only that she seized her rifle and held him at bay. Still, the fellow would
have braved a shot, had not a young officer in a silver-laced uniform glanced through the open
door in passing and discovered the situation. He doffed his chapeau to Marion, then said sternly
to the rogue, "Retire. Your men are waiting for you." Red Wolf slunk away, and Washington,
for it was he, begged that he might rest for a little time under the roof.

This request was gladly complied with, both by the girl and by her grandfather, who presently
appeared, and the fever that threatened the young soldier was averted by a day of careful nursing.
Marion's innate refinement, her gentleness, her vivacity, could not fail to interest Washington,
and the vision of her face was with him for many a day. He promised to return, then he rode
forward and caught up with the troops. He survived the battle in which seven hundred of his
comrades were shot or tomahawked and scalped. One Indian fired at him eleven times, and five
of the bullets scratched him; after that the savage forbore, believing that the officer was
under Manitou's protection. When the retreating column approached the place where Marion lived
he hastened on in advance to see her. The cabin was in ashes. He called, but there was no answer.
When he turned away, with sad and thoughtful mien, a brown tress was wrapped around his finger,
and in his cabinet he kept it until his death, folded in a paper marked "Marion, July 11, 1755."
