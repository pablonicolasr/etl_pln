But, what indeed is the Universe, if it be not THE ALL, not yet created by THE ALL having separated
itself into fragments? What else can it be-- of what else can it be made? This is the great
question. Let us examine it carefully. We find here that the "Principle of Correspondence"
(see Lesson I.) comes to our aid here. The old Hermetic axiom, "As above so below," may be
pressed into service at this point. Let us endeavor to get a glimpse of the workings on higher
planes by examining those on our own. The Principle of Correspondence must apply to this as
well as to other problems.

Let us see! On his own plane of being, how does Man create? Well, first, he may create by making
something out of outside materials. But this will not do, for there are no materials outside
of THE ALL with which it may create. Well, then, secondly, Man pro-creates or reproduces his
kind by the process of begetting, which is self-multiplication accomplished by transferring
a portion of his substance to his offspring. But this will not do, because THE ALL cannot transfer
or subtract a portion of itself, nor can it reproduce or multiply itself--in the first place
there would be a taking away, and in the second case a multiplication or addition to THE ALL,
both thoughts being an absurdity. Is there no third way in which MAN creates? Yes, there is--he
CREATES MENTALLY! And in so doing he uses no outside materials, nor does he reproduce himself,
and yet his Spirit pervades the Mental Creation.

Following the Principle of Correspondence, we are justified in considering that THE ALL creates
the Universe MENTALLY, in a manner akin to the process whereby Man creates Mental Images. And,
here is where the report of Reason tallies precisely with the report of the Illumined, as shown
by their teachings and writings. Such are the teachings of the Wise Men. Such was the Teaching
of Hermes.

THE ALL can create in no other way except mentally, without either using material (and there
is none to use), or else reproducing itself (which is also impossible). There is no escape
from this conclusion of the Reason, which, as we have said, agrees with the highest teachings
of the Illumined. Just as you, student, may create a Universe of your own in your mentality,
so does THE ALL create Universes in its own Mentality. But your Universe is the mental creation
of a Finite Mind, whereas that of THE ALL is the creation of an Infinite. The two are similar
in kind, but infinitely different in degree. We shall examine more closely into the process
of creation and manifestation as we proceed. But this is the point to fix in your minds at
this stage: THE UNIVERSE, AND ALL IT CONTAINS, IS A MENTAL CREATION OF THE ALL. Verily indeed,
ALL IS MIND!

    "THE ALL creates in its Infinite Mind countless Universes,
    which exist for aeons of Time--and yet, to THE ALL, the
    creation, development, decline and death of a million Universes
    is as the time of the twinkling of an eye."--The Kybalion.

    "The Infinite Mind of THE ALL is the womb of Universes."--The
    Kybalion.

The Principle of Gender (see Lesson I. and other lessons to follow) is manifested on all planes
of life, material mental and spiritual. But, as we have said before, "Gender" does not mean
"Sex" sex is merely a material manifestation of gender. "Gender" means "relating to generation
or creation." And whenever anything is generated or created, on any plane, the Principle of
Gender must be manifested. And this is true even in the creation of Universes.

Now do not jump to the conclusion that we are teaching that there is a male and female God,
or Creator. That idea is merely a distortion of the ancient teachings on the subject. The true
teaching is that THE ALL, in itself, is above Gender, as it is above every other Law, including
those of Time and Space. It is the Law, from which the Laws proceed, and it is not subject
to them. But when THE ALL manifests on the plane of generation or creation, then it acts according
to Law and Principle, for it is moving on a lower plane of Being. And consequently it manifests
the Principle of Gender, in its Masculine and Feminine aspects, on the Mental Plane, of course.

This idea may seem startling to some of you who hear it for the first time, but you have all
really passively accepted it in your everyday conceptions. You speak of the Fatherhood of God,
and the Motherhood of Nature--of God, the Divine Father, and Nature the Universal Mother--and
have thus instinctively acknowledged the Principle of Gender in the Universe. Is this not so?

But, the Hermetic teaching does not imply a real duality--THE ALL is ONE--the Two Aspects are
merely aspects of manifestation. The teaching is that The Masculine Principle manifested by
THE ALL stands, in a way, apart from the actual mental creation of the Universe. It projects
its Will toward the Feminine Principle (which may be called "Nature") whereupon the latter
begins the actual work of the evolution of the Universe, from simple "centers of activity"
on to man, and then on and on still higher, all according to well-established and firmly enforced
Laws of Nature. If you prefer the old figures of thought, you may think of the Masculine Principle
as GOD, the Father, and of the Feminine Principle as NATURE, the Universal Mother, from whose
womb all things have been born. This is more than a mere poetic figure of speech--it is an
idea of the actual process of the creation of the Universe. But always remember, that THE ALL
is but One, and that in its Infinite Mind the Universe is generated, created and exists.

It may help you to get the proper idea, if you will apply the Law of Correspondence to yourself,
and your own mind. You know that the part of You which you call "I," in a sense, stands apart
and witnesses the creation of mental Images in your own mind. The part of your mind in which
the mental generation is accomplished may be called the "Me" in distinction from the "I" which
stands apart and witnesses and examines the thoughts, ideas and images of the "Me."  "As above,
so below," remember, and the phenomena of one plane may be employed to solve the riddles of
higher or lower planes.

Is it any wonder that You, the child, feel that instinctive reverence for THE ALL, which feeling
we call "religion"--that respect, and reverence for THE FATHER MIND? Is it any wonder that,
when you consider the works and wonders of Nature, you are overcome with a mighty feeling which
has its roots away down in your inmost being? It is the MOTHER MIND that you are pressing close
up to, like a babe to the breast.

Do not make the mistake of supposing that the little world you see around you--the Earth, which
is a mere grain of dust in the Universe--is the Universe itself. There are millions upon millions
of such worlds, and greater. And there are millions of millions of such Universes in existence
within the Infinite Mind of THE ALL. And even in our own little solar system there are regions
and planes of life far higher than ours, and beings compared to which we earth-bound mortals
are as the slimy life-forms that dwell on the ocean's bed when compared to Man. There are beings
with powers and attributes higher than Man has ever dreamed of the gods' possessing. And yet
these beings were once as you, and still lower--and you will be even as they, and still higher,
in time, for such is the Destiny of Man as reported by the Illumined.

And Death is not real, even in the Relative sense--it is but Birth to a new life--and You shall
go on, and on, and on, to higher and still higher planes of life, for aeons upon aeons of time.
The Universe is your home, and you shall explore its farthest recesses before the end of Time.
You are dwelling in the Infinite Mind of THE ALL, and your possibilities and opportunities
are infinite, both in time and space. And at the end of the Grand Cycle of Aeons, when THE
ALL shall draw back into itself all of its creations--you will go gladly for you will then
be able to know the Whole Truth of being At One with THE ALL. Such is the report of the Illumined--those
who have advanced well along The Path.

And, in the meantime, rest calm and serene--you are safe and protected by the Infinite Power
of the FATHER-MOTHER MIND.

    "Within the Father-Mother Mind, mortal children are at
    home."--The Kybalion.

    "There is not one who is Fatherless, nor Motherless in the
    Universe."--The Kybalion.

CHAPTER VI

THE DIVINE PARADOX

    "The half-wise, recognizing the comparative unreality of
    the Universe, imagine that they may defy its Laws--such
    are vain and presumptuous fools, and they are broken against
    the rocks and torn asunder by the elements by reason of
    their folly. The truly wise, knowing the nature of the Universe,
    use Law against laws; the higher against the lower; and by
    the Art of Alchemy transmute that which is undesirable into
    that which is worthy, and thus triumph. Mastery consists not
    in abnormal dreams, visions and fantastic imaginings or
    living, but in using the higher forces against the lower--escaping
    the pains of the lower planes by vibrating on the higher.
    Transmutation, not presumptuous denial, is the weapon of the
    Master."--The Kybalion.

This is the Paradox of the Universe, resulting from the Principle of Polarity which manifests
when THE ALL begins to Create--hearken to it for it points the difference between half-wisdom
and wisdom. While to THE INFINITE ALL, the Universe, its Laws, its Powers, its life, its Phenomena,
are as things witnessed in the state of Meditation or Dream; yet to all that is Finite, the
Universe must be treated as Real, and life, and action, and thought, must be based thereupon,
accordingly, although with an ever understanding of the Higher Truth. Each according to its
own Plane and Laws. Were THE ALL to imagine that the Universe were indeed Reality, then woe
to the Universe, for there would be then no escape from lower to higher, divineward--then would
the Universe become a fixity and progress would become impossible. And if Man, owing to half-wisdom,
acts and lives and thinks of the Universe as merely a dream (akin to his own finite dreams)
then indeed does it so become for him, and like a sleep-walker he stumbles ever around and
around in a circle, making no progress, and being forced into an awakening at last by his falling
bruised and bleeding over the Natural Laws which he ignored. Keep your mind ever on the Star,
but let your eyes watch over your footsteps, lest you fall into the mire by reason of your
upward gaze. Remember the Divine Paradox, that while the Universe IS NOT, still IT IS. Remember
ever the Two Poles of Truth the Absolute and the Relative. Beware of Half-Truths.

What Hermetists know as "the Law of Paradox" is an aspect of the Principle of Polarity. The
Hermetic writings are filled with references to the appearance of the Paradox in the consideration
of the problems of Life and Being. The Teachers are constantly warning their students against
the error of omitting the "other side" of any question. And their warnings are particularly
directed to the problems of the Absolute and the Relative, which perplex all students of philosophy,
and which cause so many to think and act contrary to what is generally known as "common sense."
And we caution all students to be sure to grasp the Divine Paradox of the Absolute and Relative,
lest they become entangled in the mire of the Half-Truth. With this in view this particular
lesson has been written. Read it carefully!
