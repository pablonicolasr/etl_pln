The Taming of Red Butte Western

I

COLLARS-AND-CUFFS

The windows of the division head-quarters of the Pacific Southwestern at Copah look northward
over bald, brown mesas, and across the Pannikin to the eroded cliffs of the Uintah Hills. The
prospect, lacking vegetation, artistic atmosphere, and color, is crude and rather harshly aggressive;
and to Lidgerwood, glooming thoughtfully out upon it through the weather-worn panes scratched
and bedimmed by many desert sandstorms, it was peculiarly depressing.

"No, Ford; I hate to disappoint you, but I'm not the man you are looking for," he said, turning
back to things present and in suspense, and speaking as one who would add a reason to unqualified
refusal. "I've been looking over the ground while you were coming on from New York. It isn't
in me to flog the Red Butte Western into a well-behaved division of the P. S-W."

The grave-eyed man who had borrowed Superintendent Leckhard's pivot-chair nodded intelligence.

"That is what you have been saying, with variations, for the last half-hour. Why?"

"Because the job asks for gifts that I don't possess. At the present moment the Red Butte Western
is the most hopelessly demoralized three hundred miles of railroad west of the Rockies. There
is no system, no discipline, no respect for authority. The men run the road as if it were a
huge joke. Add to these conditions the fact that the Red Desert is a country where the large-calibred
revolver is----"

"Yes, I know all that," interrupted the man in the chair. "The road and the region need civilizing--need
it badly. That is one of the reasons why I am trying to persuade you to take hold. You are
long on civilization, Howard."

"Not on the kind which has to be inculcated by main strength and a cheerful disregard for consequences.
I'm no scrapper."

To the eye of appraisal, Lidgerwood's personal appearance bore out the peaceable assertion
to the final well-groomed detail. Compactly built and neatly, brawn and bulk were conspicuously
lacking; and the thin, intellectual face was made to appear still thinner by the pointed cut
of the closely trimmed brown beard. The eyes were alert and not wanting in steadfastness; but
they had a trick of seeming to look beyond, rather than directly at, the visual object. A physiognomist
would have classified him as a man of studious habit with the leisure to indulge it, and unconsciously
he dressed the part.

In his outspoken moments, which were rare, he was given to railing against the fate which had
made him a round peg in a square hole; a technical engineer and a man of action, when his earlier
tastes and inclinations had drawn him in other directions. But the temperamental qualities;
the niceties, the exactness, the thoroughness, which, finding no outlet in an artistic calling,
had made him a master in his unchosen profession, were well known to Mr. Stuart Ford, first
vice-president of the Pacific Southwestern System. And, it was largely for the sake of these
qualities that Ford locked his hands over one knee and spoke as a man and a comrade.

"Let me tell you, Howard--you've no idea what a savage fight we've had in New York, absorbing
these same demoralized three hundred miles. You know why we were obliged to have them. If the
Transcontinental had beaten us, it meant that our competitor would build over here from Jack's
Canyon, divide the Copah business with us, and have a line three hundred miles nearer to the
Nevada gold-fields than ours."

"I understand," said Lidgerwood; and the vice-president went on.

"Since the failure of the Red Butte 'pocket' mines, the road and the country it traverses have
been practically given over to the cowmen, the gulch miners, the rustlers, and the drift from
the big camps elsewhere. In New York and on the Street, Red Butte Western was regarded as an
exploded cartridge--a kite without a tail. It was only a few weeks ago that it dawned upon
our executive committee that this particular kite without a tail offered us a ready-made jump
of three hundred miles toward Tonopah and Goldfield. We began buying quietly for the control
with the stock at nineteen. Naturally the Transcontinental people caught on, and in twenty-four
hours we were at it, hammer and tongs."

Lidgerwood nodded. "I kept up with it in the newspapers," he cut in.

"The newspapers didn't print the whole story; not by many chapters," was the qualifying rejoinder.
"When the stock had gone to par and beyond, our own crowd went back on us; and after it had
passed the two-hundred mark, Adair and I were fighting it practically alone. Even President
Brewster lost his nerve. He wanted to make a hedging compromise with the Transcontinental brokers
just before we swung over the summit with the final five hundred shares we needed."

Again Lidgerwood made the sign of assent.

"Mr. Brewster is a level-headed Westerner. He doubtless knew, to the dotting of an 'i,' the
particular brand of trouble you two expansionists were so eager to acquire."

"He did. He has a copper property somewhere in the vicinity of Angels, and he knows the road.
He contended that we were buying two streaks of rust and a right-of-way in the Red Desert.
More than that, he asserted that the executive officer didn't live who could bring order out
of the chaos into which bad management and a peculiarly tough environment had plunged the Red
Butte Western. That's where I had him bested, Howard. All through the hot fight I kept saying
over and over to myself that I knew the man."

"But you don't know him, Stuart; that is the weak link in the chain."

Lidgerwood turned away to the scratched window-panes and the crude prospect, blurred now by
the gathering shadows of the early evening. In the yards below, a long freight-train was pulling
in from the west, with a switching-engine chasing it to begin the cutting out of the Copah
locals. Over in the Red Butte yard a road-locomotive, turning on the table, swept a wide arc
with the beam of its electric headlight in the graying dusk. Through the half-opened door in
the despatcher's room came the diminished chattering of the telegraph instruments; this, with
the outer clamor of trains and engines, made the silence in the private office more insistent.

When Lidgerwood faced about again after the interval of abstraction there were fine lines of
harassment between his eyes, and his words came as if speech were costing him a conscious effort.

"If it were merely a matter of technical fitness, I suppose I might go over to Angels and do
what you want done with the three hundred miles of demoralization. But the Red Butte proposition
asks for more; for something that I can't give it. Stuart, there is a yellow streak in me that
you seem never to have discovered. I am a coward."

The ghost of an incredulous smile wrinkled about the tired eyes of the big man in the pivot-chair.

"You put it with your usual exactitude," he assented slowly; "I hadn't discovered it." Then:
"You forget that I have known you pretty much all your life, Howard."

"You haven't known me at all," was the sober reply.

"Oh, yes, I have! Let me recall one of the boyhood pictures that has never faded. It was just
after school, one hot day, in the Illinois September. Our crowd had gone down to the pond back
of the school-house, and two of us were paddling around on a raft made of sawmill slabs. One
of the two--who always had more dare-deviltry than sense under his skull thatch--was silly
enough to 'rock the boat,' and it went to pieces. You couldn't swim, Howard, but if you hadn't
forgotten that trifling handicap and wallowed in to pull poor Billy Mimms ashore, I should
have been a murderer."

Lidgerwood shook his head.

"You think you have made your case, but you haven't. What you say is true enough; I wasn't
afraid of drowning--didn't think much about it, either way, I guess. But what I say is true,
also. There are many kinds of courage, and quite as many kinds of cowardice. I am a coward of men."

"Oh, no, you're not: you only think you are," protested the one who thought he knew. But Lidgerwood
would not let that stand.

"I know I am. Hear me through, and then judge for yourself. What I am going to tell you I have
never told to any living man; but it is your right to hear it.... I have had the symptoms all
my life, Stuart. You have spoken of the schoolboy days: you may remember how you used to fight
my battles for me. You thought I took the bullying of the bigger boys because I wasn't strong
enough physically to hold up my end. That wasn't it: it was fear, pure and simple. Are you
listening?"

The man in the chair nodded and said, "Go on." He was of those to whom fear, the fear of what
other men might do to him, was as yet a thing unlearned, and he was trying to attain the point
of view of one to whom it seemed very real.

"It followed me up to manhood, and after a time I found myself constantly and consciously deferring
to it. It was easy enough after the habit was formed. Twentieth-century civilization is decently
peaceable, and it isn't especially difficult to dodge the personal collisions. I have succeeded
in dodging them, for the greater part, paying the price in humiliation and self-abasement as
I went along. God, Stuart, you don't know what that means!--the degradation; the hot and cold
chills of self-loathing; the sickening misery of having your own soul turn upon you to rend
and tear you like a rabid dog!"

"No, I don't know what it means," said the other man, moved more than he cared to admit by
the abject confession.

"Of course you don't. Nobody else can know. I am alone in my pit of wretchedness, Ford ...
as one born out of time; apprehending, as well as you or any one, what is required of a man
and a gentleman, and yet unable to answer when my name is called. I said I had been paying
the price; I am paying it here and now. This is the fourth time I have had to refuse a good
offer that carried with it the fighting chance."

The vice-president's heavy eyebrows slanted in questioning surprise.

"You knew in advance that you were going to turn me down? Yet you came a thousand miles to
meet me here; and you admit that you have gone the length of looking the ground over."

Lidgerwood's smile was mirthless.

"A regular recurring phase of the disease. It manifests itself in a determination to break
away and do or die in the effort to win a little self-respect. I can't take the plunge. I know
beforehand that I can't ... which brings us down to Copah, the present exigency, and the fact
that you'll have to look farther along for your Red Butte Western man-queller. The blood isn't
in my veins, Stuart. It was left out in the assembling."

The vice-president was still a young man and he was confronting a problem that annoyed him.
He had been calling himself, and not without reason, a fair judge of men. Yet here was a man
whom he had known intimately from boyhood, who was but just now revealing a totally unsuspected
quality.

"You say you have been dodging the collisions. How do you know you wouldn't buck up when the
real pinch comes?" he demanded.

"Because the pinch came once--and I didn't buck up. It was over a year ago, and to this good
day I can't think calmly about it. You will understand when I say that it cost me the love
of the one woman in the world."

The vice-president did understand. Being a married lover himself, he could measure the depth
of the abyss into which Lidgerwood was looking. His voice was as sympathetic as a woman's when
he said: "Go ahead and ease your mind; tell me about it, if you can, Howard. It's barely possible
that you are not the best judge of your own act."

There was something approaching the abandonment of the shameless in Lidgerwood's manner when
he went on.

"It was in the Montana mountains. I was going in to do a bit of expert engineering for her
father. Incidentally, I was escorting her and her mother from the railroad terminus to the
summer camp in the hills, where they were to join a coaching party of their friends for the
Yellowstone tour. We had to drive forty miles in a stage, and there were six of us--the two
women and four men. On the way the talk turned upon stage-robbings and hold-ups. With the chance
of the real thing as remote as a visit from Mars, I could be an ass and a braggart. One of
the men, a salesman for a powder company, gave me the rope wherewith to hang myself. He argued
for non-resistance, and I remember that I grew sarcastic over the spectacle afforded by a grown
man, armed and in possession of his five senses, permitting himself to be robbed without attempting
to resist. You can guess what followed?"

"I'd rather hear you tell it," said the listener at Superintendent Leckhard's desk. "Go on."

Lidgerwood waited until the switching-engine, with its pop-valve open and screaming like a
liberated devil of the noise pit, had passed.

"Three miles beyond the supper station we had our hold-up; the cut-and-dried, melodramatic
sort of thing you read about, or used to read about, in the early days, with a couple of Winchesters
poking through the scrub pines to represent the gang in hiding, and one lone, crippled desperado
to come down to the footlights in the speaking part. You get the picture?"

"Yes; I've seen the original."

"Of course, it struck every soul of us with the shock of the incredible--the totally unexpected.
It was a rank anachronism, twenty-five years out of date in that particular locality. Before
anybody realized what was happening, the cripple had us lined up in a row beside the stage,
and I was reaching for the stars quite as anxiously as the little Jew hat salesman, who was
swearing by all the patriarchs that the twenty-dollar bill in his right-hand pocket was his
entire fortune."

"Naturally," Ford commented. "You needn't rawhide yourself for that. You've been West often
enough and long enough at a time to know the rules of the game--not to be frivolous when the
other fellow has the drop on you."

"Wait," said Lidgerwood. "One minute later the cripple had sized us up for what we were. The
other three men were not armed. I was, and Miss El--the young woman knew it. Also the cripple
knew it. He tapped the gun bulging in my pocket and said, in good-natured contempt, 'Watch
out that thing don't go off and hurt you some time when you ain't lookin', stranger.' Ford,
I think I must have been hypnotized. I stood there like a frozen image, and let that crippled
cow-rustler rob those two women--take the rings from their fingers!"

"Oh, hold on; there's another side to all that, and you know it," the vice-president began;
but Lidgerwood would not listen.

"No," he protested; "don't try to find excuses for me; there were none. The fellow gave me
every chance; turned his back on me as an absolutely negligible factor while he was going through
the others. I'm quick enough when the crisis doesn't involve a fighting man's chance; and I
can handle a gun, too, when the thing to be shot at isn't a human being. But to save my soul
from everlasting torments I couldn't go through the simple motions of pulling the pistol from
my pocket and dropping that fellow in his tracks; couldn't and didn't."

"Why, of course you couldn't, after it had got that far along," asserted Ford. "I doubt if
any one could. That little remark about the gun in your pocket did you up. When a man gets
you pacified to the condition in which he can safely josh you, he has got you going and he
knows it--and knows you know it. You may be twice as hot and bloodthirsty as you were before,
but you are just that much less able to strike back. It's not a theory; it is a psychological
demonstration."

"But the fact remained," said Lidgerwood, sparing himself not at all. "I was weighed and found
wanting; that is the only point worth considering."

"Well?" queried Ford, when the self-condemned culprit turned again to the dusk-darkened window,
"what came of it?"

"That which was due to come. I was told many times and in many different ways what the one
woman thought of me. For the few days during which she and her mother waited at her father's
mine for the coming of the Yellowstone party, she used me for a door-mat, as I deserved. That
was a year ago last spring. I haven't seen her since; haven't tried to."

The vice-president reached up and snapped the key of the electric bulb over the desk, and the
lurking shadows in the corners of the room fled away.

"Sit down," he said shortly; and when Lidgerwood had found a chair: "You treat it as an incident
closed, Howard. Do you mean to go on leaving it up in the air like that?"

"It was left in the air a year ago last spring. I can't pull it down now."

"Yes, you can. You haven't exaggerated the conditions on the Red Butte line an atom. As you
say, the operating force is as godless a lot of outlaws as ever ran trains or ditched them.
They all know that the road has been bought and sold, and that pretty sweeping changes are
impending. They are looking for trouble, and are quite ready to help make it. If you could
discharge them in a body, you couldn't replace them--the Red Desert having nothing to offer
as a dwelling-place for civilized men; and this they know, too. Howard, I'm telling you right
now that it will require a higher brand of courage to go over to Angels and manhandle the Red
Butte Western as a division of the P. S-W. than it would to face a dozen highwaymen, if every
individual one of the dozen had the drop on you!"

Lidgerwood left his chair and began to pace the narrow limits of the private office, five steps
and a turn. The noisy switching-engine had gone clattering and shrieking down the yard again
before he said, "You mean that you are still giving me the chance to make good over yonder
in the Red Desert--after what I have told you?"

"I do; only I'll make it more binding. It was optional with you before; it's a sheer necessity
now. You've got to go."

Again Lidgerwood took time to reflect, tramping the floor, with his head down and his hands
in the pockets of the correct coat. In the end he yielded, as the vice-president's subjects
commonly did.

"I'll go, if you still insist upon it," was the slowly spoken decision. "There will doubtless
be plenty of trouble, and I shall probably show the yellow streak--for the last time, perhaps.
It's the kind of an outfit to kill a coward for the pure pleasure of it, if I'm not mistaken."

"Well," said the man in the swing-chair, calmly, "maybe you need a little killing, Howard.
Had you ever thought of that?"

A gray look came into Lidgerwood's face.

"Maybe I do."

A little silence supervened. Then Ford plunged into detail.

"Now that you are fairly committed, sit down and let me give you an idea of what you'll find
at Angels in the way of a head-quarters outfit. Draw up here and we'll go over the lay-out
together."

A busy hour had elapsed, and the gong of the station dining-room below was adding its raucous
clamor to the drumming thunder of the incoming train from Green Butte, when the vice-president
concluded his outline sketch of the Red Butte Western conditions.

"Of course, you know that you will have a free hand. We have already cleared the decks for
you. As an independent road, the Red Butte line had the usual executive organization in miniature:
Cumberley had the title of general superintendent, but his authority, when he cared to assert
it, was really that of general manager. Under him, in the head-quarters staff at Angels, there
was an auditor--who also acted as paymaster, a general freight and passenger agent, and a superintendent
of motive power. Operating the line as a branch of the P. S-W System, we can simplify the organization.
We have consolidated the auditing and traffic departments with our Colorado-lines head-quarters
at Denver. This will leave you with only the operating, telegraph, train-service, and engineering
departments to handle from Angels. With one exception, your authority will be absolute; you
will hire and discharge as you see fit, and there will be no appeal from your decision."

"That applies to my own departments--the operating, telegraph, train-service, and engineering;
but how about the motive power?" asked the new incumbent.

Ford threw down the desk-knife, with which he had been sharpening a pencil, with a little gesture
indicative of displeasure.

"There lies the exception, and I wish it didn't. Gridley, the master-mechanic, will be nominally
under your orders, of course; but if it should come to blows between you, you couldn't fire
him. In the regular routine he will report to the Colorado-lines superintendent of motive power
at Denver. But in a quarrel with you he could make a still longer arm and reach the P. S-W.
board of directors in New York."

"How is that?" inquired Lidgerwood.

"It's a family affair. He is a widower, and his wife was a sister of the Van Kensingtons. He
got his job through the family influence, and he'll hold it in the same way. But you are not
likely to have any trouble with him. He is a brute in his own peculiar fashion; but when it
comes to handling shopmen and keeping the engines in service, he can't be beat."

"That is all I shall ask of him," said the new superintendent. "Anything else?" looking at
his watch.

"Yes, there is one other thing. I spoke of Hallock, the man you will find holding down the
head-quarters office at Angels. He was Cumberley's chief clerk, and long before Cumberley resigned
he was the real superintendent of the Red Butte Western in everything but the title, and the
place on the pay-roll. Naturally he thought he ought to be considered when we climbed into
the saddle, and he has already written to President Brewster, asking for the promotion in fact.
He happens to be a New Yorker--like Gridley; and, again like Gridley, he has a friend at court.
Magnus knows him, and he recommended him for the superintendency when Mr. Brewster referred
the application to me. I couldn't agree, and I had to turn him down. I am telling you this
so you'll be easy with him--as easy as you can. I don't know him personally, but if you can
keep him on----"

"I shall be only too glad to keep him, if he knows his business and will stay," was Lidgerwood's
reply. Then, with another glance at his watch, "Shall we go up-town and get dinner? Afterward
you can give me your notion in the large about the future extension of the road across the
second Timanyoni, and I'll order out the service-car and an engine and go to my place. A man
can die but once; and maybe I shall contrive to live long enough to set a few stakes for some
better fellow to drive. Let's go."

       *       *       *       *       *

At ten o'clock that night Engine 266, Williams, engineer, and Blackmar, fireman, was chalked
up on the Red Butte Western roundhouse bulletin-board to go west at midnight with the new superintendent's
service-car, running as a special train.

Svenson, the caller, who brought the order from the Copah sub-despatcher's office, unloaded
his news upon the circle of R.B.W. engineers, firemen, and roundhouse roustabouts lounging
on the benches in the tool-room and speculating morosely upon the probable changes which the
new management would bring to pass.

"Ve bane got dem new boss, Ay vant to tal you fallers," he drawled.

"Who is he?" demanded Williams, who had been looking on sourly while the engine-despatcher
chalked his name on the board for the night run with the service-car.

"Ay couldn't tal you his name. Bote he is dem young faller bane goin' 'round hare dees two,
t'ree days, lukin' lak preacher out of a yob. Vouldn'd dat yar you?"

Williams rose up to his full height of six-feet-two, and flung his hands upward in a gesture
that was more expressive than many oaths.

"Collars-and-Cuffs, by God!" he said.

II

THE RED DESERT

In the beginning the Red Desert, figuring unpronounceably under its Navajo name of Tse-nastci--Circle-of-Red-Stones--was
shunned alike by man and beast, and the bravest of the gold-hunters, seeking to penetrate to
the placer ground in the hill gulches between the twin Timanyoni ranges, made a hundred-mile
détour to avoid it.

Later, the discoveries of rich "pocket" deposits in the Red Butte district lifted the intermontane
hill country temporarily to the high plane of a bonanza field. In the rush that followed, a
few prudent ones chose the longer détour; others, hardier and more temerarious, outfitted at
Copah, and assaulting the hill barrier of the Little Piñons at Crosswater Gap, faced the jornada
through the Land of Thirst.

Of these earliest of the desert caravans, the railroad builders, following the same trail and
pointing toward the same destination in the gold gulches, found dismal reminders. In the longest
of the thirsty stretches there were clean-picked skeletons, and they were not always the relics
of the patient pack-animals. In which event Chandler, chief of the Red Butte Western construction,
proclaimed himself Eastern-bred and a tenderfoot by compelling the grade contractors to stop
and bury them.

Why the railroad builders, with Copah for a starting-point and Red Butte for a terminus, had
elected to pitch their head-quarters camp in the western edge of the desert, no later comer
could ever determine. Lost, also, is the identity of the camp's sponsor who, visioning the
things that were to be, borrowed from the California pioneers and named the halting-place on
the desert's edge "Angels." But for the more material details Chandler was responsible. It
was he who laid out the division yards on the bald plain at the foot of the first mesa, planting
the "Crow's Nest" head-quarters building on the mesa side of the gridironing tracks, and scattering
the shops and repair plant along the opposite boundary of the wide right-of-way.

The town had followed the shops, as a sheer necessity. First and always the railroad nucleus,
Angels became in turn, and in addition, the forwarding station for a copper-mining district
in the Timanyoni foot-hills, and a little later, when a few adventurous cattlemen had discovered
that the sun-cured herbage of the desert borders was nutritious and fattening, a stock-shipping
point. But even in the day of promise, when the railroad building was at its height and a handful
of promoters were plotting streets and town lots on the second mesa, and printing glowing tributes--for
strictly Eastern distribution--to the dry atmosphere and the unfailing sunshine, the desert
leaven was silently at work. A few of the railroad men transplanted their families; but apart
from these, Angels was a man's town with elemental appetites, and with only the coarse fare
of the frontier fighting line to satisfy them.

Farther along, the desert came more definitely to its own. The rich Red Butte "pockets" began
to show signs of exhaustion, and the gulch and ore mining afforded but a precarious alternative
to the thousands who had gone in on the crest of the bonanza wave. Almost as tumultuously as
it had swept into the hill country, the tide of population swept out. For the gulch hamlets
between the Timanyonis there was still an industrial reason for being; but the railroad languished,
and Angels became the weir to catch and retain many of the leavings, the driftwood stranded
in the slack water of the outgoing tide. With the railroad, the Copperette Mine, and the "X-bar-Z"
pay-days to bring regularly recurring moments of flushness, and with every alternate door in
Mesa Avenue the entrance to a bar, a dance-hall, a gambling den, or the three in combination,
the elemental appetites grew avid, and the hot breath of the desert fanned slow fires of brutality
that ate the deeper when they penetrated to the punk heart of the driftwood.

It was during this period of deflagration and dry rot that the Eastern owners of the railroad
lost heart. Since the year of the Red Butte inrush there had been no dividends; and Chandler,
summoned from another battle with the canyons in the far Northwest, was sent in to make an
expert report on the property. "Sell it for what it will bring," was the substance of Chandler's
advice; but there were no bidders, and from this time on a masterless railroad was added to
the spoils of war--the inexpiable war of the Red Desert upon its invaders.

At the moment of the moribund railroad's purchase by the Pacific Southwestern, the desert was
encroaching more and more upon the town planted in its western border. In the height of Angels's
prosperity there had been electric lights and a one-car street tramway, a bank, and a Building
and Loan Association attesting its presence in rows of ornate cottages on the second mesa--alluring
bait thrown out to catch the potential savings of the railroad colonists.

But now only the railroad plant was electric-lighted; the single ramshackle street-car had
been turned into a chile-con-carne stand; the bank, unable to compete with the faro games and
the roulette wheels, had gone into liquidation; the Building and Loan directors had long since
looted the treasury and sought fresh fields, and the cottages were chiefly empty shells.

Of the charter members of the Building and Loan Association, shrewdest of the many boom-time
schemes for the separation of the pay-roll man from his money, only two remained as residents
of Angels the decadent. One of these was Gridley, the master-mechanic, and the other was Hallock,
chief clerk for a diminishing series of imported superintendents, and now for the third time
the disappointed applicant for the headship of the Red Butte Western.

Associated for some brief time in the real-estate venture, and hailing from the same far-away
Eastern State and city, these two had been at first yoke-fellows, and afterward, as if by tacit
consent, inert enemies. As widely separated as the poles in characteristics, habits, and in
their outlook upon life, they had little in common, and many antipathies.

Gridley was a large man, virile of face and figure, and he marched in the ranks of the full-fed
and the self-indulgent. Hallock was big-boned and cadaverous of face, but otherwise a fair
physical match for the master-mechanic; a dark man with gloomy eyes and a permanent frown.
Jovial good-nature went with the master-mechanic's gray eyes twinkling easily to a genial smile,
but it stopped rather abruptly at the straight-lined, sensual mouth, and found a second negation
in the brutal jaw which was only thinly masked by the neatly trimmed beard. Hallock's smile
was bitter, and if he had a social side no one in Angels had ever discovered it. In a region
where fellowship in some sort, if it were only that of the bottle and the card-table, was any
man's for the taking, he was a hermit, an ascetic; and his attitude toward others, all others,
so far as Angels knew, was that of silent and morose ferocity.

It was in an upper room of the "Crow's Nest" head-quarters building that these two, the master-mechanic
and the acting superintendent, met late in the evening of the day when Vice-President Ford
had kept his appointment in Copah with Lidgerwood.

Gridley, clad like a gentleman, and tilting comfortably in his chair as he smoked a cigar that
neither love nor money could have bought in Angels, was jocosely sarcastic. Hallock, shirt-sleeved,
unkempt, and with the permanent frown deepening the furrow between his eyes, neither tilted
nor smoked.

"They tell me you have missed the step up again, Hallock," said the smoker lazily, when the
purely technical matter that had brought him to Hallock's office had been settled.

"Who tells you?" demanded the other; and a listener, knowing neither, would have remarked the
curious similarity of the grating note in both voices as infallibly as a student of human nature
would have contrasted the two men in every other personal characteristic.

"I don't remember," said Gridley, good-naturedly refusing to commit his informant, "but it's
on the wires. Vice-President Ford is in Copah, and the new superintendent is with him."

Hallock leaned forward in his chair.

"Who is the new man?" he asked.

"Nobody seems to know him by name. But he is a friend of Ford's all right. That is how he gets
the job."

Hallock took a plug of black tobacco from his pocket, and cut a small sliver from it for a
chew. It was his one concession to appetite, and he made it grudgingly.

"A college man, I suppose," he commented. "Otherwise Ford wouldn't be backing him."

"Oh, yes, I guess it's safe to count on that."

"And a man who will carry out the Ford policy?"

Gridley's eyes smiled, but lower down on his face the smile became a cynical baring of the
strong teeth.

"A man who may try to carry out the Ford idea," he qualified; adding, "The desert will get
hold of him and eat him alive, as it has the others."

"Maybe," said Hallock thoughtfully. Then, with sudden heat, "It's hell, Gridley! I've hung
on and waited and done the work for their figure-heads, one after another. The job belongs to me!"

This time Gridley's smile was a thinly veiled sneer.

"What makes you so keen for it, Hallock?" he asked. "You have no use for the money, and still
less for the title."

"How do you know I don't want the salary?" snapped the other. "Because I don't have my clothes
made in New York, or blow myself across the tables in Mesa Avenue, does it go without saying
that I have no use for money?"

"But you haven't, you know you haven't," was the taunting rejoinder. "And the title, when you
have, and have always had, the real authority, means still less to you."

"Authority!" scoffed the chief clerk, his gloomy eyes lighting up with slow fire, "this maverick
railroad don't know the meaning of the word. By God! Gridley, if I had the club in my hands
for a few months I'd show 'em!"

"Oh, I guess not," said the cigar-smoker easily. "You're not built right for it, Hallock; the
desert would give you the horse-laugh."

"Would it? Not before I had squared off a few old debts, Gridley; don't you forget that."

There was a menace in the harsh retort, and the chief clerk made no attempt to conceal it.

"Threatening, are you?" jeered the full-fed one, still good-naturedly sarcastic. "What would
you do, if you had the chance, Rankin?"

"I'd kill out some of the waste and recklessness, if it took the last man off the pay-rolls;
and I'd break even with at least one man over in the Timanyoni, if I had to use the whole Red
Butte Western to pry him loose!"

"Flemister again?" queried the master-mechanic. And then, in mild deprecation, "You are a bad
loser, Hallock, a damned bad loser. But I suppose that is one of your limitations."

A silence settled down upon the upper room, but Gridley made no move to go. Out in the yards
the night men were making up a westbound freight, and the crashing of box-cars carelessly "kicked"
into place added its note to the discord of inefficiency and destructive breakage.

Over in the town a dance-hall piano was jangling, and the raucous voice of the dance-master
calling the figures came across to the Crow's Nest curiously like the barking of a distant
dog. Suddenly the barking voice stopped, and the piano clamor ended futilely in an aimless
tinkling. For climax a pistol-shot rang out, followed by a scattering volley. It was a precise
commentary on the time and the place that neither of the two men in the head-quarters upper
room gave heed to the pistol-shots, or to the yelling uproar that accompanied them.

It was after the shouting had died away in a confused clatter of hoofs, and the pistol cracklings
were coming only at intervals and from an increasing distance, that the corridor door opened
and the night despatcher's off-trick man came in with a message for Hallock.

It was a mere routine notification from the line-end operator at Copah, and the chief clerk
read it sullenly to the master-mechanic.

"Engine 266, Williams, engineer, and Blackmar, fireman, with service-car Naught-One, Bradford,
conductor, will leave Copah at 12:01 A.M., and run special to Angels. By order of Howard Lidgerwood,
General Superintendent."

Gridley's pivot-chair righted itself with a snap. But he waited until the off-trick man was
gone before he said, "Lidgerwood! Well, by all the gods!" then, with a laugh that was more
than half a snarl, "There is a chance for you yet, Rankin."

"Why, do you know him?"

"No, but I know something about him. I've got a line on New York, the same as you have, and
I get a hint now and then. I knew that Lidgerwood had been considered for the place, but I
was given to understand that he would refuse the job if it were offered to him."

"Why should he refuse?" demanded Hallock.

"That is where my wire-tapper fell down; he couldn't tell."

"Then why do you say there is still a chance for me?"

"Oh, on general principles, I guess. If it was an even break that he would refuse, it is still
more likely that he won't stay after he has seen what he is up against, don't you think?"

Hallock did not say what he thought. He rarely did.

"Of course, you made inquiries about him when you found out he was a possible; I'd trust you
to do that, Gridley. What do you know?"

"Not much that you can use. He is out of the Middle West; a young man and a graduate of Purdue.
He took the Civil degree, but stayed two years longer and romped through the Mechanical. He
ought to be pretty well up on theory, you'd say."

"Theory be damned!" snapped the chief clerk. "What he'll need in the Red Desert will be nerve
and a good gun. If he has the nerve, he can buy the gun."

"But having the gun he couldn't always be sure of buying the nerve, eh? I guess you are right,
Rankin; you usually are when you can forget to be vindictive. And that brings us around to
the jumping-off place again. Of course, you will stay on with the new man--if he wants you to?"

"I don't know. That is my business, and none of yours."

It was a bid for a renewal of the quarrel which was never more than half veiled between these
two. But Gridley did not lift the challenge.

"Let it go at that," he said placably. "But if you should decide to stay, I want you to let
up on Flemister."

The morose antagonism died out of Hallock's eyes, and in its place came craft.

"I'd kill Flemister on sight, if I had the sand; you know that, Gridley. Some day it may come
to that. But in the meantime----"

"In the meantime you have been snapping at his heels like a fice-dog, Hallock; holding out
ore-cars on him, delaying his coal supplies, stirring up trouble with his miners. That was
all right, up to yesterday. But now it has got to stop."

"Not for any orders that you can give," retorted the chief clerk, once more opening the door
for the quarrel.

The master-mechanic got up and flicked the cigar ash from his coat-sleeve with a handkerchief
that was fine enough to be a woman's.

"I am not going to come to blows with you. Rankin--not if I can help it," he said, with his
hand on the door-knob. "But what I have said will have to go as it lies. Shoot Flemister out
of hand, if you feel like it, but quit hampering his business."

Hallock stood up, and when he was on his feet his big frame made him look still more a fair
match physically for the handsome master-mechanic.

"Why?" The single word shot out of the loose-lipped mouth like an explosive bullet.

Gridley opened the door and turned upon the threshold.

"I might borrow the word from you and say that Flemister's business and mine are none of yours.
But I won't do that. I'll merely say that Flemister may need a little Red Butte Western nursing
in the Ute Valley irrigation scheme he is promoting, and I want you to see that he gets it.
You may take that as a word to the wise, or as a kicked-in hint to a blind mule; whichever
you please. You can't afford to fight me, Hallock, and you know it. Sleep on it a few hours,
and you'll see it in that way, I'm sure. Good-night."

III

A LITTLE BROTHER OF THE COWS

Crosswater Gap, so named because the high pass over which the railroad finds its way is anything
but a gap, and, save when the winter snows are melting, there is no water within a day's march,
was in sight from the loopings of the eastern approach. Lidgerwood, scanning the grades as
the service-car swung from tangent to curve and curve to tangent up the steep inclines, was
beginning to think of breakfast. The morning air was crisp and bracing, and he had been getting
the full benefit of it for an hour or more, sitting under the umbrella roof at the observation
end of the car.

With the breakfast thought came the thing itself, or the invitation to it. As a parting kindness
the night before, Ford had transferred one of the cooks from his own private car to Lidgerwood's
service, and the little man, Tadasu Matsuwari by name, and a subject of the Mikado by race
and birth, came to the car door to call his new employer to the table.

It was an attractive table, well appointed and well served; but Lidgerwood, temperamentally
single-eyed in all things, was diverted from his reorganization problem for the moment only.
Since early dawn he had been up and out on the observation platform, noting, this time with
the eye of mastership, the physical condition of the road; the bridges, the embankments, the
cross-ties, the miles of steel unreeling under the drumming trucks, and the object-lesson was
still fresh in his mind.

To a disheartening extent, the Red Butte demoralization had involved the permanent way. Originally
a good track, with heavy steel, easy grades compensated for the curves, and a mathematical
alignment, the roadbed and equipment had been allowed to fall into disrepair under indifferent
supervision and the short-handing of the section gangs--always an impractical directory's first
retrenchment when the dividends begin to fail. Lidgerwood had seen how the ballast had been
suffered to sink at the rail-joints, and he had read the record of careless supervision at
each fresh swing of the train, since it is the section foreman's weakness to spoil the geometrical
curve by working it back, little by little, into the adjoining tangent.

Reflecting upon these things, Lidgerwood's comment fell into speech over his cup of coffee
and crisp breakfast bacon.

"About the first man we need is an engineer who won't be too exalted to get down and squint
curves with the section bosses," he mused, and from that on he was searching patiently through
the memory card-index for the right man.

At the summit station, where the line leaves the Pannikin basin to plunge into the western
desert, there was a delay. Lidgerwood was still at the breakfast-table when Bradford, the conductor,
black-shirted and looking, in his slouch hat and riding-leggings, more like a horse-wrangler
than a captain of railroad trains, lounged in to explain that there was a hot box under the
266's tender. Bradford was not of any faction of discontent, but the spirit of morose insubordination,
born of the late change in management, was in the air, and he spoke gruffly. Hence, with the
flint and steel thus provided, the spark was promptly evoked.

"Were the boxes properly overhauled before you left Copah?" demanded the new boss.

Bradford did not know, and the manner of his answer implied that he did not care. And for good
measure he threw in an intimation that roundhouse dope kettles were not in his line.

Lidgerwood passed over the large impudence and held to the matter in hand.

"How much time have we on 201?" he asked, Train 201 being the westbound passenger overtaken
and left behind in the small hours of the morning by the lighter and faster special.

"Thirty minutes, here," growled the little brother of the cows; after which he took himself
off as if he considered the incident sufficiently closed.

Fifteen minutes later Lidgerwood finished his breakfast and went back to his camp-chair on
the observation platform of the service-car. A glance over the side rail showed him his train
crew still working on the heated axle-bearing. Another to the rear picked up the passenger-train
storming around the climbing curves of the eastern approach to the summit. There was a small
problem impending for the division despatcher at Angels, and the new superintendent held aloof
to see how it would be handled.

It was handled rather indifferently. The passenger-train was pulling in over the summit switches
when Bradford, sauntering into the telegraph office as if haste were the last thing in the
world to be considered, asked for his clearance card, got it, and gave Williams the signal to go.

Lidgerwood got up and went into the car to consult the time-table hanging in the office compartment.
Train 201 had no dead time at Crosswater; hence, if the ten-minute interval between trains
of the same class moving in the same direction was to be preserved, the passenger would have
to be held.

The assumption that the passenger-train would be held aroused all the railroad martinet's fury
in the new superintendent. In Lidgerwood's calendar, time-killing on regular trains stood next
to an infringement of the rules providing for the safety of life and property. His hand was
on the signal-cord when, chancing to look back, he saw that the passenger-train had made only
the momentary time-card stop at the summit station, and was coming on.

This turned the high crime into a mere breach of discipline, common enough even on well-managed
railroads when the leading train can be trusted to increase the distance interval. But again
the martinet in Lidgerwood protested. It was his theory that rules were made to be observed,
and his experience had proved that little infractions paved the way for great ones. In the
present instance, however, it was too late to interfere; so he drew a chair out in line with
one of the rear observation windows and sat down to mark the event.

Pitching over the hilltop summit, within a minute of each other, the two trains raced down
the first few curving inclines almost as one. Mile after mile was covered, and still the perilous
situation remained unchanged. Down the short tangents and around the constantly recurring curves
the special seemed to be towing the passenger at the end of an invisible but dangerously short
drag-rope.

Lidgerwood began to grow uneasy. On the straight-line stretches the following train appeared
to be rushing onward to an inevitable rear-end collision with the one-car special; and where
the track swerved to right or left around the hills, the pursuing smoke trail rose above the
intervening hill-shoulders near and threatening. With the parts of a great machine whirling
in unison and nicely timed to escape destruction, a small accident to a single cog may spell
disaster.

Lidgerwood left his chair and went again to consult the time-table. A brief comparison of miles
with minutes explained the effect without excusing the cause. Train 201's schedule from the
summit station to the desert level was very fast; and Williams, nursing his hot box, either
could not, or would not, increase his lead.

At first, Lidgerwood, anticipating rebellion, was inclined to charge the hazardous situation
to intention on the part of his own train crew. Having a good chance to lie out of it if they
were accused, Williams and Bradford might be deliberately trying the nerve of the new boss.
The presumption did not breed fear; it bred wrath, hot and vindictive. Two sharp tugs at the
signal-cord brought Bradford from the engine. The memory of the conductor's gruff replies and
easy impudence was fresh enough to make Lidgerwood's reprimand harsh.

"Do you call this railroading?" he rasped, pointing backward to the menace. "Don't you know
that we are on 201's time?"

Bradford scowled in surly antagonism.

"That blamed hot box--" he began, but Lidgerwood cut him off short.

"The hot box has nothing to do with the case. You are not hired to take chances, or to hold
out regular trains. Go forward and tell your engineer to speed up and get out of the way."

"I got my clearance at the summit, and I ain't despatchin' trains on this jerk-water railroad,"
observed the conductor coolly. Then he added, with a shade less of the belligerent disinterest:
"Williams can't speed up. That housin' under the tender is about ready to blaze up and set
the woods afire again, right now."

Once more Lidgerwood turned to the time-card. It was twenty miles farther along to the next
telegraph station, and he heaped up wrath against the day of wrath in store for a despatcher
who would recklessly turn two trains loose and out of his reach under such critical conditions,
for thirty hazardous mountain miles.

Bradford, looking on sullenly, mistook the new boss's frown for more to follow, with himself
for the target, and was moving away. Lidgerwood pointed to a chair with a curt, "Sit down!"
and the conductor obeyed reluctantly.

"You say you have your clearance card, and that you are not despatching trains," he went on
evenly, "but neither fact relieves you of your responsibility. It was your duty to make sure
that the despatcher fully understood the situation at Crosswater, and to refuse to pull out
ahead of the passenger without something more definite than a formal permit. Weren't you taught
that? Where did you learn to run trains?"

It was an opening for hard words, but the conductor let it pass. Something in the steady, business-like
tone, or in the shrewdly appraisive eyes, turned Bradford the potential mutineer into Bradford
the possible partisan.

"I reckon we are needing a rodeo over here on this jerk-water mighty bad, Mr. Lidgerwood,"
he said, half humorously. "Take us coming and going, about half of us never had the sure-enough
railroad brand put onto us, nohow. But, Lord love you! this little pasear we're making down
this hill ain't anything! That's the old 210 chasin' us with the passenger, and she couldn't
catch Bat Williams and the '66 in a month o' Sundays if we didn't have that doggoned spavined
leg under the tender. She sure couldn't."

Lidgerwood smiled in spite of his annoyance, and wondered at what page in the railroad primer
he would have to begin in teaching these men of the camps and the round-ups.

"But it isn't railroading," he insisted, meeting his first pupil half-way, and as man to man.
"You might do this thing ninety-nine times without paying for it, and the hundredth time something
would turn up to slow or to stop the leading train, and there you are."

"Sure!" said the ex-cowboy, quite heartily.

"Now, if there should happen to be----"

The sentence was never finished. The special, lagging a little now in deference to the smoking
hot box, was rounding one of the long hill curves to the left. Suddenly the air-brakes ground
sharply upon the wheels, shrill whistlings from the 266 sounded the stop signal, and past the
end of the slowing service-car a trackman ran frantically up the line toward the following
passenger, yelling and swinging his stripped coat like a madman.

Lidgerwood caught a fleeting glimpse of a section gang's green "slow" flag lying toppled over
between the rails a hundred feet to the rear. Measuring the distance of the onrushing passenger-train
against the life-saving seconds remaining, he called to Bradford to jump, and then ran forward
to drag the Japanese cook out of his galley.

It was all over in a moment. There was time enough for Lidgerwood to rush the little Tadasu
to the forward vestibule, to fling him into space, and to make his own flying leap for safety
before the crisis came. Happily there was no wreck, though the margin of escape was the narrowest.
Williams stuck to his post in the cab of the 266, applying and releasing the brakes, and running
as far ahead as he dared upon the loosened timbers of the culvert, for which the section gang's
slowflag was out. Carter, the engineer on the passenger-train, jumped; but his fireman was
of better mettle and stayed with the machine, sliding the wheels with the driver-jams, and
pumping sand on the rails up to the moment when the shuddering mass of iron and steel thrust
its pilot under the trucks of Lidgerwood's car, lifted them, dropped them, and drew back sullenly
in obedience to the pull of the reverse and the recoil of the brake mechanism.

It was an excellent opportunity for eloquence of the explosive sort, and when the dust had
settled the track and trainmen were evidently expecting the well-deserved tongue-lashing. But
in crises like this the new superintendent was at his self-contained best. Instead of swearing
at the men, he gave his orders quietly and with the brisk certainty of one who knows his trade.
The passenger-train was to keep ten minutes behind its own time until the next siding was passed,
making up beyond that point if its running orders permitted. The special was to proceed on
201's time to the siding in question, at which point it would side-track and let the passenger
precede it.

Bradford was in the cab of 266 when Williams eased his engine and the service-car over the
unsafe culvert, and inched the throttle open for the speeding race down the hill curves toward
the wide valley plain of the Red Desert.

"Turn it loose, Andy," said the big engineman, when the requisite number of miles of silence
had been ticked off by the space-devouring wheels. "What-all do you think of Mister Collars-and-Cuffs
by this time?"

Bradford took a leisurely minute to whittle a chewing cube from his pocket plug of hard-times
tobacco.

"Well, first dash out o' the box, I allowed he was some locoed; he jumped me like a jack-rabbit
for takin' a clearance right under Jim Carter's nose that-a-way. Then we got down to business,
and I was just beginning to get onto his gait a little when the green flag butted in."

"Gait fits the laundry part of him?" suggested Williams.

"It does and it don't. I ain't much on systems and sure things, Bat, but I can make out to
guess a guess, once in a while, when I have to. If that little tailor-made man don't get his
finger mashed, or something, and have to go home and get somebody to poultice it, things are
goin' to have a spell of happenings on this little old cow-trail of a railroad. That's my ante."

"What sort of things?" demanded Williams.

"When it comes to that, your guess is as good as mine, but they'll spell trouble for the amatoors
and the trouble-makers, I reckon. I ain't placin' any bets yet, but that's about the way it
stacks up to me."

Williams let the 266 out another notch, hung out of his window to look back at the smoking
hot box, and, in the complete fulness of time, said, "Think he's got the sand, Andy?"

"This time you've got me goin'," was the slow reply. "Sizing him up one side and down the other
when he called me back to pull my ear, I said, 'No, my young bronco-buster; you're a bluffer--the
kind that'll put up both hands right quick when the bluff is called.' Afterward, I wasn't so
blamed sure. One kind o' sand he's got, to a dead moral certainty. When he saw what was due
to happen back yonder at the culvert, he told me '23,' all right, but he took time to hike
up ahead and yank that Jap cook out o' the car-kitchen before he turned his own little handspring
into the ditch."

The big engineer nodded, but he was still unconvinced when he made the stop for the siding
at Last Chance. After the fireman had dropped off to set the switch for the following train,
Williams put the unconvincement into words.

"That kind of sand is all right in God's country, Andy, but out here in the nearer edges of
hell you got to know how to fight with pitchforks and such other tools as come handy. The new
boss may be that kind of a scrapper, but he sure don't look it. You know as well as I do that
men like Rufford and 'Cat' Biggs and Red-Light Sammy'll eat him alive, just for the fun of
it, if he can't make out to throw lead quicker'n they can. And that ain't saying anything about
the hobo outfit he'll have to go up against on this make-b'lieve railroad."

"No," agreed Bradford, ruminating thoughtfully. And then, by way of rounding out the subject:
"Here's hopin' his nerve is as good as his clothes. I don't love a Mongolian any better'n you
do, Bat, but the way he hustled to save that little brown man's skin sort o' got next to me;
it sure did. Says I, 'A man that'll do that won't go round hunting a chance to kick a fice-dog
just because the fice don't happen to be a blooded bull-terrier.'"

Williams, brawny and broad-chested, leaned against his box, his bare arms folded and his short
pipe at the disputatious angle.

"He'd better have nerve, or get some," he commented. "T'otherways it's him for an early wooden
overcoat and a trip back home in the express-car. After which, let me tell you, Andy, that
man Ford'll sift this cussed country through a flour-shaker but what he'll cinch the outfit
that does it. You write that out in your car-report."

Back in the service-car Lidgerwood was sitting quietly in the doorway, smoking his delayed
after-breakfast cigar, and timing the up-coming passenger-train, watch in hand. Carter was
ten minutes, to the exact second, behind his schedule time when the train thundered past on
the main track, and Lidgerwood pocketed his watch with a smile of satisfaction. It was the
first small victory in the campaign for reform.

Later, however, when the special was once more in motion westward, the desert laid hold upon
him with the grip which first benumbs, then breeds dull rage, and finally makes men mad. Mile
after mile the glistening rails sped backward into a shimmering haze of red dust. The glow
of the breathless forenoon was like the blinding brightness of a forge-fire. To right and left
the great treeless plain rose to bare buttes, backed by still barer mountains. Let the train
speed as it would, there was always the same wearying prospect, devoid of interest, empty of
human landmarks. Only the blazing sun swung from side to side with the slow veerings of the
track: what answered for a horizon seemed never to change, never to move.

At long intervals a siding, sometimes with its waiting train, but oftener empty and deserted,
slid into view and out again. Still less frequently a telegraph station, with its red, iron-roofed
office, its water-tank cars and pumping machinery, and its high-fenced corral and loading chute,
moved up out of the distorting heat haze ahead, and was lost in the dusty mirages to the rear.
But apart from the crews of the waiting trains, and now and then the desert-sobered face of
some telegraph operator staring from his window at the passing special, there were no signs
of life: no cattle upon the distant hills, no loungers on the station platforms.

Lidgerwood had crossed this arid, lifeless plain twice within the week on his preliminary tour
of inspection, but both times he had been in the Pullman, with fellow-passengers to fill the
nearer field of vision and to temper the awful loneliness of the waste. Now, however, the desert
with its heat, its stillness, its vacancy, its pitiless barrenness, claimed him as its own.
He wondered that he had been impatient with the men it bred. The wonder now was that human
virtue of any temper could long withstand the blasting touch of so great and awful a desolation.

It was past noon when the bowl-like basin, in which the train seemed to circle helplessly without
gaining upon the terrifying horizons, began to lose its harshest features. Little by little,
the tumbled hills drew nearer, and the red-sand dust of the road-bed gave place to broken lava.
Patches of gray, sun-dried mountain grass appeared on the passing hill slopes, and in the arroyos
trickling threads of water glistened, or, if the water were hidden, there were at least paths
of damp sand to hint at the blessed moisture underneath.

Lidgerwood began to breathe again; and when the shrill whistle of the locomotive signalled
the approach to the division head-quarters, he was thankful that the builders of Angels had
pitched their tents and driven their stakes in the desert's edge, rather than in its heart.

Truly, Angels was not much to be thankful for, as the exile from the East regretfully admitted
when he looked out upon it from the windows of his office in the second story of the Crow's
Nest. A many-tracked railroad yard, flanked on one side by the repair shops, roundhouse, and
coal-chutes; and on the other by a straggling town of bare and commonplace exteriors, unpainted,
unfenced, treeless, and wind-swept: Angels stood baldly for what it was--a mere stopping-place
in transit for the Red Butte Western.

The new superintendent turned his back upon the depressing outlook and laid his hand upon the
latch of the door opening into the adjoining room. There was a thing to be said about the reckless
bunching of trains out of reach of the wires, and it might as well be said now as later, he
determined. But at the moment of door-opening he was made to realize that a tall, box-like
contrivance in one corner of the office was a desk, and that it was inhabited.

The man who rose up to greet him was bearded, heavy-shouldered, and hollow-eyed, and he was
past middle age. Green cardboard cones protecting his shirt-sleeves, and a shade of the same
material visoring the sunken eyes, were the only clerkly suggestions about him. Since he merely
stood up and ran his fingers through his thick black hair, with no more than an abstracted
"Good-afternoon" for speech, Lidgerwood was left to guess at his identity.

"You are Mr. Hallock?" Lidgerwood made the guess without offering to shake hands, the high,
box-like desk forbidding the attempt.

"Yes." The answer was neither antagonistic nor placatory; it was merely colorless.

"My name is Lidgerwood. You have heard of my appointment?"

Again the colorless "Yes."

Lidgerwood saw no good end to be subserved by postponing the inevitable.

"Mr. Ford spoke to me about you last night. He told me that you had been Mr. Cumberley's chief
clerk, and that since Cumberley's resignation you have been acting superintendent of the Red
Butte Western. Do you want to stay on as my lieutenant?"

For the long minute that Hallock took before replying, the loose-lipped mouth under the shaggy
mustache seemed to have lost the power of speech. But when the words finally came, they were
shorn of all euphemism.

"I suppose I ought to tell you to go straight to hell, Mr. Lidgerwood, put on my coat and walk
out," said this most singular of all railway subordinates. "By all the rules of the game, this
job belongs to me. What I've gone through to earn it, you nor any other man will ever know.
If I stay, I'll wish I hadn't; and so will you. You'd better give me a time-check and let me go."

Lidgerwood walked to the window and once more stared out upon the dreary prospect, bounded
by the bluffs of the second mesa. A horseman was ambling down the single street of the town,
weaving in his saddle, and giving vent to a series of Indian war-whoops. Lidgerwood saw the
drunken cowboy only with the outward eye. And when he turned back to the man in the rifle-pit
desk, he could not have told why the words of regret and dismissal which he had made up his
mind to say, refused to come. But they did refuse, and what he said was not at all what he
had intended to say.

"If I can't quite match your frankness, Mr. Hallock, it is because my early education was neglected.
But I'll say this: I appreciate your disappointment; I know what it means to a man situated
as you are. Notwithstanding, I want you to stay with me. I'll say more; I shall take it as
a personal favor if you will stay."

"You'll be sorry for it if I do," was the ungracious rejoinder.

"Not because you will do anything to make me sorry, I am sure," said the new superintendent,
in his evenest tone. And then, as if the matter were definitely settled: "I'd like to have
a word with the trainmaster, Mr. McCloskey. May I trouble you to tell me which is his office?"

Hallock waved a hand toward the door which Lidgerwood had been about to open a few minutes earlier.

"You'll find him in there," he said briefly, adding, with his altogether remarkable disregard
for the official proprieties: "If he gives you the same chance that I did, don't take him up.
He is the one man in this outfit worth more than the powder it would take to blow him to the
devil."

IV

AT THE RIO GLORIA

The matter to be taken up with McCloskey, master of trains and chief of the telegraph department,
was not altogether disciplinary. In the summarizing conference at Copah, Vice-President Ford
had spoken favorably of the trainmaster, recommending him to mercy in the event of a general
beheading in the Angels head-quarters. "A lame duck, like most of the desert exiles, and the
homeliest man west of the Missouri River," was Ford's characterization. "He is as stubborn
as a mule, but he is honest and outspoken. If you can win him over to your side, you will have
at least one lieutenant whom you can trust--and who will, I think, be duly grateful for small
favors. Mac couldn't get a job east of the Crosswater Hills, I'm afraid."

Lidgerwood had not inquired the reason for the eastern disability. He had lived in the West
long enough to know that it is an ill thing to pry too curiously into any man's past. So there
should be present efficiency, no man in the service should be called upon to recite in ancient
history, much less one for whom Ford had spoken a good word.

Like all the other offices in the Crow's Nest, that of the trainmaster was bare and uninviting.
Lidgerwood, passing beyond the door of communication, found himself in a dingy room, with cobwebs
festooning the ceiling and a pair of unwashed windows looking out upon the open square called,
in the past and gone day of the Angelic promoters, the "railroad plaza." Two chairs, a cheap
desk, and a pine table backed by the "string-board" working model of the current time-table,
did duty as the furnishings, serving rather to emphasize than to relieve the dreariness of
the place.

McCloskey was at his desk at the moment of door-opening, and Lidgerwood instantly paid tribute
to Vice-President Ford's powers of characterization. The trainmaster was undeniably homely--and
more; his hard-featured face was a study in grotesques. There was fearless honesty in the shrewd
gray eyes, and a good promise of capability in the strong Scotch jaw and long upper lip, but
the grotesque note was the one which persisted, and the trainmaster seemed wilfully to accentuate
it. His coat, in a region where shirt-sleeves predominated, was a close-buttoned gambler's
frock, and his hat, in the country of the sombrero and the soft Stetson, was a derby.

Lidgerwood was striving to estimate the man beneath these outward eccentricities when McCloskey
rose and thrust out a hand, great-jointed and knobbed like a laborer's.

"You're Mr. Lidgerwood, I take it?" said he, tilting the derby to the back of his head. "Come
to tell me to pack my kit and get out?"

"Not yet, Mr. McCloskey," laughed Lidgerwood, getting his first real measure of the man in
the hearty hand-grip. "On the contrary, I've come to thank you for not dropping things and
running away before the new management could get on the ground."

The trainmaster's rejoinder was outspokenly blunt. "I've nowhere to run to, Mr. Lidgerwood,
and that's no joke. Some of the backcappers will be telling you presently that I was a train
despatcher over in God's country, and that I put two trains together. It's your right to know
that it's true."

"Thank you, Mr. McCloskey," said Lidgerwood simply; "that sounds good to me. And take this
for yourself: the man who has done that once won't do it again. That is one thing, and another
is this: we start with a clean slate on the Red Butte Western. No man in the service who will
turn in and help us make a real railroad out of the R.B.W. need worry about his past record:
it won't be dug up against him."

"That's fair--more than fair," said the trainmaster, mouthing the words as if the mere effort
of speech were painful, "and I wish I could promise you that the rank and file will meet you
half-way. But I can't. You'll find a plucked pigeon, Mr. Lidgerwood--with plenty of hawks left
to pick the bones. The road has been running itself for the past two years and more."

"I understand," said Lidgerwood; and then he spoke of the careless despatching.

"That will be Callahan, the day man," McCloskey broke in wrathfully. "But that's the way of
it. When we get through the twenty-four hours without killing somebody or smashing something,
I thank God, and put a red mark on that calendar over my desk."

"Well, we won't go back of the returns," declared Lidgerwood, meaning to be as just as he could
to his predecessors in office. "But from now on----"

The door leading into the room beyond the trainmaster's office opened squeakily on dry hinges,
and a chattering of telegraph instruments heralded the incoming of a disreputable-looking office-man,
with a green patch over one eye and a blackened cob-pipe between his teeth. Seeing Lidgerwood,
he ducked and turned to McCloskey. Bradley, reporting in, had given his own paraphrase of the
new superintendent's strictures on Red Butte Western despatching and the criticism had lost
nothing in the recasting.

"Seventy-one's in the ditch at Gloria Siding," he said, speaking pointedly to the trainmaster.
"Goodloe reports it from Little Butte; says both enginemen are in the mix-up, but he doesn't
know whether they are killed or not."

"There you are!" snarled McCloskey, wheeling upon Lidgerwood. "They couldn't let you get your
chair warmed the first day!"

With the long run from Copah to Angels to his credit, and with all the head-quarters loose
ends still to be gathered up, Lidgerwood might blamelessly have turned over the trouble call
to his trainmaster. But a wreck was as good a starting-point as any, and he took command at once.

"Go and clear for the wrecking-train, and have some one in your office notify the shops and
the yard," he said briskly, compelling the attention of the one-eyed despatcher; and when Callahan
was gone: "Now, Mac, get out your map and post me. I'm a little lame on geography yet. Where
is Gloria Siding?"

McCloskey found a blue-print map of the line and traced the course of the western division
among the foot-hills to the base of the Great Timanyonis, and through the Timanyoni Canyon
to a park-like valley, shut in by the great range on the east and north, and by the Little
Timanyonis and the Hophras on the west and south. At a point midway of the valley his stubby
forefinger rested.

"That's Gloria," he said, "and here's Little Butte, twelve miles beyond."

"Good ground?" queried Lidgerwood.

"As pretty a stretch as there is anywhere west of the desert; reminds you of a Missouri bottom,
with the river on one side and the hills a mile away on the other. I don't know what excuse
those hoboes could find for piling a train in the ditch there."

"We'll hear the excuse later," said Lidgerwood. "Now, tell me what sort of a wrecking-plant
we have?"

"The best in the bunch," asserted the trainmaster. "Gridley's is the one department that has
been kept up to date and in good fighting trim. We have one wrecking-crane that will pick up
any of the big freight-pullers, and a lighter one that isn't half bad."

"Who is your wrecking-boss?"

"Gridley--when he feels like going out. He can clear a main line quicker than any man we've
ever had."

"He will go with us to-day?"

"I suppose so. He is in town and he's--sober."

The new superintendent caught at the hesitant word.

"Drinks, does he?"

"Not much while he is on the job. But he disappears periodically and comes back looking something
the worse for wear. They tell tough stories about him over in Copah."

Lidgerwood dropped the master-mechanic as he had dropped the offending trainmen who had put
Train 71 in the ditch at Gloria where, according to McCloskey, there should be no ditch.

"I'll go and run through my desk mail and fill Hallock up while you are making ready," he said.
"Call me when the train is made up."

Passing through the corridor on the way to his private office back of Hallock's room, Lidgerwood
saw that the wreck call had already reached the shops. A big, bearded man with a soft hat pulled
over his eyes was directing the make-up of a train on the repair track, and the yard engine
was pulling an enormous crane down from its spur beyond the coal-chutes. Around the man in
the soft hat the wrecking-crew was gathering: shopmen for the greater part, as a crew of a
master mechanic's choosing would be.

As the event proved, there was little time for the doing of the preliminary work which Lidgerwood
had meant to do. In the midst of the letter-sorting, McCloskey put his head in at the door
of the private office.

"We're ready when you are, Mr. Lidgerwood," he interrupted; and with a few hurried directions
to Hallock, Lidgerwood joined the trainmaster on the Crow's Nest platform. The train was backing
up to get its clear-track orders, and on the tool-car platform stood the big man whom Lidgerwood
had already identified presumptively as Gridley.

McCloskey would have introduced the new superintendent when the train paused for the signal
from the despatcher's window, but Gridley did not wait for the formalities.

"Come aboard, Mr. Lidgerwood," he called, genially. "It's too bad we have to give you a sweat-box
welcome. If there are any of Seventy-one's crew left alive, you ought to give them thirty days
for calling you out before you could shake hands with yourself."

Being by nature deliberate in forming friendships, and proportionally tenacious of them when
they were formed, Lidgerwood's impulse was to hold all men at arm's length until he was reasonably
assured of sincerity and a common ground. But the genial master-mechanic refused to be put
on probation. Lidgerwood made the effort while the rescue train was whipping around the hill
shoulders and plunging deeper into the afternoon shadows of the great mountain range. The tool-car
was comfortably filled with men and working tackle, and for seats there were only the blocking
timbers, the tool-boxes, and the coils of rope and chain cables. Sharing a tool-box with Gridley
and smoking a cigar out of Gridley's pocket-case, Lidgerwood found it difficult to be less
than friendly.

It was to little purpose that he recalled Ford's qualified recommendation of the man who had
New York backing and who, in Ford's phrase, was a "brute after his own peculiar fashion." Brute
or human, the big master-mechanic had the manners of a gentleman, and his easy good-nature
broke down all the barriers of reserve that his somewhat reticent companion could interpose.

"You smoke good cigars, Mr. Gridley," said Lidgerwood, trying, as he had tried before, to wrench
the talk aside from the personal channel into which it seemed naturally to drift.

"Good tobacco is one of the few luxuries the desert leaves a man capable of enjoying. You haven't
come to that yet, but you will. It is a savage life, Mr. Lidgerwood, and if a man hasn't a
good bit of the blood of his stone-age ancestors in him, the desert will either kill him or
make a beast of him. There doesn't seem to be any medium."

The talk was back again in the personal channel, and this time Lidgerwood met the issue fairly.

"You have been saying that, in one form or another, ever since we left Angels: are you trying
to scare me off, Mr. Gridley, or are you only giving me a friendly warning?" he asked.

The master-mechanic laughed easily.

"I hope I wouldn't be impudent enough to do either, on such short acquaintance," he protested.
"But now that you have opened the door, perhaps a little man-to-man frankness won't be amiss.
You have tackled a pretty hard proposition, Mr. Lidgerwood."

"Technically, you mean?"

"No, I didn't mean that, because, if your friends tell the truth about you, you can come as
near to making bricks without straw as the next man. But the Red Butte Western reorganization
asks for something more than a good railroad officer."

"I'm listening," said Lidgerwood.

Gridley laughed again.

"What will you do when a conductor or an engineer whom you have called on the carpet curses
you out and invites you to go to hell?"

"I shall fire him," was the prompt rejoinder.

"Naturally and properly, but afterward? Four out of five men in this human scrap-heap you've
inherited will lay for you with a gun to play even for the discharge. What then?"

It was just here that Lidgerwood, staring absently at the passing panorama of shifting hill
shoulders framing itself in the open side-door of the tool-car, missed a point. If he had been
less absorbed in the personal problem he could scarcely have failed to mark the searching scrutiny
in the shrewd eyes shaded by Gridley's soft hat.

"I don't know," he said, half hesitantly. "Civilization means something--or it should mean
something--even in the Red Desert, Mr. Gridley. I suppose there is some semblance of legal
protection in Angels, as elsewhere, isn't there?"

The master-mechanic's smile was tolerant.

"Surely. We have a town marshal, and a justice of the peace; one is a blacksmith and the other
the keeper of the general store."

The good-natured irony in Gridley's reply was not thrown away upon his listener, but Lidgerwood
held tenaciously to his own contention.

"The inadequacy of the law, or of its machinery, hardly excuses a lapse into barbarism," he
protested. "The discharged employee, in the case you are supposing, might hold himself justified
in shooting at me; but if I should shoot back and happen to kill him, it would be murder. We've
got to stand for something, Mr. Gridley, you and I who know the difference between civilization
and savagery."

Gridley's strong teeth came together with a little snap.

"Certainly," he agreed, without a shade of hesitation; adding, "I've never carried a gun and
have never had to." Then he changed the subject abruptly, and when the train had swung around
the last of the hills and was threading its tortuous way through the great canyon, he proposed
a change of base to the rear platform from which Chandler's marvel of engineering skill could
be better seen and appreciated.

The wreck at Gloria Siding proved to be a very mild one, as railway wrecks go. A broken flange
under a box-car had derailed the engine and a dozen cars, and there were no casualties--the
report about the involvement of the two enginemen being due to the imagination of the excited
flagman who had propelled himself on a hand-car back to Little Butte to send in the call for help.

Since Gridley was on the ground, Lidgerwood and McCloskey stood aside and let the master-mechanic
organize the attack. Though the problem of track-clearing, on level ground and with a convenient
siding at hand for the sorting and shifting, was a simple one, there was still a chance for
an exhibition of time-saving and speed, and Gridley gave it. There was never a false move made
or a tentative one, and when the huge lifting-crane went into action, Lidgerwood grew warmly
enthusiastic.

"Gridley certainly knows his business," he said to McCloskey. "The Red Butte Western doesn't
need any better wrecking-boss than it has right now."

"He can do the job, when he feels like it," admitted the trainmaster sourly.

"But he doesn't often feel like it? You can't blame him for that. Picking up wrecks isn't fairly
a part of a master-mechanic's duty."

"That is what he says, and he doesn't trouble himself to go when it isn't convenient. I have
a notion he wouldn't be here to-day if you weren't."

It was plainly evident that McCloskey meant more than he said, but once again Lidgerwood refused
to go behind the returns. He felt that he had been prejudiced against Gridley at the outset,
unduly so, he was beginning to think, and even-handed fairness to all must be the watchword
in the campaign of reorganization.

"Since we seem to be more ornamental than useful on this job, you might give me another lesson
in Red Butte geography, Mac," he said, purposely changing the subject. "Where are the gulch mines?"

The trainmaster explained painstakingly, squatting to trace a rude map in the sand at the track-side.
Hereaway, twelve miles to the westward, lay Little Butte, where the line swept a great curve
to the north and so continued on to Red Butte. Along the northward stretch, and in the foot-hills
of the Little Timanyonis, were the placers, most of them productive, but none of them rich
enough to stimulate a rush.

Here, where the river made a quick turn, was the butte from which the station of Little Butte
took its name--the superintendent might see its wooded summit rising above the lower hills
intervening. It was a long, narrow ridge, more like a hogback than a true mountain, and it
held a silver mine, Flemister's, which was a moderately heavy shipper. The vein had been followed
completely through the ridge, and the spur track in the eastern gulch, which had originally
served it, had been abandoned and a new spur built up along the western foot of the butte,
with a main line connection at Little Butte. Up here, ten miles above Little Butte, was a bauxite
mine, with a spur; and here....

McCloskey went on, industriously drawing lines in the sand, and Lidgerwood sat on a cross-tie
end and conned his lesson. Below the siding the big crane was heaving the derailed cars into
line with methodical precision, but now it was Gridley's shop foreman who was giving the orders.
The master-mechanic had gone aside to hold converse with a man who had driven up in a buckboard,
coming from the direction in which Little Butte lay.

"Goodloe told me the wreck-wagons were here, and I thought you would probably be along," the
buckboard driver was saying. "How are things shaping up? I haven't cared to risk the wires
since Bigsby leaked on us."

Gridley put a foot on the hub of the buckboard wheel and began to whittle a match with a penknife
that was as keen as a razor.

"The new chum is in the saddle; look over your shoulder to the left and you'll see him sitting
on a cross-tie beside McCloskey," he said.

"I've seen him before. He was over the road last week, and I happened to be in Goodloe's office
at Little Butte when he got off to look around," was the curt rejoinder. "But that doesn't
help any. What do you know?"

"He is a gentleman," said Gridley slowly.

"Oh, the devil! what do I care about----"

"And a scholar," the master-mechanic went on imperturbably.

The buckboard driver's black eyes snapped. "Can you add the rest of it--'and he isn't very
bright'?"

"No," was the sober reply.

"Well, what are we up against?"

Gridley snapped the penknife shut and began to chew the sharpened end of the match.

"Your pop-valve is set too light; you blow off too easily, Flemister," he commented. "So far
we--or rather you--are up against nothing worse than the old proposition. Lidgerwood is going
to try to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, beginning with the pay-roll contingent. If
I have sized him up right, he'll be kept busy; too busy to remember your name--or mine."

"What do you mean? in just so many words."

"Nothing more than I have said. Mr. Lidgerwood is a gentleman and a scholar."

"Ha!" said the man in the buckboard seat. "I believe I'm catching on, after so long a time.
You mean he hasn't the sand."

Gridley neither denied nor affirmed. He had taken out his penknife again and was resharpening
the match.

"Hallock is the man to look to," he said. "If we could get him interested ..."

"That's up to you, damn it; I've told you a hundred times that I can't touch him!"

"I know; he doesn't seem to love you very much. The last time I talked to him he mentioned
something about shooting you off-hand, but I guess he didn't mean, it. You've got to interest
him in some way, Flemister."

"Perhaps you can tell me how," was the sarcastic retort.

"I think perhaps I can, now. Do you remember anything about the sky-rocketing finish of the
Mesa Building and Loan Association, or is that too much of a back number for a busy man like you?"

"I remember it," said Flemister.

"Hallock was the treasurer," put in Gridley smoothly.

"Yes, but----"

"Wait a minute. A treasurer is supposed to treasure something, isn't he? There are possibly
twenty-five or thirty men still left in the Red Butte Western service who have never wholly
quit trying to find out why Hallock, the treasurer, failed so signally to treasure anything."

"Yah! that's an old sore."

"I know, but old sores may become suddenly troublesome--or useful--as the case may be. For
some reason best known to himself, Hallock has decided to stay and continue playing second fiddle."

"How do you know?"

The genial smile was wrinkling at the corners of Gridley's eyes.

"There isn't very much going on under the sheet-iron roof of the Crow's Nest that I don't know,
Flemister, and usually pretty soon after it happens. Hallock will stay on as chief clerk, and,
naturally, he is anxious to stand well with his new boss. Are you beginning to see daylight?"

"Not yet."

"Well, we'll open the shutters a little wider. One of the first things Lidgerwood will have
to wrestle with will be this Loan Association business. The kickers will put it up to him,
as they have put it up to every new man who has come out here. Ferguson refused to dig into
anybody's old graveyard, and so did Cumberley. But Lidgerwood won't refuse. He is going to
be the just judge, if not the very terrible."

"Still, I don't see," persisted Flemister.

"Don't you? Hallock will be obliged to justify himself to Lidgerwood, and he can't. In fact,
there is only one man living to-day who could fully justify him."

"And that man is----"

"--Pennington Flemister, ex-president of the defunct Building and Loan. You know where the
money went, Flemister."

"Maybe I do. What of that?"

"I can only offer a suggestion, of course. You are a pretty smooth liar, Pennington; it wouldn't
be much trouble for you to fix up a story that would satisfy Lidgerwood. You might even show
up a few documents, if it came to the worst."

"Well?"

"That's all. If you get a good, firm grip on that club, you'll have Hallock, coming and going.
It's a dead open and shut. If he falls in line, you'll agree to pacify Lidgerwood; otherwise
the law will have to take its course."

The man in the buckboard was silent for a long minute before he said: "It won't work, Gridley.
Hallock's grudge against me is too bitter. You know part of it, and part of it you don't know.
He'd hang himself in a minute if he could get my neck in the same noose."

The master-mechanic threw the whittled match away, as if the argument were closed.

"That is where you are lame, Flemister: you don't know your man. Put it up to Hallock barehanded:
if he comes in, all right; if not, you'll put him where he'll wear stripes. That will fetch him."

The men of the derrick gang were righting the last of the derailed box-cars, and the crew of
the wrecking-train was shifting the cripples into line for the return run to Angels.

"We'll be going in a few minutes," said the master-mechanic, taking his foot from the wheel-hub.
"Do you want to meet Lidgerwood?"

"Not here--or with you," said the owner of the Wire-Silver; and he had turned his team and
was driving away when Gridley's shop foreman came up to say that the wrecking-train was ready
to leave.

Lidgerwood found a seat for himself in the tool-car on the way back to Angels, and put in the
time smoking a short pipe and reviewing the events of his first day in the new field.

The outlook was not wholly discouraging, and but for the talk with Gridley he might have smoked
and dozed quite peacefully on his coiled hawser, in the corner of the car. But, try as he would,
the importunate demon of distrust, distrust of himself, awakened by the master-mechanic's warning,
refused to be quieted; and when, after the three hours of the slow return journey were out-worn,
McCloskey came to tell him that the train was pulling into the Angels yard, the explosion of
a track torpedo under the wheels made him start like a nervous woman.

V

THE OUTLAWS

For the first few weeks after the change in ownership and the arrival of the new superintendent,
the Red Butte Western and its nerve-centre, Angels, seemed disposed to take Mr. Howard Lidgerwood
as a rather ill-timed joke, perpetrated upon a primitive West and its people by some one of
the Pacific Southwestern magnates who owned a broad sense of humor.

During this period the sardonic laugh was heard in the land, and the chuckling appreciation
of the joke by the Red Butte rank and file, and by the Angelic soldiers of fortune who, though
not upon the company's pay-rolls, still throve indirectly upon the company's bounty, lacked
nothing of completeness. The Red Desert grinned like the famed Cheshire cat when an incoming
train from the East brought sundry boxes and trunks, said to contain the new boss's wardrobe.
Its guffaws were long and uproarious when it began to be noised about that the company carpenters
and fitters were installing a bath and other civilizing and softening appliances in the alcove
opening out of the superintendent's sleeping-room in the head-quarters building.

Lidgerwood slept in the Crow's Nest, not so much from choice as for the reason that there seemed
to be no alternative save a room in the town tavern, appropriately named "The Hotel Celestial."
Between his sleeping-apartment and his private office there was only a thin board partition;
but even this gave him more privacy than the Celestial could offer, where many of the partitions
were of building-paper, muslin covered.

It is a railroad proverb that the properly inoculated railroad man eats and sleeps with his
business; Lidgerwood exemplified the saying by having a wire cut into the despatcher's office,
with the terminals on a little table at his bed's head, and with a tiny telegraph relay instrument
mounted on the stand. Through the relay, tapping softly in the darkness, came the news of the
line, and often, after the strenuous day was ended, Lidgerwood would lie awake listening.

Sometimes the wire gossiped, and echoes of Homeric laughter trickled through the relay in the
small hours; as when Ruby Creek asked the night despatcher if it were true that the new boss
slept in what translated itself in the laborious Morse of the Ruby Creek operator as "pijjimmies";
or when Navajo, tapping the same source of information, wished to be informed if the "Chink"--doubtless
referring to Tadasu Matsuwari--ran a laundry on the side and thus kept His Royal Highness in
collars and cuffs.

At the tar-paper-covered, iron-roofed Celestial, where he took his meals, Lidgerwood had a
table to himself, which he shared at times with McCloskey, and at other times with breezy Jack
Benson, the young engineer whom Vice-President Ford had sent, upon Lidgerwood's request and
recommendation, to put new life into the track force, and to make the preliminary surveys for
a possible western extension of the road.

When the superintendent had guests, the long table on the opposite side of the dining-room
restrained itself. When he ate alone, Maggie Donovan, the fiery-eyed, heavy-handed table-girl
who ringed his plate with the semicircle of ironstone portion dishes, stood between him and
the men who were still regarding him as a joke. And since Maggie's displeasure manifested itself
in cold coffee and tough cuts of the beef, the long table made its most excruciating jests
elaborately impersonal.

On the line, and in the roundhouse and repair-shops, the joke was far too good to be muzzled.
The nickname, "Collars-and-Cuffs," became classical; and once, when Brannagan and the 117 were
ordered out on the service-car, the Irishman wore the highest celluloid collar he could find
in Angels, rounding out the clownery with a pair of huge wickerware cuffs, which had once seen
service as the coverings of a pair of Maraschino bottles.

No official notice having been taken of Brannagan's fooling, Buck Tryon, ordered out on the
same duty, went the little Irishman one better, decorating his engine headlight and handrails
with festoonings of colored calico, the decoration figuring as a caricature of Lidgerwood's
college colors, and calico being the nearest approach to bunting obtainable at Jake Schleisinger's
emporium, two doors north of Red-Light Sammy's house of call.

All of which was harmless enough, one would say, however subversive of dignified discipline
it might be. Lidgerwood knew. The jests were too broad to be missed. But he ignored them good-naturedly,
rather thankful for the playful interlude which gave him a breathing-space and time to study
the field before the real battle should begin.

That a battle would have to be fought was evident enough. As yet, the demoralization had been
scarcely checked, and sooner or later the necessary radical reforms would have to begin. Gridley,
whose attitude toward the new superintendent continued to be that of a disinterested adviser,
assured Lidgerwood that he was losing ground by not opening the campaign of severity at once.

"You'll have to take a club to these hoboes before you can ever hope to make railroad men out
of them," was Gridley's oft-repeated assertion; and the fact that the master-mechanic was continually
urging the warfare made Lidgerwood delay it.

Just why Gridley's counsel should have produced such a contrary effect, Lidgerwood could not
have explained. The advice was sound, and the man who gave it was friendly and apparently ingenuous.
But prejudices, like prepossessions, are sometimes as strong as they are inexplicable, and
while Lidgerwood freely accused himself of injustice toward the master-mechanic, a certain
feeling of distrust and repulsion, dating back to his first impressions of the man, died hard.

Oddly enough, on the other hand, there was a prepossession, quite as unreasoning, for Hallock.
There was absolutely nothing in the chief clerk to inspire liking, or even common business
confidence; on the contrary, while Hallock attended to his duties and carried out his superior's
instructions with the exactness of an automaton, his attitude was distinctly antagonistic.
As the chief subaltern on Lidgerwood's small staff he was efficient and well-nigh invaluable.
But as a man, Lidgerwood felt that he might easily be regarded as an enemy whose designs could
never be fathomed or prefigured.

In spite of Hallock's singular manner, which was an abrupt challenge to all comers, Lidgerwood
acknowledged a growing liking for the chief clerk. Under the crabbed and gloomy crust of the
man the superintendent fancied he could discover a certain savage loyalty. But under the loyalty
there was a deeper depth--of misery, or tragedy, or both; and to this abysmal part of him there
was no key that Lidgerwood could find.

McCloskey, who had served under Hallock for a number of months before the change in management,
confessed that he knew the gloomy chief clerk only as a man in authority, and exceedingly hard
to please. Questioned more particularly by Lidgerwood, McCloskey added that Hallock was married;
that after the first few months in Angels his wife, a strikingly beautiful young woman, had
disappeared, and that since her departure Hallock had lived alone in two rooms over the freight
station, rooms which no one, save himself, ever entered.

These, and similar bits of local history, were mere gatherings by the way for the superintendent,
picked up while the Red Desert was having its laugh at the new bath-room, the pajamas, and
the clean linen. They weighed lightly, because the principal problem was, as yet, untouched.
For while the laugh endured, Lidgerwood had not found it possible to breach many of the strongholds
of lawlessness.

Orders, regarded by disciplined railroad men as having the immutability of the laws of the
Medes and Persians, were still interpreted as loosely as if they were but the casual suggestions
of a bystander. Rules were formulated and given black-letter emphasis in their postings on
the bulletin boards, only to be coolly ignored when they chanced to conflict with some train
crew's desire to make up time or to kill it. Directed to account for fuel and oil consumed,
the enginemen good-naturedly forged reports and the storekeepers blandly O.K.'d them. Instructed
to keep an accurate record of all material used, the trackmen jocosely scattered more spikes
than they drove, made fire-wood of the stock cross-ties, and were not above underpinning the
section-houses with new dimension timbers.

In countless other ways the waste was prodigious and often mysteriously unexplainable. The
company supplies had a curious fashion of disappearing in transit. Two car-loads of building
lumber sent to repair the station at Red Butte vanished somewhere between the Angels shipping-yards
and their billing destination. Lime, cement, and paint were exceedingly volatile. House hardware,
purchased in quantities for company repairs, figured in the monthly requisition sheet as regularly
as coal and oil; and the lost-tool account roughly balanced the pay-roll of the company carpenters
and bridge-builders.

In such a chaotic state of affairs, track and train troubles were the rule rather than the
exception, and it was a Red Butte Western boast that the fire was never drawn under the wrecking-train
engine. For the first few weeks Lidgerwood let McCloskey answer the "hurry calls" to the various
scenes of disaster, but when three sections of an eastbound cattle special, ignoring the ten-minute-interval
rule, were piled up in the Piñon Hills, he went out and took personal command of the track-clearers.

This happened when the joke was at flood-tide, and the men of the wrecking-crew took a ten-gallon
keg of whiskey along wherewith to celebrate the first appearance of the new superintendent
in character as a practical wrecking-boss. The outcome was rather astonishing. For one thing,
Lidgerwood's first executive act was to knock in the head of the ten-gallon celebration with
a striking-hammer, before it was even spiggoted; and for another he quickly proved that he
was Gridley's equal, if not his master, in the gentle art of track-clearing; lastly, and this
was the most astonishing thing of all, he demonstrated that clean linen and correct garmentings
do not necessarily make for softness and effeminacy in the wearer. Through the long day and
the still longer night of toil and stress the new boss was able to endure hardship with the
best man on the ground.

This was excellent, as far as it went. But later, with the offending cattle-train crews before
him for trial and punishment, Lidgerwood lost all he had gained by being too easy.

"We've got him chasin' his feet," said Tryon, one of the rule-breaking engineers, making his
report to the roundhouse contingent at the close of the "sweat-box" interview. "It's just as
I've been tellin' you mugs all along, he hain't got sand enough to fire anybody."

Likewise Jack Benson, though from a friendlier point of view. The "sweat-box" was Lidgerwood's
private office in the Crow's Nest, and Benson happened to be present when the reckless trainmen
were told to go and sin no more.

"I'm not running your job, Lidgerwood, and you may fire the inkstand at me if the spirit moves
you to, but I've got to butt in. You can't handle the Red Desert with kid gloves on. Those
fellows needed an artistic cussing-out and a thirty-day hang-up at the very lightest. You can't
hold 'em down with Sunday-school talk."

Lidgerwood was frowning at his blotting-pad and pencilling idle little squares on it--a habit
which was insensibly growing upon him.

"Where would I get the two extra train-crews to fill in the thirty-day lay-off, Jack? Had you
thought of that?"

"I had only the one think, and I gave you that one," rejoined Benson carelessly. "I suppose
it is different in your department. When I go up against a thing like that on the sections,
I fire the whole bunch and import a few more Italians. Which reminds me, as old Dunkenfeld
used to say when there wasn't either a link or a coupling-pin anywhere within the four horizons:
what do you know about Fred Dawson, Gridley's shop draftsman?"

"Next to nothing, personally," replied Lidgerwood, taking Benson's abrupt change of topic as
a matter of course. "He seems a fine fellow; much too fine a fellow to be wasting himself out
here in the desert. Why?"

"Oh, I just wanted to know. Ever met his mother and sister?"

"No."

"Well, you ought to. The mother is one of the only two angels in Angels, and the sister is
the other. Dawson, himself, is a ghastly monomaniac."

Lidgerwood's brows lifted, though his query was unspoken.

"Haven't you heard his story?" asked Benson; "but of course you haven't. He is a lame duck,
you know--like every other man this side of Crosswater Summit, present company excepted."

"A lame duck?" repeated Lidgerwood.

"Yes, a man with a past. Don't tell me you haven't caught onto the hall-mark of the Red Desert.
It's notorious. The blacklegs and tin-horns and sure-shots go without saying, of course, but
they haven't a monopoly on the broken records. Over in the ranch country beyond the Timanyonis
they lump us all together and call us the outlaws."

"Not without reason," said Lidgerwood.

"Not any," asserted Benson with cheerful pessimism. "The entire Red Butte Western outfit is
tarred with the same stick. You haven't a dozen operators, all told, who haven't been discharged
for incompetence, or worse, somewhere else; or a dozen conductors or engineers who weren't
good and comfortably blacklisted before they climbed Crosswater. Take McCloskey: you swear
by him, don't you? He was a chief despatcher back East, and he put two passenger-trains together
in a head-on collision the day he resigned and came West to grow up with the Red Desert."

"I know," said Lidgerwood, "and I did not have to learn it at second-hand. Mac was man enough
to tell me himself, before I had known him five minutes." Then he suggested mildly, "But you
were speaking of Dawson, weren't you?"

"Yes, and that's what makes me say what I'm saying; he is one of them, though he needn't be
if he weren't such a hopelessly sensitive ass. He's a B.S. in M.E., or he would have been if
he had stayed out his senior year in Carnegie, but also he happened to be a foot-ball fiend,
and in the last intercollegiate game of his last season he had the horrible luck to kill a
man--and the man was the brother of the girl Dawson was going to marry."

"Heavens and earth!" exclaimed Lidgerwood. "Is he that Dawson?"

"The same," said the young engineer laconically. "It was the sheerest accident, and everybody
knew it was, and nobody blamed Dawson. I happen to know, because I was a junior in Carnegie
at the time. But Fred took it hard; let it spoil his life. He threw up everything, left college
between two days, and came to bury himself out here. For two years he never let his mother
and sister know where he was; made remittances to them through a bank in Omaha, so they shouldn't
be able to trace him. Care to hear any more?"

"Yes, go on," said the superintendent.

"I found him," chuckled Benson, "and I took the liberty of piping his little game off to the
harrowed women. Next thing he knew they dropped in on him; and he is just crazy enough to stay
here, and to keep them here. That wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for Gridley, Fred's boss
and your peach of a master-mechanic."

"Why 'peach'? Gridley is a pretty decent sort of a man-driver, isn't he?" said Lidgerwood,
doing premeditated and intentional violence to what he had come to call his unjust prejudice
against the handsome master-mechanic.

"You won't believe it," said Benson hotly, "but he has actually got the nerve to make love
to Dawson's sister! and he a widow-man, old enough to be her father!"

Lidgerwood smiled. It is the privilege of youth to be intolerant of age in its rival. Gridley
was, possibly, forty-two or three, but Benson was still on the sunny slope of twenty-five.
"You are prejudiced, Jack," he criticized. "Gridley is still young enough to marry again, if
he wants to--and to live long enough to spoil his grandchildren."

"But he doesn't begin to be good enough for Faith Dawson," countered the young engineer, stubbornly.

"Isn't he? or is that another bit of your personal grudge? What do you know against him?"

Pressed thus sharply against the unyielding fact, Benson was obliged to confess that he knew
nothing at all against the master-mechanic, nothing that could be pinned down to day and date.
If Gridley had the weaknesses common to Red-Desert mankind, he did not parade them in Angels.
As the head of his department he was well known to be a hard hitter; and now and then, when
the blows fell rather mercilessly, the railroad colony called him a tyrant, and hinted that
he, too, had a past that would not bear inspection. But even Benson admitted that this was
mere gossip.

Lidgerwood laughed at the engineer's failure to make his case, and asked quizzically, "Where
do I come in on all this, Jack? You have an axe to grind, I take it."

"I have. Mrs. Dawson wants me to take my meals at the house. I'm inclined to believe that she
is a bit shy of Gridley, and maybe she thinks I could do the buffer act. But as a get-between
I'd be chiefly conspicuous by my absence."

"Sorry I can't give you an office job," said the superintendent in mock sympathy.

"So am I, but you can do the next best thing. Get Fred to take you home with him some of these
fine evenings, and you'll never go back to Maggie Donovan and the Celestial's individual hash-holders;
not if you can persuade Mrs. Dawson to feed you. The alternative is to fire Gridley out of
his job."

"This time you are trying to make the tail wag the dog," said Lidgerwood. "Gridley has twice
my backing in the P. S-W. board of directors. Besides, he is a good fellow; and if I go up
on the mesa and try to stand him off for you, it will be only because I hope you are a better
fellow."

"Prop it up on any leg you like, only go," said Benson simply. "I'll take it as a personal
favor, and do as much for you, some time. I suppose I don't have to warn you not to fall in
love with Faith Dawson yourself--or, on second thought, perhaps I had better."

This time Lidgerwood's laugh was mirthless.

"No, you don't have to, Jack. Like Gridley, I am older than I look, and I have had my little
turn at that wheel; or rather, perhaps I should say that the wheel has had its little turn
at me. You can safely deputize me, I guess."

"All right, and many thanks. Here's 202 coming in, and I'm going over to Navajo on it. Don't
wait too long before you make up to Dawson. You'll find him well worth while, after you've
broken through his shell."

The merry jest on the Red Butte Western ran its course for another week after the three-train
wreck in the Piñons--for a week and a day. Then Lidgerwood began the drawing of the net. A
new time-card was strung with McCloskey's cooperation, and when it went into effect a notice
on all bulletin boards announced the adoption of the standard "Book of Rules," and promised
penalties in a rising scale for unauthorized departure therefrom.

Promptly the horse-laugh died away and the trouble storm was evoked. Grievance committees haunted
the Crow's Nest, and the insurrectionary faction, starting with the trainmen and spreading
to the track force, threatened to involve the telegraph operators--threatened to become a protest
unanimous and in the mass. Worse than this, the service, haphazard enough before, now became
a maddening chaos. Orders were misunderstood, whether wilfully or not no court of inquiry could
determine; wrecks were of almost daily occurrence, and the shop track was speedily filled to
the switches with crippled engines and cars.

In such a storm of disaster and disorder the captain in command soon finds and learns to distinguish
his loyal supporters, if any such there be. In the pandemonium of untoward events, McCloskey
was Lidgerwood's right hand, toiling, smiting, striving, and otherwise approving himself a
good soldier. But close behind him came Gridley; always suave and good-natured, making no complaints,
not even when the repair work made necessary by the innumerable wrecks grew mountain-high,
and always counselling firmness and more discipline.

"This is just what we have been needing for years, Mr. Lidgerwood," he took frequent occasion
to say. "Of course, we have now to pay the penalty for the sins of our predecessors; but if
you will persevere, we'll pull through and be a railroad in fact when the clouds roll by. Don't
give in an inch. Show these muckers that you mean business, and mean it all the time, and you'll
win out all right."

Thus the master-mechanic; and McCloskey, with more at stake and a less insulated point of view,
took it out in good, hard blows, backing his superior like a man. Indeed, in the small head-quarters
staff, Hallock was the only non-combatant. From the beginning of hostilities he seemed to have
made a pact with himself not to let it be known by any act or word of his that he was aware
of the suddenly precipitated conflict. The routine duties of a chief clerk's desk are never
light; Hallock's became so exacting that he rarely left his office, or the pen-like contrivance
in which he entrenched himself and did his work.

When the fight began, Lidgerwood observed Hallock closely, trying to discover if there were
any secret signs of the satisfaction which the revolt of the rank and file might be supposed
to awaken in an unsuccessful candidate for the official headship of the Red Butte Western.
There were none. Hallock's gaunt face, with the loose lips and the straggling, unkempt beard,
was a blank; and the worst wreck of the three which promptly followed the introduction of the
new rules, was noted in his reports with the calm indifference with which he might have jotted
down the breakage of a section foreman's spike-maul.

McCloskey, being of Scottish blood and desert-seasoned, was a cool in-fighter who could take
punishment without wincing overmuch. But at the end of the first fortnight of the new time-card,
he cornered his chief in the private office and freed his mind.

"It's no use, Mr. Lidgerwood; we can't make these reforms stick with the outfit we've got,"
he asserted, in sharp discouragement. "The next thing on the docket will be a strike, and you
know what that will mean, in a country where the whiskey is bad and nine men out of every ten
go fixed for trouble."

"I know; nevertheless the reforms have got to stick," returned Lidgerwood definitively. "We
are going to run this railroad as it should be run, or hang it up in the air. Did you discharge
that operator at Crow Canyon? the fellow who let Train 76 get by him without orders night before
last?"

"Dick Rufford? Oh yes, I fired him, and he came in on 202 to-day lugging a piece of artillery
and shooting off his mouth about what he was going to do to me ... and to you. I suppose you
know that his brother Bart, they call him 'the killer', is the lookout at Red-Light Sammy Faro's
game, and the meanest devil this side of the Timanyonis?"

"I didn't know it, but that cuts no figure." Lidgerwood forced himself to say it, though his
lips were curiously dry. "We are going to have discipline on this railroad while we stay here,
Mac; there are no two ways about that."

McCloskey tilted his hat to the bridge of his nose, his characteristic gesture of displeasure.

"I promised myself that I wouldn't join the gun-toters when I came out here," he said, half
musingly, "but I've weakened on that. Yesterday, when I was calling Jeff Cummings down for
dropping that new shifting-engine out of an open switch in broad daylight, he pulled on me
out of his cab window. What I had to take while he had me 'hands up' is more than I'll take
from any living man again."

As in other moments of stress and perplexity, Lidgerwood was absently marking little pencil
squares on his desk blotter.

"I wouldn't get down to the desert level, if I were you, Mac," he said thoughtfully.

"I'm down there right now, in self-defence," was the sober rejoinder. "And if you'll take a
hint from me you'll heel yourself, too, Mr. Lidgerwood. I know this country better than you
do, and the men in it. I don't say they'll come after you deliberately, but as things are now
you can't open your face to one of them without taking the chance of a quarrel, and a quarrel
in a gun-country----"

"I know," said Lidgerwood patiently, and the trainmaster gave it up.

It was an hour or two later in the same day when McCloskey came into the private office again,
hat tilted to nose, and the gargoyle face portraying fresh soul agonies.

"They've taken to pillaging now!" he burst out. "The 316, that new saddle-tank shifting-engine,
has disappeared. I saw Broderick using the '95, and when I asked him why, he said he couldn't
find the '16."

"Couldn't find it?" echoed Lidgerwood.

"No; nor I can't, either. It's nowhere in the yards, the roundhouse, or back shop, and none
of Gridley's foremen know anything about it. I've had Callahan wire east and west, and if they're
all telling the truth, nobody has seen it or heard of it."

"Where was it, at last accounts?"

"Standing on the coal track under chute number three, where the night crew left it at midnight,
or thereabouts."

"But certainly somebody must know where it has gone," said Lidgerwood.

"Yes; and by grapples! I think I know who the somebody is."

"Who is it?"

"If I should tell you, you wouldn't believe it, and besides I haven't got the proof. But I'm
going to get the proof," shaking a menacing forefinger, "and when I do----"

The interruption was the entrance of Hallock, coming in with the pay-rolls for the superintendent's
approval. McCloskey broke off short and turned to the door, but Lidgerwood gave him a parting
command.

"Come in again, Mac, in about half an hour. There is another matter that I want to take up
with you, and to-day is as good a time as any."

The trainmaster nodded and went out, muttering curses to the tilted hat brim.

VI

EVERYMAN'S SHARE

"This switching-engine mystery opens up a field that I've been trying to get into for some
little time, Mac," the superintendent began, after the half-hour had elapsed and the trainmaster
had returned to the private office. "Sit down and we'll thresh it out. Here are some figures
showing loss and expense in the general maintenance account. Look them over and tell me what
you think."

"Wastage, you mean?" queried the trainmaster, glancing at the totals in the auditor's statement.

"That is what I have been calling it; a reckless disregard for the value of anything and everything
that can be included in a requisition. There is a good deal of that, I know; the right-of-way
is littered from end to end with good material thrown aside. But I'm afraid that isn't the
worst of it."

The trainmaster was nursing a knee and screwing his face into the reflective scheme of distortion.

"Those things are always hard to prove. Short of a military guard, for instance, you couldn't
prevent Angels from raiding the company's coal-yard for its cook-stoves. That's one leak, and
the others are pretty much like it. If a company employee wants to steal, and there isn't enough
common honesty among his fellow-employees to hold him down, he can steal fast enough and get
away with it."

"By littles, yes, but not in quantity," pursued Lidgerwood.

"'Mony a little makes a mickle,' as my old grandfather used to say," McCloskey went on. "If
everybody gets his fingers into the sugar-bowl----"

Lidgerwood swung his chair to face McCloskey.

"We'll pass up the petty thieveries, for the present, and look a little higher," he said gravely.
"Have you found any trace of those two car-loads of company lumber lost in transit between
here and Red Butte two weeks ago?"

"No, nor of the cars themselves. They were reported as two Transcontinental flats, initials
and numbers plainly given in the car-record. They seem to have disappeared with the lumber."

"Which means?" queried the superintendent.

"That the numbers, or the initials, or both, were wrongly reported. It means that it was a
put-up job to steal the lumber."

"Exactly. And there was a mixed car-load of lime and cement lost at about the same time, wasn't
there?"

"Yes."

Lidgerwood's swing-chair "righted itself to the perpendicular with a snap."

"Mac, the Red Butte mines are looking up a little, and there is a good bit of house-building
going on in the camp just now: tell me, what man or men in the company's service would be likely
to be taking a flyer in Red Butte real estate?"

"I don't know of anybody. Gridley used to be interested in the camp. He went in pretty heavily
on the boom, and lost out--so they all say. So did your man out there in the pig-pen desk,"
with a jerk of his thumb to indicate the outer office.

"They are both out of it," said Lidgerwood shortly. Then: "How about Sullivan, the west-end
supervisor of track? He has property in Red Butte, I am told."

"Sullivan is a thief, all right, but he does it openly and brags about it; carries off a set
of bridge-timbers, now and then, for house-sills, and makes a joke of it with anybody who will
listen."

Lidgerwood dismissed Sullivan abruptly.

"It is an organized gang, and it must have its members pretty well scattered through the departments--and
have a good many members, too," he said conclusively. "That brings us to the disappearance
of the switching-engine again. No one man made off with that, single-handed, Mac."

"Hardly."

"It was this gang we are presupposing--the gang that has been stealing lumber and lime and
other material by the car-load."

"Well?"

"I believe we'll get to the bottom of all the looting on this switching-engine business. They
have overdone it this time. You can't put a locomotive in your pocket and walk off with it.
You say you've wired Copah?"

"Yes."

"Who was at the Copah key--Mr. Leckhard?"

"No. I didn't want to advertise our troubles to a main-line official. I got the day-despatcher,
Crandall, and told him to keep his mouth shut until he heard of it some other way."

"Good. And what did Crandall say?"

"He said that the '16 had never gone out through the Copah yards; that it couldn't get anywhere
if it had without everybody knowing about it."

Lidgerwood's abstracted gaze out of the office window became a frown of concentration.

"But the object, McCloskey--what possible profit could there be in the theft of a locomotive
that can neither be carried away nor converted into salable junk?"

The trainmaster shook his head. "I've stewed over that till I'm threatened with softening of
the brain," he confessed.

"Never mind, you have a comparatively easy job," Lidgerwood went on. "That engine is somewhere
this side of the Crosswater Hills. It is too big to be hidden under a bushel basket. Find it,
and you'll be hot on the trail of the car-load robbers."

McCloskey got upon his feet as if he were going at once to begin the search, but Lidgerwood
detained him.

"Hold on; I'm not quite through yet. Sit down again and have a smoke."

The trainmaster squinted sourly at the extended cigar-case. "I guess not," he demurred. "I
cut it out, along with the toddies, the day I put on my coat and hat and walked out of the
old F. & P.M. offices without my time-check."

"If it had to be both or neither, you were wise; whiskey and railroading don't go together
very well. But about this other matter. Some years ago there was a building and loan association
started here in Angels, the ostensible object being to help the railroad men to own their homes.
Ever hear of it?"

"Yes, but it was dead and buried before my time."

"Dead, but not buried," corrected Lidgerwood. "As I understand it, the railroad company fathered
it, or at all events, some of the officials took stock in it. When it died there was a considerable
deficit, together with a failure on the part of the executive committee to account for a pretty
liberal cash balance."

"I've heard that much," said the trainmaster.

"Then we'll bring it down to date," Lidgerwood resumed. "It appears that there are twenty-five
or thirty of the losers still in the employ of this company, and they have sent a committee
to me to ask for an investigation, basing the demand on the assertion that they were coerced
into giving up their money to the building and loan people."

"I've heard that, too," McCloskey admitted. "The story goes that the house-building scheme
was promoted by the old Red Butte Western bosses, and if a man didn't take stock he got himself
disliked. If he did take it, the premiums were held out on the pay-rolls. It smells like a
good, old-fashioned graft, with the lid nailed on."

"There wouldn't seem to be any reasonable doubt about the graft," said the superintendent.
"But my duty is clear. Of course, the Pacific Southwestern Company isn't responsible for the
side-issue schemes of the old Red Butte Western officials. But I want to do strict justice.
These men charge the officials of the building and loan company with open dishonesty. There
was a balance of several thousand dollars in the treasury when the explosion came, and it disappeared."

"Well?" said the trainmaster.

"The losers contend that somebody ought to make good to them. They also call attention to the
fact that the building and loan treasurer, who was never able satisfactorily to explain the
disappearance of the cash balance, is still on the railroad company's pay-rolls."

McCloskey sat up and tilted the derby to the back of his head. "Gridley?" he asked.

"No; for some reasons I wish it were Gridley. He is able to fight his own battles. It comes
nearer home, Mac. The treasurer was Hallock."

McCloskey rose noiselessly, tiptoed to the door of communication with the outer office, and
opened it with a quick jerk. There was no one there.

"I thought I heard something," he said. "Didn't you think you did?"

Lidgerwood shook his head.

"Hallock has gone over to the storekeeper's office to check up the time-rolls. He won't be
back to-day."

McCloskey closed the door and returned to his chair.

"If I say what I think, you'll be asking me for proofs, Mr. Lidgerwood, and I have none. Besides,
I'm a prejudiced witness. I don't like Hallock."

Quite unconsciously Lidgerwood picked up a pencil and began adding more squares to the miniature
checker-board on his desk blotter. It was altogether subversive of his own idea of fitness
to be discussing his chief clerk with his trainmaster, but McCloskey had proved himself an
honest partisan and a fearless one, and Lidgerwood was at a pass where the good counsel of
even a subordinate was not to be despised.

"I don't want to do Hallock an injustice," he went on, after a hesitant pause, "neither do
I wish to dig up the past, for him or for anybody. I was hoping that you might know some of
the inside details, and so make it easier for me to get at the truth. I can't believe that
Hallock was culpably responsible for the disappearance of the money."

By this time McCloskey had his hat tilted to the belligerent angle.

"I'm not a fair witness," he reiterated. "There's been gossip, and I've listened to it."

"About this building and loan mess?"

"No; about the wife."

"To Hallock's discredit, you mean?"

"You'd think so: there was a scandal of some sort; I don't know what it was--never wanted to
know. But there are men here in Angels who hint that Hallock killed the woman and sunk her
body in the Timanyoni."

"Heavens!" exclaimed Lidgerwood, under his breath. "I can't believe that, Mac."

"I don't know as I do, but I can tell you a thing that I do know, Mr. Lidgerwood: Hallock is
a devil out of hell when it comes to paying a grudge. There was a freight-conductor named Jackson
that he had a shindy with in Mr. Ferguson's time, and it came to blows. Hallock got the worst
of the fist-fight, but Ferguson made a joke of it and wouldn't fire Jackson. Hallock bided
his time like an Indian, and worked it around so that Jackson got promoted to a passenger run.
After that it was easy."

"How so?"

"It was the devil's own game. Jackson was a handsome young fellow, and Hallock set a woman
on him--a woman out of Cat Biggs's dance-hall. From that to holding out fares to get more money
to squander was only a step for the young fool, and he took it. Having baited the trap and
set it, Hallock sprung it. One fine day Jackson was caught red-handed and turned over to the
company lawyers. There had been a good bit of talk and they made an example of him. He's got
a couple of years to serve yet, I believe."

Lidgerwood was listening thoughtfully. The story which had ended so disastrously for the young
conductor threw a rather lurid sidelight upon Jackson's accuser. Fairness was the superintendent's
fetish, and the revenge which would sleep on its wrongs and go about deliberately and painstakingly
to strike a deadly blow in the dark was revolting to him. Yet he was just enough to distinguish
between gross vindictiveness and an evil which bore no relation to the vengeful one.

"A financially honest man might still have a weakness for playing even in a personal quarrel,"
he commented. "Your story proves nothing more than that."

"I know it."

"But I am going to run the other thing down, too," Lidgerwood insisted. "Hallock shall have
a chance to clear himself, but if he can't do it, he can't stay with me."

At this the trainmaster changed front so suddenly that Lidgerwood began to wonder if his estimate
of the man's courage was at fault.

"Don't do that, Mr. Lidgerwood, for God's sake don't stir up the devil in that long-haired
knife-fighter at such a time as this!" he begged. "The Lord knows you've got trouble enough
on hand as it is, without digging up something that belongs to the has-beens."

"I know, but justice is justice," was the decisive rejoinder. "The question is still a live
one, as the complaint of the grievance committee proves. If I dodge, my refusal to investigate
will be used against us in the labor trouble which you say is brewing. I'm not going to dodge,
McCloskey."

The contortions of the trainmaster's homely features indicated an inward struggle of the last-resort
nature. When he had reached a conclusion he spat it out.

"You haven't asked my advice, Mr. Lidgerwood, but here it is anyway. Flemister, the owner of
the Wire-Silver mine over in Timanyoni Park, was the president of that building and loan outfit.
He and Hallock are at daggers drawn, for some reason that I've never understood. If you could
get them together, perhaps they could make some sort of a statement that would quiet the kickers
for the time being, at any rate."

Lidgerwood looked up quickly. "That's odd," he said. "No longer ago than yesterday, Gridley
suggested precisely the same thing."

McCloskey was on his feet again and fumbling behind him for the door-knob.

"I'm all in," he grimaced. "When it comes to figuring with Gridley and Flemister and Hallock
all in the same breath, I'm done."

Lidgerwood made a memorandum on his desk calendar to take the building and loan matter up with
Hallock the following day. But another wreck intervened, and after the wreck a conference with
the Red Butte mine-owners postponed all office business for an additional twenty-four hours.
It was late in the evening of the third day when the superintendent's special steamed home
from the west, and Lidgerwood, who had dined in his car, went directly to his office in the
Crow's Nest.

He had scarcely settled himself at his desk for an attack upon the accumulation of mail when
Benson came in. It was a trouble call, and the young engineer's face advertised it.

"It's no use talking, Lidgerwood," he began, "I can't do business on this railroad until you
have killed off some of the thugs and highbinders."

Lidgerwood flung the paper-knife aside and whirled his chair to face the new complaint.

"What is the matter now, Jack?" he snapped.

"Oh, nothing much--when you're used to it; only about a thousand dollars' worth of dimension
timber gone glimmering. That's all."

"Tell it out," rasped the superintendent. The mine-owners' conference, from which he had just
returned, had been called to protest against the poor service given by the railroad, and knowing
his present inability to give better service, he had temporized until it needed but this one
more touch of the lash to make him lose his temper hopelessly.

"It's the Gloria bridge," said Benson. "We had the timbers all ready to pull out the old and
put in the new, and the shift was to be made to-day between trains. Last night every stick
of the new stock disappeared."

Lidgerwood was not a profane man, but what he said to Benson in the coruscating minute or two
which followed resolved itself into a very fair imitation of profanity, inclusive and world-embracing.

"And you didn't have wit enough to leave a watchman on the job!" he chafed--this by way of
putting an apex to the pyramid of objurgation. "By heavens! this thing has got to stop, Benson.
And it's going to stop, if we have to call out the State militia and picket every cursed mile
of this rotten railroad!"

"Do it," said Benson gruffly, "and when it's done you notify me and I'll come back to work."
And with that he tramped out, and was too angry to remember to close the door.

Lidgerwood turned back to his desk, savagely out of humor with Benson and with himself, and
raging inwardly at the mysterious thieves who were looting the company as boldly as an invading
army might. At this, the most inauspicious moment possible, his eye fell upon the calendar
memorandum, "See Hallock about B/L.," and his finger was on the chief clerk's bell-push before
he remembered that it was late, and that there had been no light in Hallock's room when he
had come down the corridor to his own door.

The touch of the push-button was only a touch, and there was no answering skirl of the bell
in the adjoining room. But, as if the intention had evoked it, a shadow crossed behind the
superintendent's chair and came to rest at the end of the roll-top desk. Lidgerwood looked
up with his eyes aflame. It was Hallock who was standing at the desk's end, and he was pointing
to the memorandum on the calendar pad.

"You made that note three days ago," he said abruptly. "I saw your train come in and your light
go on. What bill of lading was it you wanted to see me about?"

For an instant Lidgerwood failed to understand. Then he saw that in abbreviating he had unconsciously
used the familiar sign, "B/L," the common abbreviation of "bill of lading." At another time
he would have turned Hallock's very natural mistake into an easy introduction to a rather delicate
subject. But now he was angry.

"Sit down," he rapped out. "That isn't 'bill of lading'; it's 'building and loan.'"

Hallock dragged the one vacant chair into the circle illuminated by the shaded desk-electric,
and sat on the edge of it, with his hands on his knees. "Well?" he said, in the grating voice
that was so curiously like the master-mechanic's.

"We can cut out the details," this from the man who, under other conditions, would have gone
diplomatically into the smallest details. "Some years ago you were the treasurer of the Mesa
Building and Loan Association. When the association went out of business, its books showed
a cash balance in the treasury. What became of the money?"

Hallock sat as rigid as a carved figure flanking an Egyptian propylon, which his attitude suggested.
He was silent for a time, so long a time that Lidgerwood burst out impatiently, "Why don't
you answer me?"

"I was just wondering if it is worth while for you to throw me overboard," said the chief clerk,
speaking slowly and quite without heat. "You are needing friends pretty badly just now, if
you only knew it, Mr. Lidgerwood."

The cool retort, as from an equal in rank, added fresh fuel to the fire.

"I'm not buying friends with concessions to injustice and crooked dealing," Lidgerwood exploded.
"You were in the railroad service when the money was paid over to you, and you are in the railroad
service now. I want to know where the money went."

"It is none of your business, Mr. Lidgerwood," said the carved figure with the gloomy eyes
that never blinked.

"By heavens! I'm making it my business, Hallock! These men who were robbed say that you are
an embezzler, a thief. If you are not, you've got to clear yourself. If you are, you can't
stay in the Red Butte service another day: that's all."

Again there was a silence surcharged with electric possibilities. Lidgerwood bit the end from
a cigar and lost three matches before he succeeded in lighting it. Hallock sat perfectly still,
but the sallow tinge in his gaunt face had given place to a stony pallor. When he spoke, it
was still without anger.

"I don't care a damn for your chief clerkship," he said calmly, "but for reasons of my own
I am not ready to quit on such short notice. When I am ready, you won't have to discharge me.
Upon what terms can I stay?"

"I've stated them," said the one who was angry. "Discharge your trust; make good in dollars
and cents, or show cause why you were caught with an empty cash-box."

For the first time in the interview the chief clerk switched the stare of the gloomy eyes from
the memorandum desk calendar, and fixed it upon his accuser.

"You seem to take it for granted that I was the only grafter in the building and loan business,"
he objected. "I wasn't; on the contrary, I was only a necessary cog in the wheel. Somebody
had to make the deductions from the pay-rolls, and----"

"I'm not asking you to make excuses," stormed Lidgerwood. "I'm telling you that you've got
to make good! If the money was used legitimately, you, or some of your fellow-officers in the
company, should be able to show it. If the others left you to hold the bag, it is due to yourself,
to the men who were held up, and to me, that you set yourself straight. Go to Flemister--he
was your president, wasn't he?--and get him to make a statement that I can show to the grievance
committee. That will let you out, and me, too."

Hallock stood up and leaned over the desk end. His saturnine face was a mask of cold rage,
but his eyes were burning.

"If I thought you knew what you're saying," he began in the grating voice, "but you don't--you
can't know!" Then, with a sudden break in the fierce tone: "Don't send me to Flemister for
my clearance--don't do it, Mr. Lidgerwood. It's playing with fire. I didn't steal the money;
I'll swear it on a stack of Bibles a mile high. Flemister will tell you so if he is paid his
price. But you don't want me to pay the price. If I do----"

"Go on," said Lidgerwood, frowning, "if you do, what then?"

Hallock leaned still farther over the desk end.

"If I do, you'll get what you are after--and a good deal more. Again I am going to ask you
if it is worth while to throw me overboard."

Lidgerwood was still angry enough to resent this advance into the field of the personalities.

"You've had my last word, Hallock, and all this talk about consequences that you don't explain
is beside the mark. Get me that statement from Flemister, and do it soon. I am not going to
have it said that we are fighting graft in one place and covering it up in another."

Hallock straightened up and buttoned his coat.

"I'll get you the statement," he said, quietly; "and the consequences won't need any explaining."
His hand was on the door-knob when he finished saying it, and Lidgerwood had risen from his
chair. There was a pause, while one might count five.

"Well?" said the superintendent.

"I was thinking again," said the man at the door. "By all the rules of the game--the game as
it is played here in the desert--I ought to be giving you twenty-four hours to get out of gunshot,
Mr. Lidgerwood. Instead of that I am going to do you a service. You remember that operator,
Rufford, that you discharged a few days ago?"

"Yes."

"Bart Rufford, his brother, the 'lookout' at Red Light's place, has invited a few of his friends
to take notice that he intends to kill you. You can take it straight. He means it. And that
was what brought me up here to-night--not that memorandum on your desk calendar."

For a long time after the door had jarred to its shutting behind Hallock, Lidgerwood sat at
his desk, idle and abstractedly thoughtful. Twice within the interval he pulled out a small
drawer under the roll-top and made as if he would take up the weapon it contained, and each
time he closed the drawer to break with the temptation to put the pistol into his pocket.

Later, after he had forced himself to go to work, a door slammed somewhere in the despatcher's
end of the building, and automatically his hand shot out to the closed drawer. Then he made
his decision and carried it out. Taking the nickel-plated thing from its hiding-place, and
breaking it to eject the cartridges, he went to the end door of the corridor, which opened
into the unused space under the rafters, and flung the weapon to the farthest corner of the
dark loft.

VII

THE KILLER

Lidgerwood had found little difficulty in getting on the companionable side of Dawson, so far
as the heavy-muscled, silent young draftsman had a companionable side; and an invitation to
the family dinner-table at the Dawson cottage on the low mesa above the town had followed,
as a matter of course.

Once within the home circle, with Benson to plead his cause with the meek little woman whose
brown eyes held the shadow of a deep trouble, Lidgerwood had still less difficulty in arranging
to share Benson's permanent table welcome. Though Martha Dawson never admitted it, even to
her daughter, she stood in constant terror of the Red Desert and its representative town of
Angels, and the presence of the superintendent as the member of the household promised to be
an added guaranty of protection.

Lidgerwood's acceptance as a table boarder in the cottage on the mesa being hospitably prompt,
he was coming and going as regularly as his oversight of the three hundred miles of demoralization
permitted before the buffoonery of the Red Butte Western suddenly laughed itself out, and war
was declared. In the interval he had come to concur very heartily in Benson's estimate of the
family, and to share--without Benson's excuse, and without any reason that could be set in
words--the young engineer's opposition to Gridley as Miss Faith's possible choice.

There was little to be done in this field, however. Gridley came and went, not too often, figuring
always as a friend of the family, and usurping no more of Miss Dawson's time and attention
than she seemed willing to bestow upon him. Lidgerwood saw no chance to obstruct and no good
reason for obstructing. At all events, Gridley did not furnish the reason. And the first time
Lidgerwood found himself sitting out the sunset hour after dinner on the tiny porch of the
mesa cottage, with Faith Dawson as his companion--this while the joke was still running its
course--his talk was not of Gridley, nor yet of Benson; it was of himself.

"How long is it going to be before you are able to forget that I am constructively your brother's
boss, Miss Faith?" he asked, when she had brought him a cushion for the back of the hard veranda
chair in which he was trying to be luxuriously lazy.

"Oh, do I remember it?--disagreeably?" she laughed. And then, with charming naïveté: "I am
sure I try not to."

"I am beginning to wish you would try a little harder," he ventured, endeavoring to put her
securely upon the plane of companionship. "It is pretty lonesome sometimes, up here on the
top round of the Red-Butte-Western ladder of authority."

"You mean that you would like to leave your official dignity behind you when you come to us
here on the mesa?" she asked.

"That's the idea precisely. You have no conception how strenuous it is, wearing the halo all
the time, or perhaps I should say, the cap and bells."

She smiled. Frederic Dawson, the reticent, had never spoken of the attitude of the Red Butte
Western toward its new boss, but Gridley had referred to it quite frequently and had made a
joke of it. Without knowing just why, she had resented Gridley's attitude; this notwithstanding
the master-mechanic's genial affability whenever Lidgerwood and his difficulties were the object
of discussion.

"They are still refusing to take you seriously?" she said. "I hope you don't mind it too much."

"Personally, I don't mind it at all," he assured her--which was sufficiently true at the moment.
"The men are acting like a lot of foolish schoolboys bent on discouraging the new teacher.
I am hoping they will settle down to a sensible basis after a bit, and take me and the new
order of things for granted."

Miss Dawson had something on her mind; a thing not gathered from Gridley or from any one else
in particular, but which seemed to take shape of itself. The effect of setting it in speech
asked for a complete effacement of Lidgerwood the superintendent, and that was rather difficult.
But she compassed it.

"I don't think you ought to take them so much for granted--the men, I mean," she cautioned.
"I can't help feeling afraid that some of the joking is not quite good-natured."

"I fancy very little of it is what you would call good-natured," he rejoined evenly. "Very
much of it is thinly disguised contempt."

"For your authority?"

"For me, personally, first; and for my authority as a close second."

"Then you are anticipating trouble when the laugh is over?"

He shook his head. "I'm hoping No, as I said a moment ago, but I'm expecting Yes."

"And you are not afraid?"

It would have been worth a great deal to him if he could have looked fearlessly into the clear
gray eyes of questioning, giving her a brave man's denial. But instead, his gaze went beyond
her and he said: "You surely wouldn't expect me to confess it if I were afraid, would you?
Don't you despise a coward, Miss Dawson?"

The sun was sinking behind the Timanyonis, and the soft glow of the western sky suffused her
face, illuminating it with rare radiance. It was not, in the last analysis, a beautiful face,
he told himself, comparing it with another whose outlines were bitten deeply and beyond all
hope of erasure into the memory page. Yet the face warming softly in the sunset glow was sweet
and winsome, attractive in the best sense of the overworked word. At the moment Lidgerwood
rather envied Benson--or Gridley, whichever one of the two it was for whom Miss Dawson cared
the most.

"There are so many different kinds of cowards," she said, after the reflective interval.

"But they are all equally despicable?" he suggested.

"The real ones are, perhaps. But our definitions are often careless. My grandfather, who was
a captain of volunteers in the Civil War, used to say that real cowardice is either a psychological
condition or a soul disease, and that what we call the physical symptoms of it are often misleading."

"For example?" said Lidgerwood.

"Grandfather used to be fond of contrasting the camp-fire bully and braggart, as one extreme,
with the soldier who was frankly afraid of getting killed, as the other. It was his theory
that the man who dodged the first few bullets in a battle was quite likely to turn out to be
the real hero."

Lidgerwood could not resist the temptation to probe the old wound.

"Suppose, under some sudden stress, some totally unexpected trial, a man who was very much
afraid of being afraid found himself morally and physically unable to do the courageous thing.
Wouldn't he be, to all intents and purposes, a real coward?"

She took time to think.

"No," she said finally, "I wouldn't say that. I should wait until I had seen the same man tried
under conditions that would give him time, to think first and to act afterward."

"Would you really do that?" he asked doubtfully.

"Yes, I should. A trial of the kind you describe isn't quite fair. Acute presence of mind in
an emergency is not a supreme test of anything except of itself; least of all, perhaps, is
it a test of courage--I mean courage of that quality which endures to-day and faces without
flinching the threatening to-morrow."

"And you think the man who might be surprised into doing something very disgraceful on the
spur of the moment might still have that other kind of courage, Miss Faith?"

"Certainly." She was far enough from making any personal application of the test case suggested
by the superintendent. But in a world which took its keynote from the harsh discords of the
Red Desert, these little thoughtful talks with a man who was most emphatically not of the Red
Desert were refreshing. And she could scarcely have been Martha Dawson's daughter or Frederic
Dawson's sister without having a thoughtful cast of mind.

Lidgerwood rose and felt in his pockets for his after-dinner cigar.

"You are much more charitable than most women, Miss Dawson," he said gravely; after which he
left abruptly, and went back to his desk in the Crow's Nest.

As we have seen, this bit of confidential talk between the superintendent and Faith Dawson
fell in the period of the jesting horse-laugh; fell, as it chanced, on a day when the horse-laugh
was at its height. Later, after the storm broke, there were no more quiet evenings on the cottage
porch for a harassed superintendent. Lidgerwood came and went as before, when the rapidly recurring
wrecks did not keep him out on the line, but he scrupulously left his troubles behind him when
he climbed to the cottage on the mesa.

Quite naturally, his silence on the one topic which was stirring the Red Desert from the Crosswater
Hills to Timanyoni Canyon was a poor mask. The increasing gravity of the situation wrote itself
plainly enough in his face, and Faith Dawson was sorry for him, giving him silent sympathy,
unasked, if not wholly unexpected. The town talk of Angels, what little of it reached the cottage,
was harshly condemnatory of the new superintendent; and public opinion, standing for what it
was worth, feared no denial when it asserted that Lidgerwood was doing what he could to earn
his newer reputation.

After the mysterious disappearance of the switching-engine, mystery still unsolved and apparently
unsolvable, he struck fast and hard, searching painstakingly for the leaders in the rebellion,
reprimanding, suspending, and discharging until McCloskey warned him that, in addition to the
evil of short-handing the road, he was filling Angels with a growing army of ex-employees,
desperate and ripe for anything.

"I can't help it, Mac," was his invariable reply. "Unless they put me out of the fight I shall
go on as I have begun, staying with it until we have a railroad in fact, or a forfeited charter.
Do the best you can, but let it be plainly and distinctly understood that the man who isn't
with us is against us, and the man who is against us is going to get a chance to hunt for a
new job every time."

Whereupon the trainmaster's homely face would take on added furrowings of distress.

"That's all right, Mr. Lidgerwood; that is stout, two-fisted talk all right; and I'm not doubting
that you mean every word of it. But, they'll murder you."

"That is neither here nor there, what they will do to me. I handled them with gloves at first,
but they wanted the bare fist. They've got it now, and as I have said before, we are going
to fight this thing through to a complete and artistic finish. Who goes east on 202 to-day?"

"It is Judson's run, but he is laying off."

"What is the matter with him, sick?"

"No; just plain drunk."

"Fire him. I won't have a single solitary man in the train service who gets drunk. Tell him so."

"All right; one more stick of dynamite, with a cap and fuse in it, turned loose under foot,"
prophesied McCloskey gloomily. "Judson goes."

"Never mind the dynamite. Now, what has been done with Johnston, that conductor who turned
in three dollars as the total cash collections for a hundred-and-fifty-mile run?"

"I've had him up. He grinned and said that that was all the money there was, everybody had
tickets."

"You don't believe it?"

"No; Grantby, the superintendent of the Ruby Mine, came in on Johnston's train that morning
and he registered a kick because the Ruby Gulch station agent wasn't out of bed in time to
sell him a ticket. He paid Johnston on the train, and that one fare alone was five dollars
and sixty cents."

Lidgerwood was adding another minute square to the pencilled checker-board on his desk blotter.

"Discharge Johnston and hold back his time-check. Then have him arrested for stealing, and
wire the legal department at Denver that I want him prosecuted."

Again McCloskey's rough-cast face became the outward presentment of a soul in anxious trouble.

"Call it done--and another stick of dynamite turned loose," he acquiesced. "Is there anything
else?"

"Yes. What have you found out about that missing switch-engine?" This had come to be the stereotyped
query, vocalizing itself every time the trainmaster showed his face in the superintendent's room.

"Nothing, yet. I'm hunting for proof."

"Against the men you suspect? Who are they, and what did they do with the engine?"

McCloskey became dumb.

"I don't dare to say part of it till I can say it all, Mr. Lidgerwood. You hit too quick and
too hard. But tell me one thing: have you had to report the loss of that engine to anybody
higher up?"

"I shall have to report it to General Manager Frisbie, of course, if we don't find it."

"But haven't you already reported it?"

"No; that is, I guess not. Wait a minute."

A touch of the bell-push brought Hallock to the door of the inner office. The green shade was
pulled low over his eyes, and he held the pen he had been using as if it were a dagger.

"Hallock, have you reported the disappearance of that switching-engine to Mr. Frisbie?" asked
the superintendent.

The answer seemed reluctant, and it was given in the single word of assent.

"When?" asked Lidgerwood.

"In the weekly summary for last week; you signed it," said the chief clerk.

"Did I tell you to include that particular item in the report?" Lidgerwood did not mean to
give the inquiry the tang of an implied reproof, but the fight with the outlaws was beginning
to make his manner incisive.

"You didn't need to tell me; I know my business," said Hallock, and his tone matched his superior's.

Lidgerwood looked at McCloskey, and, at the trainmaster's almost imperceptible nod, said, "That's
all," and Hallock disappeared and closed the door.

"Well?" queried Lidgerwood sharply, when they had privacy again.

McCloskey was shifting uneasily from one foot to the other.

"My name's Scotch, and they tell me I've got Scotch blood in me," he began. "I don't like to
shoot my mouth off till I know what I'm doing. I suppose I quarrelled with Hallock once a day,
regular, before you came on the job, Mr. Lidgerwood, and I'll say again that I don't like him--never
did. That's what makes me careful about throwing it into him now."

"Go on," said Lidgerwood.

"Well, you know he wanted to be superintendent of this road. He kept the wires to New York
hot for a week after he found out that the P. S-W. was in control. He missed it, and you naturally
took it over his head--at least, maybe that's the way he looks at it."

"Take it for granted and get to the point," urged Lidgerwood, always impatient of preliminary
bush-beating.

"There isn't any point, if you don't see any," said McCloskey stubbornly. "But I can tell you
how it would strike me, if I had to be wearing your shoes just now. You've got a man for your
chief clerk who has kept this whole town guessing for two years. Some say he isn't all to the
bad; some say he is a woman-killer; but they all agree that he's as spiteful as an Indian.
He wanted your job: supposing he still wants it."

"Stick to the facts, Mac," said the superintendent. "You're theorizing now, you know."

"Well, by gravels, I will!" rasped McCloskey, pushed over the cautionary edge by Lidgerwood's
indifference to the main question at issue. "What I know don't amount to much yet, but it all
leans one way. Hallock puts in his daytime scratching away at his desk out there, and you'd
think he didn't know it was this year. But when that desk is shut up, you'll find him at the
roundhouse, over in the freight yard, round the switch shanties, or up at Biggs's--anywhere
he can get half a dozen of the men together. I haven't found a man yet that I could trust to
keep tab on him, and I don't know what he's doing; but I can guess."

"Is that all?" said Lidgerwood quietly.

"No, it isn't! That switch-engine dropped out two weeks ago last Tuesday night. I've been prying
into this locked-up puzzle-box every way I could think of ever since. Hallock knows where that
engine went!"

"What makes you think so?"

"I'll tell you. Robinson, the night-crew engineer, was a little late leaving her that night.
His fireman had gone home, and so had the yardmen. After he had crossed the yard coming out,
he saw a man sneaking toward the shifter, keeping in the shadow of the coal-chutes. He was
just curious enough to want to know who it was, and he made a little sneak of his own. When
he found it was Hallock, he went home and thought no more about it till I got him to talk."

Lidgerwood had gone back to the pencil and the blotting-pad and the making of squares.

"But the motive, Mac?" he questioned, without looking up. "How could the theft or the destruction
of a locomotive serve any purpose that Hallock might have in view?"

McCloskey did not mean any disrespect to his superior officer when he retorted: "I'm no 'cyclopædia.
There are lots of things I don't know. But unless you call it off, I'm going to know a few
more of them before I quit."

"I don't call it off, Mac; find out what you can. But I can't believe that Hallock is heading
this organized robbery and rebellion."

"Somebody is heading it, to a dead moral certainty, Mr. Lidgerwood; the licks are coming too
straight and too well-timed."

"Find the man if you can, and we'll eliminate him. And, by the way, if it comes to the worst,
how will Hepburn, the town marshal, stand?"

The trainmaster shook his head.

"I don't know. Jack's got plenty of sand, but he was elected out of the shops, and by the railroad
vote. If it comes to a show-down against the men who elected him----"

"That is what I mean," nodded Lidgerwood. "It will come to a show-down sooner or later, if
we can't nip the ringleaders. Young Rufford and a dozen more of the dropped employees are threatening
to get even. That means train-wrecking, misplaced switches, arson--anything you like. At the
first break there are going to be some very striking examples made of all the wreckers and
looters we can land on."

McCloskey's chair faced the window, and he was scowling and mouthing at the tall chimney of
the shop power-plant across the tracks. Where had he fallen upon the idea that this carefully
laundered gentleman, who never missed his daily plunge and scrub, and still wore immaculate
linen, lacked the confidence of his opinions and convictions? The trainmaster knew, and he
thought Lidgerwood must also know, that the first blow of the vengeful ones would be directed
at the man rather than at the company's property.

"I guess maybe Hepburn will do his duty when it comes to the pinch," he said finally. And the
subject having apparently exhausted itself, he went about his business, which was to call up
the telegraph operator at Timanyoni to ask why he had broken the rule requiring the conductor
and engineer, both of them, to sign train orders in his presence.

Thereupon, quite in keeping with the militant state of affairs on a harassed Red Butte Western,
ensued a sharp and abusive wire quarrel at long range; and when it was over, Timanyoni was
temporarily stricken from the list of night telegraph stations pending the hastening forward
of a relief operator, to take the place of the one who, with many profane objurgations curiously
clipped in rattling Morse, had wired his opinion of McCloskey and the new superintendent, closely
interwoven with his resignation.

It was after dark that evening when Lidgerwood closed his desk on the pencilled blotting-pad
and groped his way down the unlighted stair to the Crow's Nest platform.

The day passenger from the east was in, and the hostler had just coupled Engine 266 to the
train for the night run to Red Butte. Lidgerwood marked the engine's number, and saw Dawson
talking to Williams, the engineer, as he turned the corner at the passenger-station end of
the building. Later, when he was crossing the open plaza separating the railroad yard from
the town, he thought he heard the draftsman's step behind him, and waited for Dawson to come up.

The rearward darkness, made blacker by contrast with the white beam of the 266's headlight,
yielding no one and no further sounds, he went on, past the tar-paper-covered hotel, past the
flanking of saloons and the false-fronted shops, past the "Arcade" with its crimson sidewalk
eye setting the danger signal for all who should enter Red-Light Sammy's, and so up to the
mesa and to the cottage of seven-o'clock dinners.

His hand was on the latch of the dooryard gate when a man rose out of the gloom--out of the
ground at his feet, as it appeared to Lidgerwood--and in the twinkling of an eye the night
and the starry dome of it were effaced for the superintendent in a flash of red lightning and
a thunder-clap louder than the crash of worlds.

When he began to realize again, Dawson was helping him to his feet, and the draftsman's mother
was calling anxiously from the door.

"What was it?" Lidgerwood asked, still dazed and half blinded.

"A man tried to kill you," said Dawson in his most matter-of-fact tone. "I happened along just
in time to joggle his arm. That, and your quick drop, did the business. Not hurt, are you?"

Lidgerwood was gripping the gate and trying to steady himself. A chill, like a violent attack
of ague, was shaking him to the bone.

"No," he returned, mastering the chattering teeth by the supremest effort of will. "Thanks
to you, I guess--I'm--not hurt. Who w-was the man?"

"It was Rufford. He followed you from the Crow's Nest. Williams saw him and put me on, so I
followed him."

"Williams? Then he isn't----"

"No," said Dawson, anticipating the query. "He is with us, and he is swinging the best of the
engineers into line. But come into the house and let me give you a drop of whiskey. This thing
has got on your nerves a bit--and no wonder."

But Lidgerwood clung to the gate-palings for yet another steadying moment.

"Rufford, you said: you mean the discharged telegraph operator?"

"Worse luck," said Dawson. "It was his brother Bart, the 'lookout' at Red-Light Sammy's; the
fellow they call 'The Killer'."

VIII

BENSON'S BRIDGE-TIMBERS

It was on the morning following the startling episode at the Dawsons' gate that Benson, lately
arrived from the west on train 204, came into the superintendent's office with the light of
discovery in his eye. But the discovery, if any there were, was made to wait upon a word of
friendly solicitude.

"What's this they were telling me down at the lunch-counter just now--about somebody taking
a pot-shot at you last night?" he asked. "Dougherty said it was Bart Rufford; was it?"

Lidgerwood confirmed the gossip with a nod. "Yes, it was Rufford, so Dawson says. I didn't
recognize him, though; it was too dark."

"Well, I'm mighty glad to see that he didn't get you. What was the row?"

"I don't know, definitely; I suppose it was because I told McCloskey to discharge his brother
a while back. The brother has been hanging about town and making threats ever since he was
dropped from the pay-rolls, but no one has paid any attention to him."

"A pretty close call, wasn't it?--or was Dougherty only putting on a few frills to go with
my cup of coffee?"

"It was close enough," admitted Lidgerwood half absently. He was thinking not so much of the
narrow escape as of the fresh and humiliating evidence it had afforded of his own wretched
unreadiness.

"All right; you'll come around to my way of thinking after a while. I tell you, Lidgerwood,
you've got to heel yourself when you live in a gun country. I said I wouldn't do it, but I
have done it, and I'll tell you right now, when anybody in this blasted desert makes monkey-motions
at me, I'm going to blow the top of his head off, quick."

Lidgerwood's gaze was resting on the little drawer in his desk which now contained nothing
but a handful of loose cartridges.

"Hasn't it ever occurred to you, Jack, that I am the one man in the desert who cannot afford
to go armed? I am supposed to stand for law and order. What would my example be worth if it
should be noised around that I, too, had become a 'gun-toter'?"

"Oh, I'm not going to argue with you," laughed Benson. "You'll go your own way and do as you
please, and probably get yourself comfortably shot up before you get through. But I didn't
come up here to wrangle with you about your theoretical notions of law and order. I came to
tell you that I have been hunting for those bridge-timbers of mine."

"Well?" queried Lidgerwood; "have you found them?"

"No, and I don't believe anybody will ever find them. It's going to be another case of Rachel
weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted because they are not."

"But you have discovered something?"

"Partly yes, and partly no. I think I told you at the time that they vanished between two days
like a puff of smoke, leaving no trace behind them. How it was done I couldn't imagine. There
is a wagon-road paralleling the river over there at the Siding, as you know, and the first
thing I did the next morning was to look for wagon-tracks. No set of wheels carrying anything
as heavy as those twelve-by-twelve twenty-fours had gone over the road."

"How were they taken, then? They couldn't have been floated off down the river, could they?"

"It was possible, but not at all probable," said the engineer. "My theory was that they were
taken away on somebody's railroad car. There were only two sources of information, at first--the
night operator at Little Butte twelve miles west, and the track-walker at Point-of-Rocks, whose
boat goes down to within two or three miles of the Gloria bridge. Goodloe, at Little Butte,
reports that there was nothing moving on the main line after the passing of the midnight freight
east; and Shaughnessy, the track-walker, is just a plain, unvarnished liar: he knows a lot
more than he will tell."

"Still, you are looking a good bit more cheerful than you were last week," was Lidgerwood's
suggestion.

"Yes; after I got the work started again with a new set of timbers, I spent three or four days
on the ground digging for information like a dog after a woodchuck. There are some prospectors
panning on the bar three miles up the Gloria, but they knew nothing--or if they knew they wouldn't
tell. That was the case with every man I talked to on our side of the river. But over across
the Timanyoni, nearly opposite the mouth of the Gloria, there is a little creek coming in from
the north, and on this creek I found a lone prospector--a queer old chap who hails from my
neck of woods up in Michigan."

"Go on," said Lidgerwood, when the engineer stopped to light his pipe.

"The old man told me a fairy tale, all right," Benson went on. "He was as full of fancies as
a fig is of seeds. I have been trying to believe that what he told me isn't altogether a pipe-dream,
but it sounds mightily like one. He says that about two o'clock in the morning of Saturday,
two weeks ago, an engine and a single car backed down from the west to the Gloria bridge, and
a crowd of men swarmed off the train, loaded those bridge-timbers, and ran away with them,
going back up the line to the west. He tells it all very circumstantially, though he neglected
to explain how he happened to be awake and on guard at any such unearthly hour."

"Where was he when he saw all this?"

"On his own side of the river, of course. It was a dark night, and the engine had no headlight.
But the loading gang had plenty of lanterns, and he says they made plenty of noise."

"You didn't let it rest at that?" said the superintendent.

"Oh, no, indeed! I put in the entire afternoon that day on a hand-car with four of my men to
pump it for me, and if there is a foot of the main line, side-tracks, or spurs, west of the
Gloria bridge, that I haven't gone over, I don't know where it is. The next night I crossed
the Timanyoni and tackled the old prospector again. I wanted to check him up--see if he had
forgotten any of the little frills and details. He hadn't. On the contrary, he was able to
add what seems to me a very important detail. About an hour after the disappearance of the
one-car train with my bridge-timbers, he heard something that he had heard many times before.
He says it was the high-pitched song of a circular saw. I asked him if he was sure. He grinned
and said he hadn't been brought up in the Michigan woods without being able to recognize that
song wherever he might hear it."

"Whereupon you went hunting for saw-mills?" asked Lidgerwood.

"That is just what I did, and if there is one within hearing distance of that old man's cabin
on Quartz Creek, I couldn't find it. But I am confident that there is one, and that the thieves,
whoever they were, lost no time in sawing my bridge-timbers up into board-lumber, and I'll
bet a hen worth fifty dollars against a no-account yellow dog that I have seen those boards
a dozen times within the last twenty-four hours, without knowing it."

"Didn't see anything of our switch-engine while you were looking for your bridge-timbers and
saw-mills and other things, did you?" queried Lidgerwood.

"No," was the quick reply, "no, but I have a think coming on that, too. My old prospector says
he couldn't make out very well in the dark, but it seemed to him as if the engine which hauled
away our bridge-timbers didn't have any tender. How does that strike you?"

Lidgerwood grew thoughtful. The missing engine was of the "saddle-tank" type, and it had no
tender. It was hard to believe that it could be hidden anywhere on so small a part of the Red
Butte Western system as that covered by the comparatively short mileage in Timanyoni Park.
Yet if it had not been dumped into some deep pot-hole in the river, it was unquestionably hidden
somewhere.

"Benson, are you sure you went over all the line lying west of the Gloria bridge?" he asked
pointedly.

"Every foot of it, up one side and down the other ... No, hold on, there is that old spur running
up on the eastern side of Little Butte; it's the one that used to serve Flemister's mine when
the workings were on the eastern slope of the butte. I didn't go over that spur. It hasn't
been used for years; as I remember it, the switch connections with the main line have been
taken out."

"You're wrong about that," said Lidgerwood definitely. "McCloskey thought so too, and told
me that the frogs and point-rails had been taken out at Silver Switch--at both of the main-line
ends of the 'Y',--but the last time I was over the line I noticed that the old switch stands
were there, and that the split rails were still in place."

Benson had been tilting comfortably in his chair, smoking his pipe, but at this he got up quickly
and looked at his watch.

"Say, Lidgerwood, I'm going back to the Park on Extra 71, which ought to leave in about five
minutes," he said hurriedly. "Tell me half a dozen things in just about as many seconds. Has
Flemister used that spur since you took charge of the road?"

"No."

"Have you ever suspected him of being mixed up in the looting?"

"I haven't known enough about him to form an opinion."

Benson stepped to the door communicating with the outer office, and closed it quietly.

"Your man Hallock out there; how is he mixed up with Flemister?"

"I don't know. Why?"

"Because, the day before yesterday, when I was on the Little Butte station platform, talking
with Goodloe, I saw Flemister and Hallock walking down the new spur together. When they saw
me, they turned around and began to walk back toward the mine."

"Hallock had business with Flemister, I know that much, and he took half a day off Thursday
to go and see him," said the superintendent.

"Do you happen to know what the business was?"

"Yes, I do. He went at my request."

"H'm," said Benson, "another string broken. Never mind; I've got to catch that train."

"Still after those bridge-timbers?"

"Still after the boards they have probably been sawed into. And before I get back I am going
to know what's at the upper end of that old Silver Switch 'Y' spur."

The young engineer had been gone less than half an hour, and Lidgerwood had scarcely finished
reading his mail, when McCloskey opened the door. Like Benson, the trainmaster also had the
light of discovery in his eye.

"More thievery," he announced gloomily. "This time they have been looting my department. I
had ten or twelve thousand feet of high-priced, insulated copper wire, and a dozen or more
telephone sets, in the store-room. Mr. Cumberley had a notion of connecting up all the Angels
departments by telephone, and it got as far as the purchasing of the material. The wire and
all those telephone sets are gone."

"Well?" said Lidgerwood, evenly. The temptation to take it out upon the nearest man was still
as strong as ever, but he was growing better able to resist it.

"I've done what I could," snapped McCloskey, seeming to know what was expected of him, "but
nobody knows anything, of course. So far as I could find out, no one of my men has had occasion
to go to the store-room for a week."

"Who has the keys?"

"I have one, and Spurlock, the line-chief, has one. Hallock has the third."

"Always Hallock!" was the half-impatient comment. "I hope you don't suspect him of stealing
your wire."

McCloskey tilted his hat over his eyes, and looked truculent enough to fight an entire cavalry
troop.

"That's just what I do," he gritted. "I've got him dead to rights this time. He was in that
store-room day before yesterday, or rather night before last. Callahan saw him coming out of
there."

Lidgerwood sat back in his chair and smiled. "I don't blame you much, Mac; this thing is getting
to be pretty binding upon all of us. But I think you are mistaken in your conclusion, I mean.
Hallock has been making an inventory of material on hand for the past week or more, and now
that I think of it, I remember having seen your wire and the telephone sets included in his
last sheet of telegraph supplies."

"There it goes again," said the trainmaster sourly. "Every time I get a half-hitch on that
fellow, something turns up to make it slip. But if I had my way about twenty minutes I'd go
and choke him till he'd tell me what he has done with that wire."

Lidgerwood was smiling again.

"Try to be as fair to him as you can," he advised good-naturedly. "I know you dislike him,
and probably you have good reasons. But have you stopped to ask yourself what possible use
he could make of the stolen material?"

Again McCloskey's hat went to the pugnacious angle. "I don't know anything any more; you couldn't
prove it by me what day of the week it is. But I can tell you one thing, Mr. Lidgerwood"--shaking
an emphatic finger--"Flemister has just put a complete system of wiring and telephones in his
mine, and if he had the stuff for the system shipped in over our railroad, the agent at Little
Butte doesn't know anything about it. I asked Goodloe, by grapples!"

But even this was unconvincing to the superintendent.

"That proves nothing against Hallock, Mac, as you will see when you cool down a little," he said.

"I know it doesn't," wrathfully; "nothing proves anything any more. I suppose I've got to say
it again: I'm all in, down and out." And he went away, growling to his hat-brim.

Late in the evening of the same day, Benson returned from the west, coming in on a light engine
that was deadheading from Red Butte to the Angels shops. He sought out Lidgerwood at once,
and flinging himself wearily into a chair at the superintendent's elbow, made his report of
the day's doings.

"I have, and I haven't," he said, beginning in the midst of things, as his habit was. "You
were right about the track connection at Silver Switch. It is in; Flemister put it in himself
a month ago when he had a car-load of coal taken up to the back door of his mine."

"Did you go up over the spur?"

"Yes; and I had my trouble for my pains. Before I go any further, Lidgerwood, I'd like to ask
you one question: can we afford to quarrel with Mr. Pennington Flemister?"

"Benson, we sha'n't hesitate a single moment to quarrel with the biggest mine-owner or freight-shipper
this side of the Crosswater Hills if we have the right on our side. Spread it out. What did
you find?"

Benson sank a little lower in his chair. "The first thing I found was a couple of armed guards--a
pair of tough-looking citizens with guns sagging at their hips, lounging around the Wire-Silver
back door. There is quite a little nest of buildings at the old entrance to the Wire-Silver,
and a stockade has been built to enclose them. The old spur runs through a gate in the stockade,
and the gate was open; but the two toughs wouldn't let me go inside. I wrangled with them first,
and tried to bribe them afterward, but it was no go. Then I started to walk around the outside
of the stockade, which is only a high board fence, and they objected to that. Thereupon I told
them to go straight to blazes, and walked away down the spur, but when I got out of sight around
the first curve I took to the timber on the butte slope and climbed to a point from which I
could look over into Flemister's carefully built enclosure."

"Well, what did you see?"

"Much or little, just as you happen to look at it. There are half a dozen buildings in the
yard, and two of them are new and unpainted. Sizing them up from a distance, I said to myself
that the lumber in them hadn't been very long out of the mill. One of them is evidently the
power-house; it has an iron chimney set in the roof, and the power-plant was running."

For a little time after Benson had finished his report there was silence, and Lidgerwood had
added many squares to the pencillings on his desk blotter before he spoke again.

"You say two of the buildings are new; did you make any inquiries about recent lumber shipments
to the Wire-Silver?"

"I did," said the young engineer soberly. "So far as our station records show, Flemister has
had no material, save coal, shipped in over either the eastern or the western spur for several
months."

"Then you believe that he took your bridge-timbers and sawed them up into lumber?"

"I do--as firmly as I believe that the sun will rise to-morrow. And that isn't all of it, Lidgerwood.
He is the man who has your switch-engine. As I have said, the power-plant was running while
I was up there to-day. The power is a steam engine, and if you'd stand off and listen to it
you'd swear it was a locomotive pulling a light train up an easy grade. Of course, I'm only
guessing at that, but I think you will agree with me that the burden of proof lies upon Flemister."

Lidgerwood was nodding slowly. "Yes, on Flemister and some others. Who are the others, Benson?"

"I have no more guesses coming, and I am too tired to invent any. Suppose we drop it until
to-morrow. I'm afraid it means a fight or a funeral, and I am not quite equal to either to-night."

For a long time after Benson had gone, Lidgerwood sat staring out of his office window at the
masthead electrics in the railroad yard. Benson's news had merely confirmed his own and McCloskey's
conclusion that some one in authority was in collusion with the thieves who were raiding the
company. Sooner or later it must come to a grapple, and he dreaded it.

It was deep in the night when he closed his desk and went to the little room partitioned off
in the rear of the private office as a sleeping-apartment. When he was preparing to go to bed,
he noticed that the tiny relay on the stand at his bed's head was silent. Afterward, when he
tried to adjust the instrument, he found it ruined beyond repair. Some one had connected its
wiring with the electric lighting circuit, and the tiny coils were fused and burned into solid
little cylinders of copper.

IX

JUDSON'S JOKE

Barton Rufford, ex-distiller of illicit whiskey in the Tennessee mountains, ex-welsher turned
informer and betraying his neighbor law-breakers to the United States revenue officers, ex-everything
which made his continued stay in the Cumberlands impossible, was a man of distinction in the
Red Desert.

In the wider field of the West he had been successively a claim-jumper, a rustler of unbranded
cattle, a telegraph operator in collusion with a gang of train-robbers, and finally a faro
"lookout": the armed guard who sits at the head of the gaming-table in the untamed regions
to kill and kill quickly if a dispute arises.

Angels acknowledged his citizenship without joy. A cold-blooded murderer, with an appalling
record; and a man with a temper like smoking tow, an itching trigger-finger, the eye of a duck-hawk,
and cat-like swiftness of movement, he tyrannized the town when the humor was on him; and as
yet no counter-bully had come to chase him into oblivion.

For Lidgerwood to have earned the enmity of this man was considered equivalent to one of three
things: the superintendent would throw up his job and leave the Red Desert, preferably by the
first train; or Rufford would kill him; or he must kill Rufford. Red Butte Western opinion
was somewhat divided as to which horn of the trilemma the victim of Rufford's displeasure would
choose, all admitting that, for the moment, the choice lay with the superintendent. Would Lidgerwood
fight, or run, or sit still and be slain? In the Angels roundhouse, on the second morning following
the attempt upon Lidgerwood's life at the gate of the Dawson cottage, the discussion was spirited,
not to say acrimonious.

"I'm telling you hyenas that Collars-and-Cuffs ain't going to run away," insisted Williams,
who was just in from the all-night trip to Red Butte and return. "He ain't built that way."

Lester, the roundhouse foreman, himself a man-queller of no mean repute, thought differently.
Lidgerwood would, most likely, take to the high grass and the tall timber. The alternative
was to "pack a gun" for Rufford--an alternative quite inconceivable to Lester when it was predicated
of the superintendent.

"I don't know about that," said Judson, the discharged--and consequently momentarily sobered--engineer
of the 271. "He's fooled everybody more than once since he lit down in the Red Desert. First
crack everybody said he didn't know his business, 'cause he wore b'iled shirts: he does know
it. Next, you could put your ear to the ground and hear that he didn't have the sand to round
up the maverick R.B.W. He's doing it. I don't know but he might even run a bluff on Bart Rufford,
if he felt like it."

"Come off, John!" growled the big foreman. "You needn't be afraid to talk straight over here.
He hit you when you was down, and we all know you're only waitin' for a chance to hit back."

Judson was a red-headed man, effusively good-natured when he was in liquor, and a quick-tempered
fighter of battles when he was not.

"Don't you make any such mistake!" he snapped. "That's what McCloskey said when he handed me
the 'good-by.' 'You'll be one more to go round feelin' for Mr. Lidgerwood's throat, I suppose,'
says he. By cripes! what I said to Mac I'm sayin' to you, Bob Lester. I know good and well
a-plenty when I've earned my blue envelope. If I'd been in the super's place, the 271 would
have had a new runner a long time ago!"

"Oh, hell! I say he'll chase his feet," puffed Broadbent, the fat machinist who was truing
off the valve-seats of the 195. "If Rufford doesn't make him, there's some others that will."

Judson flared up again.

"Who you quotin' now, Fatty? One o' the shop 'prentices? Or maybe it's Rank Hallock? Say, what's
he doin' monkeyin' round the back shop so much lately? I'm goin' to stay round here till I
get a chance to lick that scrub."

Broadbent snorted his derision of all mere enginemen.

"You rail-pounders'd better get next to Rankin Hallock," he warned. "He's the next sup'rintendent
of the R.B.W. You'll see the 'pointment circular the next day after that jim-dandy over in
the Crow's Nest gets moved off'n the map."

"Well, I'm some afeared Bart Rufford's likely to move him," drawled Clay, the six-foot Kentuckian
who was filing the 195's brasses at the bench. "Which the same I ain't rejoicin' about, neither.
That little cuss is shore a mighty good railroad man. And when you ain't rubbin' his fur the
wrong way, he treats you white."

"For instance?" snapped Hodges, a freight engineer who had been thrice "on the carpet" in Lidgerwood's
office for over-running his orders.

"Oh, they ain't so blame' hard to find," Clay retorted. "Last week, when we was out on the
Navajo wreck, me and the boy didn't have no dinner-buckets. Bradford was runnin' the super's
car, and when Andy just sort o' happened to mention the famine up along, the little man made
that Jap cook o' his'n get us up a dinner that'd made your hair frizzle. He shore did."

"Why don't you go and take up for him with Bart Rufford?" sneered Broadbent, stopping his facing
machine to set in a new cut on the valve-seat.

"Not me. I've got cold feet," laughed the Kentuckian. "I'm like the little kid's daddy in the
Sunday-school song: I ain't got time to die yet--got too much to do."

It was Williams's innings, and what he said was cautionary.

"Dry up, you fellows; here comes Gridley."

The master-mechanic was walking down the planked track from the back shop, carrying his years,
which showed only in the graying mustache and chin beard, and his hundred and eighty pounds
of well-set-up bone and muscle, jauntily. Now, as always, he was the beau ideal of the industrial
field-officer; handsome in a clean-cut masculine way, a type of vigor--but also, if the signs
of the full face and the eager eyes were to be regarded, of the elemental passions.

Angelic rumor hinted that he was a periodic drunkard: he was both more and less than that.
Like many another man, Henry Gridley lived a double life; or, perhaps it would be nearer the
truth to say that there were two Henry Gridleys. Lidgerwood, the Dawsons, the little world
of Angels at large, knew the virile, accomplished mechanical engineer and master of men, which
was his normal personality. What time the other personality, the elemental barbarian, yawned,
stretched itself, and came awake, the unspeakable dens of the Copah lower quarter engulfed
him until the nether-man had gorged himself on degradation.

To his men, Gridley was a tyrant, exacting, but just; ruling them, as the men of the desert
could only be ruled, with the mailed fist. Yet there was a human hand inside of the steel gauntlet,
as all men knew. Having once beaten a bullying gang-boss into the hospital at Denver, he had
promptly charged himself with the support of the man's family. Other generous roughnesses were
recorded of him, and if the attitude of the men was somewhat tempered by wholesome fear, it
was none the less loyal.

Hence, when he entered the roundhouse, industrious silence supplanted the discussion of the
superintendent's case. Glancing at the group of enginemen, and snapping out a curt criticism
of Broadbent's slowness on the valve-seats, he beckoned to Judson. When the discharged engineer
had followed him across the turn-table, he faced about and said, not too crisply, "So your
sins have found you out one more time, have they, John?"

Judson nodded.

"What is it this time, thirty days?"

Judson shook his head gloomily. "No, I'm down and out."

"Lidgerwood made it final, did he? Well, you can't blame him."

"You hain't heard me sayin' anything, have you?" was the surly rejoinder.

"No, but it isn't in human nature to forget these little things." Then, suddenly: "Where were
you day before yesterday between noon and one o'clock, about the time you should have been
taking your train out?"

Judson had a needle-like mind when the alcohol was out of it, and the sudden query made him
dissemble.

"About ten o'clock I was playin' pool in Rafferty's place with the butt end of the cue. After
that, things got kind o'hazy."

"Well, I want you to buckle down and think hard. Don't you remember going over to Cat Biggs's
about noon, and sitting down at one of the empty card-tables to drink yourself stiff?"

Judson could not have told, under the thumbscrews, why he was prompted to tell Gridley a plain
lie. But he did it.

"I can't remember," he denied. Then then needle-pointed brain got in its word, and he added, "Why?"

"I saw you there when I was going up to dinner. You called me in to tell me what you were going
to do to Lidgerwood if he slated you for getting drunk. Don't you remember it?"

Judson was looking the master-mechanic fairly in the eyes when he said, "No, I don't remember
a thing about that."

"Try again," said Gridley, and now the shrewd gray eyes under the brim of the soft-rolled felt
hat held the engineer helpless.

"I guess--I do--remember it--now," said Judson, slowly, trying, still ineffectually, to break
Gridley's masterful eyehold upon him.

"I thought you would," said the master-mechanic, without releasing him. "And you probably remember,
also, that I took you out into the street and started you home."

"Yes," said Judson, this time without hesitation.

"Well, keep on remembering it; you went home to Maggie, and she put you to bed. That is what
you are to keep in mind."

Judson had broken the curious eye-grip at last, and again he said, "Why?"

Gridley hooked his finger absently in the engineer's buttonhole.

"Because, if you don't, a man named Rufford says he'll start a lead mine in you. I heard him
say it last night--overheard him, I should say. That's all."

The master-mechanic passed on, going out by the great door which opened for the locomotive
entering-track. Judson hung upon his heel for a moment, and then went slowly out through the
tool-room and across the yard tracks to the Crow's Nest.

He found McCloskey in his office above stairs, mouthing and grimacing over the string-board
of the new time-table.

"Well?" growled the trainmaster, when he saw who had opened and closed the door. "Come back
to tell me you've sworn off? That won't go down with Mr. Lidgerwood. When he fires, he means it."

"You wait till I ask you for my job back again, won't you, Jim McCloskey?" said the disgraced
one hotly. "I hain't asked it yet; and what's more, I'm sober."

"Sure you are," muttered McCloskey. "You'd be better-natured with a drink or two in you. What's
doing?"

"That's what I came over here to find out," said Judson steadily. "What is the boss going to
do about this flare-up with Bart Rufford?"

The trainmaster shrugged.

"You've got just as many guesses as anybody, John. What you can bet on is that he will do something
different."

Judson had slouched to the window. When he spoke, it was without turning his head.

"You said something yesterday morning about me feeling for the boss's throat along with that
gang up-town that's trying to drink itself up to the point of hitting him back. It don't strike
me that way, Mac."

"How does it strike you?"

Judson turned slowly, crossed the room, and sat down in the only vacant chair.

"You know what's due to happen, Mac. Rufford won't try it on again the way he tried it night
before last. I heard up-town that he has posted his de-fi: Mr. Lidgerwood shoots him on sight
or he shoots Mr. Lidgerwood on sight. You can figure that out, can't you?"

"Not knowing Mr. Lidgerwood much better than you do, John, I'm not sure that I can."

"Well, it's easy. Bart'll walk up to the boss in broad daylight, drop him, and then fill him
full o'lead after he's down. I've seen him--saw him do it to Bixby, Mr. Brewster's foreman
at the Copperette."

"Say the rest of it," commanded McCloskey.

"I've been thinking. While I'm laying round with nothing much to do, I believe I'll keep tab
on Bart for a little spell. I don't love him much, nohow."

McCloskey's face contortion was intended to figure as a derisive smile. "Pshaw, John!" he commented,
"he'd skin you alive. Why, even Jack Hepburn is afraid of him!"

"Jack is? How do you know that?"

McCloskey shrugged again.

"Are you with us, John?" he asked cautiously.

"I ain't with Bart Rufford and the tin-horns," said Judson negatively.

"Then I'll tell you a fairy tale," said the trainmaster, lowering his voice. "I gave you notice
that Mr. Lidgerwood would do something different: he did it, bright and early this morning;
went to Jake Schleisinger, who had to try twice before he could remember that he was a justice
of the peace, and swore out a warrant for Rufford's arrest, on a charge of assault with intent
to kill."

"Sure," said Judson, "that's what any man would do in a civilized country, ain't it?"

"Yes, but not here, John--not in the red-colored desert, with Bart Rufford's name in the body
of the warrant."

"I don't know why not," insisted the engineer stubbornly. "But go on with the story; it ain't
any fairy tale, so far."

"When he'd got the warrant, Schleisinger protesting all the while that Bart'd kill him for
issuing it, Mr. Lidgerwood took it to Hepburn and told him to serve it. Jack backed down so
fast that he fell over his feet. Said to ask him anything else under God's heavens and he'd
do it--anything but that."

"Huh!" said Judson. "If I'd took an oath to serve warrants I'd serve 'em, if it did make me
sick at my stomach." Then he got up and shuffled away to the window again, and when next he
spoke his voice was the voice of a broken man.

"I lied to you a minute ago, Mac. I did want my job back. I came over here hopin' that you
and Mr. Lidgerwood might be seein' things a little different by this time. I've quit the whiskey."

McCloskey wagged his shaggy head.

"So you've said before, John, and not once or twice either."

"I know, but every man gets to the bottom, some time. I've hit bed-rock, and I've just barely
got sense enough to know it. Let me tell you, Mac, I've pulled trains on mighty near every
railroad in this country--and then some. The Red Butte is my last ditch. With my record I couldn't
get an engine anywhere else in the United States. Can't you see what I'm up against?"

The trainmaster nodded. He was human.

"Well, it's Maggie and the babies now," Judson went on. "They don't starve, Mac, not while
I'm on top of earth. Don't you reckon you could make some sort of a play for me with the boss,
Jim? He's got bowels."

McCloskey did not resent the familiarity of the Christian name, neither did he hold out any
hope of reinstatement.

"No, John. One or two things I've learned about Mr. Lidgerwood: he doesn't often hit when he's
mad, and he doesn't take back anything he says in cold blood. I'm afraid you've cooked your
last goose."

"Let me go in and see him. He ain't half as hard-hearted as you are, Jim."

The trainmaster shook his head. "No, it won't do any good. I heard him tell Hallock not to
let anybody in on him this morning."

"Hallock be--Say, Mac, what makes him keep that--" Judson broke off abruptly, pulled his hat
over his eyes, and said, "Reckon it's worth while to shove me over to the other side, Jim McCloskey?"

"What other side?" demanded McCloskey.

Judson scoffed openly. "You ain't making out like you don't know, are you? Who was behind that
break of Rufford's last night?"

"There didn't need to be anybody behind it. Bart thinks he has a kick coming because his brother
was discharged."

"But there was somebody behind it. Tell me, Mac, did you ever see me too drunk to read my orders
and take my signals?"

"No, don't know as I have."

"Well, I never was. And I don't often get too drunk to hear straight, either, even if I do
look and act like the biggest fool God ever let live. I was in Cat Biggs's day before yesterday
noon, when I ought to have been down here taking 202 east. There were two men in the back room
putting their heads together. I don't know whether they knew I was on the other side of the
partition or not. If they did, they probably didn't pay any attention to a drivellin' idiot
that couldn't wrap his tongue around an order for more whiskey."

"Go on!" snapped McCloskey, almost viciously.

"They were talking about 'fixing' the boss. One of 'em was for the slow and safe way: small
bets and a good many of 'em. The other was for pulling a straight flush on Mr. Lidgerwood,
right now. Number One said no, that things were moving along all right, and it wasn't worth
while to rush. Then something was said about a woman; I didn't catch her name or just what
the hurry man said about her, only it was something about Mr. Lidgerwood's bein' in shape to
mix up in it. At that Number One flopped over. 'Pull it off whenever you like!' says he, savage-like."

McCloskey sprang from his chair and towered over the smaller man.

"One of those men was Bart Rufford: who was the other one, Judson?"

Judson was apparently unmoved. "You're forgettin' that I was plum' fool drunk, Jim. I didn't
see either one of 'em."

"But you heard?"

"Yes, one of 'em was Rufford, as you say, and up to a little bit ago I'd 'a' been ready to
swear to the voice of the one you haven't guessed. But now I can't."

"Why can't you do it now?"

"Sit down and I'll tell you. I've been jarred. Everything I've told you so far, I can remember,
or it seems as if I can, but right where I broke off a cog slipped. I must 'a' been drunker
than I thought I was. Gridley says he was going by and he says I called him in and told him,
fool-wise, all the things I was going to do to Mr. Lidgerwood. He says he hushed me up, called
me out to the sidewalk, and started me home. Mac, I don't remember a single wheel-turn of all
that, and it makes me scary about the other part."

McCloskey relapsed into his swing-chair.

"You said you thought you recognized the other man by his voice. It sounds like a drunken pipe-dream,
the whole of it; but who did you think it was?"

Judson rose up, jerked his thumb toward the door of the superintendent's business office, and
said, "Mac, if the whiskey didn't fake the whole business for me--the man who was mumblin'
with Bart Rufford was--Hallock!"

"Hallock?" said McCloskey; "and you said there was a woman in it? That fits down to the ground,
John. Mr. Lidgerwood has found out something about Hallock's family tear-up, or he's likely
to find out. That's what that means!"

What more McCloskey said was said to an otherwise empty room. Judson had opened the door and
closed it, and was gone.

Summing up the astounding thing afterward, those who could recall the details and piece them
together traced Judson thus:

It was ten-forty when he came down from McCloskey's office, and for perhaps twenty minutes
he had been seen lounging at the lunch-counter in the station end of the Crow's Nest. At about
eleven one witness had seen him striking at the anvil in Hepburn's shop, the town marshal being
the town blacksmith in the intervals of official duty.

Still later, he had apparently forgotten the good resolution declared to McCloskey, and all
Angels saw him staggering up and down Mesa Avenue, stumbling into and out of the many saloons,
and growing, to all appearances, more hopelessly irresponsible with every fresh stumble. This
was his condition when he tripped over the doorstep into the "Arcade," and fell full length
on the floor of the bar-room. Grimsby, the barkeeper, picked him up and tried to send him home,
but with good-natured and maudlin pertinacity he insisted on going on to the gambling-room
in the rear.

The room was darkened, as befitted its use, and a lighted lamp hung over the centre of the
oval faro table as if the time were midnight instead of midday. Eight men, five of them miners
from the Brewster copper mine, and three of them discharged employees of the Red Butte Western,
were the bettors; Red-Light himself, in sombrero and shirt-sleeves, was dealing, and Rufford,
sitting on a stool at the table's end, was the "lookout."

When Judson reeled in there was a pause, and a movement to put him out. One of the miners covered
his table stakes and rose to obey Rufford's nod. But at this conjuncture the railroad men interfered.
Judson was a fellow craftsman, and everybody knew that he was harmless in his cups. Let him
stay--and play, if he wanted to.

So Judson stayed, and stumbled round the table, losing his money and dribbling foolishness.
Now faro is a silent game, and more than once an angry voice commanded the foolish one to choose
his place and to shut his mouth. But the ex-engineer seemed quite incapable of doing either.
Twice he made the wavering circuit of the oval table, and when he finally gripped an empty
chair it was the one nearest to Rufford on the right, and diagonally opposite to the dealer.

What followed seemed to have no connecting sequence for the other players. Too restless to
lose more than one bet in the place he had chosen, Judson tried to rise, tangled his feet in
the chair, and fell down, laughing uproariously. When he struggled to the perpendicular again,
after two or three ineffectual attempts, he was fairly behind Rufford's stool.

One man, who chanced to be looking, saw the "lookout" start and stiffen rigidly in his place,
staring straight ahead into vacancy. A moment later the entire circle of witnesses saw him
take a revolver from the holster on his hip and lay it upon the table, with another from the
breast pocket of his coat to keep it company. Then his hands went quickly behind him, and they
all heard the click of the handcuffs.

The man in the sombrero and shirt-sleeves was first to come alive.

"Duck, Bart!" he shouted, whipping a weapon from its convenient shelf under the table's edge.
But Judson, trained to the swift handling of many mechanisms in the moment of respite before
a wreck or a derailment, was ready for him.

"Bart's afraid he can't duck without dying," he said grimly, screening himself behind his captive.
Then to the others, in the same unhasting tone: "Some of you fellows just quiet Sammy down
till I get out of here with this peach of mine. I've got the papers, and I know what I'm doin';
if this thing I'm holdin' against Bart's back should happen to go off----"

That ended it, so far as resistance was concerned. Judson backed quickly out through the bar-room,
drawing his prisoner backward after him; and a moment later Angels was properly electrified
by the sight of Rufford, the Red Desert terror, marching sullenly down to the Crow's Nest,
with a fiery-headed little man at his elbow, the little man swinging the weapon which had been
made to simulate the cold muzzle of the revolver when he had pressed it into Rufford's back
at the gaming-table.

It was nothing more formidable than a short, thick "S"-wrench, of the kind used by locomotive
engineers in tightening the nuts of the piston-rod packing glands.

FLEMISTER AND OTHERS

The jocosely spectacular arrest of Barton Rufford, with its appeal to the grim humor of the
desert, was responsible for a brief lull in the storm of antagonism evoked by Lidgerwood's
attempt to bring order out of the chaos reigning in his small kingdom. For a time Angels was
a-grin again, and while the plaudits were chiefly for Judson, the figure of the correctly clothed
superintendent who was courageous enough to appeal to the law, loomed large in the reflected
light of the red-headed engineer's cool daring.

For the space of a week there were no serious disasters, and Lidgerwood, with good help from
McCloskey and Benson, continued to dig persistently into the mystery of the wholesale robberies.
With Benson's discoveries for a starting-point, the man Flemister was kept under surveillance,
and it soon became evident to the three investigators that the owner of the Wire-Silver mine
had been profiting liberally at the expense of the railroad company in many ways. That there
had been connivance on the part of some one in authority in the railroad service, was also
a fact safely assumable; and each added thread of evidence seemed more and more to entangle
the chief clerk.

But behind the mystery of the robberies, Lidgerwood began to get glimpses of a deeper mystery
involving Flemister and Hallock. Angelic tradition, never very clearly defined and always shot
through with prejudice, spoke freely of a former friendship between the two men. Whether the
friendship had been broken, or whether, for reasons best known to themselves, they had allowed
the impression to go out that it had been broken, Lidgerwood could not determine from the bits
of gossip brought in by the trainmaster. But one thing was certain: of all the minor officials
in the railway service, Hallock was the one who was best able to forward and to conceal Flemister's
thieveries.

It was in the midst of these subterranean investigations that Lidgerwood had a call from the
owner of the Wire-Silver. On the Saturday in the week of surcease, Flemister came in on the
noon train from the west, and it was McCloskey who ushered him into the superintendent's office.
Lidgerwood looked up and saw a small man wearing the khaki of the engineers, with a soft felt
hat to match. The snapping black eyes, with the straight brows almost meeting over the nose,
suggested Goethe's Mephistopheles, and Flemister shaved to fit the part, with curling mustaches
and a dagger-pointed imperial. Instantly Lidgerwood began turning the memory pages in an effort
to recall where he had seen the man before, but it was not until Flemister began to speak that
he remembered his first day in authority, the wreck at Gloria Siding, and the man who had driven
up in a buckboard to hold converse with the master-mechanic.

"I've been trying to find time for a month or more to come up and get acquainted with you,
Mr. Lidgerwood," the visitor began, when Lidgerwood had waved him to a chair. "I hope you are
not going to hold it against me that I haven't done it sooner."

Lidgerwood's smile was meant to be no more than decently hospitable.

"We are not standing much upon ceremony in these days of reorganization," he said. Then, to
hold the interview down firmly to a business basis: "What can I do for you, Mr. Flemister?"

"Nothing--nothing on top of earth; it's the other way round. I came to do something for you--or,
rather, for one of your subordinates. Hallock tells me that the ghost of the old Mesa Building
and Loan Association still refuses to be laid, and he intimates that some of the survivors
are trying to make it unpleasant for him by accusing him to you."

"Yes," said Lidgerwood, studying his man shrewdly by the road of the eye, and without prejudice
to the listening ear.

"As I understand it, the complaint of the survivors is based upon the fact that they think
they ought to have had a cash dividend forthcoming on the closing up of the association's affairs,"
Flemister went on; and Lidgerwood again said, "Yes."

"As Hallock has probably told you, I had the misfortune to be the president of the company.
Perhaps it's only fair to say that it was a losing venture from the first for those of us who
put the loaning capital into it. As you probably know, the money in these mutual benefit companies
is made on lapses, but when the lapses come all in a bunch----"

"I am not particularly interested in the general subject, Mr. Flemister," Lidgerwood cut in.
"As the matter has been presented to me, I understand there was a cash balance shown on the
books, and that there was no cash in the treasury to make it good. Since Hallock was the treasurer,
I can scarcely do less than I have done. I am merely asking him--and you--to make some sort
of an explanation which will satisfy the losers."

"There is only one explanation to be made," said the ex-building-and-loan president, brazenly.
"A few of us who were the officers of the company were the heaviest losers, and we felt that
we were entitled to the scraps and leavings."

"In other words, you looted the treasury among you," said Lidgerwood coldly. "Is that it, Mr.
Flemister?"

The mine-owner laughed easily. "I'm not going to quarrel with you over the word," he returned.
"Possibly the proceeding was a little informal, if you measure it by some of the more highly
civilized standards."

"I don't care to go into that," was Lidgerwood's comment, "but I cannot evade my responsibility
for the one member of your official staff who is still on my pay-roll. How far was Hallock
implicated?"

"He was not implicated at all, save in a clerical way."

"You mean that he did not share in the distribution of the money?"

"He did not."

"Then it is only fair that you should set him straight with the others, Mr. Flemister."

The ex-president did not reply at once. He took time to roll a cigarette leisurely, to light
it, and to take one or two deep inhalations, before he said: "It's a rather disagreeable thing
to do, this digging into old graveyards, don't you think? I can understand why you should wish
to be assured of Hallock's non-complicity, and I have assured you of that; but as for these
kickers, really I don't know what you can do with them unless you send them to me. And if you
do that, I am afraid some of them may come back on hospital stretchers. I haven't any time
to fool with them at this late day."

Lidgerwood felt his gorge rising, and a great contempt for Flemister was mingled with a manful
desire to pitch him out into the corridor. It was a concession to his unexplainable pity for
Hallock that made him temporize.

"As I said before, you needn't go into the ethics of the matter with me, Mr. Flemister," he
said. "But in justice to Hallock, I think you ought to make a statement of some kind that I
can show to these men who, very naturally, look to me for redress. Will you do that?"

"I'll think about it," returned the mine-owner shortly; but Lidgerwood was not to be put off
so easily.

"You must think of it to some good purpose," he insisted. "If you don't, I shall be obliged
to put my own construction upon your failure to do so, and to act accordingly."

Flemister's smile showed his teeth.

"You're not threatening me, are you, Mr. Lidgerwood?"

"Oh, no; there is no occasion for threats. But if you don't make me that statement, fully exonerating
Hallock, I shall feel at liberty to make one of my own, embodying what you have just told me.
And if I am compelled to do this, you must not blame me if I am not able to place the matter
in the most favorable light for you."

This time the visitor's smile was a mere baring of the teeth.

"Is it worth your while to make it a personal quarrel with me, Mr. Lidgerwood?" he asked, with
a thinly veiled menace in his tone.

"I am not looking for quarrelsome occasions with you or with any one," was the placable rejoinder.
"And I hope you are not going to force me to show you up. Is there anything else? If not, I'm
afraid I shall have to ask you to excuse me. This is one of my many busy days."

After Flemister had gone, Lidgerwood was almost sorry that he had not struck at once into the
matter of the thieveries. But as yet he had no proof upon which to base an open accusation.
One thing he did do, however, and that was to summon McCloskey and give instructions pointing
to a bit of experimental observation with the mine-owner as the subject.

"He can't get away from here before the evening train, and I should like to know where he goes
and what be does with himself," was the form the instructions took. "When we find out who his
accomplices are, I shall have something more to say to him."

"I'll have him tagged," promised the trainmaster; and a few minutes later, when the Wire-Silver
visitor sauntered up Mesa Avenue in quest of diversion wherewith to fill the hours of waiting
for his train, a small man, red-haired, and with a mechanic's cap pulled down over his eyes,
kept even step with him from dive to dive.

Judson's report, made to the trainmaster that evening after the westbound train had left, was
short and concise.

"He went up and sat in Sammy's game and didn't come out until it was time to make a break for
his train. I didn't see him talking to anybody after he left here." This was the wording of
the report.

"You are sure of that, are you, John?" questioned McCloskey.

Judson hung his head. "Maybe I ain't as sure as I ought to be. I saw him go into Sammy's, and
saw him come out again, and I know he didn't stay in the bar-room. I didn't go in where they
keep the tiger. Sammy don't love me any more since I held Bart Rufford up with an S-wrench,
and I was afraid I might disturb the game if I went buttin' in to make sure that Flemister
was there. But I guess there ain't no doubt about it."

Thus Judson, who was still sober, and who meant to be faithful according to his gifts. He was
scarcely blameworthy for not knowing of the existence of a small back room in the rear of the
gambling-den; or for the further unknowledge of the fact that the man in search of diversion
had passed on into this back room after placing a few bets at the silent game, appearing no
more until he had come out through the gambling-room on his way to the train. If Judson had
dared to press his espial, he might have been the poorer by the loss of blood, or possibly
of his life; but, living to get away with it, he would have been the richer for an important
bit of information. For one thing, he would have known that Flemister had not spent the afternoon
losing his money across the faro-table; and for another, he might have made sure, by listening
to the subdued voices beyond the closed door, that the man he was shadowing was not alone in
the back room to which he had retreated.

XI

NEMESIS

On the second day following Flemister's visit to Angels, Lidgerwood was called again to Red
Butte to another conference with the mine-owners. On his return, early in the afternoon, his
special was slowed and stopped at a point a few miles east of the "Y" spur at Silver Switch,
and upon looking out he saw that Benson's bridge-builders were once more at work on the wooden
trestle spanning the Gloria. Benson himself was in command, but he turned the placing of the
string-timbers over to his foreman and climbed to the platform of the superintendent's service-car.

"I won't hold you more than a few minutes," he began, but the superintendent pointed to one
of the camp-chairs and sat down, saying: "There's no hurry. We have time orders against 73
at Timanyoni, and we would have to wait there, anyhow. What do you know now?--more than you
knew the last time we talked?"

Benson shook his head. "Nothing that would do us any good in a jury trial," he admitted reluctantly.
"We are not going to find out anything more until you send somebody up to Flemister's mine
with a search-warrant."

Lidgerwood was gazing absently out over the low hills intervening between his point of view
and the wooded summit of Little Butte.

"Whom am I to send, Jack?" he asked. "I have just come from Red Butte, and I took occasion
to make a few inquiries. Flemister is evidently prepared at all points. From what I learned
to-day, I am inclined to believe that the sheriff of Timanyoni County would probably refuse
to serve a warrant against him, if we could find a magistrate who would issue one. Nice state
of affairs, isn't it?"

"Beautiful," Benson agreed, adding: "But you don't want Flemister half as bad as you want the
man who is working with him. Are you still trying to believe that it isn't Hallock?"

"I am still trying to be fair and just. McCloskey says that the two used to be friends--Hallock
and Flemister. I don't believe they are now. Hallock didn't want to go to Flemister about that
building-and-loan business, and I couldn't make out whether he was afraid, or whether it was
just a plain case of dislike."

"It would doubtless be Hallock's policy--and Flemister's, too, for that matter--to make you
believe they are not friends. You'll have to admit they are together a great deal."

"I'll admit it if you say so, but I didn't know it before. How do you know it?"

"Hallock is over here every day or two; I have seen him three or four times since that day
when he and Flemister were walking down the new spur together and turned back at sight of me,"
said Benson. "Of course, I don't know what other business Hallock may have over here, but one
thing I do know, he has been across the river, digging into the inner consciousness of my old
prospector. And that isn't all. After he had got the story of the timber stealing out of the
old man, he tried to bribe him not to tell it to any one else; tried the bribe first and a
scare afterward--told him that something would happen to him if he didn't keep a still tongue
in his head."

Lidgerwood shook his head slowly. "That looks pretty bad. Why should he want to silence the
old man?"

"That's just what I've been asking myself. But right on the heels of that, another little mystery
developed. Hallock asked the old man if he would be willing to swear in court to the truth
of his story. The old man said he would."

"Well?" said Lidgerwood.

"A night or two later the old prospector's shack burned down, and the next morning he found
a notice pinned to a tree near one of his sluice-boxes. It was a polite invitation for him
to put distance between him and the Timanyoni district. I suppose you can put two and two together,
as I did."

Again Lidgerwood said: "It looks pretty bad for Hallock. No one but the thieves themselves
could have any possible reason for driving the old man out of the country. Did he go?"

"Not much; he isn't built that way. That same day he went to work building him a new shack;
and he swears that the next man who gets near enough to set it afire won't live to get away
and brag about it. Two days afterward Hallock showed up again, and the old fellow ran him off
with a gun."

Just then the bridge-foreman came up to say that the timbers were in place, and Benson swung
off to give Lidgerwood's engineer instructions to run carefully. As the service-car platform
came along, Lidgerwood leaned over the railing for a final word with Benson. "Keep in touch
with your old man, and tell him to count on us for protection," he said; and Benson nodded
acquiescence as the one-car train crept out upon the dismantled bridge.

Having an appointment with Leckhard, of the main line, timed for an early hour the following
morning, Lidgerwood gave his conductor instructions to stop at Angels only long enough to get
orders for the eastern division.

When the division station was reached, McCloskey met the service-car in accordance with wire
instructions sent from Timanyoni, bringing an armful of mail, which Lidgerwood purposed to
work through on the run to Copah.

"Nothing new, Mac?" he asked, when the trainmaster came aboard.

"Nothing much, only the operators have notified me that there'll be trouble, pronto, if we
don't put Hannegan and Dickson back on the wires. The grievance committee intimated pretty
broadly that they could swing the trainmen into line if they had to make a fight."

"We put no man back who has been discharged for cause," said the superintendent firmly. "Did
you tell them that?"

"I did. I have been saying that so often that it mighty nearly says itself now, when I hear
my office door open."

"Well, there is nothing to do but to go on saying it. We shall either make a spoon or spoil
a horn. How would you be fixed in the event of a telegraphers' strike?"

"I've been figuring on that. It may seem like tempting the good Lord to say it, but I believe
we could hold about half of the men."

"That is decidedly encouraging," said the man who needed to find encouragement where he could.
"Two weeks ago, if you had said one in ten, I should have thought you were overestimating.
We shall win out yet."

But now McCloskey was shaking his head dubiously. "I don't know. Andy Bradford has been giving
me an idea of how the trainmen stand, and he says there is a good deal of strike talk. Williams
adds a word about the shop force: he says that Gridley's men are not saying anything, but they'll
be likely to go out in a body unless Gridley wakes up at the last minute and takes a club to them."

Lidgerwood's conductor was coming down the platform of the Crow's Nest with his orders in his
hand, and McCloskey made ready to swing off. "I can reach you care of Mr. Leckhard, at Copah,
I suppose?" he asked.

"Yes. I shall be back some time to-morrow; in the meantime there is nothing to do but to sit
tight in the boat. Use my private code if you want to wire me. I don't more than half trust
that young fellow, Dix, Callahan's day operator. And, by the way, Mr. Frisbie is sending me
a stenographer from Denver. If the young man turns up while I am away, see if you can't get
Mrs. Williams to board him."

McCloskey promised and dropped off, and the one-car special presently clanked out over the
eastern switches. Lidgerwood went at once to his desk and promptly became deaf and blind to
everything but his work. The long desert run had been accomplished, and the service-car train
was climbing the Crosswater grades, when Tadasu Matsuwari began to lay the table for dinner.
Lidgerwood glanced at his watch, and ran his finger down the line of figures on the framed
time-table hanging over his desk.

"Humph!" he muttered; "Acheson's making better time with me than he ever has before. I wonder
if Williams has succeeded in talking him over to our side? He is certainly running like a gentleman
to-day, at all events."

The superintendent sat down to Tadasu's table and took his time to Tadasu's excellent dinner,
indulging himself so far as to smoke a leisurely cigar with his black coffee before plunging
again into the sea of work. Not to spoil his improving record, Engineer Acheson continued to
make good time, and it was only a little after eleven o'clock when Lidgerwood, looking up from
his work at the final slowing of the wheels, saw the masthead lights of the Copah yards.

Taking it for granted that Superintendent Leckhard had long since left his office in the Pacific
Southwestern building, Lidgerwood gave orders to have his car placed on the station-spur, and
went on with his work. Being at the moment deeply immersed in the voluminous papers of a claim
for stock killed, he was quite oblivious of the placement of the car, and of everything else,
until the incoming of the fast main-line mail from the east warned him that another hour had
passed. When the mail was gone on its way westward, the midnight silence settled down again,
with nothing but the minimized crashings of freight cars in the lower shifting-yard to disturb
it. The little Japanese had long since made up his bunk in one of the spare state-rooms, the
train crew had departed with the engine, and the last mail-wagon had driven away up-town. Lidgerwood
had closed his desk and was taking a final pull at the short pipe which was his working companion,
when the car door opened silently and he saw an apparition.

Standing in the doorway and groping with her hands held out before her as if she were blind,
was a woman. Her gown was the tawdry half-dress of the dance-halls, and the wrap over her bare
shoulders was a gaudy imitation in colors of the Spanish mantilla. Her head was without covering,
and her hair, which was luxuriant, hung in disorder over her face. One glance at the eyes,
fixed and staring, assured Lidgerwood instantly that he had to do with one who was either drink-maddened
or demented.

"Where is he?" the intruder asked, in a throaty whisper, staring, not at him, as Lidgerwood
was quick to observe, but straight ahead at the portieres cutting off the state-room corridor
from the open compartment. And then: "I told you I would come, Rankin; I've been watching years
and years for your car to come in. Look--I want you to see what you have made of me, you and
that other man."

Lidgerwood sat perfectly still. It was quite evident that the woman did not see him. But his
thoughts were busy. Though it was by little more than chance, he knew that Hallock's Christian
name was Rankin, and instantly he recalled all that McCloskey had told him about the chief
clerk's marital troubles. Was this poor painted wreck the woman who was, or who had been, Hallock's
wife? The question had scarcely formulated itself before she began again.

"Why don't you answer me? Where are you?" she demanded, in the same husky whisper; "you needn't
hide--I know you are here. What have you done to that man? You said you would kill him; you
promised me that, Rankin: have you done it?"

Lidgerwood reached up cautiously behind him, and slowly turned off the gas from the bracket
desk-lamp. Without wishing to pry deeper than he should into a thing which had all the ear-marks
of a tragedy, he could not help feeling that he was on the verge of discoveries which might
have an important bearing upon the mysterious problems centring in the chief clerk. And he
was afraid the woman would see him.

But he was not permitted to make the discoveries. The woman had taken two or three steps into
the car, still groping her way as if the brightly lighted interior were the darkest of caverns,
when some one swung over the railing of the observation platform, and Superintendent Leckhard
appeared at the open door. Without hesitation he entered and touched the woman on the shoulder.
"Hello, Madgie," he said, not ungently, "you here again? It's pretty late for even your kind
to be out, isn't it? Better trot away and go to bed, if you've got one to go to; he isn't here."

The woman put her hands to her face, and Lidgerwood saw that she was shaking as if with a sudden
chill. Then she turned and darted away like a frightened animal. Leckhard was drawing a chair
up to face Lidgerwood.

"Did she give you a turn?" he asked, when Lidgerwood reached up and turned the desk-lamp on
full again.

"Not exactly that, though it was certainly startling enough. I had no warning at all; when
I looked up, she was standing pretty nearly where she was when you came in. She didn't seem
to see me at all, and she was talking crazily all the time to some one else--some one who isn't
here."

"I know," said Leckhard; "she has done it before."

"Whom is she trying to find?" asked Lidgerwood, wishing to have his suspicion either denied
or confirmed.

"Didn't she call him by name?--she usually does. It's your chief clerk, Hallock. She is--or
was--his wife. Haven't you heard the ghastly story yet?"

"No; and, Leckhard, I don't know that I care to hear it. It can't possibly concern me."

"It's just as well, I guess," said the main-line superintendent carelessly. "I probably shouldn't
get it straight anyway. It's a rather horrible affair, though, I believe. There is another
man mixed up in it--the man whom she is always asking if Hallock has killed. Curiously enough,
she never names the other man, and there have been a good many guesses. I believe your head
boiler-maker, Gridley, has the most votes. He's been seen with her here, now and then--when
he's on one of his 'periodicals.' By Jove! Lidgerwood, I don't envy you your job over yonder
in the Red Desert a little bit.... But about the consolidation of the yards here: I got a telegram
after I wired you, making it necessary for me to go west on main-line Twenty-seven early in
the morning, so I stayed up to talk this yard business over with you to-night."

It was well along in the small hours when the roll of blue-print maps was finally laid aside,
and Leckhard rose yawning. "We'll carry it out as you propose, and divide the expense between
the two divisions," he said in conclusion. "Frisbie has left it to us, and he will approve
whatever we agree upon. Will you go up to the hotel with me, or bunk down here?"

Lidgerwood said he would stay with his car; or, better still, now that the business for which
he had come to Copah was despatched, he would have the roundhouse night foreman call a Red
Butte Western crew and go back to his desert.

"We are in the thick of things over on the jerk-water just now," he explained, "and I don't
like to stay away any longer than I have to."

"Having a good bit of trouble with the sure-shots?" asked Leckhard. "What was that story I
heard about somebody swiping one of your switching-engines?"

"It was true," said Lidgerwood, adding, "But I think we shall recover the engine--and some
other things--presently." He liked Leckhard well enough, but he wished he would go. There are
exigencies in which even the comments of a friend and well-wisher are superfluous.

"You have a pretty tough gang to handle over these," the well-wisher went on. "I wouldn't touch
a job like yours with a ten-foot pole, unless I could shoot good enough to be sure of hitting
a half-dollar nine times out of ten at thirty paces. Somebody was telling me that you have
already had trouble with that fellow Rufford."

"Nobody was hurt, and Rufford is in jail," said Lidgerwood, hoping to kill the friendly inquiry
before it should run into details.

"Oh, well, it's all in the day's work, I suppose, which reminds me: my day's work to-morrow
won't amount to much if I don't go and turn in. Good-night."

When Leckhard was gone, Lidgerwood climbed the stair in the station building to the despatcher's
office and gave orders for the return of his car to Angels. Half an hour later the one-car
special was retracing its way westward up the valley of the Tumbling Water, and Lidgerwood
was trying to go to sleep in the well-appointed little state-room which it was Tadasu Matsuwari's
pride to keep spick and span and spotlessly clean. But there were disturbing thoughts, many
and varied, to keep him awake, chief among them those which hung upon the dramatic midnight
episode with the demented woman for its central figure. Through what dreadful Valley of Humiliation
had she come to reach the abysmal depths in which the one cry of her soul was a cry for vengeance?
Who was the unnamed man whom Hallock had promised to kill? How much or how little was this
tragedy figuring in the trouble storm which was brooding over the Red Desert? And how much
or how little would it involve one who was anxious only to see even-handed justice prevail?

These and similar insistent questions kept Lidgerwood awake long after his train had left the
crooked pathway marked out by the Tumbling Water, and when he finally fell asleep the laboring
engine of the one-car special was storming the approaches to Crosswater Summit.

XII

THE PLEASURERS

The freight wreck in the Crosswater Hills, coming a fortnight after Rufford's arrest and deportation
to Copah and the county jail, rudely marked the close of the short armistice in the conflict
between law and order and the demoralization which seemed to thrive the more lustily in proportion
to Lidgerwood's efforts to stamp it out.

Thirty-two boxes, gondolas, and flats, racing down the Crosswater grades in the heart of a
flawless, crystalline summer afternoon at the heels of Clay's big ten-wheeler, suddenly left
the steel as a unit to heap themselves in chaotic confusion upon the right-of-way, and to round
out the disaster at the moment of impact by exploding a shipment of giant powder somewhere
in the midst of the debris.

Lidgerwood was on the western division inspecting, with Benson, one of the several tentative
routes for a future extension of the Red Butte line to a connection with the Transcontinental
at Lemphi beyond the Hophras, when the news of the wreck reached Angels. Wherefore, it was
not until the following morning that he was able to leave the head-quarters station, on the
second wrecking-train, bringing the big 100-ton crane to reinforce McCloskey, who had been
on the ground with the lighter clearing tackle for the better part of the night.

With a slowly smouldering fire to fight, and no water to be had nearer than the tank-cars at
La Guayra, the trainmaster had wrought miracles. By ten o'clock the main line was cleared,
a temporary siding for a working base had been laid, and McCloskey's men were hard at work
picking up what the fire had spared when Lidgerwood arrived.

"Pretty clean sweep this time, eh, Mac?" was the superintendent's greeting, when he had penetrated
to the thick of things where McCloskey was toiling and sweating with his men.

"So clean that we get nothing much but scrap-iron out of what's left," growled McCloskey, climbing
out of the tangle of crushed cars and bent and twisted iron-work to stand beside Lidgerwood
on the main-line embankment. Then to the men who were making the snatch-hitch for the next
pull: "A little farther back, boys; farther yet, so she won't overbalance on you; that's about
it. Now, wig it!"

"You seem to be getting along all right with the outfit you've got," was Lidgerwood's comment.
"If you can keep this up we may as well go back to Angels."

"No, don't!" protested the trainmaster. "We can snake out these scrap-heaps after a fashion,
but when it comes to resurrecting the 195--did you notice her as you came along? We kept the
fire from getting to her, but she's dug herself into the ground like a dog after a woodchuck!"

Lidgerwood nodded. "I looked her over," he said. "If she'd had a little more time and another
wheel-turn or two to spare, she might have disappeared entirely--like that switching-engine
you can't find. I'm taking it for granted that you haven't found it yet--or have you?"

"No, I haven't!" grated McCloskey, and he said it like a man with a grievance. Then he added:
"I gave you all the pointers I could find two weeks ago. Whenever you get ready to put Hallock
under the hydraulic press, you'll squeeze what you want to know out of him."

This was coming to be an old subject and a sore one. The trainmaster still insisted that Hallock
was the man who was planning the robberies and plotting the downfall of the Lidgerwood management,
and he wanted to have the chief clerk systematically shadowed. And it was Lidgerwood's wholly
groundless prepossession for Hallock that was still keeping him from turning the matter over
to the company's legal department--this in spite of the growing accumulation of evidence all
pointing to Hallock's treason. Subjected to a rigid cross-examination, Judson had insisted
that a part, at least, of his drunken recollection was real--that part identifying the voices
of the two plotters in Cat Biggs's back room as those of Rufford and Hallock. Moreover, it
was no longer deniable that the chief clerk was keeping in close touch with the discharged
employees, for some purpose best known to himself; and latterly he had been dropping out of
his office without notice, disappearing, sometimes, for a day at a time.

Lidgerwood was recalling the last of these disappearances when the second wrecking-train, having
backed to the nearest siding to admit of a reversal of its make-up order and the placing of
the crane in the lead, came up to go into action. McCloskey shaded his eyes from the sun's
glare and looked down the line.

"Hello!" he exclaimed. "Got a new wrecking-boss?"

The superintendent nodded. "I have one in the making. Dawson wanted to come along and try his
hand."

"Did Gridley send him?"

"No; Gridley is away somewhere."

"So Fred's your understudy, is he? Well, I've got one, too. I'll show him to you after a while."

They were walking back over the ties toward the half-buried 195. The ten-wheeler was on its
side in the ditch, nuzzling the opposite bank of a low cutting. Dawson had already divided
his men: half of them to place the huge jack-beams and outriggers of the self-contained steam
lifting machine to insure its stability, and the other half to trench under the fallen engine
and to adjust the chain slings for the hitch.

"It's a pretty long reach, Fred," said the superintendent. "Going to try it from here?"

"Best place," said the reticent one shortly.

Lidgerwood was looking at his watch.

"Williams will be due here before long with a special from Copah. I don't want to hold him
up," he remarked.

"Thirty minutes?" inquired the draftsman, without taking mind or eye off his problem.

"Oh, yes; forty or fifty, maybe."

"All right, I'll be out of the way," was the quiet rejoinder.

"Yes, you will!" was McCloskey's ironical comment, when the draftsman had gone around to the
other side of the great crane.

"Let him alone," said Lidgerwood. "It lies in my mind that we are developing a genius, Mac."

"He'll fall down," grumbled the trainmaster. "That crane won't pick up the '95 clear the way
she's lying."

"Won't it?" said Lidgerwood. "That's where you are mistaken. It will pick up anything we have
on the two divisions. It's the biggest and best there is made. How did you come to get a tool
like that on the Red Butte Western?"

McCloskey grinned.

"You don't know Gridley yet. He's a crank on good machinery. That crane was a clean steal."

"What?"

"I mean it. It was ordered for one of the South American railroads, and was on its way to the
Coast over the P. S-W. About the time it got as far as Copah, we happened to have a mix-up
in our Copah yards, with a ditched engine that Gridley couldn't pick up with the 60-ton crane
we had on the ground. So he borrowed this one out of the P. S-W. yards, used it, liked it,
and kept it, sending our 60-ton machine on to the South Americans in its place."

"What rank piracy!" Lidgerwood exclaimed. "I don't wonder they call us buccaneers over here.
How could he do it without being found out?"

"That puzzled more than two or three of us; but one of the men told me some time afterward
how it was done. Gridley had a painter go down in the night and change the lettering--on our
old crane and on this new one. It happened that they were both made by the same manufacturing
company, and were of substantially the same general pattern. I suppose the P. S-W. yard crew
didn't notice particularly that the crane they had lent us out of the through westbound freight
had shrunk somewhat in the using. But I'll bet those South Americans are saying pleasant things
to the manufacturers yet."

"Doubtless," Lidgerwood agreed, and now he was not smiling. The little side-light on the former
Red-Butte-Western methods--and upon Gridley--was sobering.

By this time Dawson had got his big lifter in position, with its huge steel arm overreaching
the fallen engine, and was giving his orders quietly, but with clean-cut precision.

"Man that hand-fall and take slack! Pay off, Darby," to the hoister engineer. "That's right;
more slack!"

The great tackling-hook, as big around as a man's thigh, settled accurately over the 195.

"There you are!" snapped Dawson. "Now make your hitch, boys, and be lively about it. You've
got just about one minute to do it in!"

"Heavens to Betsey!" said McCloskey. "He's going to pick it up at one hitch--and without blocking!"

"Hands off, Mac," said Lidgerwood good-naturedly. "If Fred didn't know this trade before, he's
learning it pretty rapidly now."

"That's all right, but if he doesn't break something before he gets through----"

But Dawson was breaking nothing. Having designed locomotives, he knew to the fraction of an
inch where the balancing hitch should be made for lifting one. Also machinery, and the breaking
strains of it, were as his daily bread. While McCloskey was still prophesying failure, he was
giving the word to Darby, the hoister engineer.

"Now then, Billy, try your hitch! Put the strain on a little at a time and often. Steady!--now
you've got her--keep her coming!"

Slowly the big freight-puller rose out of its furrow in the gravel, righting itself to the
perpendicular as it came. Anticipating the inward swing of it, Dawson was showing his men how
to place ties and rails for a short temporary track, and when he gave Darby the stop signal,
the hoisting cables were singing like piano strings, and the big engine was swinging bodily
in the air in the grip of the crane tackle, poised to a nicety above the steel placed to receive
it.

Dawson climbed up to the main-line embankment where Darby could see him, and where he could
see all the parts of his problem at once. Then his hands went up to beckon the slacking signals.
At the lifting of his finger there was a growling of gears and a backward racing of machinery,
a groan of relaxing strains, and a cry of "All gone!" and the 195 stood upright, ready to be
hauled out when the temporary track should be extended to a connection with the main line.

"Let's go up to the other end and see how your understudy is making it, Mac," said the gratified
superintendent. "It is quite evident that we can't tell this young man anything he doesn't
already know about picking up locomotives."

On the way up the track he asked about Clay and Green, the engineer and fireman who were in
the wreck.

"They are not badly hurt," said the trainmaster. "They both jumped--on Green's side, luckily.
Clay was bruised considerably, and Green says he knows he plowed up fifty yards of gravel with
his face before he stopped--and he looked it. They both went home on 201."

Lidgerwood was examining the cross-ties, which were cut and scarred by the flanges of many
derailed wheels.

"You have no notion of what did it?" he queried, turning abruptly upon McCloskey.

"Only a guess, and it couldn't be verified in a thousand years. The '95 went off first, and
Clay and Green both say it felt as if a rail had turned over on the outside of the curve."

"What did you find when you got here?"

"Chaos and Old Night: a pile of scrap with a hole torn in the middle of it as if by an explosion,
and a fire going."

"Of course, you couldn't tell anything about the cause, under such conditions."

"Not much, you'd say; and yet a queer thing happened. The entire train went off so thoroughly
that it passed the point where the trouble began before it piled up. I was able to verify Clay's
guess--a rail had turned over on the outside of the curve."

"That proves nothing more than poor spike-holds in a few dry-rotted cross-ties," Lidgerwood
objected.

"No; there were a number of others farther along also turned over and broken and bent. But
the first one was the only freak."

"How was that?"

"Well, it wasn't either broken or bent; but when it turned over it not only unscrewed the nuts
of the fish-plate bolts and threw them away--it pulled out every spike on both sides of itself
and hid them."

Lidgerwood nodded gravely. "I should say your guess has already verified itself. All it lacks
is the name of the man who loosened the fish-plate bolts and pulled the spikes."

"That's about all."

The superintendent's eyes narrowed.

"Who was missing out of the Angels crowd of trouble-makers yesterday, Mac?"

"I hate to say," said the trainmaster. "God knows I don't want to put it all over any man unless
it belongs to him, but I'm locoed every time it comes to that kind of a guess. Every bunch
of letters I see spells just one name."

"Go on," said Lidgerwood sharply.

"Hallock came somewhere up this way on 202 yesterday."

"I know," was the quick reply. "I sent him out to Navajo to meet Cruikshanks, the cattleman
with the long claim for stock injured in the Gap wreck two weeks ago."

"Did he stop at Navajo?" queried the trainmaster.

"I suppose so; at any rate, he saw Cruikshanks."

"Well, I haven't got any more guesses, only a notion or two. This is a pretty stiff up-grade
for 202--she passes here at two-fifty--just about an hour before Clay found that loosened rail--and
it wouldn't be impossible for a man to drop off as she was climbing this curve."

But now the superintendent was shaking his head.

"It doesn't hold together, Mac; there are too many parts missing. Your hypothesis presupposes
that Hallock took a day train out of Angels, rode twelve miles past his destination, jumped
off here while the train was in motion, pulled the spikes on this loosened rail, and walked
back to Navajo in time to see the cattleman and get in to Angels on the delayed Number 75 this
morning. Could he have done all these things without advertising them to everybody?"

"I know," confessed the trainmaster. "It doesn't look reasonable."

"It isn't reasonable," Lidgerwood went on, arguing Hallock's case as if it were his own. "Bradford
was 202's conductor; he'd know if Hallock failed to get off at Navajo. Gridley was a passenger
on the same train, and he would have known. The agent at Navajo would be a third witness. He
was expecting Hallock on that train, and was no doubt holding Cruikshanks. Your guesses prefigure
Hallock failing to show up when the train stopped at Navajo, and make it necessary for him
to explain to the two men who were waiting for him why he let Bradford carry him by so far
that it took him several hours to walk back. You see how incredible it all is?"

"Yes, I see," said McCloskey, and when he spoke again they were several rail-lengths nearer
the up-track end of the wreck, and his question went back to Lidgerwood's mention of the expected
special.

"You were saying something to Dawson about Williams and a special train; is that Mr. Brewster
coming in?"

"Yes. He wired from Copah last night. He has Mr. Ford's car--the Nadia."

The trainmaster's face-contortion was expressive of the deepest chagrin.

"Suffering Moses! but this is a nice thing for the president of the road to see as he comes
along! Wouldn't the luck we're having make a dog sick?"

Lidgerwood shook his head. "That isn't the worst of it, Mac. Mr. Brewster isn't a railroad
man, and he will probably think this is all in the day's work. But he is going to stop at Angels
and go over to his copper mine, which means that he will camp right down in the midst of the
mix-up. I'd cheerfully give a year's salary to have him stay away a few weeks longer."

McCloskey was not a swearing man in the Red Desert sense of the term, but now his comment was
an explosive exclamation naming the conventional place of future punishment. It was the only
word he could find adequately to express his feelings.

The superintendent changed the subject.

"Who is your foreman, Mac?" he inquired, as a huge mass of the tangled scrap was seen to rise
at the end of the smaller derrick's grapple.

"Judson," said McCloskey shortly. "He asked leave to come along as a laborer, and when I found
that he knew more about train-scrapping than I did, I promoted him." There was something like
defiance in the trainmaster's tone.

"From the way in which you say it, I infer that you don't expect me to approve," said Lidgerwood
judicially.

McCloskey had been without sleep for a good many hours, and his patience was tenuous. The derby
hat was tilted to its most contentious angle when he said:

"I can't fight for you when you're right, and not fight against you when I think you are wrong,
Mr. Lidgerwood. You can have my head any time you want it."

"You think I should break my word and take Judson back?"

"I think, and the few men who are still with us think, that you ought to give the man who stood
in the breach for you a chance to earn bread and meat for his wife and babies," snapped McCloskey,
who had gone too far to retreat.

Lidgerwood was frowning when he replied: "You don't see the point involved. I can't reward
Judson for what you, yourself, admit was a personal service. I have said that no drunkard shall
pull a train on this division. Judson is no less a drink-maniac for the fact that he arrested
Rufford when everybody else was afraid to."

McCloskey was mollified a little.

"He says he has quit drinking, and I believe him this time. But this job I've given him isn't
pulling trains."

"No; and if you have cooled off enough, you may remember that I haven't yet disapproved your
action. I don't disapprove. Give him anything you like where a possible relapse on his part
won't involve the lives of other people. Is that what you want me to say?"

"I was hot," said the trainmaster, gruffly apologetic. "We've got none too many friends to
stand by us when the pinch comes, and we were losing them every day you held out against Judson."

"I'm still holding out on the original count. Judson can't run an engine for me until he has
proved conclusively and beyond question that he has quit the whiskey. Whatever other work you
can find for him----"

McCloskey slapped his thigh. "By George! I've got a job right now! Why on top of earth didn't
I think of him before? He's the man to keep tab on Hallock."

But now Lidgerwood was frowning again.

"I don't like that, Mac. It's a dirty business to be shadowing a man who has a right to suppose
that you are trusting him."

"But, good Lord! Mr. Lidgerwood, haven't you got enough to go on? Hallock is the last man seen
around the engine that disappears; he spends a lot of his time swapping grievances with the
rebels; and he is out of town and within a few miles of here, as you know, when this wreck
happens. If all that isn't enough to earn him a little suspicion----"

"I know; I can't argue the case with you, Mac, But I can't do it."

"You mean you won't do it. I respect your scruples, Mr. Lidgerwood. But it is no longer a personal
matter between you and Hallock: the company's interests are involved."

Without suspecting it, the trainmaster had found the weak joint in the superintendent's armor.
For the company's sake the personal point of view must be ignored.

"It is such a despicable thing," he protested, as one who yields reluctantly. "And if, after
all, Hallock is innocent----"

"That is just the point," insisted McCloskey. "If he is innocent, no harm will be done, and
Judson will become a witness for instead of against him."

"Well," said Lidgerwood; and what more he would have said about the conspiracy was cut off
by the shrill whistle of a down-coming train. "That's Williams with the special," he announced,
when the whistle gave him leave. "Is your flag out?"

"Sure. It's up around the hill, with a safe man to waggle it."

Lidgerwood cast an anxious glance toward Dawson's huge derrick-car, which was still blocking
the main line. The hoist tackle was swinging free, and the jack-beams and outriggers were taken in.

"Better send somebody down to tell Dawson to pull up here to your temporary siding, Mac," he
suggested; but Dawson was one of those priceless helpers who did not have to be told in detail.
He had heard the warning whistle, and already had his train in motion.

By a bit of quick shifting, the main line was cleared before Williams swung cautiously around
the hill with the private car. In obedience to Lidgerwood's uplifted finger the brakes were
applied, and the Nadia came to a full stop, with its observation platform opposite the end
of the wrecking-track.

A big man, in a soft hat and loose box dust-coat, with twinkling little eyes and a curling
brown beard that covered fully three-fourths of his face, stood at the hand-rail.

"Hello, Howard!" he called down to Lidgerwood. "By George! I'd totally forgotten that you were
out here. What are you trying to do? Got so many cars and engines that you have to throw some
of them away?"

Lidgerwood climbed up the embankment to the track, and McCloskey carefully let him do it alone.
The "Hello, Howard!" had not been thrown away upon the trainmaster.

"It looks a little that way, I must admit, Cousin Ned," said the culprit who had answered so
readily to his Christian name. "We tried pretty hard to get it cleaned up before you came along,
but we couldn't quite make it."

"Oho! tried to cover it up, did you? Afraid I'd fire you? You needn't be. My job as president
merely gets me passes over the road. Ford's your man; he's the fellow you want to be scared of."

"I am," laughed Lidgerwood. The big man's heartiness was always infectious. Then: "Coming over
to camp with us awhile? If you are, I hope you carry your commissary along. Angels will starve
you, otherwise."

"Don't tell me about that tin-canned tepee village, Howard--I know. I've been there before.
How are we doing over in the Timanyoni foot-hills? Getting much ore down from the Copperette?
Climb up here and tell me all about it. Or, better still, come on across the desert with us.
They don't need you here."

The assertion was quite true. With Dawson, the trainmaster, and an understudy Judson for bosses,
there was no need of a fourth. Yet intuition, or whatever masculine thing it is that stands
for intuition, prompted Lidgerwood to say:

"I don't know as I ought to leave. I've just come out from Angels, you know."

But the president was not to be denied.

"Climb up here and quit trying to find excuses. We'll give you a better luncheon than you'll
get out of the dinner-pails; and if you carry yourself handsomely, you may get a dinner invitation
after we get in. That ought to tempt any man who has to live in Angels the year round."

Lidgerwood marked the persistent plural of the personal pronoun, and a great fear laid hold
upon him. None the less, the president's invitation was a little like the king's--it was, in
some sense, a command. Lidgerwood merely asked for a moment's respite, and went down to announce
his intention to McCloskey and Dawson. Curiously enough, the draftsman seemed to be trying
to ignore the private car. His back was turned upon it, and he was glooming out across the
bare hills, with his square jaw set as if the ignoring effort were painful.

"I'm going back to Angels with the president," said the superintendent, speaking to both of
them. "You can clean up here without me."

The trainmaster nodded, but Dawson seemed not to have heard. At all events, he made no sign.
Lidgerwood turned and ascended the embankment, only to have the sudden reluctance assail him
again as he put his foot on the truck of the Nadia to mount to the platform. The hesitation
was only momentary, this time. Other guests Mr. Brewster might have, without including the
one person whom he would circle the globe to avoid.

"Good boy!" said the president, when Lidgerwood swung over the high hand-rail and leaned out
to give Williams the starting signal. And when the scene of the wreck was withdrawing into
the rearward distance, the president felt for the door-knob, saying: "Let's go inside, where
we shan't be obliged to see so much of this God-forsaken country at one time."

One half-minute later the superintendent would have given much to be safely back with McCloskey
and Dawson at the vanishing curve of scrap-heaps. In that half-minute Mr. Brewster had opened
the car door, and Lidgerwood had followed him across the threshold.

The comfortable lounging-room of the Nadia was not empty; nor was it peopled by a group of
Mr. Brewster's associates in the copper combine, the alternative upon which Lidgerwood had
hopefully hung the "we's" and the "us's."

Seated on a wicker divan drawn out to face one of the wide side-windows were two young women,
with a curly-headed, clean-faced young man between them. A little farther along, a rather austere
lady, whose pose was of calm superiority to her surroundings, looked up from her magazine to
say, as her husband had said: "Why, Howard! are you here?" Just beyond the austere lady, and
dozing in his chair, was a white-haired man whose strongly marked features proclaimed him the
father of one of the young women on the divan.

And in the farthest corner of the open compartment, facing each other companionably in an "S"-shaped
double chair, were two other young people--a man and a woman.... Truly, the heavens had fallen!
For the young woman filling half of the tête-à-tête chair was that one person whom Lidgerwood
would have circled the globe to avoid meeting.

XIII

BITTER-SWEET

Taking his cue from certain passages in the book of painful memories, Lidgerwood meant to obey
his first impulse, which prompted him to follow Mr. Brewster to the private office state-room
in the forward end of the car, disregarding the couple in the tête-à-tête contrivance. But
the triumphantly beautiful young woman in the nearer half of the crooked-backed seat would
by no means sanction any such easy solution of the difficulty.

"Not a word for me, Howard?" she protested, rising and fairly compelling him to stop and speak
to her. Then: "For pity's sake! what have you been doing to yourself to make you look so hollow-eyed
and anxious?" After which, since Lidgerwood seemed at a loss for an answer to the half-solicitous
query, she presented her companion of the "S"-shaped chair. "Possibly you will shake hands
a little less abstractedly with Mr. Van Lew. Herbert, this is Mr. Howard Lidgerwood, my cousin,
several times removed. He is the tyrant of the Red Butte Western, and I can assure you that
he is much more terrible than he looks--aren't you, Howard?"

Lidgerwood shook hands cordially enough with the tall young athlete who, it seemed, would never
have done increasing his magnificent stature as he rose up out of his half of the lounging-seat.

"Glad to meet you, Mr. Lidgerwood, I'm sure," said the young man, gripping the given hand until
Lidgerwood winced. "Miss Eleanor has been telling me about you--marooned out here in the Red
Desert. By Jove! don't you know I believe I'd like to try it awhile myself. It's ages since
I've had a chance to kill a man, and they tell me----"

Lidgerwood laughed, recognizing Miss Brewster's romancing gift, or the results of it.

"We shall have to arrange a little round-up of the bad men from Bitter Creek for you, Mr. Van
Lew. I hope you brought your armament along--the regulation 45's, and all that."

Miss Brewster laughed derisively.

"Don't let him discourage you, Herbert," she mocked. "Bitter Creek is in Wyoming--or is it
in Montana?" this with a quick little eye-stab for Lidgerwood, "and the name of Mr. Lidgerwood's
refuge is Angels. Also, papa says there is a hotel there called the 'Celestial.' Do you live
at the Celestial, Howard?"

"No, I never properly lived there. I existed there for a few weeks until Mrs. Dawson took pity
on me. Mrs. Dawson is from Massachusetts."

"Hear him!" scoffed Miss Eleanor, still mocking. "He says that as if to be 'from Massachusetts'
were a patent of nobility. He knows I had the cruel misfortune to be born in Colorado. But
tell me, Howard, is Mrs. Dawson a charming young widow?"

"Mrs. Dawson is a very charming middle-aged widow, with a grown son and a daughter," said Lidgerwood,
a little stiffly. It seemed entirely unnecessary that she should ridicule him before the athlete.

"And the daughter--is she charming, too? But that says itself, since she must also date 'from
Massachusetts.'" Then to Van Lew: "Every one out here in the Red Desert is 'from' somewhere,
you know."

"Miss Dawson is quite beneath your definition of charming, I imagine," was Lidgerwood's rather
crisp rejoinder; and for the third time he made as if he would go on to join the president
in the office state-room.

"You are staying to luncheon with us, aren't you?" asked Miss Brewster. "Or do you just drop
in and out again, like the other kind of angels?"

"Your father commands me, and he says I am to stay. And now, if you will excuse me----"

This time he succeeded in getting away, and up to the luncheon hour talked copper and copper
prospects to Mr. Brewster in the seclusion of the president's office compartment. The call
for the midday meal had been given when Mr. Brewster switched suddenly from copper to silver.

"By the way, there were a few silver strikes over in the Timanyonis about the time of the Red
Butte gold excitement," he remarked. "Some of them have grown to be shippers, haven't they?"

"Only two, of any importance," replied the superintendent: "the Ruby, in Ruby Gulch, and Flemister's
Wire-Silver, at Little Butte. You couldn't call either of them a bonanza, but they are both
shipping fair ore in good quantities."

"Flemister," said the president reflectively. "He's a character. Know him personally, Howard?"

"A little," the superintendent admitted.

"A little is a-plenty. It wouldn't pay you to know him very well," laughed the big man good-naturedly.
"He has a somewhat paralyzing way of getting next to you financially. I knew him in the old
Leadville days; a born gentleman, and also a born buccaneer. If the men he has held up and
robbed were to stand in a row, they'd fill a Denver street."

"He is in his proper longitude out here, then," said Lidgerwood rather grimly. "This is the
'hold-up's heaven.'"

"I'll bet Flemister is doing his share of the looting," laughed the president. "Is he alone
in the mine?"

"I don't know that he has any partners. Somebody told me, when I first came over here, that
Gridley, our master-mechanic, was in with him; but Gridley says that is a mistake--that he
thinks too much of his reputation to be Flemister's partner."

"Hank Gridley," mused the president; "Hank Gridley and 'his reputation'! It would certainly
be a pity if that were to get corroded in any way. There is a man who properly belongs to the
Stone Age--what you might call an elemental 'scoundrel."

"You surprise me!" exclaimed Lidgerwood. "I didn't like him at first, but I am convinced now
that it was only unreasoning prejudice. He appeals to me as being anything but a scoundrel."

"Well, perhaps the word is a bit too savage," admitted Gridley's accuser. "What I meant was
that he has capabilities that way, and not much moral restraint. He is the kind of man to wade
through fire and blood to gain his object, without the slightest thought of the consequences
to others. Ever hear the story of his marriage? No? Remind me of it some time, and I'll tell
you. But we were speaking of Flemister. You say the Wire-Silver has turned out pretty well?"

"Very well indeed, I believe. Flemister seems to have money to burn."

"He always has, his own or somebody else's. It makes little difference to him. The way he got
the Wire-Silver would have made Black-Beard the pirate turn green with envy. Know anything
about the history of the mine?"

Lidgerwood shook his head.

"Well, I do; just happen to. You know how it lies--on the western slope of Little Butte ridge?"

"Yes."

"That is where it lies now. But the original openings were made on the eastern slope of the
butte. They didn't pan out very well, and Flemister began to look for a victim to whom he could
sell. About that time a man, whose name I can never recall, took up a claim on the western
slope of the ridge directly opposite Flemister. This man struck it pretty rich, and Flemister
began to bully him on the plea that the new discovery was only a continuation of his own vein
straight through the hill. You can guess what happened."

"Fairly well," said Lidgerwood. "Flemister lawed the other man out."

"He did worse than that; he drove straight into the hill, past his own lines, and actually
took the money out of the other man's mine to use as a fighting fund. I don't know how the
courts sifted it out, finally; I didn't follow it up very closely. But Flemister put the other
man to the wall in the end--'put it all over him,' as your man Bradford would say. There was
some domestic tragedy involved, too, in which Flemister played the devil with the other man's
family; but I don't know any of the details."

"Yet you say Flemister is a born gentleman, as well as a born buccaneer?"

"Well, yes; he behaves himself well enough in decent company. He isn't exactly the kind of
man you can turn down short--he has education, good manners, and all that, you know; but if
he were hard up I shouldn't let him get within roping distance of my pocket-book, or, if I
had given him occasion to dislike me, within easy pistol range."

"Wherein he is neither better nor worse than a good many others who take the sunburn of the
Red Desert," was Lidgerwood's comment, and just then the waiter opened the door a second time
to say that luncheon was served.

"Don't forget to remind me that I'm to tell you Gridley's story, Howard," said the president,
rising out of the depths of his lounging-chair and stripping off the dust-coat, "Reads like
a romance--only I fancy it was anything but a romance for poor Lizzie Gridley. Let's go and
see what the cook has done for us."

At luncheon Lidgerwood was made known to the other members of the private-car party. The white-haired
old man who had been dozing in his chair was Judge Holcombe, Van Lew's uncle and the father
of the prettier of the two young women who had been entertaining Jefferis, the curly-headed
collegian. Jefferis laughingly disclaimed relationship with anybody; but Miss Carolyn Doty,
the less pretty but more talkative of the two young women, confessed that she was a cousin,
twice removed, of Mrs. Brewster.

Quite naturally, Lidgerwood sought to pair the younger people when the table gathering was
complete, and was not entirely certain of his prefiguring. Eleanor Brewster and Van Lew sat
together and were apparently absorbed in each other to the exclusion of all things extraneous.
Jefferis had Miss Doty for a companion, and the affliction of her well-balanced tongue seemed
to affect neither his appetite nor his enjoyment of what the young woman had to say.

Miriam Holcombe had fallen to Lidgerwood's lot, and at first he thought that her silence was
due to the fact that young Jefferis had gotten upon the wrong side of the table. But after
she began to talk, he changed his mind.

"Tell me about the wrecked train we passed a little while ago, Mr. Lidgerwood," she began,
almost abruptly. "Was any one killed?"

"No; it was a freight, and the crew escaped. It was a rather narrow escape, though, for the
engineer, and fireman."

"You were putting it back on the track?" she asked.

"There isn't much of it left to put back, as you may have observed," said Lidgerwood. Then
he told her of the explosion and the fire.

She was silent for a few moments, but afterward she went on, half-gropingly he thought.

"Is that part of your work--to get the trains on the track when they run off?"

He laughed. "I suppose it is--or at least, in a certain sense, I'm responsible for it. But
I am lucky enough to have a wrecking-boss--two of them, in fact, and both good ones."

She looked up quickly, and he was sure that he surprised something more than a passing interest
in the serious eyes--a trouble depth, he would have called it, had their talk been anything
more than the ordinary conventional table exchange.

"We saw you go down to speak to two of your men: one who wore his hat pulled down over his
eyes and made dreadful faces at you as he talked----"

"That was McCloskey, our trainmaster," he cut in.

"And the other----?"

"Was wrecking-boss Number Two," he told her, "my latest apprentice, and a very promising young
subject. This was his first time out under my administration, and he put McCloskey and me out
of the running at once."

"What did he do?" she asked, and again he saw the groping wistfulness in her eyes, and wondered
at it.

"I couldn't explain it without being unpardonably technical. But perhaps it can best be summed
up in saying that he is a fine mechanical engineer with the added gift of knowing how to handle
men."

"You are generous, Mr. Lidgerwood, to--to a subordinate. He ought to be very loyal to you."

"He is. And I don't think of him as a subordinate--I shouldn't even if he were on my pay-roll
instead of on that of the motive-power department. I am glad to be able to call him my friend,
Miss Holcombe."

Again a few moments of silence, during which Lidgerwood was staring gloomily across at Miss
Brewster and Van Lew. Then another curiously abrupt question from the young woman at his side.

"His college, Mr. Lidgerwood; do you chance to know where he was graduated?"

At another moment Lidgerwood might have wondered at the young woman's persistence. But now
Benson's story of Dawson's terrible misfortune was crowding all purely speculative thoughts
out of his mind.

"He took his engineering course in Carnegie, but I believe he did not stay through the four
years," he said gravely.

Miss Holcombe was looking down the table, down and across to where her father was sitting,
at Mr. Brewster's right. When she spoke again the personal note was gone; and after that the
talk, what there was of it, was of the sort that is meant to bridge discomforting gaps.

In the dispersal after the meal, Lidgerwood attached himself to Miss Doty; this in sheer self-defense.
The desert passage was still in its earlier stages, and Miss Carolyn's volubility promised
to be the less of two evils, the greater being the possibility that Eleanor Brewster might
seek to re-open a certain spring of bitterness at which he had been constrained to drink deeply
and miserably in the past.

The self-defensive expedient served its purpose admirably. For the better part of the desert
run, the president slept in his state-room, Mrs. Brewster and the judge dozed in their respective
easy-chairs, and Jefferis and Miriam Holcombe, after roaming for an uneasy half-hour from the
rear platform to the cook's galley forward, went up ahead, at one of the stops, to ride--by
the superintendent's permission--in the engine cab with Williams. Miss Brewster and Van Lew
were absorbed in a book of plays, and their corner of the large, open compartment was the one
farthest removed from the double divan which Lidgerwood had chosen for Miss Carolyn and himself.

Later, Van Lew rolled a cigarette and went to the smoking-compartment, which was in the forward
end of the car; and when next Lidgerwood broke Miss Doty's eye-hold upon him, Miss Brewster
had also disappeared--into her state-room, as he supposed. Taking this as a sign of his release,
he gently broke the thread of Miss Carolyn's inquisitiveness, and went out to the rear platform
for a breath of fresh air and surcease from the fashery of a neatly balanced tongue.

When it was quite too late to retreat, he found the deep-recessed observation platform of the
Nadia occupied. Miss Brewster was not in her state-room, as he had mistakenly persuaded himself.
She was sitting in one of the two platform camp-chairs, and she was alone.

"I thought you would come, if I only gave you time enough," she said, quite coolly. "Did you
find Carolyn very persuasive?"

He ignored the query about Miss Doty, replying only to the first part of her speech.

"I thought you had gone to your state-room. I hadn't the slightest idea that you were out here."

"Otherwise you would not have come? How magnificently churlish you can be, upon occasion, Howard!"

"It doesn't deserve so hard a name," he rejoined patiently. "For the moment I am your father's
guest, and when he asked me to go to Angels with him----"

--"He didn't tell you that mamma and Judge Holcombe and Carolyn and Miriam and Herbert and
Geof. Jefferis and I were along," she cut in maliciously. "Howard, don't you know you are positively
spiteful, at times!"

"No," he denied.

"Don't contradict me, and don't be silly." She pushed the other chair toward him. "Sit down
and tell me how you've been enduring the interval. It is more than a year, isn't it?"

"Yes. A year, three months, and eleven days." He had taken the chair beside her because there
seemed to be nothing else to do.

"How mathematically exact you are!" she gibed. "To-morrow it will be a year, three months,
and twelve days; and the day after to-morrow--mercy me! I should go mad if I had to think back
and count up that way every day. But I asked you what you had been doing."

He spread his hands. "Existing, one way and another. There has always been my work."

"'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,'" she quoted. "You are excessively dull to-day,
Howard. Hasn't it occurred to you?"

"Thank you for expressing it so delicately. It seems to be my misfortune to disappoint you,
always."

"Yes," she said, quite unfeelingly. Then, with a swift relapse into pure mockery: "How many
times have you fallen in love during the one year, three months, and eleven days?"

His frown was almost a scowl. "Is it worth while to make an unending jest of it, Eleanor?"

"A jest?--of your falling in love? No, my dear cousin, several times removed, no one would
dare to jest with you on that subject. But tell me; I am really and truly interested. Will
you confess to three times? That isn't so very many, considering the length of the interval."

"No."

"Twice, then? Think hard; there must have been at least two little quickenings of the heartbeats
in all that time."

"No."

"Still no? That reduces it to one--the charming Miss Dawson----"

"You might spare her, even if you are not willing to spare me. You know well enough there has
never been any one but you, Eleanor; that there never will be any one but you."

The train was passing the western confines of the waterless tract, and a cool breeze from the
snowcapped Timanyonis was sweeping across the open platform. It blew strands of the red-brown
hair from beneath the closely fitting travelling-hat; blew color into Miss Brewster's cheeks
and a daring brightness into the laughing eyes.

"What a pity!" she said in mock sympathy.

"That I can't measure up to your requirements of the perfect man? Yes, it is a thousand pities,"
he agreed.

"No; that isn't precisely what I meant. The pity is that I seem to you to be unable to appreciate
your many excellencies and your--constancy."

"I think you were born to torment me," he rejoined gloomily. "Why did you come out here with
your father? You must have known that I was here."

"Not from any line you have ever written," she retorted. "Alicia Ford told me, otherwise I
shouldn't have known."

"Still, you came. Why? Were you curious?"

"Why should I be curious, and what about?--the Red Desert? I've seen deserts before."

"I thought you might be curious to know what disposition the Red Desert was making of such
a failure as I am," he said evenly. "I can forgive that more easily than I can forgive your
bringing of the other man along to be an on-looker."

"Herbert, you mean? He is a good boy, a nice boy--and perfectly harmless. You'll like him immensely
when you come to know him better."

"You like him?" he queried.

"How can you ask--when you have just called him 'the other man'?"

Lidgerwood turned in his chair and faced her squarely.

"Eleanor, I had my punishment over a year ago, and I have been hoping you would let it suffice.
It was hard enough to lose you without being compelled to stand by and see another man win
you. Can't you understand that?"

She did not answer him. Instead, she whipped aside from that phase of the subject to ask a
question of her own.

"What ever made you come out here, Howard?"

"To the superintendency of the Red Butte Western? You did."

"I?"

"Yes, you."

"It is ridiculous!"

"It is true."

"Prove it--if you can; but you can't."

"I am proving it day by day, or trying to. I didn't want to come, but you drove me to it."

"I decline to take any such hideous responsibility," she laughed lightly. "There must have
been some better reason; Miss Dawson, perhaps."

"Quite likely, barring the small fact that I didn't know there was a Miss Dawson until I had
been a month in Angels."

"Oh!" she said half spitefully. And then, with calculated malice, "Howard, if you were only
as brave as you are clever!... Why can't you be a man and strike back now and then?"

"Strike back at the woman I love? I'm not quite down to that, I hope, even if I was once too
cowardly to strike for her."

"Always that! Why won't you let me forget?"

"Because you must not forget. Listen: two weeks ago--only two weeks ago--one of the Angels--er--peacemakers
stood up in his place and shot at me. What I did made me understand that I had gained nothing
in a year."

"Shot at you?" she echoed, and now he might have discovered a note of real concern in her tone
if his ear had been attuned to hear it. "Tell me about it. Who was it? and why did he shoot
at you?"

His answer seemed to be indirection itself.

"How long do you expect to stay in Angels and its vicinity?" he asked.

"I don't know. This is partly a pleasure trip for us younger folk. Father was coming out alone,
and I--that is, mamma decided to come and make a car-party of it. We may stay two or three
weeks, if the others wish it. But you haven't answered me. I want to know who the man was,
and why he shot at you."

"Exactly; and you have answered yourself. If you stay two weeks, or two days, in Angels you
will doubtless hear all you care to about my troubles. When the town isn't talking about what
it is going to do to me, it is gossiping about the dramatic arrest of my would-be assassin."

"You are most provoking!" she declared. "Did you make the arrest?"

"Don't shame me needlessly; of course I didn't. One of our locomotive engineers, a man whom
I had discharged for drunkenness, was the hero. It was a most daring thing. The desperado is
known in the Red Desert as 'The Killer,' and he has had the entire region terrorized so completely
that the town marshal of Angels, a man who has never before shirked his duty, refused to serve
the warrant. Judson, the engineer, made the capture--took the 'terror' from his place in a
gambling-den, disarmed him, and brought him in. Judson himself was unarmed, and he did the
trick with a little steel wrench such as engineers use about a locomotive."

Miss Brewster, being Colorado-born, was deeply interested.

"Now you are no longer dull, Howard!" she exclaimed. "Tell me in words just how Mr. Judson did it."

"It was an old dodge, so old that it seemed new to everybody. As I told you, Judson was discharged
for drunkenness. All Angels knows him for a fighter to the finish when he is sober, and for
the biggest fool and the most harmless one when he is in liquor. He took advantage of this,
reeled into the gambling-place as if he were too drunk to see straight, played the fool till
he got behind his man--after which the matter simplified itself. Rufford, the desperado, had
no means of knowing that the cold piece of metal Judson was pressing against his back was not
the muzzle of a loaded revolver, and he had every reason for supposing that it was; hence,
he did all the things Judson told him to do."

Miss Eleanor did not need to vocalize her approval of Judson; the dark eyes were alight with
excitement.

"How fine!" she applauded. "Of course, after that, you took Mr. Judson back into the railway
service?"

"Indeed, I did nothing of the sort; nor shall I, until he demonstrates that he means what he
says about letting the whiskey alone."

"'Until he demonstrates'--don't be so cold-blooded, Howard! Possibly he saved your life."

"Quite probably. But that has nothing to do with his reinstatement as an engineer of passenger-trains.
It would be much better for Rufford to kill me than for me to let Judson have the chance to
kill a train-load of innocent people."

"And yet, a few moments ago, you called yourself a coward, cousin mine. Could you really face
such an alternative without flinching?"

"It doesn't appeal to me as a question involving any special degree of courage," he said slowly.
"I am a great coward, Eleanor--not a little one, I hope."

"It doesn't appeal to you?--dear God!" she said. "And I have been calling you ... but would
you do it, Howard?"

He smiled at her sudden earnestness.

"How generous your heart is, Eleanor, when you let it speak for itself! If you will promise
not to let it change your opinion of me--you shouldn't change it, you know, for I am the same
man whom you held up to scorn the day we parted--if you will promise, I'll tell you that for
weeks I have gone about with my life in my hands, knowing it. It hasn't required any great
amount of courage; it merely comes along in the line of my plain duty to the company--it's
one of the things I draw my salary for."

"You haven't told me why this desperado wanted to kill you--why you are in such a deep sea
of trouble out here, Howard," she reminded him.

"No; it is a long story, and it would bore you if I had time to tell it. And I haven't time,
because that is Williams's whistle for the Angels yard."

He had risen and was helping his companion to her feet when Mrs. Brewster came to the car door
to say:

"Oh, you are out here, are you, Howard? I was looking for you to let you know that we dine
in the Nadia at seven. If your duties will permit----"

Lidgerwood's refusal was apologetic but firm.

"I am very sorry, Cousin Jessica," he protested. "But I left a deskful of stuff when I ran
away to the wreck this morning, and really I'm afraid I shall have to beg off."

"Oh, don't be so dreadfully formal!" said the president's wife impatiently. "You are a member
of the family, and all you have to do is to say bluntly that you can't come, and then come
whenever you can while we are here. Carolyn Doty is dying to ask you a lot more questions about
the Red Desert. She confided to me that you were the most interesting talker----"

Miss Eleanor's interruption was calculated to temper the passed-on praise.

"He has been simply boring me to death, mamma, until just a few minutes ago. I shall tell Carolyn
that she is too easily pleased."

Mrs. Brewster, being well used to Eleanor's flippancies, paid no attention to her daughter.

"You will come to us whenever you can, Howard; that is understood," she said. And so the social
matter rested.

Lidgerwood was half-way down the platform of the Crow's Nest, heading for his office and the
neglected desk, when Williams's engine came backing through one of the yard tracks on its way
to the roundhouse. At the moment of its passing, a little man with his cap pulled over his
eyes dropped from the gangway step and lounged across to the head-quarters building.

It was Judson; and having seen him last toiling away man-fashion at the wreck in the Crosswater
Hills, Lidgerwood hailed him.

"Hello, Judson! How did you get here? I thought you were doing a turn with McCloskey."

The small man's grin was ferocious.

"I was, but Mac said he didn't have any further use for me--said I was too much of a runt to
be liftin' and pullin' along with growed-up men. I came down with Williams on the '66."

Lidgerwood turned away. He remembered his reluctant consent to McCloskey's proposal touching
the espial upon Hallock, and was sorry he had given it. It was too late to recall it now; but
neither by word nor look did the superintendent intimate to the discharged engineer that he
knew why McCloskey had sent him back to Angels on the engine of the president's special.

XIV

BLIND SIGNALS

Lidgerwood was not making the conventional excuse when he gave the deskful of work as a reason
for not accepting the invitation to dine with the president's party in the Nadia. Being the
practical as well as the nominal head of the Red Butte line, and the only official with complete
authority west of Copah, his daily mail was always heavy, and during his frequent absences
the accumulations stored up work for every spare hour he could devote to it.

It was this increasing clerical burden which had led him to ask the general manager for a stenographer,
and during one of the later absences the young man had come--a rapid, capable young fellow
with the gift of knowing how to make himself indispensable to a superior, coupled with the
ability to take care of much of the routine correspondence without specific instructions, and
with a disposition to be loyal to his salt.

Climbing the stair to his office on the second floor of the Crow's Nest after the brief exchange
of question and answer with Judson, Lidgerwood found his new helper hard at work grinding through
the day's train mail.

"Don't scamp your meals, Grady," was his greeting to the stenographer, as he opened his own
desk. "This is a pretty busy shop, but it is well to remember that there is always another
day coming, and if there isn't, it won't make any difference how much or how little is left
undone."

"Colgan wired that you were on Mr. Brewster's special, and I was waiting on the chance that
you might want to rush something through when you got in," returned the young Irishman, reaching
mechanically for his note-book.

"I shall want to rush a lot of it through after a while, but you'd better go and get your supper
now and come back fresh for it," said the superintendent, who was always humane to every one
but himself. "Was there anything special in to-day's mail?"

"Only this," turning up a letter marked "Immediate" and bearing the cancellation stamp of the
postal car which had passed eastward on Train 202.

Lidgerwood read the marked letter twice before he placed it face down in the "unanswered" basket.
It was from Flemister, and it called for a decision which the superintendent was willing to
postpone for the moment. After he had read thoughtfully through everything else on the waiting
list, he took up the mine-owner's letter again. All things considered, it was a little puzzling.
He had not seen Flemister since the day of the rather spiteful conversation, with the building-and-loan
theft for a topic, and on that occasion the mine-owner had gone away with threats in his mouth.
Yet his letter was distinctly friendly, conveying an offer of neighborly help.

The occasion for the neighborliness arose upon a right-of-way involvement. Acting under instructions
from Vice-President Ford, Lidgerwood had already begun to move in the matter of extending the
Red Butte Western toward the Nevada gold-fields, and Benson had been running preliminary surveys
and making estimates of cost. Of the two more feasible routes, that which left the main line
at Little Butte, turning southward up the Wire-Silver gulch, had been favorably reported on
by the engineer. The right of way over this route, save for a few miles through an upland valley
of cattle ranches, could be acquired from the government, and among the ranch owners only one
was disposed to fight the coming of the railroad--for a purely mercenary purpose, Benson declared.

It was about this man, James Grofield, that Flemister wrote. The ranchman, so the letter stated,
had passed through Little Butte early in the day, on his way to Red Butte. He would be returning
by the accommodation late in the afternoon, and would stop at the Wire-Silver mine, where he
had stabled his horses. For some reason he had taken a dislike to Benson, but if Lidgerwood
could make it convenient to come over to Little Butte on the evening passenger-train from Angels,
the writer of the letter would arrange to keep Grofield over-night, and the right-of-way matter
could doubtless be settled satisfactorily.

This was the substance of the mine-owner's letter, and if Lidgerwood hesitated it was partly
because he was suspicious of Flemister's sudden friendliness. Then the motive--Flemister's
motive--suggested itself, and the suspicion was put to sleep. The Wire-Silver mine was five
miles distant from the main line at Little Butte, at the end of a spur; if the extension should
be built, it would be a main-line station, with all the advantages accruing therefrom. Flemister
was merely putting the personal animosities aside for a good and sufficient business reason.

Lidgerwood looked at his watch. If Grady should not be gone too long, he might be able to work
through the pile of correspondence and get away on the evening passenger; and when the stenographer
came back the work was attacked with that end in view. But after an hour's rapid dictating,
a long-drawn whistle signal announced the incoming of the train he was trying to make and warned
him that the race against time had failed.

"It's no use; we'll have to make two bites of it," he said to Grady, and then he left his desk
to go downstairs for a breathing moment and the cup of coffee which he meant to substitute
for the dinner which the lack of time had made him forego.

Train 205, the train Flemister had suggested that he might take, was just pulling in from the
long run across the desert when he reached the foot of the stairs. That it was too late to
take this means of reaching Little Butte and the Wire-Silver mine was a small matter; it merely
meant that he would be obliged to order out the service-car and go special, if he should finally
decide to act upon Flemister's suggestion.

Angels being a meal station, there was a twenty-minute stop for all trains, and the passengers
from 205 were crowding the platform and hurrying to the dining-room and lunch-counter when
Lidgerwood made his way to the station end of the building. In the men's room, whither he went
to order his cup of coffee, there was a mixed throng of travellers, with a sprinkling of trainmen
and town idlers, among the latter a number of the lately discharged railroad employees. Lidgerwood
marked a group of the trouble-makers withdrawing to a corner of the room as he entered, and
while the waiter was serving his coffee, he saw Hallock join the group. It was only a straw,
but straws are significant when the wind is blowing from a threatening quarter. Once again
Lidgerwood remembered McCloskey's proposal, and his own reluctant assent to it, and now he
was not too greatly conscience-stricken when he saw Judson quietly working his way through
the crowded room to a point of espial upon the group in the corner.

"Your coffee's getting cold, Mr. Lidgerwood," the man behind the counter warned him, and Lidgerwood
whirled around on the pivot stool and turned his back upon the malcontents and their watcher.
The keen inner sense, which neither the physiologists nor the psychologists have yet been able
to define or to name, apprised him of a threat developing in the distant corner, but he resolutely
ignored it, drank his coffee, and presently went his way around the peopled end of the building
and back to the office entrance, meaning to go above stairs and put in another hour with Grady
before he should decide definitely about making the night run to Little Butte.

His foot was on the threshold of the stairway door when Judson overtook him.

"Mac told me to report to you when I couldn't get at him," the ex-engineman began abruptly.
"There's something hatching, but I can't find out what it is. Are you thinking about goin'
out on the road anywhere to-night, Mr. Lidgerwood?"

Lidgerwood's decision was taken on the instant.

"Yes; I think I shall go west in my car in an hour or so. Why?"

"There ain't any 'why,' I guess, if you feel like goin'. But what I don't savvy is why them
fellows back yonder in the waitin'-room are so dead anxious to find out if you are goin'."

As he spoke, a man who had been skulking behind a truck-load of express freight, so near that
he could have touched either of them with an out-stretched arm, withdrew silently in the direction
of the lunch-room. He was a tall man with stooping shoulders, and his noiseless retreat was
cautiously made, yet not quite cautiously enough, since Judson's sharp eyes marked the shuffling
figure vanishing in the shadow cast by the over-hanging shelter roof of the station.

"By cripes!--look at that, will you?" he exclaimed, pointing to the retreating figure. "That's
Hallock, and he was listening!"

Lidgerwood shook his head.

"No, that isn't Hallock," he denied. And then, with a bit of the man-driving rasp in his voice:
"See here, Judson, don't you let McCloskey's prejudices run away with you; make a memorandum
of that and paste it in your hat. I know what you have been instructed to do, and I have given
my consent, but it is with the understanding that you will be at least as fair as you would
be if McCloskey's bias happened to run the other way. I don't want you to make a case against
Hallock unless you can get proof positive that he is disloyal to the company and to me; and
I'll tell you here and now that I shall be much better pleased if you can bring me the assurance
that he is a true man."

"But that was Hallock," insisted Judson, "or else it was his livin' double."

"No; follow him and you'll see for yourself. It was more like that Ruby Gulch operator who
quit in a quarrel with McCloskey a week or two ago. What is his name?--Sheffield."

Judson hastened down the platform to satisfy himself, and Lidgerwood mounted the stair to his
office. Grady was still pounding the keys of the type-writer on the batch of letters given
him in the busy hour following his return from supper, and the superintendent turned his back
upon the clicking activities and went to stand at the window, from which he could look down
upon the platform with the waiting passenger-train drawn up beside it.

Seeing the cheerful lights in the side-tracked Nadia, he fell to thinking of Eleanor, opening
the door of conscious thought to her and saying to himself that she was never more than a single
step beyond the threshold of that door. Looking across to the Nadia, he knew now why he had
hesitated so long before deciding to go on the night trip to Timanyoni Park. Chilled hearts
follow the analogy of cold hands. When the fire is near, a man will go and spread his fingers
to the blaze, though he may be never so well assured that they will ache for it afterward.

But with this thought came another and a more manly one--the woman he loved was in Angels,
and she would doubtless remain in Angels or its immediate vicinity for some time; that was
unpreventable; but he could still resolve that there should not be a repetition of the old
tragedy of the moth and the candle. It was well that at the very outset a duty call had come
to enable him to break the spell of her nearness, and it was also well that he had decided
not to disregard it.

The train conductor's "All aboard!" shouted on the platform just below his window, drew his
attention from the Nadia and the distracting thought of Eleanor's nearness. Train 205 was ready
to resume its westward flight, and the locomotive bell was clanging musically. A half-grown
moon, hanging low in the black dome of the night, yellowed the glow of the platform incandescents.
The last few passengers were hurrying up the steps of the cars, and the conductor was swinging
his lantern in the starting signal for the engineer.

At the critical moment, when the train was fairly in motion, Lidgerwood saw Hallock--it was
unmistakably Hallock this time--spring from the shadow of a baggage-truck and whip up to the
step of the smoker, and a scant half-second later he saw Judson race across the wide platform
and throw himself like a self-propelled projectile against and through the closing doors of
the vestibule at the forward end of the sleeper.

Judson's dash and his capture of the out-going train were easily accounted for: he had seen
Hallock. But where was Hallock going? Lidgerwood was still asking himself the question half-abstractedly
when he crossed to his desk and touched the buzzer-push which summoned an operator from the
despatcher's room.

"Wire Mr. Pennington Flemister, care of Goodloe, at Little Butte, that I am coming out with
my car, and should be with him by eleven o'clock. Then call up the yard office and tell Matthews
to let me have the car and engine by eight-thirty, sharp," he directed.

The operator made a note of the order and went out, and the superintendent settled himself
in his desk-chair for another hour's hard work with the stenographer. At twenty-five minutes
past eight he heard the wheel-grindings of the up-coming service-car, and the weary short-hand
man snapped a rubber band upon the notes of the final letter.

"That's all for to-night, Grady, and it's quite enough," was the superintendent's word of release.
"I'm sorry to have to work you so late, but I'd like to have those letters written out and
mailed before you lock up. Are you good for it?"

"I'm good for anything you say, Mr. Lidgerwood," was the response of the one who was loyal
to his salt, and the superintendent put on his light coat and went out and down the stair.

At the outer door he turned up the long platform, instead of down, and walked quickly to the
Nadia, persuading himself that he must, in common decency, tell the president that he was going
away; persuading himself that it was this, and not at all the desire to warm his hands at the
ungrateful fire of Eleanor's mockery, that was making him turn his back for the moment upon
the waiting special train.

XV

ELEANOR INTERVENES

The president's private car was side-tracked on the short spur at the eastern end of the Crow's
Nest, and when Lidgerwood reached it he found the observation platform fully occupied. The
night was no more than pleasantly cool, and the half-grown moon, which was already dipping
to its early extinguishment behind the upreared bulk of the Timanyonis, struck out stark etchings
in silver and blackest shadow upon a ground of fallow dun and vanishing grays. On such nights
the mountain desert hides its forbidding face, and the potent spell of the silent wilderness
had drawn the young people of the Nadia's party to the out-door trysting-place.

"Hello, Mr. Lidgerwood, is that you?" called Van Lew, when the superintendent came across to
the spur track. "I thought you said this was a bad man's country. We have been out here for
a solid hour, and nobody has shot up the town or even whooped a single lonesome war-whoop;
in fact, I think your village with the heavenly name has gone ingloriously to bed. We're defrauded."

"It does go to bed pretty early--that part of it which doesn't stay up pretty late," laughed
Lidgerwood. Then he came closer and spoke to Miss Brewster. "I am going west in my car, and
I don't know just when I shall return. Please tell your father that everything we have here
is entirely at his service. If you don't see what you want, you are to ask for it."

"Will there be any one to ask when you are gone?" she inquired, neither sorrowing nor rejoicing,
so far as he could determine.

"Oh, yes; McCloskey, my trainmaster, will be in from the wreck before morning, and he will
turn flip-flaps trying to make things pleasant for you, if you will give him the chance."

She made the adorable little grimace which always carried him swiftly back to a certain summer
of ecstatic memories; to a time when her keenest retort had been no more than a playful love-thrust
and there had been no bitterness in her mockery.

"Will he make dreadful faces at me, as he did at you this morning when you went down among
the smashed cars at the wreck to speak to him?" she asked.

"So you were looking out of the window, too, were you? You are a close observer and a good
guesser. That was Mac, and--yes, he will probably make faces at you. He can't help it any more
than he can help breathing."

Miss Brewster was running her fingers along the hand-rail as if it were the key-board of a
piano. "You say you don't know how long you will be away?" she asked.

"No; but probably not more than the night. I was only providing for the unexpected, which some
people say is what always happens."

"Will your run take you as far as the Timanyoni Canyon?"

"Yes; through it, and some little distance beyond."

"You have just said that we are to ask for what we want. Did you mean it?"

"Surely," he replied unguardedly.

"Then we may as well begin at once," she said coolly; and turning quickly to the others: "O
all you people; listen a minute, will you? Hush, Carolyn! What do you say to a moonlight ride
through one of the grandest canyons in the West in Mr. Lidgerwood's car? It will be something
to talk about as long as you live. Don't all speak at once, please."

But they did. There was an instant and enthusiastic chorus of approval, winding up rather dolefully,
however, with Miss Doty's, "But your mother will never consent to it, Eleanor!"

"Mr. Lidgerwood will never consent, you mean," put in Miriam Holcombe quietly.

Lidgerwood said what he might without being too crudely inhospitable. His car was entirely
at the service of the president's party, of course, but it was not very commodious compared
with the Nadia. Moreover, he was going on a business trip, and at the end of it he would have
to leave them for an hour or two, or maybe longer. Moreover, again, if they got tired they
would have to sleep as they could, though possibly his state-room in the service-car might
be made to accommodate the three young women. All this he said, hoping and believing that Mrs.
Brewster would not only refuse to go herself but would promptly veto an unchaperoned excursion.

But this was one time when his distantly related kinswoman disappointed him. Mrs. Brewster,
cajoled by her daughter, yielded a reluctant consent, going to the car door to tell Lidgerwood
that she would hold him responsible for the safe return of the trippers.

"See, now, how fatally easy it is for one to promise more--oh, so very much more!--than one
has any idea of performing," murmured the president's daughter, dropping out to walk beside
the victim when the party trooped down the long platform of the Crow's Nest to the service-car.
And when he did not reply: "Please don't be grumpy."

"It was the maddest notion!" he protested. "Whatever made you suggest it?"

"More churlishness?" she said reproachfully. And then, with ironical sentiment: "There was
a time when you would have moved heaven and earth for a chance to take me somewhere with you,
Howard."

"To be with you; yes, that is true. But----"

Her rippling laugh was too sweet to be shrill; none the less it held in it a little flick of
the whip of malice.

"Listen," she said. "I did it out of pure hatefulness. You showed so plainly this afternoon
that you wished to be quit of me--of the entire party--that I couldn't resist the temptation
to pay you back with good, liberal interest. Possibly you will think twice before you snub
me again, Howard, dear."

Quickly he stopped and faced her. The others were a few steps in advance; were already boarding
the service-car.

"One word, Eleanor--and for Heaven's sake let us make it final. There are some things that
I can endure and some others that I cannot--will not. I love you; what you said to me the last
time we were together made no difference; nothing you can ever say will make any difference.
You must take that fact into consideration while you are here and we are obliged to meet."

"Well?" she said, and there was nothing in her tone to indicate that she felt more than a passing
interest in his declaration.

"That is all," he ended shortly. "I am, as I told you this afternoon, the same man that I was
a year ago last spring, as deeply infatuated and, unhappily, just as far below your ideal of
what your lover should be. In justice to me, in justice to Van Lew--"

"I think your conductor is waiting to speak to you," she broke in sweetly, and he gave it up,
putting her on the car and turning to confront the man with the green-shaded lantern who proved
to be Bradford.

"Any special orders, Mr. Lidgerwood?" inquired the reformed cattle-herder, looking stiff and
uncomfortable in his new service uniform--one of Lidgerwood's earliest requirements for men
on duty in the train service.

"Yes. Run without stop to Little Butte, unless the despatcher calls you down. Time yourself
to make Little Butte by eleven o'clock, or a little later. Who is on the engine?"

"Williams."

"Williams? How does it come that he is doubling out with me? He has just made the run over
the Desert Division with the president's car."

"So have I, for that matter," said Bradford calmly; "but we both got a hurry call about fifteen
minutes ago."

Lidgerwood held his watch to the light of the green-shaded lantern. If he meant to keep the
wire appointment with Flemister, there was no time to call out another crew.

"I don't like to ask you and Williams to double out of your turn, especially when I know of
no necessity for it. But I'm in a rush. Can you two stand it?"

"Sure," said the ex-cow-man. Then he ventured a word of his own. "I'll ride up ahead with Williams--you're
pretty full up, back here in the car, anyway--and then you'll know that two of your own men
are keepin' tab on the run. With the wrecks we're enjoying----"

Lidgerwood was impatient of mysteries.

"What do you mean, Andy?" he broke in. "Anything new?"

"Oh, nothing you could put your finger on. Same old rag-chewin' going on up at Cat Biggs's
and the other waterin' troughs about how you've got to be done up, if it costs money."

"That isn't new," objected Lidgerwood irritably.

"Tumble-weeds," said Bradford, "rollin' round over the short-grass. But they show which way
the wind's comin' from, and give you the jumps when you wouldn't have 'em natural. Williams
had a spell of 'em a few minutes ago when he went over to take the 266 out o' the roundhouse
and found one of the back-shop men down under her tinkerin' with her trucks."

"What's that?" was the sharp query.

"That's all there was to it," Bradford went on imperturbably. "Williams asked the shopman politely
what in hell he was doing under there, and the fellow crawled out and said he was just lookin'
her over to see if she was all right for the night run. Now, you wouldn't think there was any
tumble-weed in that to give a man the jumps, but Williams had 'em, all the same. Says he to
me, tellin' me about it just now: 'That's all right, Andy, but how in blue blazes did he, or
anybody else except Matthews and the caller, know that the 266 was goin' out? that's what I'd
like to know.' And I had to pass it up."

Lidgerwood asked a single question.

"Did Williams find that anything had been tampered with?"

"Nothing that you could shoot up the back-shop man for. One of the truck safety-chains--the
one on the left side, back--was loose. But it couldn't have hurt anything if it had been taken
off. We ain't runnin' on safety-chains these days."

"Safety-chain loose, you say?--so if the truck should jump and swing it would keep on swinging?
You tell Williams when you go up ahead that I want that machinist's name."

"H'm," said Bradford; "reckon it was meant to do that?"

"God only knows what isn't meant, these times, Andy. Hold on a minute before you give Williams
the word to go." Then he turned to young Jefferis, who had come out on the car platform to
light a cigarette. "Will you ask Miss Brewster to step out here for a moment?"

Eleanor came at the summons, and Jefferis gave the superintendent a clear field by dropping
off to ask Bradford for a match.

"You sent for me, Howard?" said the president's daughter, and honey could not have matched
her tone for sweetness.

"Yes. I shall have to anticipate the Angels gossips a little by telling you that we are in
the midst of a pretty bitter labor fight. That is why people go gunning for me. I can't take
you and your friends over the road to-night."

"Why not?" she inquired.

"Because it may not be entirely safe."

"Nonsense!" she flashed back. "What could happen to us on a little excursion like this?"

"I don't know, but I wish you would reconsider and go back to the Nadia."

"I shall do nothing of the sort," she said, wilfully. And then, with totally unnecessary cruelty,
she added: "Is it a return of the old malady? Are you afraid again, Howard?"

The taunt was too much. Wheeling suddenly, Lidgerwood snapped out a summons to Jefferis: "Get
aboard, Mr. Jefferis; we are going."

At the word Bradford ran forward, swinging his lantern, and a moment later the special train
shot away from the Crow's Nest platform and out over the yard switches, and began to bore its
way into the westward night.

XVI

THE SHADOWGRAPH

Forty-two miles south-west of Angels, at a point where all further progress seems definitely
barred by the huge barrier of the great mountain range, the Red Butte Western, having picked
its devious way to an apparent cul-de-sac among the foot-hills and hogbacks, plunges abruptly
into the echoing canyon of the Eastern Timanyoni.

For forty added miles the river chasm, throughout its length a narrow, tortuous crevice, with
sheer and towering cliffs for its walls, affords a precarious footing for the railway embankment,
leading the double line of steel with almost sentient reluctance, as it seems, through the
mighty mountain barrier. At its western extremity the canyon forms the gate-way to a shut-in
valley of upheaved hills and inferior mountains isolated by wide stretches of rolling grassland.
To the eastward and westward of the great valley rise the sentinel peaks of the two enclosing
mountain ranges; and across the shut-in area the river plunges from pool to pool, twisting
and turning as the craggy and densely forested lesser heights constrain it.

Red Butte, the centre of the evanescent mining excitement which was originally responsible
for the building of the railroad, lies high-pitched among the shouldering spurs of the western
boundary range. Seeking the route promising the fewest cuts and fills and the easiest grades,
Chandler, the construction chief of the building company, had followed the south bank of the
river to a point a short distance beyond the stream-fronting cliffs of the landmark hill known
as Little Butte; and at the station of the same name he had built his bridge across the Timanyoni
and swung his line in a great curve for the northward climb among the hogbacks to the gold-mining
district in which Red Butte was the principal camp.

Elsewhere than in a land of sky-piercing peaks and continent-cresting highlands, Little Butte
would have been called a true mountain. On the engineering maps of the Red Butte Western its
outline appears as a roughly described triangle with five-mile sides, the three angles of the
figure marked respectively by Silver Switch, Little Butte station and bridge, and the Wire-Silver
mine.

Between Silver Switch and the bridge station, the main line of the railroad follows the base
of the triangle, with the precipitous bluffs of the big hill on the left and the torrenting
flood of the Timanyoni on the right. Along the eastern side of the triangle, and leaving the
main track at Silver Switch, ran the spur which had formerly served the Wire-Silver when the
working opening of the mine had been on the eastern slope of the ridge-like hill. For some
years previous to the summer of overturnings this spur had been disused, though its track,
ending among a group of the old mine buildings five miles away, was still in commission.

Along the western side of the triangle, with Little Butte station for its point of divergence
from the main line, ran the new spur, built to accommodate Flemister after he had dug through
the hill, ousted the rightful owner of the true Wire-Silver vein, and had transferred his labor
hamlet and his plant--or the major part of both--to the western slope of the butte, at this
point no more than a narrow ridge separating the eastern and western gulches.

Train 205, with ex-engineer Judson apparently sound asleep in one of the rearward seats of
the day coach, was on time when it swung out of the lower canyon portal and raced around the
curves and down the grades in its crossing of Timanyoni Park. At Point-of-Rocks Judson came
awake sufficiently to put his face to the window, with a shading hand to cut off the car lights;
but having thus located the train's placement in the Park-crossing race, he put his knees up
against the back of the adjoining seat, pulled his cap over his eyes, and to all outward appearances
went to sleep again. Four or five miles farther along, however, there came a gentle grinding
of brake-shoes upon the chilled wheel-treads that aroused him quickly. Another flattening of
his nose against the window-pane showed him the familiar bulk of Little Butte looming black
in the moonlight, and a moment later he had let himself silently into the rear vestibule of
the day coach, and was as silently opening the folding doors of the vestibule itself.

Hanging off by the hand-rails, he saw the engine's headlight pick up the switch-stand of the
old spur. The train was unmistakably slowing now, and he made ready to jump if the need should
arise, picking his place at the track side as the train lights showed him the ground. As the
speed was checked, Judson saw what he was expecting to see. Precisely at the instant of the
switch passing, a man dropped from the forward step of the smoker and walked swiftly away up
the disused track of the old spur. Judson's turn came a moment later, and when his end of the
day coach flicked past the switch-stand he, too, dropped to the ground, and, waiting only until
he could follow without being detected, set out after the tall figure, which was by that time
scarcely more than an indistinct and retreating blur in the moonlight.

The chase led directly up the old spur, but it did not continue quite to the five-mile-distant
end of it. A few hundred yards short of the stockade enclosing the old buildings the shadowy
figure took to the forest and began to climb the ridge, going straight up, as nearly as Judson
could determine. The ex-engineer followed, still keeping his distance. From the first bench
above the valley level he looked back and down into the stockade enclosure. All of the old
buildings were dark, but one of the two new and unpainted ones was brilliantly lighted, and
there were sounds familiar enough to Judson to mark it as the Wire-Silver power-house. Notwithstanding
his interest in the chase, Judson was curious enough to stand a moment listening to the sharply
defined exhausts of the high-speeded steam-engine driving the generators.

"Say!" he ejaculated, under his breath, "if that engine ain't a dead match for the old 216
pullin' a grade, I don't want a cent! Double cylinder, set on the quarter, and choo-chooin'
like it ought to have a pair o' steel rails under it. If I had time I'd go down yonder and
break a winder in that power-shack; blamed if I wouldn't!"

But, unhappily, there was no time to spare; as it was, he had lingered too long, and when he
came out upon the crest of the narrow ridge and attained a point of view from which he could
look down upon the buildings clustering at the foot of the western slope, he had lost the scent.
The tall man had disappeared as completely and suddenly as if the earth had opened and swallowed
him.

This, in Judson's prefiguring, was a small matter. The tall man, whom the ex-engineer had unmistakably
recognized at the moment of train-forsaking as Rankin Hallock, was doubtless on his way to
Flemister's head-quarters at the foot of the western slope. Why he should take the roundabout
route up the old spur and across the mountain, when he might have gone on the train to Little
Butte station and so have saved the added distance and the hard climb, was a question which
Judson answered briefly: for some reason of his own, Hallock did not wish to be seen going
openly to the Wire-Silver head-quarters. Hence the drop from the train at Silver Switch and
the long tramp up the gulch and over the ridge.

Forecasting it thus, Judson lost no time on the summit of mysterious disappearances. Choosing
the shortest path he could find which promised to lead him down to the mining hamlet at the
foot of the westward-fronting slope, he set his feet in it and went stumbling down the steep
declivity, bringing up, finally, on a little bench just above the mine workings. Here he stopped
to get his breath and his bearings. From his halting-place the mine head-quarters building
lay just below him, at the right of the tunnel entrance to the mine. It was a long log building
of one story, with warehouse doors in the nearer gable and lighted windows to mark the location
of the offices at the opposite end.

Making a détour to dodge the electric-lighted tunnel mouth, Judson carefully reconnoitred the
office end of the head-quarters building. There was a door, with steps giving upon the down-hill
side, and there were two windows, both of which were blank to the eye by reason of the drawn-down
shades. Two persons, at least, were in the lighted room; Judson could hear their voices, but
the thick log walls muffled the sounds to an indistinct murmur. On the mountain-facing side
of the building, which was in shadow, the ex-engineer searched painstakingly for some open
chink or cranny between the logs, but there was no avenue of observation either for the eye
or the ear. Just as he had made up his mind to risk the moonlight on the other side of the
head-quarters, a sound like the moving of chairs on a bare floor made him dodge quickly behind
the bole of a great mountain pine which had been left standing at the back of the building.
The huge tree was directly opposite one of the windows, and when Judson looked again the figure
of a man sitting in a chair was sharply silhouetted on the drawn window-shade.

Judson stared, rubbed his eyes, and stared again. It had never occurred to him before that
the face of a man, viewed in blank profile, could differ so strikingly from the same face as
seen eye to eye. That the man whose shadow was projected upon the window-shade was Rankin Hallock,
he could not doubt. The bearded chin, the puffy lips, the prominent nose were all faithfully
outlined in the exaggerated shadowgraph. But the hat was worn at an unfamiliar angle, and there
was something in the erect, bulking figure that was still more unfamiliar. Judson backed away
and stared again, muttering to himself. If he had not traced Hallock almost to the door of
Flemister's quarters, there might have been room for the thin edge of the doubt wedge. The
unfamiliar pose and the rakish tilt of the soft hat were not among the chief clerk's remembered
characteristics; but making due allowance for the distortion of the magnified facial outline,
the profile was Hallock's.

Having definitely settled for himself the question of identity, Judson renewed his search for
some eavesdropping point of vantage. Risking the moonlight, he twice made the circuit of the
occupied end of the building. There was a line of light showing under the ill-fitting door,
and with the top step of the down-hill flight for a perching-place one might lay an ear to
the crack and overhear. But door and steps were sharply struck out in the moonlight, and they
faced the mining hamlet where the men of the day shift were still stirring.

Judson knew the temper of the Timanyoni miners. To be seen crouching on the boss's doorstep
would be to take the chance of making a target of himself for the first loiterer of the day
shift who happened to look his way. Dismissing the risky expedient, he made a third circuit
from moon-glare to shadow, this time upon hands and knees. To the lowly come the rewards of
humility. Framed level upon stout log pillars on the down-hill side, the head-quarters warehouse
and office sheltered a space beneath its floor which was roughly boarded up with slabs from
the log-sawing. Slab by slab the ex-engineer sought for his rat-hole, trying each one softly
in its turn. When there remained but three more to be tugged at, the loosened one was found.
Judson swung it cautiously aside and wriggled through the narrow aperture left by its removal.
A crawling minute later he was crouching beneath the loosely jointed floor of the lighted room,
and the avenue of the ear had broadened into a fair highway.

Almost at once he was able to verify his guess that there were only two men in the room above.
At all events, there were only two speakers. They were talking in low tones, and Judson had
no difficulty in identifying the rather high-pitched voice of the owner of the Wire-Silver
mine. The man whose profile he had seen on the window-shade had the voice which belonged to
the outlined features, but the listener under the floor had a vague impression that he was
trying to disguise it. Judson knew nothing about the letter in which Flemister had promised
to arrange for a meeting between Lidgerwood and the ranchman Grofield. What he did know was
that he had followed Hallock almost to the door of Flemister's office, and that he had seen
a shadowed face on the office window-shade which could be no other than the face of the chief
clerk. It was in spite of all this that the impression that the second speaker was trying to
disguise his voice persisted. But the ex-engineer of fast passenger-trains was able to banish
the impression after the first few minutes of eavesdropping.

Judson had scarcely found his breathing space between the floor timbers, and had not yet overheard
enough to give him the drift of the low-toned talk, when the bell of the private-line telephone
rang in the room above. It was Flemister who answered the bell-ringer.

"Hello! Yes; this is Flemister.... Yes, I say; this is Flemister; you're talking to him....
What's that?--a message about Mr. Lidgerwood?... All right; fire away."

"Who is it?" came the inquiry, in the grating voice which fitted, and yet did not fit, the
man whom Judson had followed from his boarding of the train at Angels to Silver Switch, and
from the gulch of the old spur to his disappearance on the wooded slope of Little Butte ridge.

The listener heard the click of the telephone ear-piece replacement.

"It's Goodloe, talking from his station office at Little Butte," replied the mine owner. "The
despatcher has just called him up to say that Lidgerwood left Angels in his service-car, running
special, at eight-forty, which would figure it here at about eleven, or a little later."

"Who is running it?" inquired the other man rather anxiously, Judson decided.

"Williams and Bradford. A fool for luck, every time. We might have had to écraser a couple
of our friends."

The French was beyond Judson, but the mine-owner's tone supplied the missing meaning, and the
listener under the floor had a sensation like that which might be produced by a cold wind blowing
up the nape of his neck.

"There is no such thing as luck," rasped the other voice. "My time was damned short--after
I found out that Lidgerwood wasn't coming on the passenger. But I managed to send word to Matthews
and Lester, telling them to make sure of Williams and Bradford. We could spare both of them,
if we have to."

"Good!" said Flemister. "Then you had some such alternative in mind as that I have just been
proposing?"

"No," was the crusty rejoinder. "I was merely providing for the hundredth chance. I don't like
your alternative."

"Why don't you?"

"Well, for one thing, it's needlessly bloody. We don't have to go at this thing like a bull
at a gate. I've had my finger on the pulse of things ever since Lidgerwood took hold. The dope
is working all right in a purely natural way. In the ordinary run of things, it will be only
a few days or weeks before Lidgerwood will throw up his hands and quit, and when he goes out,
I go in. That's straight goods this time."

"You thought it was before," sneered Flemister, "and you got beautifully left." Then: "You're
talking long on 'naturals' and the 'ordinary run of things,' but I notice you schemed with
Bart Rufford to put him out of the fight with a pistol bullet!"

Judson felt a sudden easing of strains. He had told McCloskey that he would be willing to swear
to the voice of the man whom he had overheard plotting with Rufford in Cat Biggs's back room.
Afterward, after he had sufficiently remembered that a whiskey certainty might easily lead
up to a sober perjury, he had admitted the possible doubt. But now Flemister's taunt made assurance
doubly sure. Moreover, the arch-plotter was not denying the fact of the conspiracy with "The
Killer."

"Rufford is a blood-thirsty devil--like yourself," the other man was saying calmly. "As I have
told you before, I've discovered Lidgerwood's weakness--he can't call a sudden bluff. Rufford's
play--the play I told him to make--was to get the drop on him, scare him up good, and chase
him out of town--out of the country. He overran his orders--and went to jail for it."

"Well?" said the mine-owner.

"Your scheme, as you outlined it to me in your cipher wire this afternoon, was built on this
same weakness of Lidgerwood's, and I agreed to it. As I understood it, you were to toll him
up here with some lie about meeting Grofield, and then one of us was to put a pistol in his
face and bluff him into throwing up his job. As I say, I agreed to it. He'll have to go when
the fight with the men gets hot enough; but he might hold on too long for our comfort."

"Well?" said Flemister again, this time more impatiently, Judson thought.

"He queered your lay-out by carefully omitting to come on the passenger, and now you propose
to fall back upon Rufford's method. I don't approve."

Again the mine-owner said "Why don't you?" and the other voice took up the question argumentatively.

"First, because it is unnecessary, as I have explained. Lidgerwood is officially dead, right
now. When the grievance committees tell him what has been decided upon, he will put on his
hat and go back to wherever it was that he came from."

"And secondly?" suggested Flemister, still with the nagging sneer in his tone.

There was a little pause, and Judson listened until the effort grew positively painful.

"The secondly is a weakness of mine, you'll say, Flemister. I want his job; partly because
it belongs to me, but chiefly because if I don't get it a bunch of us will wind up breaking
stone for the State. But I haven't anything against the man himself. He trusts me; he has defended
me when others have tried to put him wise; he has been damned white to me, Flemister."

"Is that all?" queried the mine-owner, in the tone of the prosecuting attorney who gives the
criminal his full length of the rope with which to hang himself.

"All of that part of it--and you are saying to yourself that it is a good deal more than enough.
Perhaps it is; but there is still another reason for thinking twice before burning all the
bridges behind us. Lidgerwood is Ford's man; if he throws up his job of his own accord, I may
be able to swing Ford into line to name me as his successor. On the other hand, if Lidgerwood
is snuffed out and there is the faintest suspicion of foul play.... Flemister, I'm telling
you right here and now that that man Ford will neither eat nor sleep until he has set the dogs
on us!"

There was another pause, and Judson shifted his weight cautiously from one elbow to the other.
Then Flemister began, without heat and equally without compunction. The ex-engineer shivered,
as if the measured words had been so many drops of ice-water dribbling through the cracks in
the floor to fall upon his spine.

"You say it is unnecessary; that Lidgerwood will be pushed out by the labor fight. My answer
to that is that you don't know him quite as well as you think you do. If he's allowed to live,
he'll stay--unless somebody takes him unawares and scares him off, as I meant to do to-night
when I wired you. If he continues to live, and stay, you know what will happen, sooner or later.
He'll find you out for the double-faced cur that you are--and after that, the fireworks."

At this the other voice took its turn at the savage sneering.

"You can't put it all over me that way, Flemister; you can't, and, by God, you sha'n't! You're
in the hole just as deep as I am, foot for foot!"

"Oh, no, my friend," said the cooler voice. "I haven't been stealing in car-load lots from
the company that hires me; I have merely been buying a little disused scrap from you. You may
say that I have planned a few of the adverse happenings which have been running the loss-and-damage
account of the road up into the pictures during the past few weeks--possibly I have; but you
are the man who has been carrying out the plans, and you are the man the courts will recognize.
But we're wasting time sitting here jawing at each other like a pair of old women. It's up
to us to obliterate Lidgerwood; after which it will be up to you to get his job and cover up
your tracks as you can. If he lives, he'll dig; and if he digs, he'll turn up things that neither
of us can stand for. See how he hangs onto that building-and-loan ghost. He'll tree somebody
on that before he's through, you mark my words! And it runs in my mind that the somebody will
be you."

"But this trap scheme of yours," protested the other man; "it's a frost, I tell you! You say
the night passenger from Red Butte is late. I know it's late, now; but Cranford's running it,
and it is all down-hill from Red Butte to the bridge. Cranford will make up his thirty minutes,
and that will put his train right here in the thick of things. Call it off for to-night, Flemister.
Meet Lidgerwood when he comes and tell him an easy lie about your not being able to hold Grofield
for the right-of-way talk."

Judson heard the creak and snap of a swing-chair suddenly righted, and the floor dust jarred
through the cracks upon him when the mine-owner sprang to his feet.

"Call it off and let you drop out of it? Not by a thousand miles, my cautious friend! Want
to stay here and keep your feet warm while I go and do it? Not on your tintype, you yapping
hound! I'm about ready to freeze you, anyway, for the second time--mark that, will you?--for
the second time. No, keep your hands where I can see 'em, or I'll knife you right where you
sit! You can bully and browbeat a lot of railroad buckies when you're playing the boss act,
but I know you! You come with me or I'll give the whole snap away to Vice-President Ford. I'll
tell him how you built a street of houses in Red Butte out of company material and with company
labor. I'll prove to him that you've scrapped first one thing and then another--condemned them
so you might sell them for your own pocket. I'll----"

"Shut up!" shouted the other man hoarsely. And then, after a moment that Judson felt was crammed
to the bursting point with murderous possibilities: "Get your tools and come on. We'll see
who's got the yellows before we're through with this!"

XVII

THE DIPSOMANIAC

There are moments when the primal instincts assert themselves with a sort of blind ferocity,
and to Judson, jammed under the floor timbers of Flemister's head-quarters office, came one
of these moments when he heard the two men in the room above moving to depart, and found himself
caught between the timbers so that he could not retreat.

What had happened he was unable, in the first fierce struggle for freedom, fully to determine.
It was as if a living hand had reached down to pin him fast in the tunnel-like space. Then
he discovered that a huge splinter on one of the joists was thrust like a great barb into his
coat. Ordinarily cool and collected in the face of emergencies, the ex-engineer lost his head
for a second or so and fought like a trapped animal. Then the frenzy fit passed and the quick
wit reasserted itself. Extending his arms over his head and digging his toes into the dry earth
for a purchase, he backed, crab-wise, out of the entangled coat, freed the coat, and made for
the narrow exit in a sweating panic of excitement.

Notwithstanding the excitement, however, the recovered wit was taking note of the movements
of the men who were leaving the room overhead. They were not going out by the direct way--out
of the door facing the moonlight and the mining hamlet. They were passing out through the store-room
in the rear. Also, there were other foot-falls--cautious treadings, these--as of some third
person hastening to be first at the more distant door of egress.

Judson was out of his dodge-hole and flitting from pine to pine on the upper hill-side in time
to see a man leap from the loading platform at the warehouse end of the building and run for
the sheltering shadows of the timbering at the mine entrance. Following closely upon the heels
of their mysterious file leader came the two whose footsteps Judson had been timing, and these,
too, crossed quickly to the tunnel mouth of the mine and disappeared within it.

Judson pursued swiftly and without a moment's hesitation. Happily for him, the tunnel was lighted
at intervals by electric incandescents, their tiny filaments glowing mistily against the wet
and glistening tunnel roof. Going softly, he caught a glimpse of the two men as they passed
under one of the lights in the receding tunnel depths, and a moment later he could have sworn
that a third, doubtless the man who had leaped from the loading platform to run and hide in
the shadows at the mine mouth, passed the same light, going in the same direction.

A hundred yards deeper into the mountain there was a confirming repetition of the flash-light
picture for the ex-engineer. The two men, walking rapidly now, one a step in advance of the
other, passed under another of the overhead light bulbs, and this time Judson, watching for
the third man, saw him quite plainly. The sight gave him a start. The third man was tall, and
he wore a soft hat drawn low over his face.

"Well, I'll be jiggered!" muttered the trailer, pulling his cap down to his ears and quickening
his pace. "If I didn't know better, I'd swear that was Hallock again--or Hallock's shadder
follerin' him at a good long range!"

The chase was growing decidedly mysterious. The two men in the lead could be no others than
Flemister and the chief clerk, presumably on their way to the carrying out of whatever plot
they had agreed upon, with Lidgerwood for the potential victim. But since this plot evidently
turned upon the nearing approach of Lidgerwood's special train, why were they plunging on blindly
into the labyrinthine depths of the Wire-Silver mine? This was an even half of the mystery,
and the other half was quite as puzzling. Who was the third man? Was he a confederate in the
plot, or was he also following to spy upon the conspirators?

Judson was puzzled, but he did not let his bewilderment tangle the feet of his principal purpose,
which was to keep Flemister and his reluctant accomplice in sight. This purpose was presently
defeated in a most singular manner. At the end of one of the longer tunnel levels, a black
and dripping cavern, lighted only by a single incandescent shining like a star imprisoned in
the dismal depths, the ex-engineer saw what appeared to be a wooden bulkhead built across the
passage and effectively blocking it. When the two men came to this bulkhead they passed through
it and disappeared, and the shock of the confined air in the tunnel told of a door slammed
behind them.

Judson broke into a stumbling run, and then stopped short in increasing bewilderment. At the
slamming of the door the third man had darted forward out of the shadows to fling himself upon
the wooden barrier, beating upon it with his fists and cursing like a madman. Judson saw, understood,
and acted, all with the instinctive instantaneousness born of his trade of engine-driving.
The two men in advance were merely taking the short cut through the mountain to the old workings
on the eastern slope, and the door in the bulkhead, which was doubtless one of the airlocks
in the ventilating system of the mine, had fastened itself automatically after Flemister had
released it.

Judson was a hundred yards down the tunnel, racing like a trained sprinter for the western
exit, before he thought to ask himself why the third man was playing the madman before the
locked door. But that was a matter negligible to him; his affair was to get out of the mine
with the loss of the fewest possible seconds of time--to win out, to climb the ridge, and to
descend the eastern slope to the old workings before the two plotters should disappear beyond
the hope of rediscovery.

He did his best, flying down the long tunnel reaches with little regard for the precarious
footing, tripping over the cross-ties of the miniature tramway and colliding with the walls,
now and then, between the widely separated electric bulbs. Far below, in the deeper levels,
he could hear the drumming chatter of the power-drills and the purring of the compressed air,
but the upper gangway was deserted, and it was not until he was stumbling through the timbered
portal that a watchman rose up out of the shadows to confront and halt him. There was no time
to spare for soft words or skilful evasions. With a savage upper-cut that caught the watchman
on the point of the jaw and sent him crashing among the picks and shovels of the mine-mouth
tool-room, Judson darted out into the moonlight. But as yet the fierce race was only fairly
begun. Without stopping to look for a path, the ex-engineer flung himself at the steep hill-side,
running, falling, clambering on hands and knees, bursting by main strength through the tangled
thickets of young pines, and hurling himself blindly over loose-lying bowlders and the trunks
of fallen trees. When, after what seemed like an eternity of lung-bursting struggles, he came
out upon the bare summit of the ridge, his tongue was like a dry stick in his mouth, refusing
to shape the curses that his soul was heaping upon the alcohol which had made him a wind-broken,
gasping weakling in the prime of his manhood.

For, after all the agonizing strivings, he was too late. It was a rough quarter-mile down to
the shadowy group of buildings whence the humming of the dynamo and the quick exhausts of the
high-speeded steam-engine rose on the still night air. Judson knew that the last lap was not
in his trembling muscles or in the thumping heart and the wind-broken lungs. Moreover, the
path, if any there were, was either to the right or the left of the point to which he had attained;
fronting him there was a steep cliff, trifling enough as to real heights and depths, but an
all-sufficient barrier for a spent runner.

The ex-engineer crawled cautiously to the edge of the barrier cliff, rubbed the sweat out of
his smarting eyes, and peered down into the half-lighted shadows of the stockaded enclosure.
It was not very long before he made them out--two indistinct figures moving about among the
disused and dilapidated ore sheds clustering at the track end of the old spur. Now and again
a light glowed for an instant and died out, like the momentary brilliance of a gigantic fire-fly,
by which the watcher on the cliff's summit knew that the two were guiding their movements by
the help of an electric flash-lamp.

What they were doing did not long remain a mystery. Judson heard a distance-diminished sound,
like the grinding of rusty wheels upon iron rails, and presently a shadowy thing glided out
of one of the ore sheds and took its place upon the track of the old spur. Followed a series
of clankings still more familiar to the watcher--the ting of metal upon metal, as of crow-bars
and other tools cast carelessly, one upon the other, in the loading of the shadowy vehicle.
Making a telescope of his hands to shut out the glare from the lighted windows of the power-house,
Judson could dimly discern the two figures mounting to their places on the deck of the thing
which he now knew to be a hand-car. A moment later, to the musical click-click of wheels passing
over rail-joints, the little car shot through the gate-way in the stockade and sped away down
the spur, the two indistinct figures bowing alternately to each other like a pair of grotesque
automatons.

Winded and leg-weary as he was, Judson's first impulse prompted him to seek for the path to
the end that he might dash down the hill and give chase. But if he would have yielded, another
pursuer was before him to show him the futility of that expedient. While the clicking of the
hand-car wheels was still faintly audible, a man--the door-hammering madman, Judson thought
it must be--materialized suddenly from somewhere in the under-shadows to run down the track
after the disappearing conspirators. The engineer saw the racing foot-pursuer left behind so
quickly that his own hope of overtaking the car died almost before it had taken shape.

"That puts it up to me again," he groaned, rising stiffly. Then he faced once more toward the
western valley and the point of the great triangle, where the lights of Little Butte station
and bridge twinkled uncertainly in the distance. "If I can get down yonder to Goodloe's wire
in time to catch the super's special before it passes Timanyoni"--he went on, only to drop
his jaw and gasp when he held the face of his watch up to the moonlight. Then, brokenly, "My
God! I couldn't begin to do it unless I had wings: he said eleven o'clock, and it's ten-ten
right now!"

There was the beginning of a frenzied outburst of despairing curses upbubbling to Judson's
lips when he realized his utter helplessness and the consequences menacing the superintendent's
special. True, he did not know what the consequences were to be, but he had overheard enough
to be sure that Lidgerwood's life was threatened. Then, at the climax of despairing helplessness
he remembered that there was a telephone in the mine-owner's office--a telephone that connected
with Goodloe's station at Little Butte. Here was a last slender chance of getting a warning
to Goodloe, and through him, by means of the railroad wire, to the superintendent's special.
Instantly Judson forgot his weariness, and raced away down the western slope of the mountain,
prepared to fight his way to the telephone if the entire night shift of the Wire-Silver should
try to stop him.

It cost ten of the precious fifty minutes to retrace his steps down the mountain-side, and
five more, were lost in dodging the mine watchman, who, having recovered from the effects of
Judson's savage blow, was prowling about the mine buildings, revolver in hand, in search of
his mysterious assailant. After the watchman was out of the way, five other minutes went to
the cautious prying open of the window least likely to attract attention--the window upon whose
drawn shade the convincing profile had been projected. Judson's lips were dry and his hands
were shaking again when he crept through the opening, and dropped into the unfamiliar interior,
where the darkness was but thinly diluted by the moonlight filtering through the small, dingy
squares of the opposite window. To have the courage of a house-breaker, one must be a burglar
in fact; and the ex-engineer knew how swiftly and certainly he would pay the penalty if any
one had seen him climbing in at the forced window, or should chance to discover him now that
he was in.

But there was a stronger motive than fear, fear for himself, to set him groping for the telephone.
The precious minutes were flying, and he knew that by this time the two men on the hand-car
must have reached the main line at Silver Switch. Whatever helpful chain of events might be
set in motion by communicating with Goodloe, must be linked up quickly.

He found the telephone without difficulty. It was an old-fashioned set, with a crank and bell
for ringing up the call at the other end of the line. A single turn of the crank told him that
it was cut off somewhere, doubtless by a switch in the office wiring. In a fresh fever of excitement
he began a search for the switch, tracing with his fingers the wires which led from the instrument
and following where they ran around the end of the room on the wainscoting. In the corner farthest
from his window of ingress he found the switch and felt it out. It was a simple cut-out, designed
to connect either the office instrument or the mine telephones with the main wire, as might
be desired. Under the switch stood a corner cupboard, and in feeling for the wire connections
on top of the cupboard, Judson found his fingers running lightly over the bounding surfaces
of an object with which he was, unhappily, only too familiar--a long-necked bottle with the
seal blown in the glass. The corner cupboard was evidently Flemister's sideboard.

Almost before he knew what he was doing, Judson had grasped the bottle and had removed the
cork. Here was renewed strength and courage, and a swift clearing of the brain, to be had for
the taking. At the drawing of the cork the fine bouquet of the liquor seemed instantly to fill
the room with its subtle and intoxicating essence. With the smell of the whiskey in his nostrils
he had the bottle half-way to his lips before he realized that the demon of appetite had sprung
upon him out of the darkness, taking him naked and unawares. Twice he put the bottle down,
only to take it up again. His lips were parched; his tongue rattled in his mouth, and within
there were cravings like the fires of hell, threatening torments unutterable if they should
not be assuaged.

"God have mercy!" he mumbled, and then, in a voice which the rising fires had scorched to a
hoarse whisper: "If I drink, I'm damned to all eternity; and if I don't take just one swallow,
I'll never be able to talk so as to make Goodloe understand me!"

It was the supreme test of the man. Somewhere, deep down in the soul-abyss of the tempted one,
a thing stirred, took shape, and arose to help him to fight the devil of appetite. Slowly the
fierce thirst burned itself out. The invisible hand at his throat relaxed its cruel grip, and
a fine dew of perspiration broke out thickly on his forehead. At the sweating instant the newly
arisen soul-captain within him whispered, "Now, John Judson--once for all!" and staggering
to the open window he flung the tempting bottle afar among the scattered bowlders, waiting
until he had heard the tinkling crash of broken glass before he turned back to his appointed task.

His hands were no longer trembling when he once more wound the crank of the telephone and held
the receiver to his ear. There was an answering skirl of the bell, and then a voice said: "Hello!
This is Goodloe: what's wanted?"

Judson wasted no time in explanations. "This is Judson--John Judson. Get Timanyoni on your
wire, quick, and catch Mr. Lidgerwood's special. Tell Bradford and Williams to run slow, looking
for trouble. Do you get that?"

A confused medley of rumblings and clankings crashed in over the wire, and in the midst of
the interruption Judson heard Goodloe put down the receiver. In a flash he knew what was happening
at Little Butte station. The delayed passenger-train from the west had arrived, and the agent
was obliged to break off and attend to his duties.

Anxiously Judson twirled the crank, again and yet again. Since Goodloe had not cut off the
connection, the mingled clamor of the station came to the listening ear; the incessant clicking
of the telegraph instruments on Goodloe's table, the trundling roar of a baggage-truck on the
station platform, the cacophonous screech of the passenger-engine's pop-valve. With the phut
of the closing safety-valve came the conductor's cry of "All aboard!" and then the long-drawn
sobs of the big engine as Cranford started the train. Judson knew that in all human probability
the superintendent's special had already passed Timanyoni, the last chance for a telegraphic
warning; and here was the passenger slipping away, also without warning.

Goodloe came back to the telephone when the train clatter had died away, and took up the broken
conversation.

"Are you there yet, John?" he called. And when Judson's yelp answered him: "All right; now,
what was it you were trying to tell me about the special?"

Judson did not swear; the seconds were too vitally precious. He merely repeated his warning,
with a hoarse prayer for haste.

There was another pause, a break in the clicking of Goodloe's telegraph instruments, and then
the agent's voice came back over the wire: "Can't reach the special. It passed Timanyoni ten
minutes ago."

Judson's heart was in his mouth, and he had to swallow twice before he could go on.

"Where does it meet the passenger?" he demanded.

"You can search me," replied the Little Butte agent, who was not of those who go out of their
way to borrow trouble. Then, suddenly: "Hold the 'phone a minute; the despatcher's calling
me, right now."

There was a third trying interval of waiting for the man in the darkened room at the Wire-Silver
head-quarters; an interval shot through with pricklings of feverish impatience, mingled with
a lively sense of the risk he was running; and then Goodloe called again.

"Trouble," he said shortly. "Angels didn't know that Cranford had made up so much time. Now
he tries to give me an order to hold the passenger--after it's gone by. So long. I'm going
to take a lantern and mog along up the track to see where they come together."

Judson hung up the receiver, reset the wire switch to leave it as he had found it, climbed
out through the open window and replaced the sash; all this methodically, as one who sets the
death chamber in order after the sheet has been drawn over the face of the corpse. Then he
stumbled down the hill to the gulch bottom and started out to walk along the new spur toward
Little Butte station, limping painfully and feeling mechanically in his pocket for his pipe,
which had apparently been lost in some one of the many swift and strenuous scene-shiftings.

XVIII

AT SILVER SWITCH

Like that of other railroad officials, whose duties constrain them to spend much time in transit,
Lidgerwood's desk-work went with him up and down and around and about on the two divisions,
and before leaving his office in the Crow's Nest to go down to the waiting special, he had
thrust a bunch of letters and papers into his pocket to be ground through the business-mill
on the run to Little Butte.

It was his surreptitious transference of the rubber-banded bunch of letters to the oblivion
of the closed service-car desk, observed by Miss Brewster, that gave the president's daughter
an opportunity to make partial amends for having turned his business trip into a car-party.
Before the special was well out of the Angels yard she was commanding silence, and laying down
the law for the others, particularizing Carolyn Doty, though only by way of a transfixing eye.

"Listen a moment, all of you," she called. "We mustn't forget that this isn't a planned excursion
for us; it's a business trip for Mr. Lidgerwood, and we are here by our own invitation. We
must make ourselves small, accordingly, and not bother him. Savez vous?"

Van Lew laughed, spread his long arms, and swept them all out toward the rear platform. But
Miss Eleanor escaped at the door and went back to Lidgerwood.

"There, now!" she whispered, "don't ever say that I can't do the really handsome thing when
I try. Can you manage to work at all, with these chatterers on the car?"

She was steadying herself against the swing of the car, with one shapely hand on the edge of
the desk, and he covered it with one of his own.

"Yes, I can work," he asserted. "The one thing impossible is not to love you, Eleanor. It's
hard enough when you are unkind; you mustn't make it harder by being what you used always to
be to me."

"What a lover you are when you forget to be self-conscious!" she said softly; none the less
she freed the imprisoned hand with a hasty little jerk. Then she went on with playful austerity:
"Now you are to do exactly what you were meaning to do when you didn't know we were coming
with you. I'll make them all stay away from you just as long as I can."

She kept her promise so well that for an industrious hour Lidgerwood scarcely realized that
he was not alone. For the greater part of the interval the sight-seers were out on the rear
platform, listening to Miss Brewster's stories of the Red Desert. When she had repeated all
she had ever heard, she began to invent; and she was in the midst of one of the most blood-curdling
of the inventions when Lidgerwood, having worked through his bunch of papers, opened the door
and joined the platform party. Miss Brewster's animation died out and her voice trailed away
into--"and that's all; I don't know the rest of it."

Lidgerwood's laugh was as hearty as Van Lew's or the collegian's.

"Please go on," he teased. Then quoting her: "'And after they had shot up all the peaceable
people in the town, they fell to killing each other, and'--Don't let me spoil the dramatic
conclusion."

"You are the dramatic conclusion to that story," retorted Miss Brewster, reproachfully. Whereupon
she immediately wrenched the conversation aside into a new channel by asking how far it was
to the canyon portal.

"Only a mile or two now," was Lidgerwood's rejoinder. "Williams has been making good time."
And two minutes later the one-car train, with the foaming torrent of the Timanyoni for its
pathfinder, plunged between the narrow walls of the upper canyon, and the race down the grade
of the crooked water-trail through the heart of the mountains began.

There was little chance for speech, even if the overawing grandeurs of the stupendous crevice,
seen in their most impressive presentment as alternating vistas of stark, moonlighted crags
and gulches and depths of blackest shadow, had encouraged it. The hiss and whistle of the air-brakes,
the harsh, sustained note of the shrieking wheel-flanges shearing the inner edges of the railheads
on the curves, and the stuttering roar of the 266's safety-valve were continuous; a deafening
medley of sounds multiplied a hundred-fold by the demoniac laughter of the echoes.

Miss Carolyn clung to the platform hand-rail, and once Lidgerwood thought he surprised Van
Lew with his arm about her; thought it, and immediately concluded that he was mistaken. Miriam
Holcombe had the opposite corner of the platform, and Jefferis was making it his business to
see to it that she was not entirely crushed by the grandeurs.

Miss Brewster, steadying herself by the knob of the closed door, was not overawed; she had
seen Rocky Mountain canyons at their best and their worst, many times before. But excitement,
and the relaxing of the conventional leash that accompanies it, roused the spirit of daring
mockery which was never wholly beyond call in Miss Brewster's mental processes. With her lips
to Lidgerwood's ear she said: "Tell me, Howard; how soon should a chaperon begin to make a
diversion? I'm only an apprentice, you know. Does it occur to you that these young persons
need to be shocked into a better appreciation of the conventions?"

There was a small Pintsch globe in the hollow of the "umbrella roof," with its single burner
turned down to a mere pea of light. Lidgerwood's answer was to reach up and flood the platform
with a sudden glow of artificial radiance. The chorus of protest was immediate and reproachful.

"Oh, Mr. Lidgerwood! don't spoil the perfect moonlight that way!" cried Miss Doty, and the
others echoed the beseeching.

"You'll get used to it in a minute," asserted Lidgerwood, in good-natured sarcasm. "It is so
dark here in the canyon that I'm afraid some of you might fall overboard or get hit by the
rocks, or something."

"The idea!" scoffed Miss Carolyn. Then, petulantly, to Van Lew: "We may as well go in. There
is nothing more to be seen out here."

Lidgerwood looked to Eleanor for his cue, or at least for a whiff of moral support. But she
turned traitor.

"You can do the meanest things in the name of solicitude, Howard," she began; but before she
could finish he had reached up and turned the gas off with a snap, saying, "All right; anything
to please the children." After which, however, he spoke authoritatively to Van Lew and Jefferis.
"Don't let your responsibilities lean out over the railing, you two. There are places below
here where the rocks barely give a train room to pass."

"I'm not leaning out," said Miss Brewster, as if she resented his care-taking. Then, for his
ear alone: "But I shall if I want to."

"Not while I am here to prevent you."

"But you couldn't prevent me, you know."

"Yes, I could."

"How?"

The special was rushing through the darkest of the high-walled clefts in the lower part of
the canyon. "This way," he said, his love suddenly breaking bounds, and he took her in his arms.

She freed herself quickly, breathless and indignantly reproachful.

"I am ashamed for you!" she panted. And then, with carefully calculated malice: "What if Herbert
had been looking?"

"I shouldn't care if all the world had been looking," was the stubborn rejoinder. Then, passionately:
"Tell me one thing before we go any farther, Eleanor: have you given him the right to call me out?"

"How can you doubt it?" she said; but now she was laughing at him again.

There was safety only in flight, and he fled; back to his desk and the work thereon. He was
wading dismally through a thick mass of correspondence, relating to a cattleman's claim for
stock killed, and thinking of nothing so little as the type-written words, when the roar of
the echoing canyon walls died away, and the train came to a stand at Timanyoni, the first telegraph
station in the shut-in valley between the mountain ranges. A minute or two later the wheels
began to revolve again, and Bradford came in.

"More maverick railroading," he said disgustedly. "Timanyoni had his red light out, and when
I asked for orders he said he hadn't any--thought maybe we'd want to ask for 'em ourselves,
being as we was running wild."

"So he thoughtfully stopped us to give us the chance!" snapped Lidgerwood in wrathful scorn.
"What did you do?"

"Oh, as long as he had done it, I had him call up the Angels despatcher to find out where we
were at. We're on 204's time, you know--ought to have met her here."

"Why didn't we?" asked the superintendent, taking the time-card from its pigeon-hole and glancing
at Train 204's schedule.

"She was late out of Red Butte; broke something and had to stop and tie it up; lost a half-hour
makin' her get-away."

"Then we reach Little Butte before 204 gets there--is that it?"

"That's about the way the night despatcher has it ciphered out. He gave the Timanyoni plug
operator hot stuff for holdin' us up."

Lidgerwood shook his head. The artless simplicity of Red-Butte-Western methods, or unmethods,
was dying hard, inexcusably hard.

"Does the night despatcher happen to know just where 204 is, at this present moment?" he inquired
with gentle irony.

Bradford laughed.

"I'd be willing to bet a piebald pinto against a no-account yaller dog that he don't. But I
reckon he won't be likely to let her get past Little Butte, comin' this way, when he has let
us get by Timanyoni goin' t'other way."

"That's all right, Andy; that is the way you would have a right to figure it out if you were
running a special on a normally healthy railroad--you'd be justified in running to your next
telegraph station, regardless. But the Red Butte Western is an abnormally unhealthy railroad,
and you'd better feel your way--pretty carefully, too. From Point-of-Rocks you can see well
down toward Little Butte. Tell Williams to watch for 204's headlight, and if he sees it, to
take the siding at Silver Switch, the old Wire-Silver spur."

Bradford nodded, and when Lidgerwood reimmersed himself in the cattleman's claim papers, went
forward to share Williams's watch in the cab of the 266.

Twenty minutes farther on, the train slowed again, made a momentary stop, and began to screech
and grind heavily around a sharp curve. Lidgerwood looked out of the window at his right. The
moon had gone behind a huge hill, a lantern was pricking a point in the shadows some little
distance from the track, and the tumultuous river was no longer sweeping parallel with the
embankment. He shut his desk and went to the rear platform, projecting himself into the group
of sight-seers just as the train stopped for the second time.

"Where are we now?" asked Miss Brewster, looking up at the dark mass of the hill whose forested
ramparts loomed black in the near foreground.

"At Silver Switch," replied Lidgerwood; and when the bobbing lantern came nearer he called
to the bearer of it. "What is it, Bradford?"

"The passenger, I reckon," was the answer. "Williams thought he saw it as we came around Point-o'-Rocks,
and he was afraid the despatcher had got balled up some and let 'em get past Little Butte without
a meet-order."

For a moment the group on the railed platform was silent, and in the little interval a low,
humming sound made itself felt rather than heard; a shuddering murmur, coming from all points
of the compass at once, as it seemed, and filling the still night air with its vibrations.

"Williams was right!" rejoined the superintended sharply. "She's coming!" And even as he spoke,
the white glare of an electric headlight burst into full view on the shelf-like cutting along
the northern face of the great hill, pricking out the smallest details of the waiting special,
the closed switch, and the gleaming lines of the rails.

With this powerful spot-light to project its cone of dazzling brilliance upon the scene, the
watchers on the railed platform of the superintendent's service-car saw every detail in the
swift outworking of the tragic spectacle for which the hill-facing curve was the stage-setting.

When the oncoming passenger-train was within three or four hundred yards of the spur track
switch and racing toward it at full speed, a man, who seemed to the onlookers to rise up out
of the ground in the train's path, ran down the track to meet the uprushing headlight, waving
his arms frantically in the stop signal. For an instant that seemed an age, the passenger engineer
made no sign. Then came a short, sharp whistle-scream, a spewing of sparks from rail-head and
tire at the clip of the emergency brakes, a crash as of the ripping asunder of the mechanical
soul and body, and a wrecked train lay tilted at an angle of forty-five degrees against the
bank of the hill-side cutting.

It was a moment for action rather than for words, and when he cleared the platform hand-rail
and dropped, running, Lidgerwood was only the fraction of a second ahead of Van Lew and Jefferis.
With Bradford swinging his lantern for Williams and his fireman to come on, the four men were
at the wreck before the cries of fright and agony had broken out upon the awful stillness following
the crash.

There was quick work and heart-breaking to be done, and, for the first few critical minutes,
a terrible lack of hands to do it. Cranford, the engineer, was still in his cab, pinned down
by the coal which had shifted forward at the shock of the sudden stop. In the wreck of the
tender, the iron-work of which was rammed into shapeless crumplings by the upreared trucks
of the baggage-car, lay the fireman, past human help, as a hasty side-swing of Bradford's lantern
showed.

The baggage-car, riding high upon the crushed tender, was body-whole, but the smoker, day-coach,
and sleeper were all more or less shattered, with the smoking-car already beginning to blaze
from the broken lamps. It was a crisis to call out the best in any gift of leadership, and
Lidgerwood's genius for swift and effective organization came out strong under the hammer-blow
of the occasion.

"Stay here with Bradford and Jefferis, and get that engineer out!" he called to Van Lew. Then,
with arms outspread, he charged down upon the train's company, escaping as it could through
the broken windows of the cars. "This way, every man of you!" he yelled, his shout dominating
the clamor of cries, crashing glass, and hissing steam. "The fire's what we've got to fight!
Line up down to the river, and pass water in anything you can get hold of! Here, Groner"--to
the train conductor, who was picking himself up out of the ditch into which the shock had thrown
him--"send somebody to the Pullman for blankets. Jump for it, man, before this fire gets headway!"

Luckily, there were by this time plenty of willing hands to help. The Timanyoni is a man's
country, and there were few women in the train's passenger list. Quickly a line was formed
to the near-by margin of the river, and water, in hats, in buckets improvised out of pieces
of tin torn from the wrecked car-roofs, in saturated coats, cushion covers, and Pullman blankets,
hissed upon the fire, beat it down, and presently extinguished it.

Then the work of extricating the imprisoned ones began, light for it being obtained by the
backing of Williams's engine to the main line above the switch so that the headlight played
upon the scene.

Lidgerwood was fairly in the thick of the rescue work when Miss Brewster, walking down the
track from the service-car and bringing the two young women who were afraid to be left behind,
launched herself and her companions into the midst of the nerve-racking horror.

"Give us something to do," she commanded, when he would have sent them back; and he changed
his mind and set them at work binding up wounds and caring for the injured quite as if they
had been trained nurses sent from heaven at the opportune moment.

In a very little time the length and breadth of the disaster were fully known, and its consequences
alleviated, so far as they might be with the means at hand. There were three killed outright
in the smoker, two in the half-filled day-coach, and none in the sleeper; six in all, including
the fireman pinned beneath the wreck of the tender. Cranford, the engineer, was dug out of
his coal-covered grave by Van Lew and Jefferis, badly burned and bruised, but still living;
and there were a score of other woundings, more or less dreadful.

Red Butte was the nearest point from which a relief-train could be sent, and Lidgerwood promptly
cut the telegraph wire, connected his pocket set of instruments, and sent in the call for help.
That done he transferred the pocket relay to the other end of the cut wire, and called up the
night despatcher at Angels. Fortunately, McCloskey and Dawson were just in with the two wrecking-trains
from the Crosswater Hills, and the superintendent ordered Dawson to come out immediately with
his train and a fresh crew, if it could be obtained.

Dawson took the wire and replied in person. His crew was good for another tussle, he said,
and his train was still in readiness. He would start west at once, or the moment the despatcher
could clear for him, and would be at Silver Switch as soon as the intervening miles would permit.

Eleanor Brewster and her guests were grouped beside Lidgerwood when he disconnected the pocket
set from the cut wire, and temporarily repaired the break. The service-car had been turned
into a make-shift hospital for the wounded, and the car-party was homeless.

"We are all waiting to say how sorry we are that we insisted on coming and thus adding to your
responsibilities, Howard," said the president's daughter, and now there was no trace of mockery
in her voice.

His answer was entirely sympathetic and grateful.

"I'm only sorry that you have been obliged to see and take part in such a frightful horror,
that's all. As for your being in the way--it's quite the other thing. Cranford owes his life
to Mr. Van Lew and Jefferis; and as for you three," including Eleanor and the two young women,
"your work is beyond any praise of mine. I'm anxious now merely because I don't know what to
do with you while we wait for the relief-train to come."

"Ignore us completely," said Eleanor promptly. "We are going over to that little level place
by the side-track and make us a camp-fire. We were just waiting to be comfortably forgiven
for having burdened you with a pleasure party at such a time."

"We couldn't foresee this, any of us," he made haste to say. "Now, if you'll do what you suggested--go
and build a fire to wait by?--I hope it won't be very long."

Freed of the more crushing responsibilities, Lidgerwood found Bradford and Groner, and with
the two conductors went down the track to the point of derailment to make the technical investigation
of causes.

Ordinarily, the mere fact of a destructive derailment leaves little to be discovered when the
cause is sought afterward. But, singularly enough, the curved track was torn up only on the
side toward the hill; the outer rail was still in place, and the cross-ties, deeply bedded
in the hard gravel of the cutting, showed only the surface mutilation of the grinding wheels.

"Broken flange under the 215, I'll bet," said Groner, holding his lantern down to the gashed
ties. But Bradford denied it.

"No," he contradicted: "Cranford was able to talk a little after we toted him back to the service-car.
He says it was a broken rail; says he saw it and saw the man that was flaggin' him down, all
in good time to give her the air before he hit it."

"What man was that?" asked Groner, whose point of view had not been that of an onlooker.

Lidgerwood answered for himself and Bradford.

"That is one of the things we'd like to know, Groner. Just before the smash a man, whom none
of us recognized, ran down the track and tried to give Cranford the stop signal."

They had been walking on down the line, looking for the actual point of derailment. When it
was found, it proved Cranford's assertion--in part. There was a gap in the rail on the river
side of the line, but it was not a fracture. At one of the joints the fish-plates were missing,
and the rail-ends were sprung apart sidewise sufficiently to let the wheel flanges pass through.
Groner went down on his hands and knees with the lantern held low, and made another discovery.

"This ain't no happen-so, Mr. Lidgerwood," he said, when he got up. "The spikes are pulled!"

Lidgerwood said nothing. There are discoveries which are beyond speech. But he stooped to examine
for himself. Groner was right. For a distance of eight or ten feet the rail had been loosened,
and the spikes were gone out of the corresponding cross-ties. After it was loosened, the rail
had been sprung aside, and the bit of rock inserted between the parted ends to keep them from
springing together was still in place.

Lidgerwood's eyes were bloodshot when he rose and said:

"I'd like to ask you two men, as men, what devil out of hell would set a trap like this for
a train-load of unoffending passengers?"

Bradford's slow drawl dispelled a little of the mystery.

"It wasn't meant for Groner and his passenger-wagons, I reckon. In the natural run of things,
it was the 266 and the service-car that ought to've hit this thing first--204 bein' supposed
to be a half-hour off her schedule. It was aimed for us, all right enough. And it wasn't meant
to throw us into the hill, neither. If we'd hit it goin' west, we'd be in the river. That's
why it was sprung out instead of in."

Lidgerwood's right hand, balled into a fist, smote the air, and his outburst was a fierce imprecation.
In the midst of it Groner said, "Listen!" and a moment later a man, walking rapidly up the
track from the direction of Little Butte station, came into the small circle of lantern-light.
Groner threw the light on the new-comer, revealing a haggard face--the face of the owner of
the Wire-Silver mine.

"Heavens and earth, Mr. Lidgerwood--this is awful!" he exclaimed. "I heard of it by 'phone,
and hurried over to do what I could. My men of the night-shift are on the way, walking up the
track, and the entire Wire-Silver outfit is at your disposal."

"I am afraid you are a little late, Mr. Flemister," was Lidgerwood's rejoinder, unreasoning
antagonism making the words sound crisp and ungrateful. "Half an hour ago----"

"Yes, certainly; Goodloe should have 'phoned me, if he knew," cut in the mine-owner. "Anybody
hurt?"

"Half of the number involved, and six dead," said the superintendent soberly; then the four
of them walked slowly and in silence up the track toward the two camp-fires, where the unhurt
survivors and the service-car's guests were fighting the chill of the high-mountain midnight.

XIX

THE CHALLENGE

Lidgerwood was unpleasantly surprised to find that the president's daughter knew the man whom
her father had tersely characterized as "a born gentleman and a born buccaneer," but the fact
remained. When he came with Flemister into the circle of light cast by the smaller of the two
fires, Miss Brewster not only welcomed the mine-owner; she immediately introduced him to her
friends, and made room for him on the flat stone which served her for a seat.

Lidgerwood sat on a tie-end a little apart, morosely observant. It is the curse of the self-conscious
soul to find itself often at the meeting-point of comparisons. The superintendent knew Flemister
a little, as he had admitted to the president; and he also knew that some of his evil qualities
were of the sort which appeal, by the law of opposites, to the normal woman, the woman who
would condemn evil in the abstract, perhaps, only to be irresistibly drawn by some of its purely
masculine manifestations. The cynical assertion that the worst of men can win the love of the
best of women is something both more and less than a mere contradiction of terms; and since
Eleanor Brewster's manly ideal was apparently builded upon physical courage as its pedestal,
Flemister, in his dare-devil character, was quite likely to be the man to embody it.

But just now the "gentleman buccaneer" was not living up to the full measure of his reputation
in the dare-devil field, as Lidgerwood was not slow to observe. His replies to Miss Brewster
and the others were not always coherent, and his face, seen in the flickering firelight, was
almost ghastly. True, the talk was low-toned and fragmentary; desultory enough to require little
of any member of the group sitting around the smouldering fire on the spur embankment. Death,
in any form, insists upon its rights, of silence and of respect, and the six motionless figures
lying under the spread Pullman-car sheets on the other side of the spur track were not to be
ignored.

Yet Lidgerwood fancied that of the group circling the fire, Flemister was the one whose eyes
turned oftenest toward the sheeted figures across the track; sometimes in morbid starings,
but now and again with the haggard side-glance of fear. Why was the mine-owner afraid? Lidgerwood
analyzed the query shrewdly. Was he implicated in the matter of the loosened rail? Remembering
that the trap had been set, not for the passenger train, but for the special, the superintendent
dismissed the charge against Flemister. Thus far he had done little to incur the mine-owner's
enmity--at least, nothing to call for cold-blooded murder in reprisal. Yet the man was acting
very curiously. Much of the time he scarcely appeared to hear what Miss Brewster was saying
to him. Moreover, he had lied. Lidgerwood recalled his glib explanation at the meeting beside
the displaced rail. Flemister claimed to have had the news of the disaster by 'phone: where
had he been when the 'phone message found him? Not at his mine, Lidgerwood decided, since he
could not have walked from the Wire-Silver to the wreck in an hour. It was all very puzzling,
and what little suppositional evidence there was, was conflicting. Lidgerwood put the query
aside finally, but with a mental reservation. Later he would go into this newest mystery and
probe it to the bottom. Judson would doubtless have a report to make, and this might help in
the probing.

Fortunately, the waiting interval was not greatly prolonged; fortunately, since for the three
young women the reaction was come and the full horror of the disaster was beginning to make
itself felt. Lidgerwood contrived the necessary diversion when the relief-train from Red Butte
shot around the curve of the hillside cutting.

"Van Lew, suppose you and Jefferis take the women out of the way for a few minutes, while we
are making the transfer," he suggested quietly. "There are enough of us to do the work, and
we can spare you."

This left Flemister unaccounted for, but with a very palpable effort he shook himself free
from the spell of whatever had been shackling him.

"That's right," he assented briskly. "I was just going to suggest that." Then, indicating the
men pouring out of the relief train: "I see that my buckies have come up on your train to lend
a hand; command us just the same as if we belonged to you. That is what we are here for."

Van Lew and the collegian walked the three young women a little way up the old spur while the
wrecked train's company, the living, the injured, and the dead, were transferring down the
line to the relief-train to be taken back to Red Butte. Flemister helped with the other helpers,
but Lidgerwood had an uncomfortable feeling that the man was always at his elbow; he was certainly
there when the last of the wounded had been carried around the wreck, and the relief-train
was ready to back away to Little Butte, where it could be turned upon the mine-spur "Y." It
was while the conductor of the train was gathering his volunteers for departure that Flemister
said what he had apparently been waiting for a chance to say.

"I can't help feeling indirectly responsible for this, Mr. Lidgerwood," he began, with something
like a return of his habitual self-possession. "If I hadn't asked you to come over here to-night----"

Lidgerwood interrupted sharply: "What possible difference would that have made, Mr. Flemister?"

It was not a special weakness of Flemister's to say the damaging thing under pressure of the
untoward and unanticipated event; it is rather a common failing of human nature. In a flash
he appeared to realize that he had admitted too much.

"Why--I understood that it was the unexpected sight of your special standing on the 'Y' that
made the passenger engineer lose his head," he countered lamely, evidently striving to recover
himself and to efface the damaging admission.

It chanced that they were standing directly opposite the break in the track where the rail
ends were still held apart by the small stone. Lidgerwood pointed to the loosened rail, plainly
visible under the volleying play of the two opposing headlights.

"There is the cause of the disaster, Mr. Flemister," he said hotly; "a trap set, not for the
passenger-train, but for my special. Somebody set it; somebody who knew almost to a minute
when we should reach it. Mr. Flemister, let me tell you something: I don't care any more for
my own life than a sane man ought to care, but the murdering devil who pulled the spikes on
that rail reached out, unconsciously perhaps, but none the less certainly, after a life that
I would safe-guard at the price of my own.

It was the needed flick of the whip for the shaken nerve of the mine-owner.

"Ah," said he, "I am sure every one will applaud that determination, Mr. Lidgerwood; applaud
it, and help you to see it through." And then, quite as calmly: "I suppose you will go back
from here with your special, won't you? You can't get down to Little Butte until the track
is repaired, and the wreck cleared. Your going back will make no difference in the right-of-way
matter; I can arrange for a meeting with Grofield at any time--in Angels, if you prefer."

"Yes," said Lidgerwood absently, "I am going back from here."

"Then I guess I may as well ride down to my jumping-off place with my men; you don't need us
any longer. Make my adieux to Miss Brewster and the young ladies, will you, please?"

Lidgerwood stood at the break in the track for some minutes after the retreating relief-train
had disappeared around the steep shoulder of the great hill; was still standing there when
Bradford, having once more side-tracked the service-car on the abandoned mine spur, came down
to ask for orders.

"We'll hold the siding until Dawson shows up with the wrecking-train," was the superintendent's
reply, "He ought to be here before long. Where are Miss Brewster and her friends?"

"They are all up at the bonfire. I'm having the Jap launder the car a little before they move in."

There was another interval of delay, and Lidgerwood held aloof from the group at the fire,
pacing a slow sentry beat up and down beside the ditched train, and pausing at either turn
to listen for the signal of Dawson's coming. It sounded at length: a series of shrill whistle-shrieks,
distance-softened, and presently the drumming of hasting wheels.

The draftsman was on the engine of the wrecking-train, and he dropped off to join the superintendent.

"Not so bad for my part of it, this time," was his comment, when he had looked the wreck over.
Then he asked the inevitable question: "What did it?"

Lidgerwood beckoned him down the line and showed him the sprung rail. Dawson examined it carefully
before he rose up to say: "Why didn't they spring it the other way, if they wanted to make
a thorough job of it? That would have put the train into the river."

Lidgerwood's reply was as laconic as the query. "Because the trap was set for my car, going
west; not for the passenger, going east."

"Of course," said the draftsman, as one properly disgusted with his own lack of perspicacity.
Then, after another and more searching scrutiny, in which the headlight glare of his own engine
was helped out by the burning of half a dozen matches: "Whoever did that, knew his business."

"How do you know?"

"Little things. A regular spike-puller claw-bar was used--the marks of its heel are still in
the ties; the place was chosen to the exact rail-length--just where your engine would begin
to hug the outside of the curve. Then the rail is sprung aside barely enough to let the wheel
flanges through, and not enough to attract an engineer's attention unless he happened to be
looking directly at it, and in a good light."

The superintendent nodded. "What is your inference?" he asked.

"Only what I say; that the man knew his business. He is no ordinary hobo; he is more likely
in your class, or mine."

Lidgerwood ground his heel into the gravel, and with the feeling that he was wasting precious
time of Dawson's which should go into the track-clearing, asked another question.

"Fred, tell me; you've known John Judson longer than I have: do you trust him--when he's sober?"

"Yes." The answer was unqualified.

"I think I do, but he talks too much. He is over here, somewhere, to-night, shadowing the man
who may have done this. He--and the man--came down on 205 this evening. I saw them both board
the train at Angels as it was pulling out."

Dawson looked up quickly, and for once the reticence which was his customary shield was dropped.

"You're trusting me, now, Mr. Lidgerwood: who was the man? Gridley?"

"Gridley? No. Why, Dawson, he is the last man I should suspect!"

"All right; if you think so."

"Don't you think so?"

It was the draftsman's turn to hesitate.

"I'm prejudiced," he confessed at length. "I know Gridley; he is a worse man than a good many
people think he is--and not so bad as some others believe him to be. If he thought you, or
Benson, were getting in his way--up at the house, you know----"

Lidgerwood smiled.

"You don't want him for a brother-in-law; is that it, Fred?"

"I'd cheerfully help to put my sister in her coffin, if that were the alternative," said Dawson
quite calmly.

"Well," said the superintendent, "he can easily prove an alibi, so far as this wreck is concerned.
He went east on 202 yesterday. You knew that, didn't you?"

"Yes, I knew it, but----"

"But what?"

"It doesn't count," said the draftsman, briefly. Then: "Who was the other man, the man who
came west on 205?"

"I hate to say it, Fred, but it was Hallock. We saw the wreck, all of us, from the back platform
of my car. Williams had just pulled us out on the old spur. Just before Cranford shut off and
jammed on his air-brakes, a man ran down the track, swinging his arms like a madman. Of course,
there wasn't the time or any chance for me to identify him, and I saw him only for the second
or two intervening, and with his back toward us. But the back looked like Hallock's; I'm afraid
it was Hallock's."

"But why should he weaken at the last moment and try to stop the train?" queried Dawson.

"You forget that it was the special, and not the passenger, that was to be wrecked."

"Sure," said the draftsman.

"I've told you this, Fred, because, if the man we saw were Hallock, he'll probably turn up
while you are at work; Hallock, with Judson at his heels. You'll know what to do in that event?"

"I guess so: keep a sharp eye on Hallock, and make Judson hold his tongue. I'll do both."

"That's all," said the superintendent. "Now I'll have Bradford pull us up on the spur to give
you room to get your baby crane ahead; then you can pull down and let us out."

The shifting took some few minutes, and more than a little skill. While it was in progress
Lidgerwood was in the service-car, trying to persuade the young women to go to his state-room
for a little rest and sleep on the return run. In the midst of the argument, the door opened
and Dawson came in. From the instant of his entrance it was plain that he had expected to find
the superintendent alone; that he was visibly and painfully embarrassed.

Lidgerwood excused himself and went quickly to the embarrassed one, who was still anchoring
himself to the door-knob. "What is it, Fred?" he asked.

"Judson: he has just turned up, walking from Little Butte, he says, with a pretty badly bruised
ankle. He is loaded to the muzzle with news of some sort, and he wants to know if you'll take
him with you to An--" The draftsman, facing the group under the Pintsch globe at the other
end of the open compartment, stopped suddenly and his big jaw grew rigid. Then he said, in
an awed whisper, "God! let me get out of here!"

"Tell Judson to come aboard," said Lidgerwood; and the draftsman was twisting at the door-knob
when Miriam Holcombe came swiftly down the compartment.

"Wait, Fred," she said gently. "I have come all the way out here to ask my question, and you
mustn't try to stop me: are you going to keep on letting it make us both desolate--for always?"
She seemed not to see or to care that Lidgerwood made a listening third.

Dawson's face had grown suddenly haggard, and he, too, ignored the superintendent.

"How can you say that to me, Miriam?" he returned almost gruffly. "Day and night I am paying,
paying, and the debt never grows less. If it wasn't for my mother and Faith ... but I must
go on paying. I killed your brother----"

"No," she denied, "that was an accident for which you were no more to blame than he was: but
you are killing me."

Lidgerwood stood by, man-like, because he did not know enough to vanish. But Miss Brewster
suddenly swept down the compartment to drag him out of the way of those who did not need him.

"You'd spoil it all, if you could, wouldn't you?" she whispered, in a fine feminine rage; "and
after I have moved heaven and earth to get Miriam to come out here for this one special blessed
moment! Go and drive the others into a corner, and keep them there."

Lidgerwood obeyed, quite meekly; and when he looked again, Dawson had gone, and Miss Holcombe
was sobbing comfortably in Eleanor's arms.

Judson boarded the service-car when it was pulled up to the switch; and after Lidgerwood had
disposed of his passengers for the run back to Angels, he listened to the ex-engineer's report,
sitting quietly while Judson told him of the plot and of the plotters. At the close he said
gravely: "You are sure it was Hallock who got off of the night train at Silver Switch and went
up the old spur?"

It was a test question, and the engineer did not answer it off-hand.

"I'd say yes in a holy minute if there wasn't so blamed much else tied on to it, Mr. Lidgerwood.
I was sure, at the time, that it was Hallock; and besides, I heard him talking to Flemister
afterward, and I saw his mug shadowed out on the window curtain, just as I've been telling
you. All I can say crosswise, is that I didn't get to see him face to face anywhere; in the
gulch, or in the office, or in the mine, or any place else."

"Yet you are convinced, in your own mind?"

"I am."

"You say you saw him and Flemister get on the hand-car and pump themselves down the old spur;
of course, you couldn't identify either of them from the top of the ridge?"

"That's a guess," admitted the ex-engineer frankly. "All I could see was that there were two
men on the car. But it fits in pretty good: I hear 'em plannin' what-all they're going to do;
foller 'em a good bit more'n half-way through the mine tunnel; hike back and hump myself over
the hill, and get there in time to see two men--some two men--rushin' out the hand-car to go
somewhere. That ain't court evidence, maybe, but I've seen more'n one jury that'd hang both
of 'em on it."

"But the third man, Judson; the man you saw beating with his fists on the bulkhead air-lock:
who was he?" persisted Lidgerwood.

"Now you've got me guessin' again. If I hadn't been dead certain that I saw Hallock go on ahead
with Flemister--but I did see him; saw 'em both go through the little door, one after the other,
and heard it slam before the other dub turned up. No," reading the question in the superintendent's
eye, "not a drop, Mr. Lidgerwood; I ain't touched not, tasted not, n'r handled not--'r leastwise,
not to drink any," and here he told the bottle episode which had ended in the smashing of Flemister's
sideboard supply.

Lidgerwood nodded approvingly when the modest narrative reached the bottle-smashing point.

"That was fine, John," he said, using the ex-engineer's Christian name for the first time in
the long interview. "If you've got it in you to do such a thing as that, at such a time, there
is good hope for you. Let's settle this question once for all: all I ask is that you prove
up on your good intentions. Show me that you have quit, not for a day or a week, but for all
time, and I shall be only too glad to see you pulling passenger-trains again. But to get back
to this crime of to-night: when you left Flemister's office, after telephoning Goodloe, you
walked down to Little Butte station?"

"Yes; walked and run. There was nobody there but the bridge watchman. Goodloe had come on up
the track to find out what had happened."

"And you didn't see Flemister or Hallock again?"

"No."

"Flemister told us he got the news by 'phone, and when he said it the wreck was no more than
an hour old. He couldn't have walked down from the mine in that time. Where could he have got
the message, and from whom?"

Judson was shaking his head.

"He didn't need any message--and he didn't get any. I'd put it up this way: after that rail-joint
was sprung open, they'd go back up the old spur on the hand-car, wouldn't they? And on the
way they'd be pretty sure to hear Cranford when he whistled for Little Butte. That'd let 'em
know what was due to happen, right then and there. After that, it'd be easy enough. All Flemister
had to do was to rout out his miners over his own telephones, jump onto the hand-car again,
and come back in time to show up to you."

Lidgerwood was frowning thoughtfully.

"Then both of them must have come back; or, no--that must have been your third man who tried
to flag Cranford down. Judson, I've got to know who that third man is. He has complicated things
so that I don't dare move, even against Flemister, until I know more. We are not at the ultimate
bottom of this thing yet."

"We're far enough to put the handcuffs onto Mr. Pennington Flemister any time you say," asserted
Judson. "There was one little thing that I forgot to put in the report: when you get ready
to take that missing switch-engine back, you'll find it choo-chooin' away up yonder in Flemister's
new power-house that he's built out of boards made from Mr. Benson's bridge-timbers."

"Is that so? Did you see the engine?" queried the superintendent quickly.

"No, but I might as well have. She's there, all right, and they didn't care enough to even
muffle her exhaust."

Lidgerwood took a slender gold-banded cigar from his desk-box, and passed the box to the ex-engineer.

"We'll get Mr. Pennington Flemister--and before he is very many hours older," he said definitely.
And then: "I wish we were a little more certain of the other man."

Judson bit the end from his cigar, but he forbore to light it. The Red Desert had not entirely
effaced his sense of the respect due to a superintendent riding in his own private car.

"It's a queer sort of a mix-up, Mr. Lidgerwood," he said, fingering the cigar tenderly. "Knowin'
what's what, as some of us do, you'd say them two'd never get together, unless it was to cut
each other's throats."

Lidgerwood nodded. "I've heard there was bad blood between them: it was about that building-and-loan
business, wasn't it?"

"Shucks! no; that was only a drop in the bucket," said Judson, surprised out of his attitude
of rank-and-file deference. "Hallock was the original owner of the Wire-Silver. Didn't you
know that?"

"No."

"He was, and Flemister beat him out of it--lock, stock, and barrel: just simply reached out
an' took it. Then, when he'd done that, he reached out and took Hallock's wife--just to make
it a clean sweep, was the way he bragged about it."

"Heavens and earth!" ejaculated the listener. Then some of the hidden things began to define
themselves in the light of this astounding revelation: Hallock's unwillingness to go to Flemister
for the proof of his innocence in the building-and-loan matter; his veiled warning that evil,
and only evil, would come upon all concerned if Lidgerwood should insist; the invasion of the
service-car at Copah by the poor demented creature whose cry was still for vengeance upon her
betrayer. Truly, Flemister had many crimes to answer for. But the revelation made Hallock's
attitude all the more mysterious. It was unaccountable save upon one hypothesis--that Flemister
was able to so play upon the man's weaknesses as to make him a mere tool in his hands. But
Judson was going on to elucidate.

"First off, we all thought Hallock'd kill Flemister. Rankin was never much of a bragger or
much of a talker, but he let out a few hints, and, accordin' to Red Desert rulin's, Flemister
wasn't much better than a dead man, right then. But it blew over, some way, and now----"

"Now he is Flemister's accomplice in a hanging matter, you would say. I'm afraid you are right,
Judson," was the superintendent's comment; and with this the subject was dropped.

The early dawn of the summer morning was graying over the desert when the special drew into
the Angels yard. Lidgerwood had the yard crew place the service-car on the same siding with
the Nadia, and near enough so that his guests, upon rising, could pass across the platforms.

That done, and he saw to the doing of it himself, he climbed the stair in the Crow's Nest,
meaning to snatch a little sleep before the labors and hazards of a new day should claim him.
But McCloskey, the dour-faced, was waiting for him in the upper corridor--with news that would
not wait.

"The trouble-makers have sent us their ultimatum at last," he said gruffly. "We cancel the
new 'Book of Rules' and reinstate all the men that have been discharged, or a strike will be
declared and every wheel on the line will stop at midnight to-night."

Weary to the point of mental stagnation, Lidgerwood still had resilience enough left to rise
to the new grapple.

"Is the strike authorized by the labor union leaders?" he asked.

McCloskey shook his head. "I've been burning the wires to find out. It isn't; the Brotherhoods
won't stand for it, and our men are pulling it off by their lonesome. But it'll materialize,
just the same. The strikers are in the majority, and they'll scare the well-affected minority
to a standstill. Business will stop at twelve o'clock to-night."

"Not entirely," said the superintendent, with anger rising. "The mails will be carried, and
perishable freight will continue moving. Get every man you can enlist on our side, and buy
up all the guns you can find and serve them out; we'll prepare to fight with whatever weapons
the other side may force us to use. Does President Brewster know anything about this?"

"I guess not. They had all gone to bed in the Nadia when the grievance committee came up."

"That's good; he needn't know it. He is going over to the Copperette, and we must arrange to
get him and his party out of town at once. That will eliminate the women. See to engaging the
buckboards for them, and call me when the president's party is ready to leave. I'm going to
rest up a little before we lock horns with these pirates, and you'd better do the same after
you get things shaped up for to-night's hustle."

"I'm needing it, all right," admitted the trainmaster. And then; "Was this passenger wreck
another of the 'assisted' ones?"

"It was. Two men broke a rail-joint on Little Butte side-cutting for my special--and caught
the delayed passenger instead. Flemister was one of the two."

"And the other?" said McCloskey.

Lidgerwood did not name the other.

"We'll get the other man in good time, and if there is any law in this God-forsaken desert
we'll hang both of them. Have you unloaded it all? If you have, I'll turn in."

"All but one little item, and maybe you'll rest better if I don't tell you that right now."

"Give it a name," said Lidgerwood crisply.

"Bart Rufford has broken jail, and he is here, in Angels."

McCloskey was watching his chief's face, and he was sorry to see the sudden pallor make it
colorless. But the superintendent's voice was quite steady when he said:

"Find Judson, and tell him to look out for himself. Rufford won't forgive the episode of the
'S'-wrench. That's all--I'm going to bed."

XX

STORM SIGNALS

Though Lidgerwood had been up for the better part of two nights, and the day intervening, it
was apparent to at least one member of the head-quarters force that he did not go to bed immediately
after the arrival of the service-car from the west; the proof being a freshly typed telegram
which Operator Dix found impaled upon his sending-hook when he came on duty in the despatcher's
office at seven o'clock in the morning.

The message was addressed to Leckhard, superintendent of the Pannikin Division of the Pacific
Southwestern system, at Copah. It was in cipher, and it contained two uncodified words--"Fort"
and "McCook," which small circumstance set Dix to thinking--Fort McCook being the army post,
twelve miles as the crow flies, down the Pannikin from Copah.

Now Dix was not one of the rebels. On the contrary, he was one of the few loyal telegraphers
who had promised McCloskey to stand by the Lidgerwood management in case the rebellion grew
into an organized attempt to tie up the road. But the young man had, for his chief weakness,
a prying curiosity which had led him, in times past, to experiment with the private office
code until he had finally discovered the key to it.

Hence, a little while after the sending of the Leckhard message, Callahan, the train despatcher,
hearing an emphatic "Gee whiz!" from Dix's' corner, looked up from his train-sheet to say,
"What hit you, brother?"

"Nothing," said Dix shortly, but Callahan observed that he was hastily folding and pocketing
the top sheet of the pad upon which he had been writing. Dix went off duty at eleven, his second
trick beginning at three in the afternoon. It was between three and four when McCloskey, having
strengthened his defenses in every way he could devise, rapped at the door of his chief's sleeping-room.
Fifteen minutes later Lidgerwood joined the trainmaster in the private office.

"I couldn't let you sleep any longer," McCloskey began apologetically, "and I don't know but
you'll give me what-for as it is. Things are thickening up pretty fast."

"Put me in touch," was the command.

"All right. I'll begin at the front end. Along about ten o'clock this morning Davidson, the
manager of the Copperette, came down to see Mr. Brewster. He gave the president a long song
and dance about the tough trail and the poor accommodations for a pleasure-party up at the
mine, and the upshot of it was that Mr. Brewster went out to the mine with him alone, leaving
the party in the Nadia here."

Lidgerwood said "Damn!" and let it go at that for the moment. The thing was done, and it could
not be undone. McCloskey went on with his report, his hat tilted to the bridge of his nose.

"Taking it for granted that you mean to fight this thing to a cold finish, I've done everything
I could think of. Thanks to Williams and Bradford, and a few others like them, we can count
on a good third of the trainmen; and I've got about the same proportion of the operators in
line for us. Taking advantage of the twenty-four-hour notice the strikers gave us, I've scattered
these men of ours east and west on the day trains to the points where the trouble will hit
us at twelve o'clock to-night."

"Good!" said Lidgerwood briefly. "How will you handle it?"

"It will handle itself, barring too many broken heads. At midnight, in every important office
where a striker throws down his pen and grounds his wire, one of our men will walk in and keep
the ball rolling. And on every train in transit at that time, manned by men we're not sure
of, there will be a relief crew of some sort, deadheading over the road and ready to fall in
line and keep it coming when the other fellows fall out."

Again the superintendent nodded his approval. The trainmaster was showing himself at his loyal
best.

"That brings us down to Angels and the present, Mac. How do we stand here?"

"That's what I'd give all my old shoes to know," said McCloskey, his homely face emphasizing
his perplexity. "They say the shopmen are against us, and if that's so we're outnumbered here,
six to one. I can't find out anything for certain. Gridley is still away, and Dawson hasn't
got back, and nobody else knows anything about the shop force."

"You say Dawson isn't in? He didn't have more than five or six hours' work on that wreck. What
is the matter?"

"He had a bit of bad luck. He got the main line cleared early this morning, but in shifting
his train and the 'cripples' on the abandoned spur, a culvert broke and let the big crane off.
He has been all day getting it on again, but he'll be in before dark--so Goodloe says."

"And how about Benson?" queried Lidgerwood.

"He's on 203. I caught him on the other side of Crosswater, and took the liberty of signing
your name to a wire calling him in."

"That was right. With this private-car party on our hands, we may need every man we can depend
upon. I wish Gridley were here. He could handle the shop outfit. I'm rather surprised that
he should be away. He must have known that the volcano was about ready to spout."

"Gridley's a law to himself," said the trainmaster. "Sometimes I think he's all right, and
at other times I catch myself wondering if he wouldn't tread on me like I was a cockroach,
if I happened to be in his way."

Having had exactly the same feeling, and quite without reason, Lidgerwood generously defended
the absent master-mechanic.

"That is prejudice, Mac, and you mustn't give it room. Gridley's all right. We mustn't forget
that his department, thus far, is the only one that hasn't given us trouble and doesn't seem
likely to give us trouble. I wish I could say as much for the force here in the Crows' Nest."

"With a single exception, you can--to-day," said McCloskey quickly. "I've cleaned house. There
is only one man under this roof at this minute who won't fight for you at the drop of the hat."

"And that one is----?"

The trainmaster jerked his head toward the outer office. "It's the man out there--or who was
out there when I came through; the one you and I haven't been agreeing on."

"Hallock? Is he here?"

"Sure; he's been here since early this morning."

"But how--" Lidgerwood's thought went swiftly backward over the events of the preceding night.
Judson's story had left Hallock somewhere in the vicinity of the Wire-Silver mine and the wreck
at some time about midnight, or a little past, and there had been no train in from that time
on until the regular passenger, reaching Angels at noon. It was McCloskey who relieved the
strain of bewilderment.

"How did he get here? you were going to say. You brought him from somewhere down the road on
your special. He rode on the engine with Williams."

Lidgerwood pushed his chair back and got up. It was high time for a reckoning of some sort
with the chief clerk.

"Is there anything else, Mac?" he asked, closing his desk.

"Yes; one more thing. The grievance committee is in session up at the Celestial. Tryon, who
is heading it, sent word down a little while ago that the men would wreck every dollar's worth
of company property in Angels if you didn't countermand your wire of this morning to Superintendent
Leckhard."

"I haven't wired Leckhard."

"They say you did; and when I asked 'em what about it, they said you'd know."

The superintendent's hand was on the knob of the corridor door.

"Look it up in Callahan's office," he said. "If any message has gone to Leckhard to-day, I
didn't write it."

When he closed the door of his private office behind him, Lidgerwood's purpose was to go immediately
to the Nadia to warn the members of the pleasure-party, and to convince them, if possible,
of the advisability of a prompt retreat to Copah. But there was another matter which was even
more urgent. After the events of the night, it had not been unreasonable to suppose that Hallock
would scarcely be foolhardy enough to come back and take his place as if nothing had happened.
Since he had come back, there was only one thing to be done, and the safety of all demanded it.

Lidgerwood left the Crow's Nest and walked quickly uptown. Contrary to his expectations, he
found the avenue quiet and almost deserted, though there was a little knot of loungers on the
porch of the Celestial, and Biggs's bar-room, and Red-Light Sammy's, were full to overflowing.
Crossing to the corner opposite the hotel, the superintendent entered the open door of Schleisinger's
"Emporium." At the moment there was a dearth of trade, and the round-faced little German who
had weathered all the Angelic storms was discovered shaving himself before a triangular bit
of looking-glass, stuck up on the packing-box which served him by turns as a desk and a dressing-case.

"How you vas, Mr. Litchervood?" was his greeting, offered while the razor was on the upward
sweep. "Don'd tell me you vas come aboud some more of dose chustice businesses. Me, I make
oud no more of dem warrants, nichts. Dot teufel Rufford iss come back again, alretty, and----"

Lidgerwood broke the refusal in the midst.

"You are an officer of the law, Schleisinger--more is the pity, both for you and the law--and
you must do your duty. I have come to swear out another warrant. Get your blank and fill it in."

The German shopkeeper put down his razor with only one side of his face shaven. "Oh, mein Gott!"
was his protest; but he rummaged in the catch-all packing-box and found the pad of blank warrants.
Lidgerwood dictated slowly, in charity for the trembling fingers that held the pen. Knowing
his own weakness, he could sympathize with others. When it came to the filling in of Hallock's
name, Schleisinger stopped, open-mouthed.

"Donnerwetter!" he gasped, "you don'd mean dot, Mr. Litchervood; you don'd neffer mean dot?"

"I am sorry to say that I do; sorrier than you or any one else can possibly be."

"Bud--bud----"

"I know what you would say," interrupted Lidgerwood hastily. "You are afraid of Hallock's friends--as
you were afraid of Rufford and his friends. But you must do your sworn duty."

"Nein, nein, dot ain'd it," was the earnest denial. "Bud--bud nobody vould serve a warrant
on Mr. Hallock, Mr. Litchervood! I----"

"I'll find some one to serve it," said the complainant curtly, and Schleisinger made no further
objections.

With the warrant in his pocket, a magistrate's order calling for the arrest and detention of
Rankin Hallock on the double charge of train-wrecking and murder, Lidgerwood left Schleisinger's,
meaning to go back to the Crow's Nest and have McCloskey put the warrant in Judson's hands.
But there was a thing to come between; a thing not wholly unlooked for, but none the less destructive
of whatever small hope of regeneration the victim of unreadiness had been cherishing.

When the superintendent recrossed to the Celestial corner, Mesa Avenue was still practically
deserted, though the group on the hotel porch had increased its numbers. Three doors below,
in front of Biggs's, a bunch of saddled cow-ponies gave notice of a fresh accession to the
bar-room crowd which was now overflowing upon the steps and the plank sidewalk. Lidgerwood's
thoughts shuttled swiftly. He argued that a brave man would neither hurry nor loiter in passing
the danger nucleus, and he strove with what determination there was in him to keep even step
with the reasoned-out resolution.

But once more his weakness tricked him. When the determined stride had brought him fairly opposite
Biggs's door, a man stepped out of the sidewalk group and calmly pushed him to a stand with
the flat of his hand. It was Rufford, and he was saying quite coolly: "Hold up a minute, pardner;
I'm going to cut your heart out and feed it to that pup o Schleisinger's that's follerin' you.
He looks mighty hungry."

With reason assuring him that the gambler was merely making a grand-stand play for the benefit
of the bar-room crowd wedging itself in Biggs's doorway, Lidgerwood's lips went dry, and he
knew that the haunting terror was slipping its humiliating mask over his face. But before he
could say or do any fear-prompted thing a diversion came. At the halting moment a small man,
red-haired, and with his cap pulled down over his eyes, had separated himself from the group
of loungers on the Celestial porch to make a swift détour through the hotel bar, around the
rear of Biggs's, and so to the street and the sidewalk in front. As once before, and under
somewhat less hazardous conditions, he came up behind Rufford, and again the gambler felt the
pressure of cold metal against his spine.

"It ain't an S-wrench this time, Bart," he said gently, and the crowd on Biggs's doorstep roared
its appreciation of the joke. Then: "Keep your hands right where they are, and side-step out
o' Mr. Lidgerwood's way--that's business." And when the superintendent had gone on: "That's
all for the present, Bart. After I get a little more time and ain't so danged busy I'll borrow
another pair o' clamps from Hepburn and take you back to Copah. So long."

By all the laws of Angelic procedure, Judson should have been promptly shot in the back when
he turned and walked swiftly down the avenue to overtake the superintendent. But for once the
onlookers were disappointed. Rufford was calmly relighting his cigar, and when he had sufficiently
cursed the bar-room audience for not being game enough to stop the interference, he kicked
Schleisinger's dog, and turned his back upon Biggs's and its company.

It was a bit of common human perverseness that kept Lidgerwood from thanking Judson when the
engineer overtook him at the corner of the plaza. Uppermost in his thoughts at the moment was
the keen sense of humiliation arising upon the conviction that the plucky little man had surprised
his secret and would despise him accordingly. Hence his first word to Judson was the word of
authority.

"Go back to Schleisinger and have him swear you in as a deputy constable," he directed tersely.
"When you are sworn in, come down here and serve this," and he gave Judson the warrant for
Hallock's arrest.

The engineer glanced at the name in the body of the warrant and nodded.

"So you've made up your mind?" he said.

Lidgerwood was frowning abstractedly up at the windows of Hallock's office in the head-quarters
building.

"I don't know," he said, half hesitantly. "But he is implicated in that murderous business
of last night--that we both know--and now he is back here. McCloskey told you that, didn't he?"

Judson nodded again, and Lidgerwood went on, irresistibly impelled to justify his own action.

"It would be something worse than folly to leave him at liberty when we are on the ragged edge
of a fight. Arrest him wherever you can find him, and take him over to Copah on the first train
that serves. He'll have to clear himself, if he can; that's all."

When Judson, with his huge cow-boy pistol sagging at his hip, had turned back to do the first
part of his errand, Lidgerwood went on around the Crow's Nest and presented himself at the
door of the Nadia. Happily, for his purpose, he found only Mrs. Brewster and Judge Holcombe
in possession, the young people having gone to climb one of the bare mesa hills behind the
town for an unobstructed view of the Timanyonis.

The superintendent left Judge Holcombe out of the proposal which he urged earnestly upon Mrs.
Brewster. Telling her briefly of the threatened strike and its promise of violence and rioting,
he tried to show her that the presence of the private-car party was a menace, alike to its
own members and to him. The run to Copah could be made on a special schedule and the party
might be well outside of the danger zone before the armistice expired. Would she not defer
to his judgment and let him send the Nadia back to safety while there was yet time?

Mrs. Brewster, the placid, let him say his say without interruption. But when he finished,
the placidity became active opposition. The president's wife would not listen for a moment
to an expedient which did not--could not--include the president himself.

"I know, Howard, you're nervous--you can't help being nervous," she said, cutting him to the
quick when nothing was farther from her intention. "But you haven't stopped to think what you're
asking. If there is any real danger for us--which I can't believe--that is all the more reason
why we shouldn't run away and leave your cousin Ned behind. I wouldn't think of it for an instant,
and neither would any of the others."

Being hurt again in his tenderest part by the quite unconscious gibe, Lidgerwood did not press
his proposal further.

"I merely wished to state the case and to give you a chance to get out and away from the trouble
while we could get you out," he said, a little stiffly. Then: "It is barely possible that the
others may agree with me instead of with you: will you tell them about it when they come back
to the car, and send word to my office after you have decided in open council what you wish
to do? Only don't let it be very late; a delay of two or three hours may make it impossible
for us to get the Nadia over the Desert Division."

Mrs. Brewster promised, and the superintendent went upstairs to his office. A glance into Hallock's
room in passing showed him the chief clerk's box-like desk untenanted, and he wondered if Judson
would find his man somewhere in the town. He hoped so. It would be better for all concerned
if the arrest could be made without too many witnesses. True, Hallock had few friends in the
railroad service, at least among those who professed loyalty to the management, but with explosives
lying about everywhere underfoot, one could not be too careful of matches and fire.

The superintendent had scarcely closed the door upon his entrance into his own room when it
was opened again with McCloskey's hand on the latch. The trainmaster came to report that a
careful search of Callahan's files had not disclosed any message to Leckhard. Also, he added
that Dix, who should have come on duty at three o'clock, was still absent.

"What do you make out of that?" queried Lidgerwood.

McCloskey's scowl was grotesquely horrible.

"Bullying or bribery," he said shortly. "They've got Dix hid away uptown somewhere. But there
was a message, all right, and with your name signed to it. Callahan saw it on Dix's hook this
morning before the boy came down. It was in code, your private code."

"Call up the Copah offices and have it repeated back," ordered the superintendent. "Let's find
out what somebody has been signing my name to."

McCloskey shook his grizzled head. "You won't mind if I say that I beat you to it, this time,
will you? I got Orton, a little while ago, on the Copah wire and pumped him. He says there
was a code message, and that Dix sent it. But when I asked him to repeat it back here, he said
he couldn't--that Mr. Leckhard had taken it with him somewhere down the main line."

Lidgerwood's exclamation was profane. The perversity of things, animate and inanimate, was
beginning to wear upon him.

"Go and tell Callahan to keep after Orton until he gets word that Mr. Leckhard has returned.
Then have him get Leckhard himself at the other end of the wire and call me," he directed.
"Since there is only one man besides myself in Angels who knows the private-office code, I'd
like to know what that message said."

McCloskey nodded. "You mean Hallock?"

"Yes."

The trainmaster was half-way to the door when he turned suddenly to say: "You can fire me if
you want to, Mr. Lidgerwood, but I've got to say my say. You're going to let that yellow dog
run loose until he bites you."

"No, I am not."

"By gravies! I'd have him safe under lock and key before the shindy begins to-night, if it
was my job."

Lidgerwood had turned to his desk and was opening it.

"He will be," he announced quietly. "I have sworn out a warrant for his arrest, and Judson
has it and is looking for his man."

McCloskey smote fist into palm and gritted out an oath of congratulation. "That's where you
hit the proper nail on the head!" he exclaimed. "He's the king-pin of the whole machine, and
if you can pull him out, the machine will fall to pieces. What charge did you put in the warrant?
I only hope it's big enough to hold him."

"Train-wrecking and murder," said Lidgerwood, without looking around; and a moment later McCloskey
went out, treading softly as one who finds himself a trespasser on forbidden ground.

The afternoon sun was poising for its plunge behind the western barrier range and Lidgerwood
had sent Grady, the stenographer, up to the cottage on the second mesa to tell Mrs. Dawson
that he would not be up for dinner, when the door opened to admit Miss Brewster.

"'And the way into my parlor is up a winding stair,'" she quoted blithely and quite as if the
air were not thick with threatening possibilities. "So this is where you live, is it? What
a dreary, bleak, blank place!"

"It was, a moment ago; but it isn't, now," he said, and his soberness made the saying something
more than a bit of commonplace gallantry. Then he gave her his swing-chair as the only comfortable
one in the bare room, adding, "I hope you have come to tell me that your mother has changed
her mind."

"Indeed I haven't! What do you take us for, Howard?"

"For an exceedingly rash party of pleasure-hunters--if you have decided to stay here through
what is likely to happen before to-morrow morning. Besides, you are making it desperately hard
for me."

She laughed lightly. "If you can't be afraid for yourself, you'll be afraid for other people,
won't you? It seems to be one of your necessities."

He let the taunt go unanswered.

"I can't believe that you know what you are facing, any of you, Eleanor. I'll tell you what
I told your mother: there will be battle, murder, and sudden death let loose here in Angels
before to-morrow morning. And it is so utterly unnecessary for any of you to be involved."

She rose and stood before him, putting a comradely hand on his shoulder, and looking him fairly
in the eyes.

"There was a ring of sincerity in that, Howard. Do you really mean that there is likely to
be violence?"

"I do; it is almost certain to come. The trouble has been brewing for a long time--ever since
I came here, in fact. And there is nothing we can do to prevent it. All we can do is to meet
it when it does come, and fight it out."

"'We,' you say; who else besides yourself, Howard?" she asked.

"A little handful of loyal ones."

"Then you will be outnumbered?"

"Six to one here in town if the shopmen go out. They have already threatened to burn the company's
buildings if I don't comply with their demands, and I know the temper of the outfit well enough
to give it full credit for any violence it promises. Won't you go and persuade the others to
consent to run for it, Eleanor? It is simply the height of folly for you to hold the Nadia
here. If I could have had ten words with your father this morning before he went out to the
mine, you would all have been in Copah, long ago. Even now, if I could get word to him, I'm
sure he would order the car out at once."

She nodded.

"Perhaps he would; quite likely he would--and he would stay here himself." Then, suddenly:
"You may send the Nadia back to Copah on one condition--that you go with it."

At first he thought it was a deliberate insult; the cruelest indignity she had ever put upon
him. Knowing his weakness, she was good-natured enough, or solicitous enough, to try to get
him out of harm's way. Then the steadfast look in her eyes made him uncertain.

"If I thought you could say that, realizing what it means--" he began, and then he looked away.

"Well?" she prompted, and the hand slipped from his shoulder.

His eyes were coming back to hers. "If I thought you meant that," he repeated; "if I believed
that you could despise me so utterly as to think for a moment that I would deliberately turn
my back upon my responsibilities here--go away and hunt safety for myself, leaving the men
who have stood by me to whatever----"

"You are making it a matter of duty," she interrupted quite gravely. "I suppose that is right
and proper. But isn't your first duty to yourself and to those who--" She paused, and then
went on in the same steady tone: "I have been hearing some things to-day--some of the things
you said I would hear. You are well hated in the Red Desert, Howard--hated so fiercely that
this quarrel with your men will be almost a personal one."

"I know," he said.

"They will kill you, if you stay here and let them do it."

"Quite possibly."

"Howard! Do you tell me you can stay here and face all this without flinching?"

"Oh, no; I didn't say that."

"But you are facing it!"

He smiled.

"As I told you yesterday--that is one of the things for which I draw my salary. Don't mistake
me; there is nothing heroic about it--the heroics are due to come to-night. That is another
thing, Eleanor--another reason why I want you to go away. When the real pinch comes, I shall
probably disgrace myself and everybody remotely connected with me. I'd a good bit rather be
torn into little pieces, privately, than have you here to be made ashamed--again."

She turned away.

"Tell me, in so many words, what you think will be done to-night--what are you expecting?"

"I told you a few moments ago, in the words of the Prayer Book: battle, and murder, and sudden
death. A strike has been planned, and it will fail. Five minutes after the first strike-abandoned
train arrives, the town will go mad."

She had come close to him again.

"Mother won't go and leave father; that is settled. You must do the best you can, with us for
a handicap. What will you do with us, Howard?"

"I have been thinking about that. The farther you can get away from the shops and the yard,
which will be the storm-centre, the safer you will be. I can have the Nadia set out on the
Copperette switch, which is a good half-mile below the town, with Van Lew and Jefferis to stand
guard----"

"They will both be here, with you," she interrupted.

"Then the alternative is to place the car as near as possible to this building, which will
be defended. If there is a riot, you can all come up here and be out of the way of chance pistol-shots,
at least."

"Ugh!" she shivered. "Is this really civilized America?"

"It's America--without much of the civilization. Now, will you go and tell the others what
to expect, and send Van Lew to me? I want to tell him just what to do and how to do it, while
there is time and an undisturbed chance."

XXI

THE BOSS MACHINIST

Miss Brewster evidently obeyed her instructions precisely, since Van Lew came almost immediately
to tap on the door of the superintendent's private room.

"Miss Eleanor said you wanted to see me," he began, when Lidgerwood had admitted him; adding:
"I was just about to chase out to see what had become of her."

The frank confession of solicitude was not thrown away upon Lidgerwood, and it cost him an
effort to put the athlete on a plane of brotherly equality as a comrade in arms. But he compassed
it.

"Yes, I asked her to send you up," he replied. Then: "I suppose you know what we are confronting,
Mr. Van Lew?"

"Mrs. Brewster told us as soon as we came back from the hills. Is it likely to be serious?"

"Yes. I wish I could have persuaded Mrs. Brewster to order the Nadia out of it. But she has
refused to go and leave Mr. Brewster behind."

"I know," said Van Lew; "we have all refused."

"So Miss Brewster has just told me," frowned Lidgerwood. "That being the case, we must make
the best of it. How are you fixed for arms in the president's car?"

"I have a hunting rifle--a forty-four magazine; and Jefferis has a small armory of revolvers--boy-like."

"Good! The defense of the car, if a riot materializes, will fall upon you two. Judge Holcombe
can't be counted in. I'll give you all the help I can spare, but you'll have to furnish the
brains. I suppose I don't need to tell you not to take any chances?"

Van Lew shook his head and smiled.

"Not while the dear girl whom, God willing, I'm going to marry, is a member of our car-party.
I'm more likely to be over-cautious than reckless, Mr. Lidgerwood."

Here, in terms unmistakable, was a deep grave in which to bury any poor phantom of hope which
might have survived, but Lidgerwood did not advertise the funeral.

"She is altogether worthy of the most that you can do for her, and the best that you can give
her, Mr. Van Lew," he said gravely. Then he passed quickly to the more vital matter. "The Nadia
will be placed on the short spur track at this end of the building, close in, where you can
step from the rear platform of the car to the station platform. I'll try to keep watch for
you, but you must also keep watch for yourself. If any firing begins, get your people out quietly
and bring them up here. Of course, none of you will have anything worse than a stray bullet
to fear, but the side walls of the Nadia would offer no protection against that."

Van Lew nodded understandingly.

"Call it settled," he said. "Shall I use my own judgment as to the proper moment to make the
break, or will you pass us the word?"

Lidgerwood took time to consider. Conditions might arise under which the Crow's Nest would
be the most unsafe place in Angels to which to flee for shelter.

"Perhaps you would better sit tight until I give the word," he directed, after the reflective
pause. Then, in a lighter vein: "All of these careful prefigurings may be entirely beside the
mark, Mr. Van Lew; I hope the event may prove that they were. And until the thing actually
hits us, we may as well keep up appearances. Don't let the women worry any more than they have to."

"You can trust me for that," laughed the athlete, and he went his way to begin the keeping
up of appearances.

At seven o'clock, just as Lidgerwood was finishing the luncheon which had been sent up to his
office from the station kitchen, Train 203 pulled in from the east; and a little later Dawson's
belated wrecking-train trailed up from the west, bringing the "cripples" from the Little Butte
disaster. Not to leave anything undone, Lidgerwood summoned McCloskey by a touch of the buzzer-push
connecting with the trainmaster's office.

"No word from Judson yet?" he asked, when McCloskey's homely face appeared in the doorway.

"No, not yet," was the reply.

"Let me know when you hear from him; and in the meantime I wish you would go downstairs and
see if Gridley came in on 203. If he did, bring him and Benson up here and we'll hold a council
of war. If you see Dawson, send him home to his mother and sister. He can report to me later,
if he finds it safe to leave his womankind."

The door of the outer office had barely closed behind McCloskey when that opening into the
corridor swung upon its hinges to admit the master-mechanic. He was dusty and travel-stained,
but nothing seemed to stale his genial good-humor.

"Well, well, Mr. Lidgerwood! so the hoboes have asked to see your hand, at last, have they?"
he began sympathetically. "I heard of it over in Copah, just in good time to let me catch 203.
You're not going to let them make you show down, are you?"

"No," said Lidgerwood.

"That's right; that's precisely the way to stack it up. Of course, you know you can count on
me. I've got a beautiful lot of pirates over in the shops, but we'll try to hold them level."
Then, in the same even tone: "They tell me we went into the hole again last night, over at
Little Butte. Pretty bad?"

"Very bad; six killed outright, and as many more to bury later on, I am told by the Red Butte
doctors."

"Heavens and earth! The men are calling it a broken rail; was it?"

"A loosened rail," corrected Lidgerwood.

The master-mechanic's eyes narrowed.

"Natural?" he asked.

"No, artificial."

Gridley swore savagely.

"This thing's got to stop, Lidgerwood! Sift it, sift it to the bottom! Whom do you suspect?"

It was a plain truth, though an unintentionally misleading one, that the superintendent put
into his reply.

"I don't suspect any one, Gridley," he began, and he was going on to say that suspicion had
grown to certainty, when the latch of the door opening from the outer office clicked again
and McCloskey came in with Benson. The master-mechanic excused himself abruptly when he saw
who the trainmaster's follower was.

"I'll go and get something to eat," he said hurriedly; "after which I'll pick up a few men
whom we can depend upon and garrison the shops. Send over for me if you need me."

Benson looked hard at the door which was still quivering under Gridley's outgoing slam. And
when the master-mechanic's tread was no longer audible in the upper corridor, the young engineer
turned to the man at the desk to say: "What tickled the boss machinist, Lidgerwood?"

"I don't know. Why?"

Benson looked at McCloskey.

"Just as we came in, he was standing over you with a look in his eyes as if he were about to
murder you, and couldn't quite make up his mind as to the simplest way of doing it. Then the
look changed to his usual cast-iron smile in the flirt of a flea's hind leg--at some joke you
were telling, I took it."

Being careful and troubled about many things, Lidgerwood missed the point of Benson's remark;
could not remember, when he tried, just what it was that he had been saying to Gridley when
the interruption came. But the matter was easily dismissed. Having his two chief lieutenants
before him, the superintendent seized the opportunity to outline the plan of campaign for the
night. McCloskey was to stay by the wires, with Callahan to share his watch. Dawson, when he
should come down, was to pick up a few of the loyal enginemen and guard the roundhouse. Benson
was to take charge of the yards, keeping his eye on the Nadia. At the first indication of an
outbreak, he was to pass the word to Van Lew, who would immediately transfer the private-car
party to the second-floor offices in the head-quarters building.

"That is all," was Lidgerwood's summing up, when he had made his dispositions like a careful
commander-in-chief; "all but one thing. Mac, have you seen anything of Hallock?"

"Not since the middle of the afternoon," was the prompt reply.

"And Judson has not yet reported?"

"No."

"Well--this is for you, Benson--Mac already knows it: Judson is out looking for Hallock. He
has a warrant for Hallock's arrest."

Benson's eyes narrowed.

"Then you have found the ringleader at last, have you?" he asked.

"I am sorry to say that there doesn't seem to be any doubt of Hallock's guilt. The arrest will
be made quietly. Judson understands that. There is another man that we've got to have, and
there is no time just now to go after him."

"Who is the other man?" asked Benson.

"It is Flemister; the man who has the stolen switching-engine boxed up in a power-house built
out of planks sawed from your Gloria bridge-timbers."

"I told you so!" exclaimed the young engineer. "By Jove! I'll never forgive you if you don't
send him to the rock-pile for that, Lidgerwood!"

"I have promised to hang him," said the superintendent soberly--"him and the man who has been
working with him."

"And that's Rankin Hallock!" cut in the trainmaster vindictively, and his scowl was grotesquely
hideous. "Can you hang them, Mr. Lidgerwood?"

"Yes. Flemister, and a man whom Judson has identified as Hallock, were the two who ditched
204 at Silver Switch last night. The charge in Judson's warrant reads,'train-wrecking and murder.'"

The trainmaster smote the desk with his fist.

"I'll add one more strand to the rope--Hallock's rope," he gritted ferociously. "You remember
what I told you about that loosened rail that caused the wreck in the Crosswater Hills? You
said Hallock had gone to Navajo to see Cruikshanks; he did go to Navajo, but he got there just
exactly four hours after 202 had gone on past Navajo, and he came on foot, walking down the
track from the Hills!"

"Where did you get that?" asked Lidgerwood quickly.

"From the agent at Navajo. I wasn't satisfied with the way it shaped up, and I did a little
investigating on my own hook."

"Pass him up," said Benson briefly, "and let's go over this lay-out for to-night again. I shall
be out of touch down in the yards, and I want to get it straight in my head."

Lidgerwood went carefully over the details again, and again cautioned Benson about the Nadia
and its party. From that the talk ran upon the ill luck which had projected the pleasure-party
into the thick of things; upon Mrs. Brewster's obstinacy--which Lidgerwood most inconsistently
defended--and upon the probability of the president's return from the Copperette--also in the
thick of things, and it was close upon eight o'clock when the two lieutenants went to their
respective posts.

It was fully an hour farther along, and the tense strain of suspense was beginning to tell
upon the man who sat thoughtful and alone in the second-floor office of the Crow's Nest, when
Benson ran up to report the situation in the yards.

"Everything quiet so far," was the news he brought. "We've got the Nadia on the east spur,
where the folks can slip out and make their get-away, if they have to. There are several little
squads of the discharged men hanging around, but not many more than usual. The east and west
yards are clear, and the three sections of the mid-night freight are crewed and ready to pull
out when the time comes. The folkses are playing dummy whist in the Nadia; and Gridley is holding
the fort at the shops with the toughest-looking lot of myrmidons you ever laid your eyes on."

Once again Lidgerwood was making tiny squares on his desk blotter.

"I'm thankful that the news of the strike got to Copah in time to bring Gridley over on 203,"
he said.

Benson's boyish eyes opened to their widest angle.

"Did he say he came in on Two-three?" he asked.

"He did."

"Well, that's odd--devilish odd! I was on that train, and I rambled it from one end to the
other--which is a bad habit I have when I'm trying to kill travel-time. Gridley isn't a man
to be easily overlooked. Reckon he was riding on the brake-beams? He was dirty enough to make
the guess good. Hello, Fred"--this to Dawson, who had at that moment let himself in through
the deserted outer office--"we were just talking about your boss, and wondering how he got
here from Copah on Two-three without my seeing him."

"He didn't come from Copah," said the draftsman briefly. "He came in with me from the west,
on the wrecking-train. He was in Red Butte, and he had an engine bring him down to Silver Switch,
where he caught us just as we were pulling out."

XXII

THE TERROR

Engineer John Judson, disappearing at the moment when the superintendent had sent him back
to bully Schleisinger into appointing him constable, from the ken of those who were most anxious
to hear from him, was late in reporting. But when he finally climbed the stair of the Crow's
Nest to tap at Lidgerwood's door, he brought the first authentic news from the camp of the enemy.

When McCloskey had come at a push of the call-button, Lidgerwood snapped the night-latch on
the corridor door.

"Let us have it, Judson," he said, when the trainmaster had dragged his chair into the circle
of light described by the green cone shade of the desk lamp. "We have been wondering what had
become of you."

Summarized, Judson's story was the report of an intelligent scout. Since he was classed with
the discharged men, he had been able to find out some of the enemy's moves in the game of coercion.
The strikers had transferred their head-quarters from the Celestial to Cat Biggs's place, where
the committees, jealously safeguarded, were now sitting "in permanence" in the back room. Judson
had not been admitted to the committee-room; but the thronged bar-room was public, and the
liquor which was flowing freely had loosened many tongues.

From the bar-room talk Judson had gathered that the strikers knew nothing as yet of McCloskey's
plan to keep the trains moving and the wires alive. Hence--unless the free-flowing whiskey
should precipitate matters--there would probably be no open outbreak before midnight. As an
offset to this, however, the engineer had overheard enough to convince him that the Copah wire
had been tapped; that Dix, the day operator, had been either bribed or intimidated, and was
now under guard at the strikers' head-quarters, and that some important message had been intercepted
which was, in Judson's phrase, "raising sand" in the camp of the disaffected. This recurrence
of the mysterious message, of which no trace could be found in the head-quarters record, opened
a fresh field of discussion, and it was McCloskey who put his finger upon the only plausible
conclusion.

"It is Hallock again," he rasped. "He is the only man who could have used the private code.
Dix probably picked out the cipher; he's got a weakness for such things. Hallock's carrying
double. He has fixed up some trouble-making message, or faked one, and signed your name to
it, and then schemed to let it leak out through Dix."

"It's making the trouble, all right," was Judson's comment. "When I left Biggs's a few minutes
ago, Tryon was calling for volunteers to come down here and steal an engine. From what he said,
I took it they were aimin' to go over into the desert to tear up the track and stop somebody
or something coming this way from Copah--all on account of that make-believe message that you
didn't send."

Thus far Judson's report had dealt with facts. But there were other things deducible. He insisted
that the strength of the insurrection did not lie in the dissatisfied employees of the Red
Butte Western, or even in the ex-employees; it was rather in the lawless element of the town
which lived and fattened upon the earnings of the railroad men--the saloon-keepers, the gamblers,
the "tin-horns" of every stripe. Moreover, it was certain that some one high in authority in
the railroad service was furnishing the brains. There was a chief to whom all the malcontents
deferred, and who figured in the bar-room talk as the "boss," or "the big boss."

"And that same 'big boss' is sitting up yonder in Cat Biggs's back room, right now, givin'
his orders and tellin' 'em what to do," was Judson's crowning guess, and since Hallock had
not been visible since the early afternoon, for the three men sitting under the superintendent's
desk lamp, Judson's inference stood as a fact assured. It was Hallock who had fomented the
trouble; it was Hallock who was now directing it.

"I suppose you didn't see anything of Grady, my stenographer?" inquired Lidgerwood, when Judson
had made an end.

The engineer shook his head. "Reckon they've got him cooped up along with Dix?"

"I hope not. But he has disappeared. I sent him up to Mrs. Dawson's with a message late this
afternoon, and he hasn't shown up since."

"Of course, they've got him," said McCloskey, sourly. "Does he know anything that he can tell?"

"Nothing that can make any difference now. They are probably holding him to hamper me. The
boy's loyal."

"Yes," growled McCloskey, "and he's Irish."

"Well, my old mother is Irish, too, for the matter of that," snapped Judson. "If you don't
like the Irish, you'll be finding a chip on my shoulder any day in the week, except to-day,
Jim McCloskey!"

Lidgerwood smiled. It brought a small relaxing of strains to hear these two resurrecting the
ancient race feud in the midst of the trouble storm. And when the trainmaster returned to his
post in the wire office, and Judson had been sent back to Biggs's to renew his search for the
hidden ring-leader, it was the memory of the little race tiff that cleared the superintendent's
brain for the grapple with the newly defined situation.

Judson's report was grave enough, but it brought a good hope that the crucial moment might
be postponed until many of the men would be too far gone in liquor to take any active part.
Lidgerwood took the precautions made advisable by Tryon's threat to steal an engine, sending
word to Benson to double his guards on the locomotives in the yard, and to Dawson to block
the turn-table so that none might be taken from the roundhouse.

Afterward he went out to look over the field in person. Everything was quiet; almost suspiciously
so. Gridley was found alone in his office at the shops, smoking a cigar, with his chair tilted
to a comfortable angle and his feet on the desk. His guards, he said, were posted in and around
the shops, and he hoped they were not asleep. Thus far, there had been little enough to keep
them awake.

Lidgerwood, passing out through the door opening upon the electric-lighted yard, surprised
a man in the act of turning the knob to enter. It was the merest incident, and he would not
have remarked it if the door, closing behind Gridley's visitor, had not bisected a violent
outburst of profanity, vocalizing itself in the harsh tones of the master-mechanic, as thus:
"You ---- ---- chuckle-headed fool! Haven't you any better sense than to come--" At this point
the closing door cut the sentence of objurgation, and Lidgerwood continued his round of inspection,
trying vainly to recall the identity of the chance-met man whose face, half hidden under the
drooping brim of a worn campaign-hat, was vaguely familiar. The recollection came at length,
with the impact of a blow. The "chuckle-headed fool" of Gridley's malediction was Richard Rufford,
the "Killer's" younger brother.

Lidgerwood said nothing of this incident to Dawson, whom he found patrolling the roundhouse.
Here, as at the shops and in the yard, everything was quiet and orderly. The crews for the
three sections of the midnight freight were all out, guarding their trains and engines, and
Dawson had only Bradford and the roundhouse night-men for company.

"Nothing stirring, Fred?" inquired the superintendent.

"Less than nothing; it's almost too quiet," was the sober reply. And then: "I see you haven't
sent the Nadia out; wouldn't it be a good scheme to get a couple of buckboards and have the
women and Judge Holcombe driven up to our place on the mesa? The trouble, when it comes, will
come this way."

Lidgerwood shook his head.

"My stake in the Nadia is precisely the same size as yours, Fred, and I don't want to risk
the buckboard business. We'll do a better thing than that, if we have to let the president's
party make a run for it. Get your smartest passenger flyer out on the table, head it east,
and when I send for it, rush it over to couple on to the Nadia--with Williams for engineer.
Has Benson had any trouble in the yard?"

"There has been nobody to make any. Tryon came down a few minutes ago, considerably more than
half-seas over, and said he was ready to take his engine and the first section of the east-bound
midnight--which would have been his regular run. But he went back uptown peaceably when Benson
told him he was down and out."

Lidgerwood did not extend his round to include Benson's post at the yard office, which was
below the coal chutes. Instead, he went over to the Nadia, thinking pointedly of the two added
mysteries: the fact that Gridley had told a deliberate lie to account for his appearance in
Angels, and the other and more recent fact that the master-mechanic was conferring, even in
terms of profanity, with Rufford's brother, who was not, and never had been, in his department.

Under the "umbrella roof" of the Nadia's rear platform the young people of the party were sitting
out the early half of the perfect summer night, the card-tables having been abandoned when
Benson had brought word of the tacit armistice. There was an unoccupied camp-chair, and Miss
Brewster pointed it out to the superintendent.

"Climb over and sit with us, Howard," she said, hospitably. "You know you haven't a thing in
the world to do."

Lidgerwood swung himself over the railing, and took the proffered chair.

"You are right; I haven't very much to do just now," he admitted.

"Has your strike materialized yet?" she asked.

"No; it isn't due until midnight."

"I don't believe there is going to be any."

"Don't you? I wish I might share your incredulity--with reason."

Miss Doty and the others were talking about the curious blending of the moonlight with the
masthead electrics, and the two in the shadowed corner of the deep platform were temporarily
ignored. Miss Brewster took advantage of the momentary isolation to say, "Confess that you
were a little bit over-wrought this afternoon when you wanted to send us away: weren't you?"

"I only hope that the outcome will prove that I was," he rejoined patiently.

"You still believe there will be trouble?"

"Yes."

"Then I'm afraid you are still overwrought," she countered lightly. "Why, the very atmosphere
of this beautiful night breathes peace."

Before he could reply, a man came up to the platform railing, touched his cap, and said, "Is
Mr. Lidgerwood here?"

Lidgerwood answered in person, crossing to the railing to hear Judson's latest report, which
was given in hoarse whispers. Miss Brewster could distinguish no word of it, but she heard
Lidgerwood's reply. "Tell Benson and Dawson, and say that the engine I ordered had better be
sent up at once."

When Lidgerwood had resumed his chair he was promptly put upon the question rack of Miss Eleanor's
curiosity.

"Was that one of your scouts?" she asked.

"Yes."

"Did he come to tell you that there wasn't going to be any strike?"

"No."

"How lucidly communicative you are! Can't you see that I am fairly stifling with curiosity?"

"I'm sorry, but you shall not have the chance to say that I was overwrought twice in the same
half-day."

"Howard! Don't be little and spiteful. I'll eat humble pie and call myself hard names, if you
insist; only--gracious goodness! is that engine going to smash into our car?"

The anxious query hinged itself upon the approach of a big, eight-wheeled passenger flyer which
was thundering down the yard on the track occupied by the Nadia. Within half a car-length of
collision, the air-brake hissed, the siderods clanked and chattered, and the shuddering monster
rolled gently backward to a touch coupling with the president's car.

Eleanor's hand was on her cousin's arm. "Howard, what does this mean?" she demanded.

"Nothing, just at present; it is merely a precaution."

"You are not going to take us away from Angels?"

"Not now; not at all, unless your safety demands it." Then he rose and spoke to the others.
"I'm sorry to have to shut off your moon-vista with that noisy beast, but it may be necessary
to move the car, later on. Don't get out of touch with the Nadia, any of you, please."

He had vaulted the hand-rail and was saying good-night, when Eleanor left her chair and entered
the car. He was not greatly surprised to find her waiting for him at the steps of the forward
vestibule when he had gone so far on his way to his office.

"One moment," she pleaded. "I'll be good, Howard; and I know that there is danger. Be very
careful of yourself, won't you, for my sake."

He stopped short, and his arms went out to her. Then his self-control returned and his rejoinder
was almost bitter.

"Eleanor, you must not! you tempt me past endurance! Go back to Van--to the others, and, whatever
happens, don't let any one leave the car."

"I'll do anything you say, only you must tell me where you are going," she insisted.

"Certainly; I am going up to my office--where you found me this afternoon. I shall be there
from this on, if you wish to send any word. I'll see that you have a messenger. Good-by."

He left her before her sympathetic mood should unman him, his soul crying out at the kindness
which cut so much more deeply than her mockery. At the top of the corridor stair McCloskey
was waiting for him.

"Judson has told you what's due to happen?" queried the trainmaster.

"He told me to look for swift trouble; that somebody had betrayed your strike-breaking scheme."

"He says they'll try to keep the east-bound freights from going out."

"That would be a small matter. But we mustn't lose the moral effect of taking the first trick
in the game. Are the sections all in line on the long siding?"

"Yes."

"Good. We'll start them a little ahead of time; and let them kill back to schedule after they
get out on the road. Send Bogard down with their clearance orders, and 'phone Benson at the
yard office to couple them up into one train, engine to the caboose in front, and send them
out solid. When they have cleared the danger limit, they can split up and take the proper time
intervals--ten minutes apart."

"Call it done," said the trainmaster, and he went to carry out the order. Two minutes later
Bogard, the night-relief operator off duty, darted out of the despatcher's room with the clearance-cards
for the three sections. Lidgerwood stopped him in mid-flight.

"One second, Robert: when you have done your errand, come back to the president's car, ask
for Miss Brewster, and say that I sent you. Then stay within call and be ready to do whatever
she wants you to do."

Bogard did the first part of his errand swiftly, and he was taking the duplicate signatures
of the engineer and conductor of the third and last section when Benson came up to put the
solid-train order into effect. The couplings were made deftly and without unnecessary stir.
Then Benson stepped back and gave the starting signal, twirling his lantern in rapid circles.
Synchronized as perfectly as if a single throttle-lever controlled them all, the three heavy
freight-pullers hissed, strained, belched fire, and the long train began to move out.

It was Lidgerwood's challenge to the outlaws, and as if the blasts of the three tearing exhausts
had been the signal it was awaiting, the strike storm broke with the suddenness and fury of
a tropical hurricane. From a hundred hiding-places in the car-strewn yard, men came running,
some to swarm thickly upon the moving engines and cabooses, others swinging by the drawheads
to cut the air-brake hose.

Benson was swept aside and overpowered before he could strike a blow. Bogard, speeding across
to take his post beside the Nadia, was struck down before he could get clear of the pouring
hornet swarm. Shots were fired; shrill yells arose. Into the midst of the clamor the great
siren whistle at the shops boomed out the fire alarm, and almost at the the same instant a
red glow, capped by a rolling nimbus of sooty oil smoke, rose to beacon the destruction already
begun in the shop yards. And while the roar of the siren was still jarring upon the windless
night air, the electric-light circuits were cut out, leaving the yards and the Crow's Nest
in darkness, and the frantic battle for the trains to be lighted only by the moon and the lurid
glow of destruction spreading slowly under its black canopy of smoke.

In the Crow's Nest the sudden coup of the strikers had the effect which its originator had
doubtless counted upon. It was some minutes after the lights were cut off, and the irruption
had swept past the captured and disabled trains to the shops, before Lidgerwood could get his
small garrison together and send it, with McCloskey for its leader, to reinforce the shop guard,
which was presumably fighting desperately for the control of the power plant and the fire pumps.

Only McCloskey's protest and his own anxiety for the safety of the Nadia's company, kept Lidgerwood
from leading the little relief column of loyal trainmen and head-quarters clerks in person.
The lust of battle was in his blood, and for the time the shrinking palsy of physical fear
held aloof.

When the sally of the trainmaster and his forlorn-hope squad had left the office-story of the
head-quarters building almost deserted, it was the force of mere mechanical habit that sent
Lidgerwood back to his room to close his desk before going down to order the Nadia out of the
zone of immediate danger. There was a chair in his way, and in the darkness and in his haste
he stumbled over it. When he recovered himself, two men, with handkerchief masks over their
faces, were entering from the corridor, and as he turned at the sound of their footsteps, they
sprang upon him.

For the first rememberable time in his life, Howard Lidgerwood met the challenge of violence
joyfully, with every muscle and nerve singing the battle-song, and a huge willingness to slay
or be slain arming him for the hand-to-hand struggle. Twice he drove the lighter of the two
to the wall with well-planted blows, and once he got a deadly wrestler's hold on the tall man
and would have killed him if the free accomplice had not torn his locked fingers apart by main
strength. But it was two against one; and when it was over, the conflagration light reddening
the southern windows sufficed for the knotting of the piece of hemp lashing with which the
two masked garroters were binding their victim in his chair.

Meanwhile, the pandemonium raging at the shops was beginning to surge backward into the railway
yard. Some one had fired a box-car, and the upblaze centred a fresh fury of destruction. Up
at the head of the three-sectioned freight train a mad mob was cutting the leading locomotive free.

Dawson, crouching in the roundhouse door directly opposite, knew all that Judson could tell
him, and he instantly divined the purpose of the engine thieves. They were preparing to send
the freight engine eastward on the Desert Division main line to collide with and wreck whatever
coming thing it was that they feared.

The threatened deed wrought itself out before the draftsman could even attempt to prevent it.
A man sprang to the footboard of the freed locomotive, jerked the throttle open, stayed at
the levers long enough to hook up to the most effective cut-off for speed, and jumped for his life.

Dawson was deliberate, but not slow-witted. While the abandoned engine was, as yet, only gathering
speed for the eastward dash, he was dodging the straggling rioters in the yard, racing purposefully
for the only available locomotive, ready and headed to chase the runaway--namely, the big eight-wheeler
coupled to the president's car. He set the switch to the main line as he passed it, but there
was no time to uncouple the engine from the private car, even if he had been willing to leave
the woman he loved, and those with her, helpless in the midst of the rioting.

So there was no more than a gasped-out word to Williams as he climbed to the cab before the
eight-wheeler, with the Nadia in tow, shot away from the Crow's Nest platform. And it was not
until the car was growling angrily over the yard-limit switches that Van Lew burst into the
central compartment like a man demented, to demand excitedly of the three women who were clinging,
terror-stricken, to Judge Holcombe:

"Who has seen Miss Eleanor? Where is Miss Eleanor?"

XXIII

THE CRUCIBLE

Only Miss Brewster herself could have answered the question of her whereabouts at the exact
moment of Van Lew's asking. She was left behind, standing aghast in the midst of tumults, on
the platform of the Crow's Nest. Terrified, like the others, at the sudden outburst of violence,
she had ventured from the car to look for Lidgerwood's messenger, and in the moment of frightened
bewilderment the Nadia had been whisked away.

Naturally, her first impulse was to fly, and the only refuge that offered was the superintendent's
office on the second floor. The stairway door was only a little distance down the platform,
and she was presently groping her way up the stair, praying that she might not find the offices
as dark and deserted as the lower story of the building seemed to be.

The light of the shop-yard fire, and that of the burning box-car nearer at hand, shone redly
through the upper corridor windows, enabling her to go directly to the open door of the superintendent's
office. But when she reached the door and looked within, the trembling terror returned and
held her spell-bound, speechless, unable to move or even to cry out.

What she saw fitted itself to nothing real; it was more like a scene clipped from a play. Two
masked men were covering with revolvers a third, who was tied helpless in a chair. The captive's
face was ghastly and blood-stained, and at first she thought he was dead. Then she saw his
lips move in curious twitchings that showed his teeth. He seemed to be trying to speak, but
the ruffian at his right would not give him leave.

"This is where you pass out, Mr. Lidgerwood," the man was saying threateningly. "You give us
your word that you will resign and leave the Red Butte Western for keeps, or you'll sit in
that chair till somebody comes to take you out and bury you."

The twitching lips were controlled with what appeared to be an almost superhuman effort, but
the words came jerkily.

"What would my word, extorted--under such conditions--be worth to you?"

Eleanor could hear, in spite of the terror that would not let her cry out or run for help.
He was yielding to them, bargaining for his life!

"We'll take it," said the spokesman coolly. "If you break faith with us there are more than
two of us who will see to it that you don't live long enough to brag about it. You've had your
day, and you've got to go."

"And if I refuse?" Eleanor made sure that the voice was steadier now.

"It's this, here and now," grated the taller man who had hitherto kept silence, and he cocked
his revolver and jammed the muzzle of it against the bleeding temple of the man in the chair.

The captive straightened himself as well as his bonds would let him.

"You--you've let the psychological moment go by, gentlemen: I--I've got my second wind. You
may burn and destroy and shoot as you please, but while I'm alive I'll stay with you. Blaze
away, if that's what you want to do."

The horror-stricken watcher at the door covered her face with her hands to shut out the sight
of the murder. It was not until Lidgerwood's voice, calm and even-toned and taunting, broke
the silence that she ventured to look again.

"Well, gentlemen, I'm waiting. Why don't you shoot? You are greater cowards than I have ever
been, with all my shiverings and teeth-chatterings. Isn't the stake big enough to warrant your
last desperate play? I'll make it bigger. You are the two men who broke the rail-joint at Silver
Switch. Ah, that hits you, doesn't it?"

"Shut up!" growled the tall man, with a frightful imprecation. But the smaller of the two was
silent.

Lidgerwood's grin was ghastly, but it was nevertheless a teeth-baring of defiance.

"You curs!" he scoffed. "You haven't even the courage of your own necessities! Why don't you
pluck up the nerve to shoot, and be done with it? I'll make it still more binding upon you:
if you don't kill me now, while you have the chance, as God is my witness I'll hang you both
for those murders last night at Silver Switch. I know you, in spite of your flimsy disguise:
I can call you both by name!"

Out in the yard the yellings and shoutings had taken on a new note, and the windows of the
upper room were jarring with the thunder of incoming trains. Eleanor Brewster heard the new
sounds vaguely: the jangle and clank of the trains, the quick, steady tramp of disciplined
men, snapped-out words of command, the sudden cessation of the riot clamor, and now a shuffling
of feet on the stairway behind her.

Still she could not move; still she was speechless and spell-bound, but no longer from terror.
Her cousin--her lover--how she had misjudged him! He a coward? This man who was holding his
two executioners at bay, quelling them, cowing them, by the sheer force of the stronger will,
and of a courage that was infinitely greater than theirs?

The shuffling footsteps came nearer, and once again Lidgerwood straightened himself in his
chair, this time with a mighty struggle that broke the knotted cords and freed him.

"I said I could name you, and I will!" he cried, springing to his feet. "You," pointing to
the smaller man, "you are Pennington Flemister; and you," wheeling upon the tall man and lowering
his voice, "you are Rankin Hallock!"

The light of the fire in the shop yard had died down until its red glow no longer drove the
shadows from the corners of the room. Eleanor shrank aside when a dozen men pushed their way
into the private office. Then, suddenly the electric lights went on, and a gruff voice said,
"Drop them guns, you two. The show's over."

It was McCloskey who gave the order, and it was obeyed sullenly. With the clatter of the weapons
on the floor, the door of the outer office opened with a jerk, and Judson thrust a hand-cuffed
prisoner of his own capturing into the lighted room.

"There he is, Mr. Lidgerwood," snarled the engineer-constable. "I nabbed him over yonder at
the fire, workin' to put it out, just as if he hadn't told his gang to go and set it!"

"Hallock!" exclaimed the superintendent, starting as if he had seen a ghost. "How is this?
Are there two of you?"

Hallock looked down moodily. "There were two of us who wanted your job, and the other one needed
it badly enough to wreck trains and to kill people, and to lead a lot of pig-headed trainmen
and mechanics into a riot to cover his tracks."

Lidgerwood turned quickly. "Unmask those men, McCloskey."

It was the signal for a tumult. The tall man fought desperately to preserve his disguise, but
Flemister's mask was torn off in the first rush. Then came a diversion, sudden and fiercely
tragic. With a cry of rage that was like the yell of a madman, Hallock flung himself upon the
mine-owner, beating him down with his manacled hands, choking him, grinding him into the dust
of the floor. And when the avenger of wrongs was pulled off and dragged to his feet, Lidgerwood,
looking past the death grapple, saw the figure of a woman swaying at the corridor door; saw
the awful horror in her eyes. In the turning of a leaf he had fought his way to her.

"Good heavens, Eleanor!" he gasped. "What are you doing here?" and he faced her about quickly
and led her into the corridor lest she should see the distorted features of the victim of Hallock's
vengeance.

"I came--they took the car away, and I--I was left behind," she faltered. And then: "Oh, Howard!
take me away; hide me somewhere! It's too horrible!"

There was a bull-bellow of rage from the room they had just left, and Lidgerwood hurried his
companion into the first refuge that offered, which chanced to be the trainmaster's room. Out
of the private office and into the corridor came the taller of the two garroters, holding his
mask in place as he ran, with McCloskey, Judson, and all but one or two of the others in hot
pursuit.

Notwithstanding, the fugitive gained the stair and fell, rather than ran, to the bottom. There
was the crash of a bursting door, a soldierly command of "Halt!" the crack of a cavalry rifle,
and McCloskey came back, wiping his homely face with a bandanna.

"They got him," he said; and then, seeing Eleanor for the first time, his jaw dropped and he
tried to apologize. "Excuse me, Miss Brewster; I didn't have the least idea you were up here."

"Nothing matters now," said Eleanor, pale to the lips. "Come in here and tell us about it.
And--and--is mamma safe?"

"She's down-stairs in the Nadia, with the others--where I supposed you were," McCloskey began;
but Lidgerwood heard the feet of those who were carrying Flemister's body from the chamber
of horrors, and quickly shutting the door on sight and sounds, started the trainmaster on the
story which must be made to last until the way was clear of things a woman should not see.

"Who was the tall man?" he asked. "I thought he was Hallock--I called him Hallock."

The trainmaster shook his head. "They're about the same build; but we were all off wrong, Mr.
Lidgerwood--'way off. It's been Gridley: Gridley and his side-partner, Flemister, all along.
Gridley was the man who jumped the passenger at Crosswater Hills, and took up the rail to ditch
Clay's freight--with Hallock chasing him and trying to prevent it. Gridley was the man who
helped Flemister last night at Silver Switch--with Hallock trying again to stop him, and Judson
trying to keep tab on Hallock, and getting him mixed up with Gridley at every turn, even to
mistaking Gridley's voice and his shadow on the window-curtain for Hallock's. Gridley was the
man who stole the switch-engine and ran it over the old Wire-Silver spur to the mine to sell
it to Flemister for his mine power-plant--they've got it boxed up and running there, right
now. Gridley is the man who has made all this strike trouble, bossing the job to get you out
and to get himself in, so he could cover up his thieveries. Gridley was the man who put up
the job with Bart Rufford to kill you, and Judson mistook his voice for Hallock's that time,
too. Gridley was----"

"Hold on, Mac," interrupted the superintendent; "how did you learn all this?"

"Part of it through some of his men, who have been coming over to us in the last half-hour
and giving him away; part of it through Dick Rufford, who was keeping tab on him for the money
he could squeeze out of him afterward."

"How did Rufford come to tell you?"

"Why, Bradford--that is--er--the two Ruffords started a little shooting match with Andy, and--m-m--well,
Bart passed out for keeps, this time, but Dick lived long enough to tell Bradford a few things--for
old cow-boy times' sake, I suppose. I'll never put it all over any man, again, as long as I
live, Mr. Lidgerwood, after rubbing it into Hallock the way I did, when he was doing his level
best to help us out. But it's partly his own fault. He wanted to play a lone hand, and he was
scheming to get them both into the same frying-pan--Gridley and Flemister."

Lidgerwood nodded. "He had a pretty bitter grudge against Flemister."

"The worst a man could have," said McCloskey soberly. Then he added: "I've got a few thousand
dollars saved up that says that Rankin Hallock isn't going to hang for what he did in the other
room a few minutes ago. I knew it would come to that if the time ever ripened right suddenly,
and I tried to find Judson to choke him off. But John got in ahead of me."

Lidgerwood switched the subject abruptly in deference to Eleanor's deep breathing.

"I must take Miss Brewster to her friends. You say the Nadia is back? Who moved it without orders?"

"Yes, she's back, all right, and Dawson is the man who comes in for the blessing. He wanted
an engine--needed one right bad--and he couldn't wait to uncouple the car. It was Hallock who
sent that message to Mr. Leckhard that we've been hearing so much about, and it was a beg for
the loan of a few of Uncle Sam's boys from Fort McCook. Gridley got on to it through Dix, and
he also cut us out of Mr. Leckhard's answer telling us that the cavalry boys were on 73. By
Gridley's orders, the two Ruffords and some others turned an engine loose to run down the road
for a head-ender with the freight that was bringing the soldiers. Dawson chased the runaway
engine with the coupled-up Nadia outfit, caught it just in the nick of time to prevent a collision
with 73, and brought it back. He's down in the car now, with one of the young women crying
on his neck, and----"

Miss Brewster got up out of her chair, found she could stand without tottering, and said: "Howard,
I must go back to mamma. She will be perfectly frantic if some one hasn't told her that I am
safe. We can go now, can't we, Mr. McCloskey? The trouble is all over, isn't it?"

The trainmaster nodded gravely.

"It's over, all but the paying of the bills. That rifle-shot we heard a little spell ago settled
it. No, he isn't dead"--this in answer to Lidgerwood's unspoken question--"but it will be a
heap better for all concerned if he don't get over it. You can go down. Lieutenant Baldwin
has posted his men around the shops and the Crow's Nest."

Together they left the shelter of the trainmaster's room, and passed down the dark stair and
out upon the platform, where the cavalrymen were mounting guard. There was no word spoken by
either until they reached the Nadia's forward vestibule, and then it was Lidgerwood who broke
the silence to say: "I have discovered something to-night, Eleanor: I'm not quite all the different
kinds of a coward I thought I was."

"Don't tell me!" she said, in keen self-reproach, and her voice thrilled him like the subtle
melody of a passion song. "Howard, dear, I--I'm sitting in sackcloth and ashes. I saw it all--with
my own eyes, and I could neither run nor scream. Oh, it was splendid! I never dreamed that
any man could rise by the sheer power of his will to such a pinnacle of courage. Does that
make amends--just a little? And won't you come to breakfast with us in the morning, and let
me tell you afterward how miserable I've been--how I fairly nagged father into bringing this
party out here so that I might have an excuse to--to----"

He forgot the fierce strife so lately ended; forgot the double victory he had won.

"But--but Van Lew," he stammered--"he told me that you--that he--" and then he took her in
his arms and kissed her, while a young man with a bandaged head--a man who answered to the
name of Jack Benson, and who was hastening up to get permission to go home to Faith Dawson--turned
his back considerately and walked away.

"What were you going to say about Herbert?" she murmured, when he let her have breath enough
to speak with.

"I was merely going to remark that he can't have you now, not if he were ten thousand times
your accepted lover."

She escaped from his arms and ran lightly up the steps of the private car. And from the safe
vantage-ground of the half-opened door she turned and mocked him.

"Silly boy," she said softly. "Can't you read print when it's large enough to shout at all
the world? Herbert and Carolyn have been 'announced' for more than three months, and they are
to be married when we get back to New York. That's all; good-night, and don't you dare to forget
your breakfast engagement!"
