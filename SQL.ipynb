They\\nhad assumed that affairs were to go on as of old, and that the reintegration of the State was\\nto take place under the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had taken it upon\\nhimself, together with the Legislature, to authorize the election of delegates to a State Convention,\\nwithout restriction as to who should be entitled to vote.  Thus encouraged, the element but\\nlately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the State to the Union without any\\nintervention whatever of the Federal Government; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such\\nillusions, since his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in question, whose consequent\\ndisappointment and chagrin were so great as to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.\\nThe provisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray, prohibited the assembling\\nof his convention, and shortly after called, one himself, the delegates to which were to b\\nchosen by voters who could take the amnesty-oath.  The proclamation convening this assemblage\\nalso announced the policy that would be pursued in governing the State until its affairs were\\nsatisfactorily reorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the Judiciary, and\\nprovided for the appointment, by the Governor, of county officials to succeed those known to\\nbe disloyal.  As this action of Hamilton\\'s disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty\\noath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with pronounced and serious\\nopposition, and he quickly realized that he had on his hands an arduous task to protect the\\ncolored people, particularly as in the transition state of society just after the close of\\nthe war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented itself chiefly on the freedmen.  It\\nwas greatly feared that political rights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and\\nas it was generally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race war unless\\nthe freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of subjection, acts of intimidation were soon\\nreported from all parts of the State.\\n\\nHamilton, an able, determined, and fearless man, tried hard to curb this terrorism, but public\\nopinion being strong against him, he could accomplish little without military aid.  As department\\ncommander, I was required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as these requisitions\\nfor help became necessarily very frequent, the result was that shortly after he assumed his\\nduties, detachments of troops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.  By such\\ndisposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the administration of Hamilton,\\nand all went well till the inauguration of J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance\\nof an authorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called together, assumed the\\nduties of the office August 9, 1866.\\n\\nOne of Governor Throckmorton\\'s first acts was to ask the withdrawal or non-interference of\\nthe military.  This was not all granted, but under his ingenious persuasion President Johnson,\\non the 13th of August, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with the unhampered\\ncontrol of civil affairs, and this was more than enough to revive the bulldozing methods that\\nhad characterized the beginning of Hamilton\\'s administration.  Oppressive legislation in the\\nshape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed, developing a policy of gross\\ninjustice toward the colored people on the part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and\\ndisorder ensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least, continued till\\nCongress, by what are known as the Reconstruction Acts, took into its own hands the rehabilitation\\nof the seceded States.\\n\\nIn the State of Louisiana a provisional government, chosen by the loyal element, had been put\\nin operation, as already mentioned, as early as 1864.  This was effected under encouragement\\ngiven by President Lincoln, through the medium of a Constitutional convention, which met at\\nNew Orleans in April, 1864, and adjourned in July.  The constitution then agreed upon was submitted\\nto the people, and in September, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of\\nthe State.\\n\\nThe government provided under this constitution being looked upon as provisional merely, was\\nnever recognized by Congress, and in 1865 the returned Confederates, restored to citizenship\\nby the President\\'s amnesty proclamation, soon got control of almost all the State.  The Legislature\\nwas in their hands, as well as most of the State and municipal offices; so, when the President,\\non the 20th of August, 1866, by proclamation, extended his previous instructions regarding\\ncivil affairs in Texas so as to have them apply to all the seceded States, there at once began\\nin Louisiana a system of discriminative legislation directed against the freedmen, that led\\nto flagrant wrongs in the enforcement of labor contracts, and in the remote parishes to numbers\\nof outrages and murders.\\n\\nTo remedy this deplorable condition of things, it was proposed, by those who had established\\nthe government of 1864, to remodel the constitution of the State; and they sought to do this\\nby reassembling the convention, that body before its adjournment having provided for reconvening\\nunder certain conditions, in obedience to the call of its president.  Therefore, early in the\\nsummer of 1866, many members of this convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided\\nthat a necessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation was issued accordingly\\nby B. K. Howell, President-pro-tempore.\\n\\nMayor John T.  Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked upon this proposed action\\nas revolutionary, and by the time the convention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling\\nprevailed that efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the meeting.  A bloody\\nriot followed, resulting, in the killing and wounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.\\n\\nI happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from Texas, where I had been called\\nby affairs on the Rio Grande.  On my way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on\\nthe night of July 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving the details\\nof the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing me that, to prevent further slaughter,\\nGeneral Baird, the senior military officer present, had assumed control of the municipal government. But\\nour intelligence is not stopped by this. By a simple sic jubeo it posits a disorder which is\\nan \"absence of order.\"\\n\\nIn so doing it thinks a word or a set of words, nothing more.\\n\\nIf it seeks to attach an idea to the word, it finds that disorder\\nmay indeed be the negation of order, but that this negation is then\\nthe implicit affirmation of the presence of the opposite order, which\\nwe shut our eyes to because it does not interest us, or which we evade\\nby denying the second order in its turn--that is, at bottom, by re-establishing\\nthe first.\\n\\nHow can we speak, then, of an incoherent diversity which an understanding organizes? It is no use\\nfor us to say that no one supposes this incoherence to be realized or realizable: when we speak\\nof it, we believe we are thinking of it; now, in analyzing the idea actually present, we find, as\\nwe said before, only the disappointment of the mind confronted with an order that does not interest\\nit, or a swaying of the mind between two kinds of order, or, finally, the idea pure and simple of\\nthe empty word that we have created by joining a negative prefix to a word which itself signifies\\nsomething. But it is this analysis that we neglect to make. We omit it, precisely because\\nit does not occur to us to distinguish two kinds of order that are irreducible to one another.\\n\\nWe\\nsaid, indeed, that all order necessarily appears as contingent. If there are two kinds of order, this\\ncontingency of order is explained: one of the forms is contingent in relation to the other.\\nWhere I find the geometrical order, the vital was possible; where the order is vital, it might have\\nbeen geometrical. But suppose that the order is everywhere of the same kind, and simply admits of\\ndegrees which go from the geometrical to the vital: if a determinate order still appears to\\nme to be contingent, and can no longer be so by relation to an order of another kind, I shall necessarily\\nbelieve that the order is contingent by relation to an absence of\\nitself, that is to say by relation to a state of things \"in which\\nthere is no order at all.\"\\n\\nAnd this state of things I shall believe that I am thinking of, because\\nit is implied, it seems, in the very contingency of order, which is\\nan unquestionable fact.\\n\\n Div. of the Gulf, \"New Orleans, La.\\n\\n\"Continue to enforce martial law, so far as may be necessary to preserve the peace; and do\\nnot allow any of the civil authorities to act, if you deem such action dangerous to the public\\nsafety.  Lose no time in investigating and reporting the causes that led to the riot, and the\\nfacts which occurred.\\n\\n\"U. S. GRANT, \"Lieutenant-General.\"\\n\\nIn obedience to the President\\'s directions, My report of August 1 was followed by another,\\nmore in detail, which I give in full, since it tells the whole story of the riot:\\n\\n\"HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF, \"NEW ORLEANS, LA., August 6, 1866.\\n\\n\"His EXCELLENCY ANDREW JOHNSON, \"President United States\\n\\n\"I have the honor to make the following reply to your despatch of August 4.  A very large number\\nof colored people marched in procession on Friday night, July twenty-seven (27), and were addressed\\nfrom the steps of the City Hall by Dr. Dostie, ex-Governor Hahn, and others.  The speech of\\nDostie was intemperate in language and sentiment.  The speeches of the others, so far as I\\ncan learn, were characterized by moderation.  I have not given you the words of Dostie\\'s speech,\\nas the version published was denied; but from what I have learned of the man, I believe they\\nwere intemperate.\\n\\n\"The convention assembled at twelve (12) M.  on the thirtieth (30), the timid members absenting\\nthemselves because the tone of the general public was ominous of trouble.  I think there were\\nabout twenty-six (26) members present.  In front of the Mechanics Institute, where the meeting\\nwas held, there were assembled some colored men, women, and children, perhaps eighteen (18)\\nor twenty (20), and in the Institute a number of colored men, probably one hundred and fifty\\n(150).  Among those outside and inside there might have been a pistol in the possession of\\nevery tenth (10) man.\\n\\n\"About one (1) p. m.  a procession of say from sixty (60) to one hundred and thirty (130) colored\\nmen marched up Burgundy Street and across Canal Street toward the convention, carrying an American\\nflag. These men had about one pistol to every ten men, and canes and clubs in addition.  While\\ncrossing Canal Street a row occurred.  There were many spectators on the street, and their\\nmanner and tone toward the procession unfriendly.  A shot was fired, by whom I am not able\\nto state, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored man in the procession.\\nThis led to other shots and a rush after the procession.  On arrival at the front of the Institute\\nthere was some throwing of brickbats by both sides.  The police, who had been held well in\\nhand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.  The procession entered the Institute\\nwith the flag, about six (6) or eight (8) remaining outside.  A row occurred between a policeman\\nand one of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the parties, which led to\\nan indiscriminate fire on the building through the windows by the policemen.  This had been\\ngoing on for a short time, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the Institute,\\nwhereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into the building.\\n\\n\"From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the building, the policemen\\nopened an indiscriminate fire upon the audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when\\nthey retired, and those inside barricaded the doors.  The door was broken in, and the firing\\nagain commenced, when many of the colored and white people either escaped throughout the door\\nor were passed out by the policemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the\\ncircle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again fired upon by the citizens\\nthat formed the outer circle.  Many of those wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were\\nprisoners and not wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.  The wounded were\\nstabbed while lying on the ground, and their heads beaten with brickbats.  In the yard of the\\nbuilding, whither some of the colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they\\nwere fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.  Some were killed and wounded several squares\\nfrom the scene.  Members of the convention were wounded by the police while in their hands\\nas prisoners, some of them mortally.\\n\\n\"The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of this Convention; the remote\\ncause was the bitter and antagonistic feeling which has been growing in this community since\\nthe advent of the present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force, selected many\\ndesperate men, and some of them known murderers. People of clear views were overawed by want\\nof confidence in the Mayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his police\\nforce.  I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens on this subject, and have heard\\nthem express fear, and want of confidence in Mayor Monroe.  Ever since the intimation of this\\nlast convention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city papers for supporting,\\nby their articles, the bitter feeling of bad men.  As to the merciless manner in which the\\nconvention was broken up, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.\\n\\n\"It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a great many here toward\\nNorthern men, and this unfortunate affair has so precipitated matters that there is now a test\\nof what shall be the status of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in constant\\ndread or not, whether they can be protected in life and property, and have justice in the courts.\\nIf this matter is permitted to pass over without a thorough and determined prosecution of those\\nengaged in it, we may look out for frequent scenes of the same kind, not only here, but in\\nother places.  No steps have as yet been taken by the civil authorities to arrest citizens\\nwho were engaged in this massacre, or policemen who perpetrated such cruelties.  The members\\nof the convention have been indicted by the grand jury, and many of them arrested and held\\nto bail.  As to whether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the guilty parties\\non both sides, I must say it is my opinion, unequivocally, that they cannot.  Judge Abell,\\nwhose course I have closely watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most dangerous\\nmen that we have here to the peace and quiet of the city. The leading men of the convention--King,\\nCutler, Hahn, and others --have been political agitators, and are bad men.  I regret to say\\nthat the course of Governor Wells has been vacillating, and that during the late trouble he\\nhas shown very little of the man.\\n\\n\"P. H. SHERIDAN, \"Major-General Commanding.\"\\n\\nSubsequently a military commission investigated the subject of the riot, taking a great deal\\nof testimony.  The commission substantially confirmed the conclusions given in my despatches,\\nand still later there was an investigation by a select committee of the House of Representatives,\\nof which the Honorables Samuel Shellabarger, of Ohio, H. L. Elliot, of Massachusetts, and B.\\nM. Boyer, of Pennsylvania, were the members.  The majority report of the committee also corroborated,\\nin all essentials, my reports of the distressing occurrence.  The committee likewise called\\nattention to a violent speech made by Mr. Johnson at St. Louis in September, 1866, charging\\nthe origin of the riot to Congress, and went on to say of the speech that \"it was an unwarranted\\nand unjust expression of hostile feeling, without pretext or foundation in fact.\"  A list of\\nthe killed and wounded was embraced in the committee\\'s report, and among other conclusions\\nreached were the following: \"That the meeting of July 30 was a meeting of quiet citizens, who\\ncame together without arms and with intent peaceably to discuss questions of public concern....\\nThere has been no occasion during our National history when a riot has occurred so destitute\\nof justifiable cause, resulting in a massacre so inhuman and fiend-like, as that which took\\nplace at New Orleans on the 30th of July last.\\n\\nThe statement is also made, that, \"He [the President] knew that \\'rebels\\' and \\'thugs\\' and disloyal\\nmen had controlled the election of Mayor Monroe, and that such men composed chiefly his police\\nforce.\"\\n\\nThe committee held that no legal government existed in Louisiana, and recommended the temporary\\nestablishment of a provisional government therein; the report concluding that \"in the meantime\\nthe safety of all Union men within the State demands that such government be formed for their\\nprotection, for the well being of the nation and the permanent peace of the Republic.\"\\n\\nThe New Orleans riot agitated the whole country, and the official and other reports served\\nto intensify and concentrate the opposition to President Johnson\\'s policy of reconstruction,\\na policy resting exclusively on and inspired solely by the executive authority--for it was\\nmade plain, by his language and his acts, that he was seeking to rehabilitate the seceded States\\nunder conditions differing not a whit from those existing before the rebellion; that is to\\nsay, without the slightest constitutional provision regarding the status of the emancipated\\nslaves, and with no assurances of protection for men who had remained loyal in the war.\\n\\nSCHUYLER COLFAX, Speaker of the House of Representatives.\\n\\nLAFAYETTE S.

March the 11th this\\nlaw was published in General Orders No. 10, from the Headquarters of the Army, the same order\\nassigning certain officers to take charge of the five military districts into which the States\\nlately in rebellion were subdivided, I being announced as the commander of the Fifth Military\\nDistrict, which embraced Louisiana and Texas, a territory that had formed the main portion\\nof my command since the close of the war.\\n\\nBetween the date of the Act and that of my assignment, the Louisiana Legislature, then in special\\nsession, had rejected a proposed repeal of an Act it had previously passed providing for an\\nelection of certain municipal officers in New Orleans.  This election was set for March 11,\\nbut the mayor and the chief of police, together with General Mower, commanding the troops in\\nthe city, having expressed to me personally their fears that the public peace would be disturbed\\nby the election, I, in this emergency, though not yet assigned to the district, assuming the\\nauthority which the Act conferred on district commanders, declared that the election should\\nnot take place; that no polls should be opened on the day fixed; and that the whole matter\\nwould stand postponed till the district commander should be appointed, or special instructions\\nbe had.  This, my first official act under the Reconstruction laws, was rendered necessary\\nby the course of a body of obstructionists, who had already begun to give unequivocal indications\\nof their intention to ignore the laws of Congress.\\n\\nA copy of the order embodying the Reconstruction law, together with my assignment, having reached\\nme a few days after, I regularly assumed control of the Fifth Military District on March 19,\\nby an order wherein I declared the State and municipal governments of the district to be provisional\\nonly, and, under the provisions of the sixth section of the Act, subject to be controlled,\\nmodified, superseded, or abolished.  I also announced that no removals from office would be\\nmade unless the incumbents failed to carry out the provisions of the law or impeded reorganization,\\nor unless willful delays should necessitate a change, and added: \"Pending the reorganization,\\nit is, desirable and intended to create as little disturbance in the machinery of the various\\nbranches of the provisional governments as possible, consistent with the law of Congress and\\nits successful execution, but this condition is dependent upon the disposition shown by the\\npeople, and upon the length of time required for reorganization.\"\\n\\nUnder these limitations Louisiana and Texas retained their former designations as military\\ndistricts, the officers in command exercising their military powers as heretofore.  In addition,\\nthese officers were to carry out in their respective commands all provisions of the law except\\nthose specially requiring the action of the district commander, and in cases of removals from\\nand appointment to office.\\n\\nIn the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have heretofore noted, had\\nbeen vetoed.  On the very day of the veto, however, despite the President\\'s adverse action,\\nit passed each House of Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it the\\neffect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of reconstruction presented was, beyond question,\\nthe policy endorsed by the people of the country.  It was, therefore, my determination to see\\nto the law\\'s zealous execution in my district, though I felt certain that the President would\\nendeavor to embarrass me by every means in his power, not only on account of his pronounced\\npersonal hostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but to obstruct the\\nmeasures enacted by Congress.\\n\\nHaving come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my guidance, the principle of non-interference\\nwith the provisional State governments, and though many appeals were made to have me rescind\\nrulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some presupposed action to be taken by them,\\nmy invariable reply was that I would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of\\nabsolute necessity.  The same policy was announced also in reference to municipal affairs throughout\\nthe district, so long as the action of the local officers did not conflict with the law.\\n\\nIn a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in municipal matters in New Orleans,\\nfor it had become clearly apparent that several of the officials were, both by acts of omission\\nand commission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from office the Mayor,\\nJohn T.  Monroe; the Judge of the First District Court, E. Abell; and the Attorney-General\\nof the State, Andrew S. Herron; at the same time appointing to the respective offices thus\\nvacated Edward Heath, W. W. Howe, and B. L. Lynch.  The officials thus removed had taken upon\\nthemselves from the start to pronounce the Reconstruction acts unconstitutional, and to advise\\nsuch a course of obstruction that I found it necessary at an early dav to replace them by men\\nin sympathy with the law, in order to make plain my determination to have its provisions enforced.\\nThe President at once made inquiry, through General Grant, for the cause of the removal, and\\nI replied:\\n\\n\"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT, \"New Orleans, La., April 19, 1867.\\n\\n\"GENERAL: On the 27th day of March last I removed from office Judge E. Abell, of the Criminal\\nCourt of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John\\nT. Monroe, Mayor of the City of New Orleans.  These removals were made under the powers granted\\nme in what is usually termed the \\'military bill,\\' passed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of\\nthe United States.\\n\\n\"I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of these men, especially after\\nthe investigations made by the military board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report\\nof the congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has been made for\\nthe cause of removal, I would respectfully state as follows:\\n\\n\"The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court in the city of New Orleans,\\nand for a period of at least nine months previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating\\na large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost promising no\\nprosecution in his court against the offenders, in case such an event occurred.  The records\\nof his court will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.\\n\\n\"In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana, I considered\\nit his duty to indict these men before this criminal court.  This he failed to do, but went\\nso far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the victims\\nof the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty\\ninnocent.  He was therefore, in my belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on\\nthe massacre of July 30.\\n\\n\"Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general\\nwho would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent\\nguilty and let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot\\nand massacre.\\n\\n\"With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst elements of the population\\nof this city, giving to those elements an immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief\\nwill see how insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions in the troubles\\nwhich might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization of this State.  Many of\\nthese persons were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies, doing their\\nwork so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson knew of my official acts before I could\\nreport them to General Grant.\\n\\nThe supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of reconstruction became a law\\ndespite the President\\'s veto on March 23. This was a curative act, authorizing elections and\\nprescribing methods of registration.  I also announced that until elections were held in accordance\\nwith these acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the holding over of\\nthose persons whose terms of office otherwise would have expired, would govern in all cases\\nexcepting only those special ones in which I myself might take action.  There was one parish,\\nLivingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the election previously ordered\\nthere, and which therefore took place, but by a supplemental order this election was declare\\nnull and void.\\n\\nIn April.  I began the work of administering the Supplemental Law, which, under  certain condition\\nof eligibility, required a registration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing\\ndelegate to a Constitutional convention. It was there, but neutralized by the action which fulfilled\\nand thereby filled the representation. The obstacle creates nothing positive; it simply makes\\na void, removes a stopper. This inadequacy of act to representation\\nis precisely what we here call consciousness.  Before\\nannouncing these boards, I had asked to be advised definitely as to what persons were disfranchised\\nby the law, and was directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it, pending\\nan opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr. Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance\\nof the boards, I gave the following instructions:\\n\\n\"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT. \"New Orleans, La., April 10, 1867.\\n\\n\"Special Orders, No. 15.\\n\\n\"The four municipal districts of the City of New Orleans and the Parish of Orleans, right bank\\n(Algiers), will each constitute a Registration district.  Election precincts will remain as\\nat present constituted.\\n\\n\"....Each member of the Board of Registers, before commencing his duties, will file in the\\noffice of the Assistant-Inspector-General at these headquarters, the oath required in the sixth\\nsection of the Act referred to, and be governed in the execution of his duty by the provisions\\nof the first section of that Act, faithfully administering the oath therein prescribed to each\\nperson registered.\\n\\n\"Boards of Registers will immediately select suitable offices within their respective districts,\\nhaving reference to convenience and facility of registration, and will enter upon their duties\\non the day designated. And a tendency achieves all that it aims at only if it is not thwarted\\nby another tendency. How, then, could this occur in the domain of\\nlife, where, as we shall show, the interaction of antagonistic tendencies\\nis always implied?  Office-hours for registration\\nwill be from 8 o\\'clock till 12 A. M., and from 4 till 7 P. M.\\n\\n\"When elections are ordered, the Board of Registers for each district will designate the number\\nof polls and the places where they shall be opened in the election precincts within its district,\\nappoint the commissioners and other officers necessary for properly conducting the elections,\\nand will superintend the same.\\n\\n\"They will also receive from the commissioners of elections of the different precincts the\\nresult of the vote, consolidate the same, and forward it to the commanding general.\\n\\n\"Registers and all officers connected with elections will be held to a rigid accountability\\nand will be subject to trial by military commission for fraud, or unlawful or improper conduct\\nin the performance of their duties.  Their rate of compensation and manner of payment will\\nbe in accordance with the provisions of sections six and seven of the supplemental act.\\n\\n\"Pending the decision of the Attorney-General of the United States on the question as to who\\nare disfranchised by law, registers will give the most rigid interpretation to the law, and\\nexclude from registration every person about whose right to vote there may be a doubt.

Christian civilization has exalted her almost\\ninfinitely above the position to which either paganism or Mohammedanism assigned her. This\\nelevation is the natural outgrowth of the example and teaching of Jesus of Nazareth. Unlike\\nother ancient great instructors, he did not repel women from discipleship, but cordially welcomed\\nher presence wherever he taught. His lessons of wisdom, and his precious promises of life everlasting,\\nwere in all their fullness addressed to her as freely as to the most honored of men. His illustrations\\nof sweeping the house to find the lost piece of silver, and of the leaven hid in three measures\\nof meal, were drawn from her employments, and were probably suggested by her presence. To the\\ncry of the poor Syro-Phenician woman, no less than to that of the centurion or nobleman, did\\nhe give his attention and sympathy, and with equal speed did he answer the agonizing prayer.\\nRising far above the trammels of Jewish prejudice, while he sat weary at the mouth of Jacob\\'s\\nwell, he taught the beauty of spiritual worship to the astonished woman of Samaria. She became\\nhis first missionary to the people of her city, to whom she told the story of his wonderful\\nwisdom, and said, \"Is not this the Christ?\" How kind must have been his spirit, how tender\\nhis words, to the sisters at Bethany, to cause the exclamation, \"If thou hadst been here, my\\nbrother had not died!\" How consoling must have been his accents, which drew the fair penitent\\nto his feet, and which led her, in loving adoration, to wash them with her tears and to wipe\\nthem with the hairs of her head! How wonderful the manifestation of that Divine condescension\\nand love which elicited that gratitude which still lingers in the rich perfumes of the alabaster-box\\nof precious ointment! No marvel that women \"followed him from Galilee,\" stood sorrowfully beholding\\nhis crucifixion, and when he was taken from the cross, \"followed after and beheld the sepulcher,\\nand how his body was laid.\" Their devotion was rewarded, on the morning of his resurrection,\\nby their being made the first messengers of his glorious triumph. On such perfect equality\\nwere men and women placed by the blessed Savior as to terms of salvation and Gospel privileges,\\nthat the apostle exclaims, \"In Christ Jesus there is neither male nor female.\" All are members\\nof his body, and in him all become one.\\n\\nAs Christian influences more fully control society, and as the spirit of Christ permeates the\\nmasses, the position of woman becomes more elevated. She is no longer considered as a slave,\\nand compelled to bear every burden, as in savage life; nor is she a mere attendant, or minister\\nto sensual pleasure, as among the Mohammedans. The bars are removed from the doors of the harem,\\nand the veil is taken from her face. She sits with the family at the table, entertains her\\nguests, and enjoys their society. She studies with her brothers in the same school, recites\\nto the same teachers, and reads the same books. With her friends, she joins in the service\\nand song and worship of, the sanctuary, converses in the social assembly, and listens to distinguished\\nspeakers as they discuss topics of literature, art, science, or statesmanship. The cry of suffering\\nhumanity touches her heart, and she is deeply interested in the great movements toward the\\nelevation of the race. In this ascent, every step she has taken has been in opposition to the\\nprotest of the spirit of other civilizations, which yet lurks in many a breast. To be seen\\nby strangers, to have her face unveiled, to sit in public assemblies, to study sciences and\\narts, is contrary to nature, is an offense against purity, and tends to destroy her loveliness,--said\\nthese inveterate croakers. Yet society recognized her influence and power, and believed she\\nhad both rights and duties. Step by step, odious laws have been repealed, her right to her\\nown property has been in great measure secured, doors of usefulness have been opened before\\nher, her voice is welcomed from the platform, and her writings from the press. She visits the\\nsick and the prisoner, and pleads for the suffering, until hospitals and asylums are founded\\nin their behalf. She soothes the sorrows of the aged, takes the hand of the orphan to lead\\nhim in paths of safety, and in the tumult of war ministers to the wounded and dying.\\n\\nAmidst her general activity, many questions arise as to what further avenues of usefulness\\nmay properly open. How far may she engage in business, and in what branches? what is her proper\\nwork in the Church, and to what extent may she perform public religious services? is she properly\\na citizen, and what privileges or rights should she enjoy?--are inquiries which are considered\\nand discussed. The greatest interest is at present excited by the question, \"Should women have\\nthe ballot?\" and both in this country and in England it has able advocates and strong opponents.\\n\\nIt can not be denied that the answer of the large majority is in the negative, and that in\\nmany instances this answer comes in the form of the laugh of ridicule or in the sneer of contempt.\\nSuch is the fate of all incipient efforts for reformation; but where a cause is intrinsically\\njust, it can survive and triumph.\\n\\nWithout entering into the general discussion, two points may be briefly noted. First, this\\nquestion is considered only in Christian lands. It is not even heard of elsewhere. It is mooted\\nonly in countries where the Bible is placed in the hands of the common people. It is strong\\nonly where free institutions have been established, and where liberal ideas have prevailed.\\nIt is the outgrowth of Bible freedom. Secondly, many of its opponents are persons of strong\\nintellect, of broad views, of great benevolence, and of unquestioned piety. Yet in the opposition\\nwe find also all, or nearly all, of the most ignorant classes of society. We find also in the\\nopposition, with very few exceptions, the entire class of venders of intoxicating drinks, drunkards,\\ngamblers, and other notoriously vicious characters. Is there any reason for such an aggregation?\\nOn the other hand, the friends of the measure, though fewer in number, are generally found\\namong the intelligent and religious members of the community. It is true that a few of those\\nwho desired to be recognized as leaders of the movement are known as free-thinkers or infidels;\\nand a still smaller number have been advocates of free-love and other loathsome vagaries. The\\nopponents of the cause have skillfully presented their names as representatives of the idea,\\nand have thus cast such odium upon it that many timid persons, dreading even an apparent association\\nwith them, have feared to express their own convictions. These odious parties, however, are\\nvery few in number, and their influence is constantly diminishing. There can be no question\\nthat four-fifths of the friends of female suffrage are to-day active members of various Christian\\nChurches; and of them no small number are ministers distinguished for their learning, benevolence,\\nand piety.\\n\\nThe signs of the times indicate a determined struggle between temperance and intemperance.\\nThe use of intoxicating liquors is the source of nine-tenths of all the dark and terrible crimes\\nthat disgrace humanity. It whets the assassin\\'s dagger, and pours poison into the cup of the\\nsuicide. It beggars the laborer, breaks the heart of the anguished wife, and starves the helpless\\nchildren. It fills jails and penitentiaries with victims, and hospitals and asylums with the\\ninjured and hopelessly wrecked. It fastens on society an army of police to be supported, and\\nit oppresses the land with taxes. The money amassed by the venders buys our legislators, corrupts\\nour judges and governors, and controls our political parties. Who shall stay its ravages, or\\ncurtail its power?\\n\\nMy conviction is, and for years has been, that the only hope is in giving the ballot to women.\\nTrue, some women love strong drink, and some are vile; yet the vast majority are utterly opposed\\nto intemperance. None so well as the drunkard\\'s wife knows the terrible evil, or so keenly\\nfeels its pangs. Could the mother, who bows her head in sorrow as she beholds her loved boy\\nhastening to ruin; the wife, whose once affectionate husband has been transformed into a demon;\\nthe daughter, whose cheek has been mantled with shame at her father\\'s fall, and who has suffered\\nthe bitterness of blasted hopes and of dismal poverty,--could they have the ballot, how quickly\\nwould the rum-shops be closed, and our youth be preserved from multi-fold temptations! What\\nother triumph could compare with this?\\n\\nWith this conviction, I hail with pleasure this volume from the pen of Dr. Webster. It discusses\\nan important question calmly, clearly, forcibly. I may not agree with all of his positions,\\nor with some of his Biblical criticisms, yet I believe the work possesses much merit, will\\nlead to serious thoughtfulness, and be productive of good.\\n\\nI also rejoice that the enterprising publishers whose names appear on the imprint have added\\nthis volume to their catalogue, and have thus given the influence of their names, and their\\nwidely extended means of circulation, to a cause so intimately connected with the interests\\nof humanity. The Church, in its various denominations, and by its varied agencies, must ever\\nbe, as it ever has been, the leader and the guide in great moral movements.\\n\\nM. SIMPSON.\\n\\nWOMAN MAN\\'S EQUAL.\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\nNatural Rights.\\n\\nIn the discussion of the question of woman\\'s equality with man, I purpose to prove from the\\nBible, as I believe I can, that at the creation there was neither superiority nor inferiority\\nordained between Adam and Eve; and that the partial distinctions which have for ages existed,\\nand which still exist, are of man\\'s invention; and may, therefore with propriety, be examined,\\nand, where found unfair or oppressive, may be justly condemned.\\n\\nI hope also to be able to establish the fact, from history, that in every age, whenever an\\nopportunity has afforded itself, women have proved themselves to be fully men\\'s equals in intellectual\\ncapacity, in morality, industry, and religion; and that, in matters of government, they have\\nproved themselves to be as wise and judicious rulers as any of the opposite sex, under the\\nsame, or similar, circumstances. That the instances in which women have been called to places\\nof power and responsibility in the State are comparatively rare, is not to be attributed to\\nnatural incapacity or mental inferiority, but to the fact of the persistent efforts made by\\nmen to keep them as much as possible in the background; that in many instances women have broken\\nthe fetters of oppression and prejudice by which they were bound, and have ascended the hill\\nof fame in advance of their male opponents. If, then, women have in other and darker ages over-leaped\\nthe formidable barriers placed in their way, and thus benefited their respective nations, and\\nsometimes the world, by their intrepidity, why should obstructions be placed in their path\\nnow, in this day of professed light and progress? Freedom, improvement, and righteousness ought\\nto be the watchwords of the nations.\\n\\nAfter enduring years of ridicule and contempt, the advocates of women\\'s rights begin to see\\nsome slight indications that their labors have not been altogether futile. Both in England\\nand America the movement is now making considerable progress. Persons of wealth, of high position\\nin the social scale, and of sound education, have become its warm friends and advocates; but,\\nso hard is it to remove old-time prejudice, it is probable that many years may yet elapse before\\nwomen will be allowed to enjoy equal rights and privileges with men.\\n\\nAll great reforms, whether European or American, are of slow growth, and are usually denounced\\nas running counter to Scripture and common sense; as witness the discussions on the disestablishment\\nof the Irish Church in Britain, and on the abolition of slavery in the United States; both\\nof which reforms were fiercely assailed as contrary to the Word of God and reason, and declared\\nto be in fact the offspring of infidelity. But, like these two great reforms, when movements\\nof vital importance are once inaugurated, their arriving at perfection is but a matter of time.\\nRight is almost always sure to prevail in the end.\\n\\nThe claiming for women equality with men, not only in mental capacity, but in civil and ecclesiastical\\nrights, may shock the preconceived opinions of many persons, and will probably subject the\\nindividual advancing such views to the charge of fanaticism and false teaching; yet we conceive\\nthe claim to be consistent with reason, justice, and the Word of God; and its full recognition\\nto be of vital importance to the entire race of mankind. In the discussion of this question,\\nthe object will not be to flatter women, or to give offense to men; but simply to present the\\nrequirements of impartial justice with regard to a portion of the human race, who, because\\nof their sex, have for centuries been held in a position little, if any, better than that of\\nslaves; and who, up to the present time, are deprived of their natural rights and privileges\\nby the laws of our own and other countries, professedly civilized, enlightened, and Christian.\\nWhile, therefore, the injustice suffered, both in the past and the present, by women, will\\nbe briefly presented in the following pages, there is still no wish to deprive the \"lords of\\ncreation\" of any really God-appointed privilege. But should we happen to come in contact with\\nthe selfishness and the usurped prerogatives of men, we will not hesitate to expose what we\\nconceive to be grievous wrongs, because of their antiquity.\\n\\nThere is no human tie so sacred as that of marriage; and yet there is no covenant so generally\\nviolated in some way or other by many of the contracting parties. The alliance, it is true,\\nmay be continued, and even observed, so far as the letter is concerned. But what of the spirit?\\nWhen once true confidence is lost, the sublime and exalted character of the relation is destroyed.\\nThere is no longer any genuine affection, or real union of heart, between the parties. Nothing\\nwill destroy mutual confidence between two parties sooner than an arrogant assumption by one\\nof them of fancied superiority over the other. Self-respect is an inherent principle in human\\nnature. The mind of prince and peasant is alike actuated by it, and by an instinctive desire\\nfor freedom and independence of action, for the advantages of civil and religious liberty,\\nand for the exercise of individual rights; and this instinctive desire is no less strong in\\nthe hearts of women than of men. It is impossible for a woman of proper discernment, and of\\nrefined taste and liberal education, to consider herself, simply because of her sex, inferior\\nto her own male relatives, or indeed to any one of the opposite sex, of the same intellectual\\npowers, literary attainments, and position in society. Nothing but the influence of a misdirected\\nor perverted education, or the most extreme degradation and ignorance, can in any one induce\\nthe belief that woman is the inferior of man, merely because she is a woman.\\n\\nNo business firm could remain together in harmony for a single day, if it were understood that\\none of the partners assumed the position that he was superior to the other, who, prior to entering\\ninto the partnership, had been received in the same social circles, and who had brought into\\nthe business an equal proportion of funds and of business talent. And doubly preposterous would\\nthe assumption be, if it were based on the fact that the assumer was the larger or physically\\nstronger man; and, because possessed of more of the animal nature than his partner, it therefore\\nbecame his right to dictate to and control the other.\\n\\nSuch an assumption as this is no more absurd, nor is the reasoning upon which it is based more\\nillogical, than that which asserts that woman, because she is a woman, is therefore an inferior,\\nto be ruled at the discretion of her husband or sons in her own home; and that she ought to\\nbe contented to be considered such, and to be so treated by her own nation and in her own family.\\nThe carrying out of such an idea is more than absurd. It is monstrous. It is an imposition\\nthat has only been tolerated because the exactions are not in every case so bad as the system\\nis capable of enforcing; and it is one from which every advocate of Christian liberty, to be\\nconsistent with his profession, should withdraw both countenance and toleration.\\n\\nThe history of woman\\'s wrongs has for ages been written in tears, often with her life-blood;\\nand yet the volume has, in most instances, been concealed in her own bosom, notwithstanding\\nits fearful weight. But if, at any time, as sometimes happens, unable to keep it hidden longer,\\nshe unfolds the pages of her grief to others, what an outcry is raised against her! The oppressed\\nItalian peasant, the Russian serf, the Spanish or American black, all, if they are only of\\nthe male sex, may make their wrongs public, may even resist oppression to the death, and be\\napplauded for so doing. But let a woman speak so that she can be heard, no matter how great\\nthe outrages from which she has suffered, let her couch her timid complaint in ever such delicate\\nlanguage, and what a storm of invective is hurled at her! The very act of complaining is declared--by\\nthe advocates of her inferiority--to be in itself unwifely, indecent. \"A woman\\'s voice has\\nno business to be heard outside of her own house; nor there, if her lord decrees otherwise,\"\\nsay they. It is asserted that she has been induced to give publicity to her sorrows--indeed,\\nhas occasioned them--by peevishness or imprudence, or by something worse; and thus, by an,\\nunfair, sometimes an altogether false, issue being raised, the unhappy victim not merely of\\noppression, but of downright brutality, is shut off from justly merited sympathy. And women,\\ntoo, who are more fortunately situated, in possessing somewhat kinder husbands, or in being\\npossessed by them, shaping their views according to those entertained by the sterner sex, unite\\nwith them in the condemnation of a sorrow-stricken sister; and, instead of making her burden\\nlighter, contribute to increasing its weight. Such women having never felt the iron pierce\\ntheir own souls, can not realize the woes of those in whose bosoms the barb is rankling at\\nevery pulsation, and they weakly fancy that the sorrows of those suffering ones are but the\\ninventions of an ill-ordered mind, or, at most, that the picture has been overdrawn.\\n\\nUnkind men are not the only class, however, who assert the inferiority of the gentler sex.\\nIf they were, they might be disposed of in a very summary manner. There is another class not\\nless dangerous, not less tyrannical or less arrogant, though somewhat more plausible. These\\nspeak, when occasion suits, quite eloquently, often with indecorous flippancy, of the \"great\\ninfluence which the ladies are capable of exerting upon society;\" and for the qualified good\\nwhich the orators graciously concede that women have accomplished, or may be capable of accomplishing,\\nthey bespatter them with a sort of sneering praise that is absolutely insulting to a woman\\nof common sense. This style of fulsome flattery, with some degree of soft attention, graciously\\nbestowed upon women, these men deem adequate compensation for all the indignities put upon\\ntheir so-called inferiors. With what supreme contempt, therefore, must every right-minded woman\\nlisten to such harangues, or read them when in print!\\n\\nLearned orators and divines and grave professors may, indeed sometimes do, soar away almost\\nto the seventh heaven while recounting the heroic or generous actions of women in past ages.\\nAdmiring audiences are told that \"gentle women are the ministering angels, sent by the wisdom\\nof God to be the comforters of mankind upon earth, as the beloved of our hearths and homes;\\nthat the world, without the gentle hand of woman to alleviate our sorrows, would be a dark\\nand dreary solitude swept by the whirlwinds of despair.\" The delighted listeners are borne\\naway on the wings of fancy--alas! it is only fancy--till, in imagination, it would appear that\\nwoman had escaped from her worse than Egyptian bondage, had crossed, without trouble, the Red\\nSea, passed the dreadful wilderness, moved out from the plains of Moab, and, by some peculiar\\nmagic of her own, had been deftly wafted over Jordan into the promised land; that already she\\nhad gloried in the tumbling-down of the walls of Jericho, and had enjoyed the triumph of having\\nthe delegation of Gibeonites coming, in their old garments, to seek an alliance with her as\\nthe chosen of the Lord.\\n\\nBut let a woman allured by such an oration ask a right, and how soon the strain is changed!\\nLet her ask to be placed on an equality with man in regard to the holding of property, or to\\ncivil or ecclesiastical rights, or authority or position; let the daughters ask equal rights\\nand privileges with sons; let them request admission into the same colleges and universities\\nwith their brothers, so that they may compete with them for the honors and degrees conferred\\nin such institutions,--and what then? The flowery oratory is all gone. The \"angels,\" the \"heroic,\\nbrave, and virtuous women,\" have suddenly become agitators whose conduct is unseemly. They\\n\"are ambitious, indelicate, not to say immodest, bold-faced females\"--whether of the human\\nor some other race we are not told.\\n\\nForgetting, apparently, that the Creator\\'s universal law is liberty of thought and freedom\\nof action, coupled with a strict responsibility for the use of both, those who are opposed\\nto women exercising or enjoying equal rights with men, contend, as an excuse for their opposition,\\nthat some of the women engaged in the present reform movement are extravagant in their demands,\\nand abuse the privileges they already possess. Precisely the same thing was said of the slaves\\nin the South. Indeed, the same argument, variously worded, has been used by oppressors in all\\nages. \"Ye are idle, ye are idle,\" is a very old cry.\\n\\nBut, admitting that some women are injudicious and occasionally one is irreverent, are not\\nmen, in advocating their peculiar views on politics, the same, only in much larger proportion?\\nAre they, therefore, deprived of the franchise or other privileges? If men were obliged to\\ncome to such a standard as they lay down for women, they would consider the measure meted out\\nto them a very hard one. Still, if it is a just and fair way of dealing with woman\\'s suffrage\\nand other questions of importance, it is an equally just and fair way to deal with men concerning\\ntheir right to exercise the franchise.\\n\\nBut, though deprived of the civil and ecclesiastical privileges accorded to their sons and\\nbrothers, women are yet held equally accountable with them for any infraction of these same\\ncivil and ecclesiastical laws. Not supposed to have sufficient mental capacity to understand\\nwhat a law really means, she is yet, if she violates that law, punished for such violation.\\nAnd, in the face of all this, it is sneeringly asked, \"What can reasonable women want more\\nthan they already have?\" The answer is simple: Equal rights and privileges with men.\\n\\nAnd it is to be hoped, for the honor of Christianity and civilization, that these will soon\\nbe accorded.\\n\\nVery much has been accomplished in several of the States of the Republic, in regard to giving\\nwomen a proper position in civil and educational matters, but much still remains to be done;\\nand just now it would seem doubtful which country will first accord the suffrage to them--England\\nor the United States. Eminent statesmen in both of these countries are moving in the matter.\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nWoman in Antiquity.\\n\\nIn the preceding chapter it is mentioned that the intention is to present to the reader, in\\nas condensed a form as possible, some of the indignities put upon women, both in the past and\\nthe present, so that the reader may be able to form a candid judgment on the subject of woman\\'s\\nrights and woman\\'s wrongs. We will, therefore, first consider the condition of the women of\\nantiquity, and of those in heathen and Mohammedan lands; and, afterward, her position in professedly\\ncivilized and Christian countries.\\n\\nAfter the dispersion of mankind at Babel, we behold, through the mists of the surrounding gloom,\\nthe various tribes into which the race had by that event become divided, subsisting at first\\nby the spontaneous fruits of the earth, and by the chase. Then they became herdsmen, tillers\\nof the soil, and traffickers, varying these occupations by predatory warfare. They are all\\nastir, passing to and fro through the wide extent of the regions as yet inhabited. History,\\nso far as it deals with the earlier portion of this period, necessarily derives its material\\nfrom traditionary legends, more or less credible, as the case may be. These recount the marvelous\\nexploits--not unfrequently manifestly fabulous--of their rude heroes; their deeds of might,\\ntheir noble enterprises, their indomitable courage, their persistent activity, and often their\\ndeeds of most revolting cruelty.\\n\\nOf the women of this period we obtain but slight glimpses, but sufficient to show that, in\\ntheir domestic arrangements, the ancients early acted upon the principle, that \"might makes\\nright.\" Muscle appears to have been at a premium during these eras.\\n\\nLater, the nations are found still engaged in war, as if each esteemed the slaughtering of\\nits neighbors the grandest and noblest of human achievements; but their equipments indicate\\nthat, meanwhile, manufactures have been making some advancement. Warriors present a more formidable\\nappearance than did those of former ages. They are clad in armor, and guard themselves with\\nbreastplates and with shields. Their glittering swords and spears, their battle-axes and their\\nbows, are grasped in hands only too eager to use them; and the combatants press proudly on\\ntoward the scene of conflict; while others, equally intrepid, but less military in their tastes,\\nstill employ themselves in the chase; and the more indolent pursue pleasures of a less exciting\\ncharacter.\\n\\nBut where, meanwhile, are the counterparts of these--the wives, sisters, and daughters of these\\ngrim warriors and sturdy huntsmen, or of these dreaming idlers? In existence they certainly\\nare; but they exist only to drudge and suffer. While their masters are employing or non-employing\\nthemselves, according to the bent of their inclination, they are cultivating the fields or\\nwatering and herding the flocks, bearing heavy burdens, carrying the luggage of their husbands\\nto facilitate progress on the war-path; or at home rearing up children, who rarely rise up\\nto call them blessed; or they are waiting, in submissive obedience, at the feet of their reclining\\nlords, to be petted and caressed or cursed and kicked, as passion or caprice may dictate--subjected\\nalike to neglect, contempt, and abuse. Exceptions to this general rule doubtless occurred occasionally;\\nfor irresponsible power does not of necessity convert every man into an unfeeling tyrant, just\\nas under other systems of slavery, some were fortunate enough to fall into the hands of kind,\\nconsiderate owners, whose hearts they inspired with love and tenderness; but neither bound\\nwife nor bond slave was treated with kindness, respect, or common justice, because their inherent\\nright to be so treated was recognized. It mattered little to the women of this period whether\\nthey were held as wives or concubines; their actual condition was that of slavery.\\n\\nIn none of the countries of antiquity had women more liberty than in Egypt; and yet what was\\nher real condition there? Alexander remarked, it is true, that though \"the women')\n",
      "3 Pandas(Index=2, index=3, filename='suspicious-document00003.txt', text='I do not remember that I was \"very angry\" about Hooker\\'s despatch, as General Sherman says\\n(Vol. II, page 59), though I think Sherman was.  Indeed, he had more reason to be angry than\\nI; for the fact, and evidence of it, were so plain that the Twenty-third Corps had done its\\nduty as ordered, that if Hooker\\'s despatch was meant to imply the contrary, which I doubt,\\nthat was a cause of anger to the general-in-chief, whom he had unnecessarily alarmed, rather\\nthan to me, who had no apprehension of being suspected by the general-in-chief of having failed\\nin my duty.\\n\\nIn fact, I do not recollect having seen Hooker\\'s despatch at all until I saw it quoted in Sherman\\'s\\n\"Memoirs.\"  My recollection is that Sherman told me, on his visiting us the next day, that\\nhe had received during the battle a despatch from Hooker to the effect that his flank was unprotected.\\nIn reply to this I explained to General Sherman where my troops had been during the engagement,\\nand showed him the dead of the 14th Kentucky lying on the advanced ground they had held while\\nHascall\\'s division was forming.  I believe that if I had seen Hooker\\'s despatch at the time,\\nI should have interpreted it then, as I do now, as referring, not to his immediate right, but\\nto the extreme right of the line.  I do not recollect any words, \"pretty sharp\" or otherwise,\\nbetween General Hooker and myself on that subject, and do not believe it was ever mentioned\\nbetween us.  In short, I do not think I was present at the interview in the \"little church\"\\ndescribed by General Sherman (Sherman\\'s \"Memoirs,\" Vol. II, page 59).  I have an impression\\nthat General Hascall was there, and that it is to him General Sherman refers.  I believe the\\nKolb House difficulty was almost entirely a misapprehension between General Sherman and General\\nHooker.  Why this mistake was not explained at the time or afterward I do not know, unless\\nit was that the feelings of those two gentlemen toward each other were unfavorable to any such\\nexplanation.\\n\\nI will add that General Hooker and I were together both before and after the opening of the\\nKolb House engagement.  He knew perfectly well where my troops were, and what they were doing,\\nand it seems to me utterly impossible that he can have meant by his despatch what General Sherman\\nunderstood it to mean.\\n\\nMy despatches of that date to Sherman show that I had no special apprehension even in respect\\nto our extreme right flank, and that I doubted the report that one whole corps was in our front.\\n\\nMy orders on that day,( 2) show that Hascall was up with Hooker at the intersection of the\\nMarietta and Powder Spring roads, near the Kolb House, as early as 3 P. M., and that Cox was\\nordered up with three brigades at 4:15 P. M., before the assault began.  Cox arrived with the\\nhead of his column during the enemy\\'s attack, and was directed by me in person where and how\\nto put his troops in position.  Hence I think I must be right in the inference that in Hooker\\'s\\ndespatch to Sherman of 5:30 P. M., the words \"our extreme right flank\" must have been intended\\nto refer to my extreme right, and not his.  He was simply unduly apprehensive for the safety\\nof the extreme right flank of the army, not of his own corps in particular.  My report to General\\nSherman at 9 P. M. simply shows that I did not share that apprehension; that, instead of believing\\nthere were \"three entire corps in front of us,\" I doubted whether there was even all of Hood\\'s\\ncorps.\\n\\nGeneral Hooker\\'s habit of swinging off from the rest of General Thomas\\'s army, and getting\\npossession of roads designated for McPherson or for me, was a common subject of remark between\\nSherman, Thomas, McPherson, and myself; and his motive was understood to be, as General Sherman\\nstates, to get command of one of the armies, in the event of battle, by virtue of his senior\\ncommission.  But the subject was never mentioned between General Hooker and me, and he never\\neven approximated to giving me an order.  No doubt he entertained the opinion that he would\\nhave a right to give orders to either General McPherson or myself under certain circumstances\\nlikely to arise, for General Sherman entertained the same opinion. What General Thomas thought\\non the question I never knew.  My own opinion and McPherson\\'s were decidedly the contrary.\\n\\n                            CONVERSATION OVER THE QUESTION OF RELATIVE RANK\\n\\nIn the final movement which resulted in the withdrawal of Johnston\\'s army from Kenesaw, the\\nArmy of the Tennessee passed by the right flank of my infantry line along the famous Sandtown\\nRoad.  While this was going on, McPherson and I sat on our horses together a long time, observing\\nthe movement and renewing the familiar intercourse of our youth.  We had a long and free conversation\\non a great variety of subjects--a rare opportunity for commanders, even in the same army, where\\ntheir troops were generally from ten to twenty miles apart in line of battle.  One of the first\\nsubjects that came up was that question of relative rank; for our troops had \"met\" and were\\nthen \"doing duty together,\" in the language of the old article of war.  But the subject was\\nquickly dismissed with the remark, made almost simultaneously by both, that such a question\\ncould not possible cause any difficulty between us.  McPherson had the senior commission of\\nmajor-general, and I the senior assignment as army commander.  Perhaps it would have puzzled\\neven Halleck to frame a satisfactory decision in that peculiar case.  I had long before determined\\nwhat my decision would be if that question ever became a practical one between McPherson and\\nmyself on the field of battle.  I would have said, in substance at least:  \"Mac, just tell\\nme what you want me to do.\"\\n\\nAs we sat together that day, McPherson confided to me the secret of his marriage engagement,\\nfor the purpose, as he stated, of inquiring whether, in my opinion, he could before long find\\na chance to go home and get married.  I told him I thought that after the capture of Atlanta\\noperations would be suspended long enough for that.  But my dear and noble friend was killed\\nin the next great battle.  After Atlanta had fallen I went home, as McPherson would doubtless\\nhave done if he had lived; but our common friend and classmate Hood cut the visit so short\\nthat there would have been little time for marriage festivities.\\n\\nMcPherson, among other high qualities, was one of the most generous men I ever knew.  He was\\nremarkably skilful in topographical drawing, etching, lettering, and all other uses of the\\npen.  Although at the head of the class and a most conscientious student whose time was very\\nvaluable to himself, he would spend a very large part of that precious time in \"lettering\"\\nproblems for classmates who needed such help.  For this reason and others he was, by common\\nconsent of all the classes, the most popular man in the corps.  I could not compete with \"Mac\"\\nat all in the lettering business, but I tried to follow his good example, in my own way, by\\nhelping the boys over knotty points in \"math\" and \"phil.\"  I had taught district school one\\nwinter before going to West Point, and hence had acquired the knack of explaining things.\\n\\nHood was not well up in mathematics.  The first part of the course especially he found very\\nhard--so much so that he became discouraged. After the unauthorized festivities of Christmas,\\nparticularly, he seemed much depressed.  On the 26th he asked me which I would prefer to be,\\n\"an officer of the army or a farmer in Kentucky?\"  I replied in a way which aroused his ambition\\nto accomplish what he had set out to do in coming to West Point, without regard to preference\\nbetween farming and soldiering.  He went to work in good earnest, and passed the January examinations,\\nthough by a very narrow margin. From that time on he did not seem to have so much difficulty.\\nWhen we were fighting each other so desperately fifteen years later, I wondered whether Hood\\nremembered the encouragement I had given him to become a soldier, and came very near thinking\\nonce or twice that perhaps I had made a mistake.  But I do not believe that public enmity ever\\ndiminished my personal regard for my old friend and classmate.\\n\\n                                   VISIT TO THE CAMP OF FRANK P. BLAIR, JR.\\n\\nIn thinking of McPherson, I recall an interesting incident connected with Frank P. Blair, Jr.\\'s\\narrival with his corps about June 9, referred to by General Sherman (Vol. II, page 24).  For\\nsome reason we had an afternoon\\'s rest the day after Blair arrived; so I rode over to his camp--seven\\nor eight miles, perhaps--to greet my old friend.  McPherson, to whose army Blair\\'s corps belonged,\\nand other officers were there.  To our immense surprise, Blair had brought along great hogsheads\\nof ice and numerous baskets of champagne, as if to increase the warmth of our welcome.  Of\\ncourse we did not disdain such an unusual treat in the enemy\\'s country.  About sunset McPherson\\ninvited me to visit his camp, and we started off at a full gallop, which we kept up all the\\nway, yet it was some time after dark when we reached the headquarters of the Army of the Tennessee.\\nA good camp supper was awaiting us, with jolly young officers to make it merry.  It was not\\nuntil supper was ended that I began to realize the necessity of a night\\'s march to get back\\nto my own camp.  As our infantry line was twenty miles long, and the cavalry stretched it out\\non either flank as many more, my single orderly was quite sufficient protection from any attack\\nby the enemy; but the Georgia bushes, brambles, and mud, combined with the absence of any known\\nroad, constituted an enemy hard to overcome. However, by the aid of the compass which I have\\nalways carried in my head since I used to hunt in the wilds of the West, I got back to camp,\\nand went to bed, taking care not to observe the time of night by my watch.\\n\\nAs I have said, I was often much annoyed by General Hooker\\'s corps getting possession of roads\\nwhich had been designated for mine to advance upon, thus greatly delaying my movements.  But\\nit is but just to say that this is susceptible of an explanation much more creditable to General\\nHooker than that given by General Sherman. General Thomas\\'s army was so large that he could\\nnever get his three corps into position as soon as expected by the use of the roads designated\\nfor him.  Hence, when Hooker was not in advance he would \"switch off\" and hunt for another\\nroad to the right or left, and thus sometimes strike in ahead of McPherson or me, and leave\\nus no road at all to move on.  In fact, the army was so large and the roads were so few that\\nour movements were often painfully slow and tedious, and General Hooker\\'s motive may have been\\nonly to get ahead and bring his corps into action or to the position assigned to it in whatever\\nway he could.\\n\\n                                  ANECDOTE OF SHERMAN AND HOOKER UNDER FIRE\\n\\nThe first time I ever saw General Sherman and General Hooker together, or got even a suspicion\\nthat their personal relations were other than the most satisfactory, was at Resaca.  Cox\\'s\\ndivision had gained possession of some portions of the enemy\\'s outer works, so that from a\\nbald hill just in rear of our line some parts of the main line of defense could be distinctly\\nseen.  Upon my informing General Sherman of this, he soon appeared on the ground, accompanied\\nor closely followed by a large number of general and staff officers. Besides Sherman, Thomas,\\nHooker, and Newton, a score of others were there, all eager to see what they could of the now\\nfamous stronghold which McPherson had refrained from assaulting.  I led them to the hill, on\\nwhich a few dead trees were still standing, and from which the much-desired view could be obtained.\\nOf course all were on foot, yet they were too numerous not to attract the attention of the\\nenemy.  Very soon the sound of musketry in front, then not very heavy, was varied by the sharp\\nexplosion of a shell overhead, and fragments of branches of dead trees came falling all around.\\nA general \"scatteration\" occurred in all directions save one.  Newton and I, who were conversing\\nat the time, quietly stepped aside a few paces out of the line of fire, where we were much\\nsafer than we would have been in full retreat, and then turned round to see what had become\\nof our companions.  All save two had disappeared, even Thomas having abandoned the field, probably\\nfor the first and only time in his life.  But still there, on the bald hill, in full view of\\nthe hostile artillery, were the two already highly distinguished generals, Sherman and Hooker,\\nboth alike famous for supreme courage, striding round the ground, appearing to look at nothing\\nin particular and not conversing with each other, but seeming at least a foot taller than usual,\\neach waiting for the other to lead off in retreat.  After quite a long continuance of this\\nlittle drama, which greatly entertained Newton and me, the two great soldiers, as if by some\\nmysterious impulse,--for they did not speak a word,--simultaneously and slowly strode to the\\nrear, where their horses were held.  I cheerfully gave the \"Johnny Rebs\" credit for the courtesy\\nof not firing another shot after they saw the effect of the first, which I doubt not was intended\\nonly as a gentle hint that such impudence in Yankees was not to be tolerated.  Yet a single\\nshell from the same direction,--probably from the same battery,--when we were moving into action\\nthat morning, exploded near my head, and killed the aide who was riding behind me.( 3)  My\\ntoo numerous staff and escort had attracted attention. I had at Dalton a few days before forbade\\nthe staff and escort to follow me into action, unless specially ordered to do so; but they\\nhad not so soon learned the lesson which the sad casualty at Resaca taught them.  It was then\\nearly in the campaign.  Later, both generals and orderlies had learned to restrain somewhat\\ntheir curiosity and their too thoughtless bravery.  The perfect old soldier has learned to\\neconomize the life and strength of men, including his own, with somewhat the same care that\\nhe does those of artillery horses and transportation mules.  It is only the young soldier who\\ndoes not know the difference between husbanding the national resources and showing cowardice\\nin face of the enemy.\\n\\nAt Wilson\\'s Creek, where the brave Lyon was killed in August, 1861, and where the gallant volunteers\\non both sides had fought with almost unexampled courage, standing up to their work all the\\ntime, until one third of their numbers were killed or wounded, and their forty rounds of ammunition\\ngone, the little companies of old, regular Indian-fighters had been deployed as skirmishers\\nin close order, behind trees and bushes and hillocks, and had suffered comparatively small\\nlosses.  The following colloquy occurred between one of them and a volunteer whose cartridge-box,\\nas he was proud to show, was empty.  Volunteer:  \"How many shots did you fire?\" Old soldier\\n(looking into his cartridge-box):  \"I fired just nineteen.\"  Volunteer:  \"And how many rebs\\ndo you think you killed?\" Old soldier:  \"I guess I killed about nineteen.\"\\n\\nOne beautiful, quiet Sunday afternoon, in front of Atlanta, when even the pickets were respecting\\nthe Sabbath day, my headquarters band, which had been playing selections of sacred music, easily\\nheard on the other side of the lines, struck up a favorite Southern air of quite a different\\ncharacter.  Quickly came a shell crashing through the trees far over our heads.  The band as\\nquickly took the hint and changed the tune.  Such little \"courtesies\" from our \"friends the\\nenemy\" were not at all uncommon in the short intervals of rest from deadly work.\\n\\n                                                     THE ASSAULT ON KENESAW\\n\\nGeneral Sherman says in Vol. II, page 60, of his \"Memoirs\":\\n\\n\"During the 24th and 25th of June, General Schofield extended his right as far as prudent,\\nso as to compel the enemy to thin out his lines correspondingly, with the intention to make\\ntwo strong assaults at points where success would give us the greatest advantage.  I had consulted\\nGenerals Thomas, McPherson, and Schofield, and we all agreed that we could not with prudence\\nstretch out any more, and therefore there was no alternative but to attack \\'fortified lines\\'--a\\nthing carefully avoided up to that time.\"\\n\\nThe first sentence literally means that I extended my right \"with the intention,\" on my part,\\n\"to make two strong assaults,\" etc. But that is a mere verbal error.  General Sherman, of course,\\nmeant to say that the intention was his.\\n\\nThe second sentence is, perhaps, ambiguous.  At least it has been construed to mean more than\\nthe truth.  It is undoubtedly true that \"we all agreed that we could not with prudence stretch\\nout any more,\" but we did not agree in the conclusion \"and therefore there was no alternative,\"\\netc.\\n\\nIndeed, such conclusion was extremely illogical, as was demonstrated a few days later, when\\none of the other \"alternatives\" was adopted with success.  This successful movement was essentially\\nthe same as that which had been previously made to dislodge the enemy from Dalton, and that\\nby which Sherman\\'s army had been transferred from New Hope Church to the railroad in front\\nof Allatoona, as well as that by which Atlanta was afterward captured.  Hence the existence\\nof this \"alternative\" could not have been unthought of by any of us at the time of the assault\\non Kenesaw.\\n\\nBut there was another alternative in this and similar cases, which was much discussed at various\\ntimes during the campaign.  Its practicability can be judged of only upon general principles,\\nfor it was never tried.  It was to detach two or three corps, nearly half our army (which was\\nabout double the strength of the enemy), make a detour wide enough to avoid his fortifications,\\nand strike directly at his flank and rear.  Such a movement, it was urged, at Dalton, Kenesaw,\\nor Atlanta would have compelled Johnston to fight a battle on equal terms with one half of\\nSherman\\'s army, while he had to hold his parapets against the other half.  Whatever else may\\nbe said of this proposed movement, it would undoubtedly have been more hazardous and much more\\ndecisive, one way or the other, than any of the plans actually adopted.  It certainly promised\\nsuccess proportionate to the cost, instead of a costly failure, which the assault of fortified\\nlines had almost invariably proved to be.\\n\\nI did not see Thomas or McPherson for some days before the assault, but I believe their judgment,\\nlike mine, was opposed to it. Undoubtedly it was generally opposed, though deferentially as\\nbecame subordinates toward the commanding general.  The responsibility was entirely Sherman\\'s,\\nas he afterward frankly stated; and I presume he did not mean to imply otherwise by the language\\nused in his \"Memoirs\" above quoted (Vol. II, page 60).  General Sherman\\'s orders, issued on\\nJune 24 (Special Field Orders, No. 28), directed each of the three armies to make an attack\\n(under the word \"assault\" for Thomas and \"attack\" for McPherson and me).  I had made all preparations\\nto carry out the order on my part.  Being visited by General Sherman a day or two before the\\ndate named for the execution of the order (June 27), I explained to him what I had done, and\\nhow little hope there was of success, on account of the smallness of my reserve to push the\\nadvantage even if we should break the line, when he at once replied that it was not intended\\nthat I should make an attack in front, but to make a strong demonstration in my front, and\\ngain what advantage I could on the enemy\\'s flank.  During the day Cox\\'s division forced the\\npassage of Olley\\'s Creek and secured a position on the head of Nickajack, which was spoken\\nof by Sherman as the only success of the day.\\n\\n                                                 TENDENCY OF VETERAN TROOPS\\n\\nThere were doubtless many occasions in the Atlanta campaign when the enemy\\'s intrenchments\\ncould have been assaulted with success. These were when the position had been but recently\\noccupied and the fortifications were very slight.  After several days\\' occupation, as at the\\npoints attacked by Thomas and McPherson, the lines became impregnable.  Frequent efforts were\\nmade, and by none more earnestly than by General Sherman, to press the troops to a vigorous\\nassault of the enemy\\'s position under the favorable circumstances above referred to.  But the\\ngeneral feeling of the army, including not only privates, but officers of nearly all grades,\\nwas undoubtedly opposed to such attacks.  The notion was very prevalent that there was no necessity\\nof fighting the enemy on unequal terms.  When attacked, either with or without cover, the troops\\nwould fight with the most determined valor, and almost invariably with success.  So when attacking\\nthe enemy in open ground there was no lack of energy or pluck.  But we lose one of the most\\nimportant lessons of the war if we fail to remember and appreciate the fact that our veteran\\ntroops are very loath to make an attack where they believe they have not a fair chance of success.\\nThis feeling must be attributed, not to a lack of high soldierly qualities, but to intelligence\\nand good sense.  The veteran American soldier fights very much as he has been accustomed to\\nwork his farm or run his sawmill:  He wants to see a fair prospect that it is \"going to pay.\"\\nHis loyalty, discipline, and pluck will not allow him under any circumstances to retreat without\\norders, much less to run away; but if he encounters a resistance which he thinks he cannot\\novercome, or which he thinks it would \"cost too much\" to overcome, he will lie down, cover\\nhimself with a little parapet, and hold his ground against any force that may attempt to drive\\nhim back.  This feeling of the soldier is an element in the problem of war which cannot be\\nignored. The general who, with such an army, would win the full measure of success due to greatly\\nsuperior numbers, must manoeuver so as to compel the enemy to fight him on approximately equal\\nterms, instead of assaulting fortifications where, against modern weapons, numbers are of little\\nor no avail.  In the days of the bayonet successful tactics consisted in massing a superior\\nforce upon some vital point, and breaking the enemy\\'s line.  Now it is the fire of the musket,\\nnot the bayonet, that decides the battle.  To mass troops against the fire of a covered line\\nis simply to devote them to destruction. The greater the mass, the greater the loss--that is\\nall.  A large mass has no more chance of success than a small one.  That this is absolutely\\ntrue since the introduction of breech-loaders is probably not doubted by any one; and it was\\nvery nearly true with the muzzle- loading rifles used during our late war, as was abundantly\\ndemonstrated on many occasions.\\n\\nI have always believed that the true tactics of our late war, whenever our force was double\\nthat of the enemy (as it sometimes was and always should have been at all points where decisive\\nmovements were to be made), were to throw one half the force upon the enemy\\'s rear, so as to\\ncompel him to attack that force or else retreat by side roads with loss of trains and artillery.\\nThis would doubtless have been a bold departure from the ancient tactics, which had not yet\\nbeen proved obsolete.  Yet I always thought it strange that our leading generals were unwilling\\nto attempt it. Had Sherman divided his army in such a way, and struck at Hood\\'s rear, he might\\nhave found a chance to destroy that army as well as the railroads in Georgia.\\n\\n                                      THE DEATH OF McPHERSON BEFORE ATLANTA\\n\\nThe death of McPherson, on July 22, was felt by all to be an irreparable loss, and by none\\nmore so than by General Sherman, who manifested deep feeling when the body was brought to the\\nHoward House, east of Atlanta.  I recollect well his remark to the effect that the whole of\\nthe Confederacy could not atone for the sacrifice of one such life.\\n\\nMy recollection of some of the incidents of that day differs in some respects from that of\\nGeneral Sherman.  As soon as it was known that the Army of the Tennessee was heavily engaged\\nI drew out of line the larger part of my troops, leaving the picket-line in position, with\\nstrong reserves behind the parapets, and massed them near my left, ready to send reinforcements\\nto the Army of the Tennessee if necessary, or to form a temporary left flank if the line on\\nmy left should be broken, as it was late in the day, as described by General Sherman.( 4)\\n\\nWhen that break was made in the line immediately to the left of mine, I had a rare opportunity\\nof witnessing Sherman\\'s splendid conduct as a simple soldier, the occasion for which occurs\\nso rarely to the general-in-chief of a great army.  Sherman at once sent to me for all my artillery,\\nwhich responded to his call at a full gallop.  He led the batteries in person to some high,\\nopen ground in front of our line near the Howard House, placed them in position, and directed\\ntheir fire, which from that advanced position enfiladed the parapets from which our troops\\nhad been driven, and which the enemy then occupied.  With the aid of that terrible raking fire,\\nthe division of Union troops very quickly regained the intrenchments they had lost.  General\\nSherman, on page 81, Vol. II, gives me the credit due to himself for that soldierly conduct\\nas an artillery commander.  I was occupied in forming my infantry reserve to meet the enemy\\nif Logan\\'s troops did not drive them back.  Only my artillery was used in restoring this broken\\nline, because Logan\\'s infantry proved sufficient without further aid. This action of mine was\\ntaken with General Sherman\\'s knowledge and approval, and was the correct thing to do, for the\\nreason that the ground in my front was such as to make both my position and that of the enemy\\npractically unassailable.  I had no apprehension of an attack in my front, and there was no\\nquestion of my attempting to \"make a lodgment in Atlanta\" that day, as stated by Sherman in\\nVol. II, page 80.\\n\\nIt was proposed by me that my reserve and Thomas\\'s should go the assistance of the Army of\\nthe Tennessee, either directly or, better still, by making a counter-attack in front of the\\nright of that army, which, if successful, would cut off the hostile force then attacking in\\nleft.  Sherman replied, as I recollect, that he had asked Thomas to send some troops to the\\nleft, and the latter had replied that he had none to spare.  Without these the proposition\\nto make a counter-attack could not be entertained.  But my memory is only that of conversations\\nwith General Sherman during the day, and he ought to be much better informed than I concerning\\nwhat passed between General Thomas and himself.  I recollect that General Sherman during the\\nday expressed something like a wish to \"let the Army of the Tennessee fight its own battle,\"\\nbut in his statement of motive for so doing I think he does that army injustice.  My impression\\nwas, and is, that they would have been very glad of assistance, and that timely help would\\nhave increased the fraternal feeling between the armies, instead of creating unworthy jealousy.\\n\\nI cannot but believe, as I then thought, that we were losing a great opportunity that day.\\nA large force of the enemy had made a wide circuit from his defenses about Atlanta and attacked\\nour left several miles distant.  We there had a chance to fight him on equal terms.  I thought,\\nand still think, we ought to have concentrated a large part of Thomas\\'s force and mine near\\nthe Howard House, and made a strong counter-attack upon this attacking column of the enemy,\\nwith the hope of cutting it off from Atlanta.  Instead of this, Thomas spent the day in efforts\\nto \"make a lodgment in Atlanta\" over well-prepared fortifications which the Georgia militia\\ncould hold against him about as well as the veteran Confederate troops.\\n\\nThe movement of August 4 and 5 was designed to be substantially what had been frequently suggested,\\nbut which I have heretofore referred to as having never been tried, with the exception that\\nthe attacking force was not to sever its connection with the main body, and hence might not\\nreach far enough to strike an exposed flank of the enemy.  But even with this modification\\nI thought the movement ought to have a fair chance of success.  That movement was not suggested\\nby me in any way, and, so far as I know, not by General Thomas.  I believe it originated entirely\\nwith General Sherman.  I never heard of it until I received his orders.  There was no \"argument\"\\nby me of the question of relative rank, as suggested by General Sherman (Vol. II, page 99).\\n\\n                             SHERMAN\\'S ERROR IN A QUESTION OF RELATIVE RANK\\n\\nThe positions of the troops when the order for the movement was made rendered it convenient\\nthat the Twenty-third Corps be put in first,--that is, next to the right of General Thomas\\'s\\ntroops then in position,--while the Fourteenth Corps, commanded by General John M. Palmer,\\nwas relied upon to develop rapidly to our right and endeavor to strike the enemy\\'s flank before\\nhe could extend his intrenched line far enough to meet and resist our attack.  It was not until\\nsome time after my orders for this movement had been issued and should have been in progress\\nof vigorous execution that I received the first intimation that the question of rank had been\\nraised, as stated by General Sherman, and that my orders had simply been transmitted to the\\ndivision commanders of the Fourteenth Corps.\\n\\nIt cannot for a moment be admitted that any share of the blame for that failure attaches to\\nthe Fourteenth Corps, as such.  Nor do I believe with General Sherman that its slowness on\\nthat occasion was due to anything \"imbibed\" from General Thomas.\\n\\n                             SHERMAN\\'S ERROR IN A QUESTION OF RELATIVE RANK\\n\\nMy own view of military duty was different from that entertained by the commander of the Fourteenth\\nCorps, as was shown in my subsequent action, hereinafter referred to, when I was ordered to\\nreport to and act under the orders of General Stanley.  But if the distinguished statesman\\nwho then commanded the Fourteenth Corps fell into error at that time, he has doubtless since\\nregretted it far more than any other man could possible do; and he has many times atoned for\\nthat error by the great services to the country which he has continued to render up to the\\npresent time.\\n\\nThe primary and principal cause of this and all similar difficulties during the Atlanta campaign\\nwas the grave error of opinion which disregarded the special rank of army and department commanders\\ngiven them by the President\\'s assignment under the law, and the still graver error of judgment\\nin leaving such an important question open until the eve of battle, in the \"hope that there\\nwould be no necessity for making this decision.\"  This error seems incomprehensible when it\\nis considered that it in effect nullified the President\\'s selection of army and department\\ncommanders at the most important of all moments, the crisis of battle, by making these commanders\\nsubject to the orders of any general of older commission whose troops happened to be adjacent\\nto theirs.\\n\\nIn the midst of battle, when the orders of a common superior cannot be obtained in time to\\nmeet an emergency, the highest commander present must give the necessary orders and must be\\nobeyed.  This is probably the gravest responsibility of war.  Yet Sherman\\'s opinion and decision\\nwould have placed this responsibility, not upon the army commander who had been selected by\\nthe President, upon the advice of the general-in-chief, under an act of Congress passed especially\\nfor the purpose, but upon some one who through political influence or otherwise had got an\\nearlier commission of major-general.  So many of the latter had proved to be unqualified for\\nresponsible command that Congress had enacted a special law authorizing the President to supersede\\nsuch prior commissions and assign commanders of armies or army corps in the field and in any\\ndepartment whom he deemed competent.( 5)  Palpable as this fallacy seems, yet it was adhered\\nto until overruled by the War Department.\\n\\nIt is proper for me to add that I had at that time but a very slight personal acquaintance\\nwith General Palmer.  However, I knew him well by reputation, and esteemed him highly.  General\\nThomas, especially, had given me a high estimate of his character and abilities.  If there\\nwas any cause of jealousy or ill-feeling between us, I never suspected it.\\n\\n[( 1) War Records, Vol. XXXVIII, part iv, p. 558.]\\n\\n[( 2) War Records, Vol. XXXVIII, part iv, pp. 566 and 568.]\\n\\n[( 3) Captain A.

What  was the Pirate\\nsaying? That he was the subject of their conversation was plain from the glances thrown at\\nhim; that he was at a crisis in his fate he knew by instinct; but, ignorant of the tongue they\\nspoke, he could but wait in fearful anxiety and mistrust.\\n\\nHe learned afterwards the purport of the talk.\\n\\n\"That is your man?\" said Angria. \\'You have deceived me.

Desmond threw a beseeching look at Diggle, and said hurriedly:\\n\\n\"Mr. Diggle, please tell me--\"\\n\\nBut Angria rose to his feet in wrath, and shouted to the man who had Desmond by the sleeve.\\nDesmond made no further resistance. His head swam as he passed between the dusky ranks out\\ninto the courtyard.\\n\\n\"What does it all mean?\" he asked himself.\\n\\nHis guide hurried him along until they came to a barn-like building under the northwest angle\\nof the fort. The Maratha unlocked the door, signed to Desmond to enter, and locked him in.\\nHe was alone.\\n\\nHe spent three miserable hours. Bitterly did he now regret having cast in his lot with the\\nsmooth-spoken stranger who had been so sympathetic with him in his troubles at home. He tried\\nto guess what was to be done with him. He was in Angria\\'s power, a prisoner, but to what end?\\nHad he run from the tyranny at home merely to fall a victim to a worse tyranny at the hands\\nof an oriental? He knew so little of Angria, and his brain was in such a turmoil, that he could\\nnot give definite shape to his fears.\\n\\nHe paced up and down the hot, stuffy shed, awaiting, dreading, he knew not what. Through the\\nhole that served for a window he saw men passing to and fro across the courtyard, but they\\nwere all swarthy, all alien; there was no one from whom he could expect a friendly word.\\n\\nToward evening, as he looked through the hole, he saw Diggle issue from the door of the palace\\nand cross towards the outer gate.\\n\\n\"Mr. Diggle! Mr. Diggle!\" he called. \"Please! I am locked up here.\"\\n\\nDiggle looked round, smiled, and leisurely approached the shed.\\n\\n\"Why have they shut me up here?\" demanded Desmond. \"Captain Barker said I was to return at\\nonce. Do get the door unlocked.\"\\n\\n\"You ask the impossible, my young friend,\" replied Diggle through the hole. \"You are here by\\nthe orders of Angria, and \\'twould be treason in me to pick his locks.\"\\n\\n\"But why? what right has he to lock me up? and you, why did you let him?

I implore you to release\\nme. What have I ever done to you? Don\\'t leave me in this awful place.\"\\n\\nDiggle smiled and began to move away. At the sight of his malicious smile the prisoner\\'s despair\\nwas swept away before a tempest of rage.\\n\\n\"You scoundrel! You shameless scoundrel!\"\\n\\nThe words, low spoken and vibrant with contempt, reached Diggle when he was some distance from\\nthe shed. He turned and sauntered back.\\n\\n\"Heia! contumeliosae voces! \\'Tis pretty abuse. My young friend, I must withdraw my ears from\\nsuch shocking language.

Horae momento cita mors yen it--you remember the phrase?\"\\n\\nDiggle leaned against the wooden wall, watching with malicious enjoyment the effect of his\\nwords. Desmond was very pale; all his strength seemed to have deserted him. Finding that his\\ntaunts provoked no reply, Diggle went on:\\n\\n\"Time presses, my young friend. You will be logged a deserter from the Good  Intent. \\'Tis my\\nfervent hope you never fall into the hands of Captain Barker; as you know, he is a terrible\\nman when roused.\"\\n\\nWaving  his  gloved  hand, he moved away. Desmond did not watch his departure.  Falling back\\nfrom the window, he threw himself upon the ground, and gave way to a long fit of black despair. \\n\\n§7. As the object of a just war is to obtain justice, a nation, when it has declared war, has\\na right to use all necessary means, and no other, for attaining that\\nend. A just war gives the right to take the life of the enemy; but\\nthere are limits to this right.\\nRanged along one of the walls, they squatted on the floor, and for some minutes afterwards\\nDesmond heard the clank of irons and the harsh grating of a key. Then a big Maratha came to\\nhim, searched him thoroughly, clapped iron bands upon his ankles, and locked the chains to\\nstaples in the wall. Soon the door was shut, barred, and locked, and Desmond found himself\\na prisoner with eight others.\\n\\nFor a little they spoke among themselves, in the low tones of men utterly spent and dispirited.\\nThen all was silent, and they slept. But Desmond lay wide awake, waiting for the morning.\\n\\nThe shed was terribly hot. Air came only through the one narrow opening, and before an hour\\nwas past the atmosphere was foul, seeming the more horrible to Desmond by contrast with the\\nfreshness of his life on the ocean. Mosquitoes nipped him until he could scarcely endure the\\nintense irritation. He would have given anything for a little water; but though he heard a\\nsentry pacing up and down outside, he did not venture to call to him, and could only writhe\\nin heat and torture, longing for the dawn, yet fearing it and what it might bring forth.\\n\\nWorn and haggard after his sleepless night, Desmond had scarcely spirit enough to look with\\ncuriosity on his fellow prisoners when the shed was faintly  lit by the morning sun. But he\\nsaw that the eight men, all natives, were lying on crude charpoys {mat beds} along the wall,\\neach man chained to a staple like his own. One of the men was awake; and, catching Desmond\\'s\\nlusterless eyes fixed upon him, he sat up and returned his gaze.\\n\\n\"Your Honor is an English gentleman?\"\\n\\nThe words caused Desmond to start: they were so unexpected in such a place. The Indian spoke\\nsoftly and carefully, as if anxious not to awaken his companions.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Desmond. \"Who are you?\"\\n\\n\"My name, sir, is Surendra Nath Chuckerbutti.

Videlicet, sir, this week a\\nfellow captive is minus a finger and thumb--and all for oversight of six annas {the anna is\\nthe 16th part of a rupee}. But I hear the step of our jailer; I must bridle my tongue.\"\\n\\nThe Babu had spoken throughout in a low monotonous tone that had not disturbed  the  slumbers\\nof his fellow prisoners. But they were all awakened by the noisy opening of the door and the\\nentrance of their jailer. He went to each in turn, and unlocked their fetters; then they filed\\nout in dumb submission, to be escorted by armed sentries to the different sheds where they\\nfed, each caste by itself.\\n\\nWhen the eight had disappeared the jailer turned to Desmond, and, taking him by the sleeve,\\nled him across the courtyard into the palace. Here, in a little room, he was given a meager\\nbreakfast of rice; after which he was taken to another room where he found Angria in company\\nwith a big Maratha, who had in his hand a long bamboo cane. The Pirate was no longer in durbar\\n{council, ceremonial} array, but was clad in a long yellow robe with a lilac-colored shawl.\\n\\nConscious that he made a very poor appearance in his tatters, Desmond felt that the two men\\nlooked at him with contempt. A brief conversation passed between them; then the Maratha salaamed\\nto Angria and went from the room, beckoning Desmond to follow him. They went out of the precincts\\nof the palace, and through a part of the town, until they arrived at the docks. There the laborers,\\nslaves and free, were already at work. Desmond at the first glance noticed several Europeans\\namong them, miserable objects who scarcely lifted their heads to look at this latest newcomer\\nof their race. His guide called up one of the foremen shipwrights, and instructed him to place\\nthe boy among a gang of the workmen. Then he went away. Scarcely a minute had elapsed when\\nDesmond heard a cry, and looking round, saw the man brutally belaboring with his rattan the\\nbare shoulders of a native. He quivered; the incident seemed of ill augury.\\n\\nIn a few minutes Desmond found himself among a gang of men who were working at a new gallivat\\nin process of construction for Angria\\'s own use. He received his orders in dumb show from the\\nforeman of the gang. Miserable as he was, he would not have been a boy if he had not been interested\\nin his novel surroundings; and no intelligent boy could have failed to take an interest in\\nthe construction of a gallivat. It was a large rowboat of from thirty to seventy tons, with\\ntwo masts, the mizzen being very slight. The mainmast bore one huge sail, triangular in form,\\nits peak extending to a considerable height above the mast. The smaller gallivats were covered\\nwith a spar deck made of split bamboos, their armament consisting of pettararoes fixed on swivels\\nin the gunwale. But the larger vessels had a fixed deck on which were mounted six or eight\\ncannon, from two to four pounders; and in addition to their sail they had from forty to fifty\\noars, so that, with a stout crew, they attained a rate of four or five miles an hour.\\n\\nOne of the first things Desmond learned was that the Indian mode of ship building differed\\nfundamentally from the European. The timbers were fitted in after the planks had been put together;\\nand the planks were put together, not with flat edges, but rabbited, the parts made to correspond\\nwith  the greatest exactness. When a plank was set up, its edge was smeared with red lead,\\nand the edge of the plank to come next was pressed down upon it, the inequalities in its surface\\nbeing thus shown by the marks of the lead. These being smoothed away, if necessary several\\ntimes, and the edges fitting exactly, they were rubbed with da\\'ma, a sort of glue that in course\\nof time became as hard as iron. The planks were then firmly riveted with pegs, and by the time\\nthe work was finished the seams were scarcely visible, the whole forming apparently one entire\\npiece of timber.\\n\\nThe process of building a gallivat was thus a very long and tedious one; but the vessel when\\ncompleted was so strong that it could go to sea for many years before the hull needed repair.\\n\\n')\n",

The weather was good, and the crew and equipment functioned perfectly. \\nIn every detail, the attack was carried out exactly as planned, and the bomb performed exactly\\nas expected.\\n\\nThe bomb exploded over Hiroshima at 8:15 on the morning of August 6, 1945.  About an hour previously,\\nthe Japanese early warning radar net had detected the approach of some American aircraft headed\\nfor the southern part of Japan.  The alert had been given and radio broadcasting stopped in\\nmany cities, among them Hiroshima.  The planes approached the coast at a very high altitude.\\nAt nearly 8:00 A.M., the radar operator in Hiroshima determined that the number of planes coming\\nin was very small--probably not more than three--and the air raid alert was lifted.  The normal\\nradio broadcast warning was given to the people that it might be advisable to go to shelter\\nif B-29\\'s were actually sighted, but no raid was expected beyond some sort of reconnaissance.\\nAt 8:15 A.M., the bomb exploded with a blinding flash in the sky, and a great rush of air and\\na loud rumble of noise extended for many miles around the city; the first blast was soon followed\\nby the sounds of falling buildings and of growing fires, and a great cloud of dust and smoke\\nbegan to cast a pall of darkness over the city.\\n\\nAt 8:16 A.M., the Tokyo control operator of the Japanese Broadcasting Corporation noticed that\\nthe Hiroshima station had gone off the air. He tried to use another telephone line to reestablish\\nhis program, but it too had failed.  About twenty minutes later the Tokyo railroad telegraph\\ncenter realized that the main line telegraph had stopped working just north of Hiroshima. \\nFrom some small railway stops within ten miles of the city there came unofficial and confused\\nreports of a terrible explosion in Hiroshima.  All these reports were transmitted to the Headquarters\\nof the Japanese General Staff.\\n\\nMilitary headquarters repeatedly tried to call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima.  The\\ncomplete silence from that city puzzled the men at Headquarters; they knew that no large enemy\\nraid could have occurred, and they knew that no sizeable store of explosives was in Hiroshima\\nat that time.  A young officer of the Japanese General Staff was instructed to fly immediately\\nto Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for\\nthe staff.  It was generally felt at Headquarters that nothing serious had taken place, that\\nit was all a terrible rumor starting from a few sparks of truth.\\n\\nThe staff officer went to the airport and took off for the southwest. After flying for about\\nthree hours, while still nearly 100 miles from Hiroshima, he and his pilot saw a great cloud\\nof smoke from the bomb. In the bright afternoon, the remains of Hiroshima were burning.\\n\\nTheir plane soon reached the city, around which they circled in disbelief.  A great scar on\\nthe land, still burning, and covered by a heavy cloud of smoke, was all that was left of a\\ngreat city.  They landed south of the city, and the staff officer immediately began to organize\\nrelief measures, after reporting to Tokyo.\\n\\nTokyo\\'s first knowledge of what had really caused the disaster came from the White House public\\nannouncement in Washington sixteen hours after Hiroshima had been hit by the atomic bomb.\\n\\nNagasaki\\n\\nNagasaki had never been subjected to large scale bombing prior to the explosion of the atomic\\nbomb there.  On August 1st, 1945, however, a number of high explosive bombs were dropped on\\nthe city.  A few of these bombs hit in the shipyards and dock areas in the southwest portion\\nof the city.  Several of the bombs hit the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works and six bombs landed\\nat the Nagasaki Medical School and Hospital, with three direct hits on buildings there.  While\\nthe damage from these few bombs were relatively small, it created considerable concern in Nagasaki\\nand a number of people, principally school children, were evacuated to rural areas for safety,\\nthus reducing the population in the city at the time of the atomic attack.\\n\\nOn the morning of August 9th, 1945, at about 7:50 A.M., Japanese time, an air raid alert was\\nsounded in Nagasaki, but the \"All clear\" signal was given at 8:30.  When only two B-29 superfortresses\\nwere sighted at 10:53 the Japanese apparently assumed that the planes were only on reconnaissance\\nand no further alarm was given.  A few moments later, at 11:00 o\\'clock, the observation B-29\\ndropped instruments attached to three parachutes and at 11:02 the other plane released the\\natomic bomb.\\n\\nThe bomb exploded high over the industrial valley of Nagasaki, almost midway between the Mitsubishi\\nSteel and Arms Works, in the south, and the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works (Torpedo Works),\\nin the north, the two principal targets of the city.\\n\\nDespite its extreme importance, the first bombing mission on Hiroshima had been almost routine.\\nThe second mission was not so uneventful. Again the crew was specially trained and selected;\\nbut bad weather introduced some momentous complications.  These complications are best described\\nin the brief account of the mission\\'s weaponeer, Comdr., now Capt., F. L.  Ashworth, U.S.N.,\\nwho was in technical command of the bomb and was charged with the responsibility of insuring\\nthat the bomb was successfully dropped at the proper time and on the designated target.  His\\nnarrative runs as follows:\\n\\n\"The night of our take-off was one of tropical rain squalls, and flashes of lightning stabbed\\ninto the darkness with disconcerting regularity.  The weather forecast told us of storms all\\nthe way from the Marianas to the Empire.  Our rendezvous was to be off the southeast coast\\nof Kyushu, some 1500 miles away.  There we were to join with our two companion observation\\nB-29\\'s that took off a few minutes behind us. Skillful piloting and expert navigation brought\\nus to the rendezvous without incident.\\n\\n\"About five minutes after our arrival, we were joined by the first of our B-29\\'s.  The second,\\nhowever, failed to arrive, having apparently been thrown off its course by storms during the\\nnight.  We waited 30 minutes and then proceeded without the second plane toward the target area.\\n\\n\"During the approach to the target the special instruments installed in the plane told us that\\nthe bomb was ready to function.  We were prepared to drop the second atomic bomb on Japan.\\nBut fate was against us, for the target was completely obscured by smoke and haze.  Three times\\nwe attempted bombing runs, but without success.  Then with anti-aircraft fire bursting around\\nus and with a number of enemy fighters coming up after us, we headed for our secondary target,\\nNagasaki.\\n\\n\"The bomb burst with a blinding flash and a huge column of black smoke swirled up toward us.\\nOut of this column of smoke there boiled a great swirling mushroom of gray smoke, luminous\\nwith red, flashing flame, that reached to 40,000 feet in less than 8 minutes.  Below through\\nthe clouds we could see the pall of black smoke ringed with fire that covered what had been\\nthe industrial area of Nagasaki.\\n\\n\"By this time our fuel supply was dangerously low, so after one quick circle of Nagasaki, we\\nheaded direct for Okinawa for an emergency landing and refueling\".\\n\\nGENERAL COMPARISON OF HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI\\n\\nIt was not at first apparent to even trained observers visiting the two Japanese cities which\\nof the two bombs had been the most effective.\\n\\nIn some respects, Hiroshima looked worse than Nagasaki.  The fire damage in Hiroshima was much\\nmore complete; the center of the city was hit and everything but the reinforced concrete buildings\\nhad virtually disappeared.  A desert of clear-swept, charred remains, with only a few strong\\nbuilding frames left standing was a terrifying sight.\\n\\nAt Nagasaki there were no buildings just underneath the center of explosion.  The damage to\\nthe Mitsubishi Arms Works and the Torpedo Works was spectacular, but not overwhelming.  There\\nwas something left to see, and the main contours of some of the buildings were still normal.\\n\\nAn observer could stand in the center of Hiroshima and get a view of the most of the city;\\nthe hills prevented a similar overall view in Nagasaki.  Hiroshima impressed itself on one\\'s\\nmind as a vast expanse of desolation; but nothing as vivid was left in one\\'s memory of Nagasaki.\\n\\nWhen the observers began to note details, however, striking differences appeared.  Trees were\\ndown in both cities, but the large trees which fell in Hiroshima were uprooted, while those\\nin Nagasaki were actually snapped off.  A few reinforced concrete buildings were smashed at\\nthe center in Hiroshima, but in Nagasaki equally heavy damage could be found 2,300 feet from\\nX.  In the study of objects which gave definite clues to the blast pressure, such as squashed\\ntin cans, dished metal plates, bent or snapped poles and like, it was soon evident that the\\nNagasaki bomb had been much more effective than the Hiroshima bomb.  In the description of\\ndamage which follows, it will be noted that the radius for the amount of damage was greater\\nin Nagasaki than Hiroshima.\\n\\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION OF DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE ATOMIC EXPLOSIONS\\n\\nIn considering the devastation in the two cities, it should be remembered that the cities\\'\\ndifferences in shape and topography resulted in great differences in the damages.  Hiroshima\\nwas all on low, flat ground, and was roughly circular in shape; Nagasaki was much cut up by\\nhills and mountain spurs, with no regularity to its shape.\\n\\nIn Hiroshima almost everything up to about one mile from X was completely destroyed, except\\nfor a small number (about 50) of heavily reinforced concrete buildings, most of which were\\nspecially designed to withstand earthquake shock, which were not collapsed by the blast; most\\nof these buildings had their interiors completely gutted, and all windows, doors, sashes, and\\nframes ripped out.  In Nagasaki, nearly everything within 1/2 mile of the explosion was destroyed,\\nincluding heavy structures.  All Japanese homes were destroyed within 1 1/2 miles from X.\\n\\nUnderground air raid shelters with earth cover roofs immediately below the explosion had their\\nroofs caved in; but beyond 1/2 mile from X they suffered no damage.\\n\\nIn Nagasaki, 1500 feet from X high quality steel frame buildings were not completely collapsed,\\nbut the entire buildings suffered mass distortion and all panels and roofs were blown in.\\n\\nIn Nagasaki, 2,000 feet from X, reinforced concrete buildings with 10\" walls and 6\" floors\\nwere collapsed; reinforced concrete buildings with 4\" walls and roofs were standing but were\\nbadly damaged.  At 2,000 feet some 9\" concrete walls were completely destroyed.\\n\\nIn Nagasaki, 3,500 feet from X, church buildings with 18\" brick walls were completely destroyed.\\n12\" brick walls were severely cracked as far as 5,000 feet.\\n\\nIn Hiroshima, 4,400 feet from X, multi-story brick buildings were completely demolished.  In\\nNagasaki, similar buildings were destroyed to 5,300 feet.\\n\\nIn Hiroshima, roof tiles were bubbled (melted) by the flash heat out to 4,000 feet from X;\\nin Nagasaki, the same effect was observed to 6,500 feet.\\n\\nIn Hiroshima, steel frame buildings were destroyed 4,200 feet from X, and to 4,800 feet in\\nNagasaki.\\n\\nIn both cities, the mass distortion of large steel buildings was observed out to 4,500 feet from X.\\n\\nIn Nagasaki, reinforced concrete smoke stacks with 8\" walls, specially designed to withstand\\nearthquake shocks, were overturned up to 4,000 feet from X.\\n\\nIn Hiroshima, steel frame buildings suffered severe structural damage up to 5,700 feet from\\nX, and in Nagasaki the same damage was sustained as far as 6,000 feet.\\n\\nIn Nagasaki, 9\" brick walls were heavily cracked to 5,000 feet, were moderately cracked to\\n6,000 feet, and slightly cracked to 8,000 feet. In both cities, light concrete buildings collapsed\\nout to 4,700 feet.\\n\\nIn Hiroshima, multi-story brick buildings suffered structural damage up to 6,600 feet, and\\nin Nagasaki up to 6,500 feet from X.\\n\\nIn both cities overhead electric installations were destroyed up to 5,500 feet; and trolley\\ncars were destroyed up to 5,500 feet, and damaged to 10,500 feet.\\n\\nFlash ignition of dry, combustible material was observed as far as 6,400 feet from X in Hiroshima,\\nand in Nagasaki as far as 10,000 feet from X.\\n\\nSevere damage to gas holders occured out to 6,500 feet in both cities.\\n\\nAll Japanese homes were seriously damaged up to 6,500 feet in Hiroshima, and to 8,000 feet\\nin Nagasaki.  Most Japanese homes were damaged up to 8,000 feet in Hiroshima and 10,500 feet\\nin Nagasaki.\\n\\nThe hillsides in Nagasaki were scorched by the flash radiation of heat as far as 8,000 feet\\nfrom X; this scorching gave the hillsides the appearance of premature autumn.\\n\\nIn Nagasaki, very heavy plaster damage was observed in many buildings up to 9,000 feet; moderate\\ndamage was sustained as far as 12,000 feet, and light damage up to 15,000 feet.\\n\\nThe flash charring of wooden telegraph poles was observed up to 9,500 feet from X in Hiroshima,\\nand to 11,000 feet in Nagasaki; some reports indicate flash burns as far as 13,000 feet from\\nX in both places.\\n\\nSevere displacement of roof tiles was observed up to 8,000 feet in Hiroshima, and to 10,000\\nfeet in Nagasaki.\\n\\nIn Nagasaki, very heavy damage to window frames and doors was observed up to 8,000 feet, and\\nlight damage up to 12,000 feet.\\n\\nRoofs and wall coverings on steel frame buildings were destroyed out to 11,000 feet.\\n\\nAlthough the sources of many fires were difficult to trace accurately, it is believed that\\nfires were started by primary heat radiation as far as 15,000 feet from X.\\n\\nRoof damage extended as far as 16,000 feet from X in Hiroshima and in Nagasaki.\\n\\nThe actual collapse of buildings was observed at the extreme range of 23,000 feet from X in\\nNagasaki.\\n\\nAlthough complete window damage was observed only up to 12,000 feet from X, some window damage\\noccurred in Nagasaki up to 40,000 feet, and actual breakage of glass occured up to 60,000 feet.\\n\\nHeavy fire damage was sustained in a circular area in Hiroshima with a mean radius of about\\n6,000 feet and a maximum radius of about 11,000 feet; similar heavy damage occured in Nagasaki\\nsouth of X up to 10,000 feet, where it was stopped on a river course.\\n\\nIn Hiroshima over 60,000 of 90,000 buildings were destroyed or severely damaged by the atomic\\nbomb; this figure represents over 67% of the city\\'s structures.\\n\\nIn Nagasaki 14,000 or 27% of 52,000 residences were completely destroyed and 5,400, or 10%\\nwere half destroyed.  Only 12% remained undamaged.  This destruction was limited by the layout\\nof the city. The following is a summary of the damage to buildings in Nagasaki as determined\\nfrom a ground survey made by the Japanese:\\n\\n  Destruction of Buildings and Houses          Number     Percentage\\n  (Compiled by Nagasaki Municipality)\\n\\n  Total in Nagasaki (before atomic explosion)  50,000     100.0\\n  Blasted (not burned)                          2,652       5.3\\n  Blasted and burned                           11,494      23.0\\n  Blasted and/or burned                        14,146      28.3\\n  Partially burned or blasted                   5,441      10.9\\n  Total buildings and houses destroyed         19,587      39.2\\n  Undamaged                                    30,413      60.8\\n\\nIn Hiroshima, all utilities and transportation services were disrupted for varying lengths\\nof time.  In general however services were restored about as rapidly as they could be used\\nby the depleted population. Through railroad service was in order in Hiroshima on 8 August,\\nand electric power was available in most of the surviving parts on 7 August, the day after\\nthe bombing.  The reservoir of the city was not damaged, being nearly 2 miles from X.  However,\\n70,000 breaks in water pipes in buildings and dwellings were caused by the blast and fire effects.\\nRolling transportation suffered extensive damage.  The damage to railroad tracks, and roads\\nwas comparatively small, however.  The electric power transmission and distribution systems\\nwere badly wrecked.  The telephone system was approximately 80% damaged, and no service was\\nrestored until 15 August.\\n\\nDespite the customary Japanese lack of attention to sanitation measures, no major epidemic\\nbroke out in the bombed cities.  Although the conditions following the bombings makes this\\nfact seem surprising, the experience of other bombed cities in both Germany and Japan show\\nHiroshima and Nagasaki not to be isolated cases.\\n\\nThe atomic explosion over Nagasaki affected an over-all area of approximately 42.9 square miles\\nof which about 8.5 square miles were water and only about 9.8 square miles were built up, the\\nremainder being partially settled.  Approximately 36% of the built up areas were seriously\\ndamaged.  The area most severely damaged had an average radius of about 1 mile, and covered\\nabout 2.9 square miles of which 2.4 were built up.\\n\\nIn Nagasaki, buildings with structural steel frames, principally the Mitsubishi Plant as far\\nas 6,000 feet from X were severely damaged; these buildings were typical of wartime mill construction\\nin America and Great Britain, except that some of the frames were somewhat less substantial.\\nThe damage consisted of windows broken out (100%), steel sashes ripped out or bent, corrugated\\nmetal or corrugated asbestos roofs and sidings ripped off, roofs bent or destroyed, roof trusses\\ncollapsed, columns bent and cracked and concrete foundations for columns rotated.  Damage to\\nbuildings with structural steel frames was more severe where the buildings received the effect\\nof the blast on their sides than where the blast hit the ends of buildings, because the buildings\\nhad more stiffness (resistance to negative moment at the top of columns) in a longitudinal\\ndirection.  Many of the lightly constructed steel frame buildings collapsed completely while\\nsome of the heavily constructed (to carry the weight of heavy cranes and loads) were stripped\\nof roof and siding, but the frames were only partially injured.\\n\\nThe next most seriously damaged area in Nagasaki lies outside the 2.9 square miles just described,\\nand embraces approximately 4.2 square miles of which 29% was built up.  The damage from blast\\nand fire was moderate here, but in some sections (portions of main business districts) many\\nsecondary fires started and spread rapidly, resulting in about as much over-all destruction\\nas in areas much closer to X.\\n\\nAn area of partial damage by blast and fire lies just outside the one just described and comprises\\napproximately 35.8 square miles.  Of this area, roughly 1/6th was built up and 1/4th was water.\\nThe extent of damage varied from serious (severe damage to roofs and windows in the main business\\nsection of Nagasaki, 2.5 miles from X), to minor (broken or occasionally broken windows at\\na distance of 7 miles southeast of X).\\n\\nAs intended, the bomb was exploded at an almost ideal location over Nagasaki to do the maximum\\ndamage to industry, including the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works, the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance\\nWorks (Torpedo Works), and numerous factories, factory training schools, and other industrial\\nestablishments, with a minimum destruction of dwellings and consequently, a minimum amount\\nof casualties.  Had the bomb been dropped farther south, the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works\\nwould not have been so severely damaged, but the main business and residential districts of\\nNagasaki would have sustained much greater damage casualties.\\n\\nCalculations show that the structural steel and reinforced concrete frames which survived the\\nblast fairly close to X could not have withstood the estimated peak pressures developed against\\nthe total areas presented by the sides and roof of the buildings.  The survival of these frames\\nis explained by the fact that they were not actually required to withstand the peak pressure\\nbecause the windows were quickly knocked out and roof and siding stripped off thereby reducing\\ntotal area and relieving the pressure.  While this saved the building frame, it permitted severe\\ndamage to building interior and contents, and injuries to the building occupants.  Buildings\\nwithout large panel openings through which the pressure could dissipate were completely crushed,\\neven when their frames were as strong as those which survived.\\n\\nThe damage sustained by reinforced concrete buildings depended both on the proximity to X and\\nthe type and strength of the reinforced concrete construction.  Some of the buildings with\\nreinforced concrete frames also had reinforced concrete walls, ceilings, and partitions, while\\nothers had brick or concrete tile walls covered either with plaster or ornamental stone, with\\npartitions of metal, glass, and plaster.  With the exception of the Nagasaki Medical School\\nand Hospital group, which was designed to withstand earthquakes and was therefore of heavier\\nconstruction than most American structures, most of the reinforced concrete structures could\\nbe classified only as fair, with concrete of low strength and density, with many of the columns,\\nbeams, and slabs underdesigned and improperly reinforced.  These facts account for some of\\nthe structural failures which occured.\\n\\nIn general, the atomic bomb explosion damaged all windows and ripped out, bent, or twisted\\nmost of the steel window or door sashes, ripped doors from hinges, damaged all suspended wood,\\nmetal, and plaster ceilings.  The blast concussion also caused great damage to equipment by\\ntumbling and battering.  Fires generally of secondary origin consumed practically all combustible\\nmaterial, caused plaster to crack off, burned all wooden trim, stair covering, wooden frames\\nof wooden suspended ceilings, beds, mattresses, and mats, and fused glass, ruined all equipment\\nnot already destroyed by the blast, ruined all electrical wiring, plumbing, and caused spalling\\nof concrete columns and beams in many of the rooms.\\n\\nAlmost without exception masonry buildings of either brick or stone within the effective limits\\nof the blast were severely damaged so that most of them were flattened or reduced to rubble.\\nThe wreckage of a church, approximately 1,800 feet east of X in Nagasaki, was one of the few\\nmasonry buildings still recognizable and only portions of the walls of this structure were\\nleft standing.  These walls were extremely thick (about 2 feet).  The two domes of the church\\nhad reinforced concrete frames and although they were toppled, they held together as units.\\n\\nPractically every wooden building or building with timber frame within 2.0 miles of X was either\\ncompletely destroyed or very seriously damaged, and significant damage in Nagasaki resulted\\nas far as 3 miles from X.  Nearly all such buildings collapsed and a very large number were\\nconsumed by fire.\\n\\n')\n",

I don\\'t believe much in this running around business\\nand I. don\\'t want to see the colored people do it. I am a colored man and I ain\\'t sorry, and\\nI want to see the colored people like what is good and what I want them to have, and that\\'s\\nto live regular and work hard and understand things, and that\\'s enough to keep any decent man\\nexcited.\" Jeff Campbell spoke now with some anger. Not to Melanctha, he did not think of her\\nat all when he was talking. It was the life he wanted that he spoke to, and the way he wanted\\nthings to be with the colored people.\\n\\nBut Melanctha Herbert had listened to him say all this. She knew he meant it, but it did not\\nmean much to her, and she was sure some day he would find out, that it was not all, of real\\nwisdom. Melanctha knew very well what it was to have real wisdom. \"But how about Jane Harden?\"\\nsaid Melanctha to Jeff Campbell, \"seems to me Dr. Campbell you find her to have something in\\nher, and you go there very often, and you talk to her much more than you do to the nice girls\\nthat stay at home with their people, the kind you say you are really wanting. It don\\'t seem\\nto me Dr. Campbell, that what you say and what you do seem to have much to do with each other.\\nAnd about your being so good Dr. Campbell,\" went on Melanctha, \"You don\\'t care about going\\nto church much yourself, and yet you always are saying you believe so much in things like that,\\nfor people. It seems to me, Dr. Campbell you want to have a good time just like all us others,\\nand then you just keep on saying that it\\'s right to be good and you ought not to have excitements,\\nand yet you really don\\'t want to do it Dr. Campbell, no more than me or Jane Harden. No, Dr.\\nCampbell, it certainly does seem to me you don\\'t know very well yourself, what you mean, when\\nyou are talking.\"\\n\\nJefferson had been talking right along, the way he always did when he got started, and now\\nMelanctha\\'s answer only made him talk a little harder. He laughed a little, too, but very low,\\nso as not to disturb \\'Mis\\' Herbert who was sleeping very nicely, and he looked brightly at\\nMelanctha to enjoy her, and then he settled himself down to answer.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he began, \"it certainly does sound a little like I didn\\'t know very well what I do mean,\\nwhen you put it like that to me, Miss Melanctha, but that\\'s just because you don\\'t understand\\nenough about what I meant, by what I was just saying to you. I don\\'t say, never, I don\\'t want\\nto know all kinds of people, Miss Melanctha, and I don\\'t say there ain\\'t many kinds of people,\\nand I don\\'t say ever, that I don\\'t find some like Jane Harden very good to know and talk to,\\nbut it\\'s the strong things I like in Jane Harden, not all her excitements. I don\\'t admire the\\nbad things she does, Miss Melanctha, but Jane Harden is a strong woman and I always respect\\nthat in her. No I know you don\\'t believe what I say, Miss Melanctha, but I mean it, and it\\'s\\nall just because you don\\'t understand it when I say it. And as for religion, that just ain\\'t\\nmy way of being good, Miss Melanctha, but it\\'s a good way for many people to be good and regular\\nin their way of living, and if they believe it, it helps them to be good, and if they\\'re honest\\nin it, I like to see them have it. No, what I don\\'t like, Miss Melanctha, is this what I see\\nso much with the colored people, their always wanting new things just to get excited.\"\\n\\nJefferson Campbell here stopped himself in this talking. Melanctha Herbert did not make any\\nanswer. They both sat there very quiet.\\n\\nJeff Campbell then began again on the old papers. He sat there on the steps just above where\\nMelanctha was sitting, and he went on with his reading, and his head went moving up and down,\\nand sometimes he was reading, and sometimes he was thinking about all the things he wanted\\nto be doing, and then he would rub the back of his dark hand over his mouth, and in between\\nhe would be frowning with his thinking, and sometimes he would be rubbing his head hard to\\nhelp his thinking. And Melanctha just sat still and watched the lamp burning, and sometimes\\nshe turned it down a little, when the wind caught it and it would begin to get to smoking.\\n\\nAnd so Jeff Campbell and Melanctha Herbert sat there on the steps, very quiet, a long time,\\nand they didn\\'t seem to think much, that they were together. They sat there so, for about an\\nhour, and then it came to Jefferson very slowly and as a strong feeling that he was sitting\\nthere on the steps, alone, with Melanctha. He did not know if Melanctha Herbert was feeling\\nvery much about their being there alone together. Jefferson began to wonder about it a little.\\nSlowly he felt that surely they must both have this feeling. It was so important that he knew\\nthat she must have it. They both sat there, very quiet, a long time.\\n\\nAt last Jefferson began to talk about how the lamp was smelling. Jefferson began to explain\\nwhat it is that makes a lamp get to smelling. Melanctha let him talk. She did not answer, and\\nthen he stopped in his talking. Soon Melanctha began to sit up straighter and then she started\\nin to question.\\n\\n\"About what you was just saying Dr. Campbell about living regular and all that, I certainly\\ndon\\'t understand what you meant by what you was just saying. You ain\\'t a bit like good people\\nDr. Campbell, like the good people you are always saying are just like you. I know good people\\nDr. Campbell, and you ain\\'t a bit like men who are good and got religion. You are just as free\\nand easy as any man can be Dr. Campbell, and you always like to be with Jane Harden, and she\\nis a pretty bad one and you don\\'t look down on her and you never tell her she is a bad one.\\nI know you like her just like a friend Dr. Campbell, and so I certainly don\\'t understand just\\nwhat it is you mean by all that you was just saying to me. I know you mean honest Dr. Campbell,\\nand I am always trying to believe you, but I can\\'t say as I see just what you mean when you\\nsay you want to be good and real pious, because I am very certain Dr. Campbell that you ain\\'t\\nthat kind of a man at all, and you ain\\'t never ashamed to be with queer folks Dr. Campbell,\\nand you seem to be thinking what you are doing is just like what you are always saying, and\\nDr. Campbell, I certainly don\\'t just see what you mean by what you say.\"\\n\\nDr. Campbell almost laughed loud enough to wake \\'Mis\\' Herbert. He did enjoy the way Melanctha\\nsaid these things to him. He began to feel very strongly about it that perhaps Melanctha really\\nhad a good mind. He was very free now in his laughing, but not so as to make Melanctha angry.\\nHe was very friendly with her in his laughing, and then he made his face get serious, and he\\nrubbed his head to help him in his thinking.\\n\\n\"I know Miss Melanctha\" he began, \"It ain\\'t very easy for you to understand what I was meaning\\nby what I was just saying to you, and perhaps some of the good people I like so wouldn\\'t think\\nvery much, any more than you do, Miss Melanctha, about the ways I have to be good. But that\\'s\\nno matter Miss Melanctha. What I mean Miss Melanctha by what I was just saying to you is, that\\nI don\\'t, no, never, believe in doing things just to get excited. You see Miss Melanctha I mean\\nthe way so many of the colored people do it. Instead of just working hard and caring about\\ntheir working and living regular with their families and saving up all their money, so they\\nwill have some to bring up their children better, instead of living regular and doing like\\nthat and getting all their new ways from just decent living, the colored people just keep running\\naround and perhaps drinking and doing everything bad they can ever think of, and not just because\\nthey like all those bad things that they are always doing, but only just because they want\\nto get excited. No Miss Melanctha, you see I am a colored man myself and I ain\\'t sorry, and\\nI want to see the colored people being good and careful and always honest and living always\\njust as regular as can be, and I am sure Miss Melanctha, that that way everybody can have a\\ngood time, and be happy and keep right and be busy, and not always have to be doing bad things\\nfor new ways to get excited. Yes Miss Melanctha, I certainly do like everything to be good,\\nand quiet, and I certainly do think that is the best way for all us colored people. No, Miss\\nMelanctha too, I don\\'t mean this except only just the way I say it. I ain\\'t got any other meaning\\nMiss Melanctha, and it\\'s that what I mean when I am saying about being really good. It ain\\'t\\nMiss Melanctha to be pious and not liking every kind of people, and I don\\'t say ever Miss Melanctha\\nthat when other kind of people come regular into your life you shouldn\\'t want to know them\\nalways. What I mean Miss Melanctha by what I am always saying is, you shouldn\\'t try to know\\neverybody just to run around and get excited. It\\'s that kind of way of doing that I hate so\\nalways Miss Melanctha, and that is so bad for all us colored people. I don\\'t know as you understand\\nnow any better what I mean by what I was just saying to you. But you certainly do know now\\nMiss Melanctha, that I always mean it what I say when I am talking.\"\\n\\n\"Yes I certainly do understand you when you talk so Dr. Campbell. I certainly do understand\\nnow what you mean by what you was always saying to me. I certainly do understand Dr. Campbell\\nthat you mean you don\\'t believe it\\'s right to love anybody.\" \"Why sure no, yes I do Miss Melanctha,\\nI certainly do believe strong in loving, and in being good to everybody, and trying to understand\\nwhat they all need, to help them.\" \"Oh I know all about that way of doing Dr. Campbell, but\\nthat certainly ain\\'t the kind of love I mean when I am talking. I mean real, strong, hot love\\nDr. Campbell, that makes you do anything for somebody that loves you.\" \"I don\\'t know much about\\nthat kind of love yet Miss Melanctha. You see it\\'s this way with me always Miss Melanctha.\\nI am always so busy with my thinking about my work I am doing and so I don\\'t have time for\\njust fooling, and then too, you see Miss Melanctha, I really certainly don\\'t ever like to get\\nexcited, and that kind of loving hard does seem always to mean just getting all the time excited.\\nThat certainly is what I always think from what I see of them that have it bad Miss Melanctha,\\nand that certainly would never suit a man like me. You see Miss Melanctha I am a very quiet\\nkind of fellow, and I believe in a quiet life for all the colored people. No Miss Melanctha\\nI certainly never have mixed myself up in that kind of trouble.\"\\n\\n\"Yes I certainly do see that very clear Dr. Campbell,\" said Melanctha, \"I see that\\'s certainly\\nwhat it is always made me not know right about you and that\\'s certainly what it is that makes\\nyou really mean what you was always saying. You certainly are just too scared Dr. Campbell\\nto really feel things way down in you. All you are always wanting Dr. Campbell, is just to\\ntalk about being good, and to play with people just to have a good time, and yet always to\\ncertainly keep yourself out of trouble. It don\\'t seem to me Dr. Campbell that I admire that\\nway to do things very much. It certainly ain\\'t really to me being very good. It certainly ain\\'t\\nany more to me Dr. Campbell, but that you certainly are awful scared about really feeling things\\nway down in you, and that\\'s certainly the only way Dr. Campbell I can see that you can mean,\\nby what it is that you are always saying to me.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know about that Miss Melanctha, I certainly don\\'t think I can\\'t feel things very deep\\nin me, though I do say I certainly do like to have things nice and quiet, but I don\\'t see harm\\nin keeping out of danger Miss Melanctha, when a man knows he certainly don\\'t want to get killed\\nin it, and I don\\'t know anything that\\'s more awful dangerous Miss Melanctha than being strong\\nin love with somebody. I don\\'t mind sickness or real trouble Miss Melanctha, and I don\\'t want\\nto be talking about what I can do in real trouble, but you know something about that Miss Melanctha,\\nbut I certainly don\\'t see much in mixing up just to get excited, in that awful kind of danger.\\nNo Miss Melanctha I certainly do only know just two kinds of ways of loving. One kind of loving\\nseems to me, is like one has a good quiet feeling in a family when one does his work, and is\\nalways living good and being regular, and then the other way of loving is just like having\\nit like any animal that\\'s low in the streets together, and that don\\'t seem to me very good\\nMiss Melanctha, though I don\\'t say ever that it\\'s not all right when anybody likes it, and\\nthat\\'s all the kinds of love I know Miss Melanctha, and I certainly don\\'t care very much to\\nget mixed up in that kind of a way just to be in trouble.\"\\n\\nJefferson stopped and Melanctha thought a little.\\n\\n\"That certainly does explain to me Dr. Campbell what I been thinking about you this long time.\\nI certainly did wonder how you could be so live, and knowing everything, and everybody, and\\ntalking so big always about everything, and everybody always liking you so much, and you always\\nlooking as if you was thinking, and yet you really was never knowing about anybody and certainly\\nnot being really very understanding. It certainly is all Dr. Campbell because you is so afraid\\nyou will be losing being good so easy, and it certainly do seem to me Dr. Campbell that it\\ncertainly don\\'t amount to very much that kind of goodness.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you are right Miss Melanctha,\" Jefferson answered. \"I don\\'t say never, perhaps you\\nain\\'t right Miss Melanctha. Perhaps I ought to know more about such ways Miss Melanctha. Perhaps\\nit would help me some, taking care of the colored people, Miss Melanctha. I don\\'t say, no,\\nnever, but perhaps I could learn a whole lot about women the right way, if I had a real good\\nteacher.\"\\n\\n\\'Mis\\' Herbert just then stirred a little in her sleep. Melanctha went up the steps to the bed\\nto attend her. Dr. Campbell got up too and went to help her. \\'Mis\\' Herbert woke up and was\\na little better. Now it was morning and Dr. Campbell gave his directions to Melanctha, and\\nthen left her.\\n\\nMelanctha Herbert all her life long, loved and wanted good, kind and considerate people. Jefferson\\nCampbell was all the things that Melanctha had ever wanted. Jefferson was a strong, well built,\\ngood looking, cheery, intelligent and good mulatto. And then at first he had not cared to know\\nMelanctha, and when he did begin to know her he had not liked her very well, and he had not\\nthought that she would ever come to any good. And then Jefferson Campbell was so very gentle.\\nJefferson never did some things like other men, things that now were beginning to be ugly,\\nfor Melanctha. And then too Jefferson Campbell did not seem to know very well what it was that\\nMelanctha really wanted, and all this was making Melanctha feel his power with her always getting\\nstronger.\\n\\nDr. Campbell came in every day to see \\'Mis\\' Herbert. \\'Mis\\' Herbert, after that night they watched\\ntogether, did get a little better, but \\'Mis\\' Herbert was really very sick, and soon it was\\npretty sure that she would have to die. Melanctha certainly did everything, all the time, that\\nany woman could. Jefferson never thought much better of Melanctha while she did it. It was\\nnot her being good, he wanted to find in her. He knew very well Jane Harden was right, when\\nshe said Melanctha was always being good to everybody but that that did not make Melanctha\\nany better for her. Then too, \\'Mis\\' Herbert never liked Melanctha any better, even on the last\\nday of her living, and so Jefferson really never thought much of Melanctha\\'s always being good\\nto her mother.\\n\\nJefferson and Melanctha now saw each other, very often. They now always liked to be with each\\nother, and they always now had a good time when they talked to one another. They, mostly in\\ntheir talking to each other, still just talked about outside things and what they were thinking.\\nExcept just in little moments, and not those very often, they never said anything about their\\nfeeling. Sometimes Melanctha would tease Jefferson a little just to show she had not forgotten,\\nbut mostly she listened to his talking, for Jefferson still always liked to talk along about\\nthe things he believed in. Melanctha was liking Jefferson Campbell better every day, and Jefferson\\nwas beginning to know that Melanctha certainly had a good mind, and he was beginning to feel\\na little her real sweetness. Not in her being good to \\'Mis\\' Herbert, that never seemed to Jefferson\\nto mean much in her, but there was a strong kind of sweetness in Melanctha\\'s nature that Jefferson\\nbegan now to feel when he was with her.\\n\\n\\'Mis\\' Herbert was now always getting sicker. One night again Dr. Campbell felt very certain\\nthat before it was morning she would surely die. Dr. Campbell said he would come back to help\\nMelanctha watch her, and to do anything he could to make \\'Mis\\' Herbert\\'s dying more easy for\\nher. Dr. Campbell came back that evening, after he was through with his other patients, and\\nthen he made \\'Mis\\' Herbert easy, and then he came and sat down on the steps just above where\\nMelanctha was sitting with the lamp, and looking very tired. Dr. Campbell was pretty tired\\ntoo, and they both sat there very quiet.\\n\\n\"You look awful tired to-night, Dr. Campbell,\" Melanctha said at last, with her voice low and\\nvery gentle, \"Don\\'t you want to go lie down and sleep a little? You\\'re always being much too\\ngood to everybody, Dr. Campbell. I like to have you stay here watching to-night with me, but\\nit don\\'t seem right you ought to stay here when you got so much always to do for everybody.\\nYou are certainly very kind to come back, Dr. Campbell, but I can certainly get along to-night\\nwithout you. I can get help next door sure if I need it. You just go \\'long home to bed, Dr.\\nCampbell. You certainly do look as if you need it.\"\\n\\nJefferson was silent for some time, and always he was looking very gently at Melanctha.\\n\\n\"I certainly never did think, Miss Melanctha, I would find you to be so sweet and thinking,\\nwith me.\" \"Dr. Campbell\" said Melanctha, still more gentle, \"I certainly never did think that\\nyou would ever feel it good to like me. I certainly never did think you would want to see for\\nyourself if I had sweet ways in me.\"\\n\\nThey both sat there very tired, very gentle, very quiet, a long time. At last Melanctha in\\na low, even tone began to talk to Jefferson Campbell.\\n\\n\"You are certainly a very good man, Dr. Campbell, I certainly do feel that more every day I\\nsee you. Dr. Campbell, I sure do want to be friends with a good man like you, now I know you.\\nYou certainly, Dr. Campbell, never do things like other men, that\\'s always ugly for me. Tell\\nme true, Dr. Campbell, how you feel about being always friends with me. I certainly do know,\\nDr. Campbell, you are a good man, and if you say you will be friends with me, you certainly\\nnever will go back on me, the way so many kinds of them do to every girl they ever get to like\\nthem. Tell me for true, Dr. Campbell, will you be friends with me.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Miss Melanctha,\" said Campbell slowly, \"why you see I just can\\'t say that right out that\\nway to you. Why sure you know Miss Melanctha, I will be very glad if it comes by and by that\\nwe are always friends together, but you see, Miss Melanctha, I certainly am a very slow-minded\\nquiet kind of fellow though I do say quick things all the time to everybody, and when I certainly\\ndo want to mean it what I am saying to you, I can\\'t say things like that right out to everybody\\ntill I know really more for certain all about you, and how I like you, and what I really mean\\nto do better for you. You certainly do see what I mean, Miss Melanctha.\" \"I certainly do admire\\nyou for talking honest to me, Jeff Campbell,\" said Melanctha. \"Oh, I am always honest, Miss\\nMelanctha. It\\'s easy enough for me always to be honest, Miss Melanctha. All I got to do is\\nalways just to say right out what I am thinking. I certainly never have got any real reason\\nfor not saying it right out like that to anybody.\"\\n\\nThey sat together, very silent. \"I certainly do wonder, Miss Melanctha,\" at last began Jeff\\nCampbell, \"I certainly do wonder, if we know very right, you and me, what each other is really\\nthinking. I certainly do wonder, Miss Melanctha, if we know at all really what each other means\\nby what we are always saying.\" \"That certainly do mean, by what you say, that you think I am\\na bad one, Jeff Campbell,\" flashed out Melanctha. \"Why no, Miss Melanctha, why sure I don\\'t\\nmean any thing like that at all, by what I am saying to you. You know well as I do, Miss Melanctha,\\nI think better of you every day I see you, and I like to talk with you all the time now, Miss\\nMelanctha, and I certainly do think we both like it very well when we are together, and it\\nseems to me always more, you are very good and sweet always to everybody. It only is, I am\\nreally so slow-minded in my ways, Miss Melanctha, for all I talk so quick to everybody, and\\nI don\\'t like to say to you what I don\\'t know for very sure, and I certainly don\\'t know for\\nsure I know just all what you mean by what you are always saying to me. And you see, Miss Melanctha,\\nthat\\'s what makes me say what I was just saying to you when you asked me.\"\\n\\n\"I certainly do thank you again for being honest to me, Dr. Campbell,\" said Melanctha. \"I guess\\nI leave you now, Dr. Campbell. I think I go in the other room and rest a little. I leave you\\nhere, so perhaps if I ain\\'t here you will maybe sleep and rest yourself a little. This has been\\npainfully proved too often by those who see a friend suffering unnecessarily, and in the short-sighted\\nattempt to wrench the emotional microscope from his hand, simply\\ncause the hold to tighten and the magnifying power to increase.\\n\\nA careful, steady training of the physique opens the way for a better practice of the wholesome\\nphilosophy, and the microscope drops with the relaxation of the external tension which has helped\\nto hold it.\\n\\nEmotions are often not even exaggerated but are from the beginning imaginary; and there are\\nno more industrious imps of evil than these sham feelings. The imps have no better field for\\ntheir destructive work than in various forms of morbid, personal attachment, and in what is\\ncommonly called religion,--but which has no more to do with genuine religion than the abnormal\\npersonal likings have to do with love.\\n\\nIt is a fact worthy of notice that the two powers most helpful, most strengthening, when sincerely\\nfelt and realized, are the ones oftenest perverted and shammed, through morbid states and abnormal\\nnervous excitement. The sham is often so perfect an image of the reality that even the shammer\\nis deceived.\\n\\nTo tell one of these pseudo-religious women that the whole attitude of her externally sanctified\\nlife is a sham emotion, would rouse anything but a saintly spirit, and surprise her beyond\\nmeasure. Yet the contrast between the true, healthful, religious\\nfeeling and the sham is perfectly marked, even though both classes\\nfollow the same forms and belong to the same charitable societies.\\nWith the one, religion seems to be an accomplishment, with a rivalry\\nas to who can carry it to the finest point; with the other, it is\\na steadily growing power of wholesome use. He did not know what it was right that he should do\\nabout it. He wondered if it was just a little play that they were doing. If it was a play he\\ndid not want to go on playing, but if it was really that he was not very understanding, and\\nthat with Melanctha Herbert he could learn to really understand, then he was very certain he\\ndid not want to be a coward. It was very hard for him to know what he wanted. He thought and\\nthought, and always he did not seem to know any better what he wanted. At last he gave up this\\nthinking. He felt sure it was only play with Melanctha. \"No, I certainly won\\'t go on fooling\\nwith her any more this way,\" he said at last out loud to himself, when he was through with\\nthis thinking. \"I certainly will stop fooling, and begin to go on with my thinking about my\\nwork and what\\'s the matter with people like \\'Mis\\' Herbert,\" and Jefferson took out his book\\nfrom his pocket, and drew near to the lamp, and began with some hard scientific reading.\\n\\nJefferson sat there for about an hour reading, and he had really forgotten all about his trouble\\nwith Melanctha\\'s meaning. Then \\'Mis\\' Herbert had some trouble with her breathing. She woke\\nup and was gasping. Dr. Campbell went to her and gave her something that would help her. Melanctha\\ncame out from the other room and did things as he told her. They together made \\'Mis\\' Herbert\\nmore comfortable and easy, and soon she was again in her deep sleep.\\n\\nDr. Campbell went back to the steps where he had been sitting. Melanctha came and stood a little\\nwhile beside him, and then she sat down and watched him reading. By and by they began with\\ntheir talking. Jeff Campbell began to feel that perhaps it was all different. Perhaps it was\\nnot just play, with Melanctha. Anyway he liked it very well that she was with him. He began\\nto tell her about the book he was just reading.\\n\\nMelanctha was very intelligent always in her questions. Jefferson knew now very well that she\\nhad a good mind. They were having a very good time, talking there together. And then they began\\nagain to get quiet.\\n\\n\"It certainly was very good in you to come back and talk to me Miss Melanctha,\" Jefferson said\\nat last to her, for now he was almost certain, it was no game she was playing. Melanctha really\\nwas a good woman, and she had a good mind, and she had a real, strong sweetness, and she could\\nsurely really teach him. \"Oh I always like to talk to you Dr. Campbell\" said Melanctha, \"And\\nthen you was only just honest to me, and I always like it when a man is really honest to me.\"\\nThen they were again very silent, sitting there together, with the lamp between them, that\\nwas always smoking. Melanctha began to lean a little more toward Dr. Campbell, where he was\\nsitting, and then she took his hand between her two and pressed it hard, but she said nothing\\nto him. She let it go then and leaned a little nearer to him. Jefferson moved a little but\\ndid not do anything in answer. At last, \"Well,\" said Melanctha sharply to him. \"I was just\\nthinking\" began Dr. Campbell slowly, \"I was just wondering,\" he was beginning to get ready\\nto go on with his talking. \"Don\\'t you ever stop with your thinking long enough ever to have\\nany feeling Jeff Campbell,\" said Melanctha a little sadly. \"I don\\'t know,\" said Jeff Campbell\\nslowly, \"I don\\'t know Miss Melanctha much about that. No, I don\\'t stop thinking much Miss Melanctha\\nand if I can\\'t ever feel without stopping thinking, I certainly am very much afraid Miss Melanctha\\nthat I never will do much with that kind of feeling. Sure you ain\\'t worried Miss Melanctha,\\nabout my really not feeling very much all the time. I certainly do think I feel some, Miss\\nMelanctha, even though I always do it without ever knowing how to stop with my thinking.\" \"I\\nam certainly afraid I don\\'t think much of your kind of feeling Dr. Campbell.\" \"Why I think\\nyou certainly are wrong Miss Melanctha I certainly do think I feel as much for you Miss Melanctha,\\nas you ever feel about me, sure I do. I don\\'t think you know me right when you talk like that\\nto me. Tell me just straight out how much do you care about me, Miss Melanctha.\" \"Care about\\nyou Jeff Campbell,\" said Melanctha slowly. \"I certainly do care for you Jeff Campbell less\\nthan you are always thinking and much more than you are ever knowing.\"\\n\\nJeff Campbell paused on this, and he was silent with the power of Melanctha\\'s meaning. They\\nsat there together very silent, a long time. \"Well Jeff Campbell,\" said Melanctha. \"Oh,\" said\\nDr. Campbell and he moved himself a little, and then they were very silent a long time. \"Haven\\'t\\nyou got nothing to say to me Jeff Campbell?\" said Melanctha. \"Why yes, what was it we were\\njust saying about to one another. You see Miss Melanctha I am a very quiet, slow minded kind\\nof fellow, and I am never sure I know just exactly what you mean by all that you are always\\nsaying to me. But I do like you very much Miss Melanctha and I am very sure you got very good\\nthings in you all the time. You sure do believe what I am saying to you Miss Melanctha.\" \"Yes\\nI believe it when you say it to me, Jeff Campbell,\" said Melanctha, and then she was silent\\nand there was much sadness in it. \"I guess I go in and lie down again Dr. Campbell,\" said Melanctha.\\n\"Don\\'t go leave me Miss Melanctha,\" said Jeff Campbell quickly. \"Why not, what you want of\\nme Jeff Campbell?\" said Melanctha. \"Why,\" said Jeff Campbell slowly, \"I just want to go on\\ntalking with you. I certainly do like talking about all kinds of things with you. You certainly\\nknow that all right, Miss Melanctha.\" \"I guess I go lie down again and leave you here with\\nyour thinking,\" said Melanctha gently. \"I certainly am very tired to night Dr. Campbell. Good\\nnight I hope you rest well Dr. Campbell.\" Melanctha stooped over him, where he was sitting,\\nto say this good night, and then, very quick and sudden, she kissed him and then, very quick\\nagain, she went away and left him.\\n\\nDr. Campbell sat there very quiet, with only a little thinking and sometimes a beginning feeling,\\nand he was alone until it began to be morning')\n",

In view of the many attacks that have been made on our banking system--especially\\nthe Bank Act of 1844--by Chambers of Commerce and others before the war, it is rather surprising\\nthat so little criticism should have been heard of this Report, which practically advocates\\na return, as rapidly as possible, to the practice and principles imposed by that Act. The picture,\\nso minute in its touches, is true as death.\" Madame de Staël had many devoted friendships,\\nas would naturally be expected from the overwhelming wealth and ardor of her nature. Affinity\\nof genius and a common love of liberty drew Benjamin Constant and her into intimate relations; and she\\nmaintained for years still closer relations with the all-knowing, all-cultured August Schlegel,\\nwhose devouring egotism and ever-sensitive vanity put all her patience and generosity to the proof.\\n\\n\\nOne of the most interesting--especially to advocates of sound finance--points in its Report\\nis the implied condemnation that it pronounces on the methods by which the war has been financed\\nby our rulers. It points out that \"the need of the Government for funds wherewith to finance\\nthe war in excess of the amounts raised by taxation or by loans from the public has made necessary\\nthe creation of credits in their favour with the Bank of England.... The balances created by\\nthese operations passing by means of payments to contractors and others to the Joint Stock\\nbanks have formed the foundation of a great growth in their deposits, which have also been\\nswelled by the creation of credits in connection with the subscriptions to the various War\\nLoans.... The greatly increased volume of bank deposits, representing a corresponding increase\\nof purchasing power and, therefore, tending in conjunction with other causes to a great rise\\nof prices, has brought about a corresponding demand for legal tender currency which could not\\nhave been satisfied under the stringent provisions of the Act of 1844.\" Here we have the story\\nof bad war finance put as clearly as it can be. Mandeville\\'s Fable of the Bees is attacked in\\nthe Second Dialogue, where Lysicles expounds some Mandevillian views but is theologically an atheist,\\npolitically a revolutionary, and socially a leveller. In the Letter to Dion, however, Mandeville\\nassumes that Berkeley is charging him with all of these views, and accuses Berkeley of unfairness\\nand misrepresentation.\\n\\nNeither Alciphron nor the Letter to Dion caused much of a stir. The Letter never had a second edition,[1]\\nand is now exceedingly scarce. The significance of the Letter would be minor if it were confined\\nto its role in the exchange between Berkeley and Mandeville.[2] Berkeley\\nhad more sinners in mind than Mandeville, and Mandeville more critics\\nthan Berkeley. Considering that the Committee included an ex-Governor\\nof the Bank and the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury it could hardly have been expected\\nto use much plainer language concerning the failure of our rulers to get money out of us in\\nthe right way for the war and the vigour with which they made use of the demoralising weapon\\nof inflation.\\n\\nIt followed as a necessary consequence that the volume of legal tender currency had to be greatly\\nincreased. As prices rose wages rose with them, and so much more \"cash\" was needed in order\\nto pay for a turnover of goods which, fairly constant in volume, demanded more currency because\\nof their inflated prices. I know, Sir, that in drawing those Characters, you design\\'d them for\\nMonsters to be abhorr\\'d and detested; and in this you have succeeded to Admiration, at least\\nwith me; for I can assure you, that I never saw any two Interlocutors in the same Dialogue\\nor Drama, whose Behaviour and Principles I execrate more heartily, than I do theirs. And if\\nyou would read the Fable of the Bees impartially, you would be convinced of this, from my Description\\nof the Company I would chuse to converse with.\\n Strictly the amount\\n(about £5,000,000) by which these issues exceed the amount of gold and currency notes held\\nby those banks should be added to the figures of the present fiduciary issues given above.]\\n\\n\"There is also a certain amount of gold coin still in the hands of the public which ought to\\nbe added to the last-mentioned figure, but the amount is unknown.\"\\n\\nIt will be noted that the gold held by the banks (other than the Bank of England) and by the\\npublic has declined from £123 to £40 millions, according to the Committee\\'s estimate, while,\\non the other hand, the circulation of bank notes has risen by £27 millions and the issue of\\ncurrency notes has taken place to the tune of £259 millions (at the date of the Report; it\\nis now nearly £300 millions), making a net addition to legal tender currency of over £200 millions.\\nWhen we also remember that there has been a very heavy coinage of silver and copper, that the\\nBank of England\\'s deposits have risen by over £100 millions and the deposits of the other banks\\nby nearly £700 millions, and all this at a time when most of the industrial activity of the\\ncountry was going into the production of destructive weapons and the support of those who were\\nusing them, the behaviour of commodities of ordinary use in rising by nearly 100 per cent.\\nseems to be an example of remarkable moderation.

CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH\\n\\nIt has occurred to me that some reminiscences of a long life would be of interest to my family\\nand friends.\\n\\nMy memory goes back for more than eighty years.  I recall distinctly when about five years\\nold my mother took me to the school of Mrs. Westbrook, wife of the well-known pastor of the\\nDutch Reformed church, who had a school in her house, within a few doors.  The lady was a highly\\neducated woman, and her husband, Doctor Westbrook, a man of letters as well as a preacher.\\nHe specialized in ancient history, and the interest he aroused in Roman and Greek culture and\\nachievements has continued with me ever since.\\n\\nThe village of Peekskill at that time had between two and three thousand inhabitants.  Its\\npeople were nearly all Revolutionary families who had settled there in colonial times.  There\\nhad been very little immigration either from other States or abroad; acquaintance was universal,\\nand in the activities of the churches there was general co-operation among the members.  Church\\nattendance was so unanimous that people, young or old, who failed to be in their accustomed\\nplaces on Sunday felt the disapproval of the community.\\n\\nSocial activities of the village were very simple, but very delightful and healthful.  There\\nwere no very rich nor very poor. Nearly every family owned its own house or was on the way\\nto acquire one.  Misfortune of any kind aroused common interest and sympathy.  A helping hand\\nof neighborliness was always extended to those in trouble or distress.  Peekskill was a happy\\ncommunity and presented conditions of life and living of common interest, endeavor, and sympathy\\nnot possible in these days of restless crowds and fierce competition.\\n\\nThe Peekskill Academy was the dominant educational institution, and drew students not only\\nfrom the village but from a distance. It fitted them for college, and I was a student there\\nfor about twelve years.  The academy was a character-making institution, though it lacked the\\nthoroughness of the New England preparatory schools.  Its graduates entering into the professions\\nor business had an unusual record of success in life.  I do not mean that they accumulated\\ngreat fortunes, but they acquired independence and were prominent and useful citizens in all\\nlocalities where they settled.\\n\\nI graduated from the Peekskill Academy in 1852.  I find on the programme of the exercises of\\nthat day, which some old student preserved, that I was down for several original speeches,\\nwhile the other boys had mainly recitations.  Apparently my teachers had decided to develop\\nany oratorical talent I might possess.\\n\\nI entered Yale in 1852 and graduated in 1856.  The college of that period was very primitive\\ncompared with the university to which it has grown.  Our class of ninety-seven was regarded\\nas unusually large.  The classics and mathematics, Greek and Latin, were the dominant features\\nof instruction.  Athletics had not yet appeared, though rowing and boat-racing came in during\\nmy term.  The outstanding feature of the institution was the literary societies: the Linonia\\nand the Brothers of Unity.  The debates at the weekly meetings were kept up and maintained\\nupon a high and efficient plane.  Both societies were practically deliberative bodies and discussed\\nwith vigor the current questions of the day.  Under this training Yale sent out an unusual\\nnumber of men who became eloquent preachers, distinguished physicians, and famous lawyers.\\nWhile the majority of students now on leaving college enter business or professions like engineering,\\nwhich is allied to business, at that time nearly every young man was destined for the ministry,\\nlaw, or medicine.  My own class furnished two of the nine judges of the Supreme Court of the\\nUnited States, and a large majority of those who were admitted to the bar attained judicial\\nhonors. It is a singular commentary on the education of that time that the students who won\\nthe highest honors and carried off the college prizes, which could only be done by excelling\\nin Latin, Greek, and mathematics, were far outstripped in after-life by their classmates who\\nfell below their high standard of collegiate scholarship but were distinguished for an all-around\\ninterest in subjects not features in the college curriculum.\\n\\nMy classmates, Justice David J. Brewer and Justice Henry Billings Brown, were both eminent\\nmembers of the Supreme Court of the United States. Brewer was distinguished for the wide range\\nof his learning and illuminating addresses on public occasions.  He was bicentennial orator\\nof the college and a most acceptable one.  Wayne MacVeagh, afterwards attorney-general of the\\nUnited States, one of the leaders of the bar, also one of the most brilliant orators of his\\ntime, was in college with me, though not a classmate.  Andrew D. White, whose genius, scholarship,\\nand organization enabled Ezra Cornell to found Cornell University, was another of my college\\nmates. He became one of the most famous of our diplomats and the author of many books of permanent\\nvalue.  My friendship with MacVeagh and White continued during their lives, that is, for nearly\\nsixty years.  MacVeagh was one of the readiest and most attractive of speakers I ever knew.\\nHe had a very sharp and caustic wit, which made him exceedingly popular as an after-dinner\\nspeaker and as a host in his own house.  He made every evening when he entertained, for those\\nwho were fortunate enough to be his guests, an occasion memorable in their experience.\\n\\nJohn Mason Brown, of Kentucky, became afterwards the leader of the bar in his State, and was\\nabout to receive from President Harrison an appointment as justice of the Supreme Court when\\nhe died suddenly.  If he had been appointed it would have been a remarkable circumstance that\\nthree out of nine judges of the greatest of courts, an honor which is sought by every one of\\nthe hundreds of thousands of lawyers in the United States, should have been from the same college\\nand the same class.\\n\\nThe faculty lingers in my memory, and I have the same reverence and affection for its members,\\nthough sixty-five years out of college, that I had the day I graduated.  Our president, Theodore\\nD. Woolsey, was a wonderful scholar and a most inspiring teacher.  Yale has always been fortunate\\nin her presidents, and peculiarly so in Professor Woolsey.  He had personal distinction, and\\nthere was about him an air of authority and reserved power which awed the most radical and\\nrebellious student, and at the same time he had the respect and affection of all.  In his historical\\nlectures he had a standard joke on the Chinese, the narration of which amused him the more\\nwith each repetition.  It was that when a Chinese army was beleaguered and besieged in a fortress\\ntheir provisions gave out and they decided to escape. They selected a very dark night, threw\\nopen the gates, and as they marched out each soldier carried a lighted lantern.\\n\\nIn the faculty were several professors of remarkable force and originality.  The professor\\nof Greek, Mr. Hadley, father of the distinguished ex-president of Yale, was more than his colleagues\\nin the thought and talk of the undergraduates.  His learning and pre-eminence in his department\\nwere universally admitted.  He had a caustic wit and his sayings were the current talk of the\\ncampus. He maintained discipline, which was quite lax in those days, by the exercise of this\\nability.  Some of the boys once drove a calf into the recitation-room.  Professor Hadley quietly\\nremarked: \"You will take out that animal.  We will get along to-day with our usual number.\"\\nIt is needless to say that no such experiment was ever repeated.\\n\\nAt one time there was brought up in the faculty meeting a report that one of the secret societies\\nwas about to bore an artesian well in the cellar of their club house.  It was suggested that\\nsuch an extraordinary expense should be prohibited.  Professor Hadley closed the discussion\\nand laughed out the subject by saying from what he knew of the society, if it would hold a\\nfew sessions over the place where the artesian well was projected, the boring would be accomplished\\nwithout cost.  The professor was a sympathetic and very wise adviser to the students.  If any\\none was in trouble he would always go to him and give most helpful relief.\\n\\nProfessor Larned inspired among the students a discriminating taste for the best English literature\\nand an ardent love for its classics.  Professor Thacher was one of the most robust and vigorous\\nthinkers and teachers of his period.  He was a born leader of men, and generation after generation\\nof students who graduated carried into after-life the effects of his teaching and personality.\\nWe all loved Professor Olmstead, though we were not vitally interested in his department of\\nphysics and biology.  He was a purist in his department, and so confident of his principles\\nthat he thought it unnecessary to submit them to practical tests. One of the students, whose\\nroom was immediately over that of the professor, took up a plank from the flooring, and by\\nboring a very small hole in the ceiling found that he could read the examination papers on\\nthe professor\\'s desk.  The information of this reaching the faculty, the professor was asked\\nif he had examined the ceiling.  He said that was unnecessary, because he had measured the\\ndistance between the ceiling and the surface of his desk and found that the line of vision\\nconnected so far above that nothing could be read on the desk.\\n\\nTimothy Dwight, afterwards president, was then a tutor.  Learning, common sense, magnetism,\\nand all-around good-fellowship were wonderfully united in President Dwight.  He was the most\\npopular instructor and best loved by the boys.  He had a remarkable talent for organization,\\nwhich made him an ideal president.  He possessed the rare faculty of commanding and convincing\\nnot only the students but his associates in the faculty and the members of the corporation\\nwhen discussing and deciding upon business propositions and questions of policy.\\n\\nThe final examinations over, commencement day arrived.  The literary exercises and the conferring\\nof degrees took place in the old Center Church.  I was one of the speakers and selected for\\nmy subject \"The Hudson River and Its Traditions.\"  I was saturated from early association and\\nclose investigation and reading with the crises of the Revolutionary War, which were successfully\\ndecided on the patriots\\' side on the banks of the Hudson.  I lived near Washington Irving,\\nand his works I knew by heart, especially the tales which gave to the Hudson a romance like\\nthe Rhine\\'s. The subject was new for an academic stage, and the speech made a hit.  Nevertheless,\\nit was the saddest and most regretful day of my life when I left Yale.\\n\\nMy education, according to the standard of the time, was completed, and my diploma was its\\nevidence.  It has been a very interesting question with me how much the academy and the college\\ncontributed to that education.  Their discipline was necessary and their training essential.\\nFour years of association with the faculty, learned, finely equipped, and sympathetic, was\\na wonderful help. The free associations of the secret and debating societies, the campus, and\\nthe sports were invaluable, and the friendships formed with congenial spirits added immensely\\nto the pleasures and compensations of a long life.\\n\\nIn connection with this I may add that, as it has been my lot in the peculiar position which\\nI have occupied for more than half a century as counsel and adviser for a great corporation\\nand its creators and the many successful men of business who have surrounded them, I have learned\\nto know how men who have been denied in their youth the opportunities for education feel when\\nthey are in possession of fortunes, and the world seems at their feet.  Then they painfully\\nrecognize their limitations, then they know their weakness, then they understand that there\\nare things which money cannot buy, and that there are gratifications and triumphs which no\\nfortune can secure.  The one lament of all those men has been:  \"Oh, if I had been educated\\nI would sacrifice all that I have to obtain the opportunities of the college, to be able to\\nsustain not only conversation and discussion with the educated men with whom I come in contact,\\nbut competent also to enjoy what I see is a delight to them beyond anything which I know.\"\\n\\nBut I recall gratefully other influences quite as important to one\\'s education.  My father\\nwas a typical business man, one of the pioneers of river transportation between our village\\nand New York, and also a farmer and a merchant.  He was a stern man devoted to his family,\\nand, while a strict disciplinarian, very fond of his children.\\n\\nMy mother was a woman of unusual intellect bordering upon genius. There were no means of higher\\neducation at that period, but her father, who was an eminent lawyer, and her grandfather, a\\njudge, finding her so receptive, educated her with the care that was given to boys who were\\nintended for a professional life.  She was well versed in the literature of the time of Queen\\nElizabeth and Queen Anne, and, with a retentive memory, knew by heart many of the English classics.\\nShe wrote well, but never for publication. Added to these accomplishments were rare good sense\\nand prophetic vision.  The foundation and much of the superstructure of all that I have and\\nall that I am were her work.  She was a rigid Calvinist, and one of her many lessons has been\\nof inestimable comfort to me.  Several times in my life I have met with heavy misfortunes and\\nwhat seemed irreparable losses.  I have returned home to find my mother with wise advice and\\nsuggestions ready to devote herself to the reconstruction of my fortune, and to brace me up.\\nShe always said what she thoroughly believed:  \"My son, this which you think so great a calamity\\nis really divine discipline. The Lord has sent it to you for your own good, because in His\\ninfinite wisdom He saw that you needed it.  I am absolutely certain that if you submit instead\\nof repining and protesting, if you will ask with faith and proper spirit for guidance and help,\\nthey both will come to you and with greater blessings than you ever had before.\"  That faith\\nof my mother inspired and intensified my efforts and in every instance her predictions proved true.\\n\\nEvery community has a public-spirited citizen who unselfishly devotes himself or herself to\\nthe public good.  That citizen of Peekskill in those early days was Doctor James Brewer.  He\\nhad accumulated a modest competence sufficient for his simple needs as bachelor.  He was either\\nthe promoter or among the leaders of all the movements for betterment of the town.  He established\\na circulating library upon most liberal terms, and it became an educational institution of\\nbenefit.  The books were admirably selected, and the doctor\\'s advice to readers was always\\navailable. His taste ran to the English classics, and he had all the standard authors in poetry,\\nhistory, fiction, and essay.\\n\\nNo pleasure derived in reading in after-years gave me such delight as the Waverley Novels.\\nI think I read through that library and some of it several times over.\\n\\nThe excitement as the novels of Dickens and Thackeray began to appear equalled almost the enthusiasm\\nof a political campaign. Each one of those authors had ardent admirers and partisans. The characters\\nof Dickens became household companions.  Every one was looking for the counterpart of Micawber\\nor Sam Weller, Pecksniff or David Copperfield, and had little trouble in finding them either\\nin the family circle or among the neighbors.\\n\\nDickens\\'s lectures in New York, which consisted of readings from his novels, were an event\\nwhich has rarely been duplicated for interest.  With high dramatic ability he brought out before\\nthe audience the characters from his novels with whom all were familiar.  Every one in the\\ncrowd had an idealistic picture in his mind of the actors of the story.  It was curious to\\nnote that the presentation which the author gave coincided with the idea of the majority of\\nhis audience.  I was fresh from the country but had with me that evening a rather ultra-fashionable\\nyoung lady.  She said she was not interested in the lecture because it represented the sort\\nof people she did not know and never expected to meet; they were a very common lot.  In her\\nsubsequent career in this country and abroad she had to her credit three matrimonial adventures\\nand two divorces, but none of her husbands were of the common lot.\\n\\nSpeaking of Dickens, one picture remains indelibly pressed upon my memory.  It was the banquet\\ngiven him at which Horace Greeley presided.  Everybody was as familiar with Mr. Pickwick and\\nhis portrait by Cruikshank in Dickens\\'s works as with one\\'s father. When Mr. Greeley arose\\nto make the opening speech and introduce the guest of the evening, his likeness to this portrait\\nof Pickwick was so remarkable that the whole audience, including Mr. Dickens, shouted their\\ndelight in greeting an old and well-beloved friend.\\n\\nAnother educational opportunity came in my way because one of my uncles was postmaster of the\\nvillage.  Through his post-office came several high-class magazines and foreign reviews.  There\\nwas no rural delivery in those days, and the mail could only be had on personal application,\\nand the result was that the subscribers of these periodicals frequently left them a long time\\nbefore they were called for.  I was an omnivorous reader of everything available, and as a\\nresult these publications, especially the foreign reviews, became a fascinating source of information\\nand culture.  They gave from the first minds of the century criticisms of current literature\\nand expositions of political movements and public men which became of infinite value in after-years.\\n\\nAnother unincorporated and yet valuable school was the frequent sessions at the drug store\\nof the elder statesmen of the village. On certain evenings these men, representing most of\\nthe activities of the village, would avail themselves of the hospitable chairs about the stove\\nand discuss not only local matters but the general conditions of the country, some of them\\nrevolving about the constitutionality of various measures which had been proposed and enacted\\ninto laws.  They nearly all related to slavery, the compromise measures, the introduction of\\nslaves into new territories, the fugitive slave law, and were discussed with much intelligence\\nand information.  The boys heard them talked about in their homes and were eager listeners\\non the outskirts of this village congress.  Such institutions are not possible except in the\\nuniversal acquaintance, fellowship, and confidences of village and country life.  They were\\nthe most important factors in forming that public opinion, especially among the young, which\\nsupported Mr. Lincoln in his successful efforts to save the Union at whatever cost.\\n\\nA few days after returning home from Yale I entered the office of Edward Wells, a lawyer of\\nthe village, as a student.  Mr. Wells had attained high rank in his profession, was a profound\\nstudent of the law, and had a number of young men, fitting them for the bar under his direction.\\n\\nI was admitted to the bar in 1858, and immediately opened an office in the village.  My first\\nclient was a prosperous farmer who wanted an opinion on a rather complicated question.  I prepared\\nthe case with great care.  He asked me what my fee was, and I told him five dollars.  He said:\\n\"A dollar and seventy-five is enough for a young lawyer like you.\"  Subsequently he submitted\\nthe case to one of the most eminent lawyers in New York, who came to the same conclusion and\\ncharged him five hundred dollars. On account of this gentleman\\'s national reputation the farmer\\nthought that fee was very reasonable.  In subsequent years I have received several very large\\nretainers, but none of them gave so much satisfaction as that dollar and seventy-five cents,\\nwhich I had actually earned after having been so long dependent on my father.\\n\\nAfter some years of private practice Commodore Vanderbilt sent for me and offered the attorneyship\\nfor the New York and Harlem Railroad.  I had just been nominated and confirmed United States\\nminister to Japan.  The appointment was a complete surprise to me, as I was not an applicant\\nfor any federal position.  The salary was seven thousand five hundred dollars and an outfit\\nof nine thousand. The commodore\\'s offer of the attorneyship for the Harlem Railroad, which\\nwas his first venture in railroading, was far less than the salary as minister.  When I said\\nthis to the commodore, he remarked:  \"Railroads are the career for a young man; there is nothing\\nin politics.  Don\\'t be a damned fool.\"  That decided me, and on the 1st of January, 1921, I\\nrounded out fifty-five years in the railway service of this corporation and its allied lines.\\n\\nNothing has impressed me more than little things, and apparently immaterial ones, which have\\ninfluenced the careers of many people. My father and his brothers, all active business men,\\nwere also deeply interested in politics, not on the practical side but in policies and governmental\\nmeasures.  They were uncompromising Democrats of the most conservative type; they believed\\nthat interference with slavery of any kind imperilled the union of the States, and that the\\nunion of the States was the sole salvation of the perpetuity of the republic and its liberties.\\nI went to Yale saturated with these ideas.  Yale was a favorite college for Southern people.\\nThere was a large element from the slaveholding States among the students.  It was so considerable\\nthat these Southerners withdrew from the great debating societies of the college and formed\\na society of their own, which they called the Calliopean.  Outside of these Southerners there\\nwere very few Democrats among the students, and I came very near being drawn into the Calliopean,\\nbut happily escaped.\\n\\nThe slavery question in all its phases of fugitive slave law and its enforcement, the extension\\nof slavery into the new territories, or its prohibition, and of the abolition of the institution\\nby purchase or confiscation were subjects of discussion on the campus, in the literary societies,\\nand in frequent lectures in the halls in New Haven by the most prominent and gifted speakers\\nand advocates.\\n\\nThat was a period when even in the most liberal churches the pulpit was not permitted to preach\\npolitics, and slavery was pre-eminently politics.  But according to an old New England custom,\\nthe pastor was given a free hand on Thanksgiving Day to unburden his mind of everything which\\nhad been bubbling and seething there for a year.  One of the most eminent and eloquent of New\\nEngland preachers was the Reverend Doctor Bacon, of Center Church, New Haven.  His Thanksgiving\\nsermon was an event eagerly anticipated by the whole college community.  He was violently anti-slavery.\\nHis sermons were not only intently listened to but widely read, and their effect in promoting\\nanti-slavery sentiment was very great.\\n\\nThe result of several years of these associations and discussions converted me, and I became\\na Republican on the principles enunciated in the first platform of the party in 1856.  When\\nI came home from Yale the situation in the family became very painful, because my father was\\nan intense partisan.  He had for his party both faith and love, and was shocked and grieved\\nat his son\\'s change of principles.  He could not avoid constantly discussing the question,\\nand was equally hurt either by opposition or silence.\\n\\nII.  IN PUBLIC LIFE\\n\\nThe campaign of 1856 created an excitement in our village which had never been known since\\nthe Revolutionary War.  The old families who had been settled there since colonial days were\\nmainly pro-slavery and Democratic, while the Republican party was recruited very largely from\\nNew England men and in a minority.\\n\\nSeveral times in our national political campaigns there has been one orator who drew audiences\\nand received public attention and reports in the newspapers beyond all other speakers.  On\\nthe Democratic side during that period Horatio Seymour was pre-eminent. On the Republican side\\nin the State of New York the attractive figure was George William Curtis.  His books were very\\npopular, his charming personality, the culture and the elevation of his speeches put him in\\na class by himself.\\n\\nThe Republicans of the village were highly elated when they had secured the promise of Mr.\\nCurtis to speak at their most important mass meeting.  The occasion drew together the largest\\naudience the village had known, composed not only of residents but many from a distance.  The\\ncommittee of arrangements finally reported to the waiting audience that the last train had\\narrived, but Mr. Curtis had not come.\\n\\nIt suddenly occurred to the committee that it would be a good thing to call a young recruit\\nfrom a well-known Democratic family and publicly commit him.  First came the invitation, then\\nthe shouting, and when I arose they cried \"platform,\" and I was escorted to the platform, but\\nhad no idea of making a speech. My experience for years at college and at home had saturated\\nme with the questions at issue in all their aspects.  From a full heart, and a sore one, I\\npoured out a confession of faith. I thought I had spoken only a few minutes, but found afterwards\\nthat it was over an hour.  The local committee wrote to the State committee about the meeting,\\nand in a few days I received a letter from the chairman of the State committee inviting me\\nto fill a series of engagements covering the whole State of New York.\\n\\nThe campaign of 1856 differed from all others in memory of men then living.  The issues between\\nthe parties appealed on the Republican side to the young.  There had grown up among the young\\nvoters an intense hostility to slavery.  The moral force of the arguments against the institution\\ncaptured them.  They had no hostility to the South, nor to the Southern slaveholders; they\\nregarded their position as an inheritance, and were willing to help on the lines of Mr. Lincoln\\'s\\noriginal idea of purchasing the slaves and freeing them.  But the suggestion had no friends\\namong the slaveholders.  These young men believed that any extension or strengthening of the\\ninstitution would be disastrous to the country.  The threatened dissolution of the Union, secession,\\nor rebellion did not frighten them.\\n\\nPolitical conventions are the most interesting of popular gatherings. The members have been\\ndelegated by their fellow citizens to represent them, and they are above the average in intelligence,\\npolitical information of conditions in the State and nation, as the convention represents the\\nState or the republic.  The belief that they are generally boss-governed is a mistake.  The\\nparty leader, sometimes designated as boss, invariably consults with the strongest men there\\nare in the convention before he arrives at a decision.  He is generally successful, because\\nhe has so well prepared the way, and his own judgment is always modified and frequently changed\\nin these conferences.\\n\\nIn 1858 I had the first sensation of the responsibility of public office.  I was not an applicant\\nfor the place; in fact, knew nothing about it until I was elected a delegate to the Republican\\nState convention from the third assembly district of Westchester County.  The convention was\\nheld at Syracuse.  The Westchester delegates arrived late at night or, rather, early in the\\nmorning, and we came to the hotel with large numbers of other delegates from different sections\\nwho had arrived on the same train.  It was two o\\'clock, but the State leader, Thurlow Weed,\\nwas in the lobby of the hotel to greet the delegates.  He said to me:  \"You are from Peekskill.\\nWith whom are you studying law?\"  I answered: \"With Judge William Nelson.\"  \"Oh,\" he remarked,\\n\"I remember Judge Nelson well.  He was very active in the campaign of 1828.\" It was a feat\\nof memory to thus recall the usefulness of a local politician thirty years before.  I noticed,\\nas each delegate was introduced, that Mr. Weed had some neighborhood recollections of the man\\nwhich put a tag on him.\\n\\nThe next day, as we met the leader, he recalled us by name, the places where we lived, and\\nthe districts represented.  Mr. Blaine was the only other man I ever met or knew who possessed\\nthis extraordinary gift for party leadership.\\n\\nThere was a revolt in the convention among the young members, who had a candidate of their\\nown.  Mr. Weed\\'s candidate for governor was Edwin D. Morgan, a successful New York merchant,\\nwho had made a good record as a State senator.  I remember one of Mr. Weed\\'s arguments was\\nthat the Democrats were in power everywhere and could assess their office-holders, while the\\nRepublicans would have to rely for campaign funds upon voluntary contributions, which would\\ncome nowhere so freely as from Mr. Morgan and his friends.  When the convention met Mr. Weed\\nhad won over a large majority of the delegates for his candidate.  It was a triumph not only\\nof his skill but of his magnetism, which were always successfully exerted upon a doubtful member.\\n\\nI was elected to the assembly, the popular branch of the New York Legislature, in 1861.  I\\nwas nominated during an absence from the State, without being a candidate or knowing of it\\nuntil my return.  Of course, I could expect nothing from my father, and my own earnings were\\nnot large, so I had to rely upon a personal canvass of a district which had been largely spoiled\\nby rich candidates running against each other and spending large amounts of money.  I made\\na hot canvass, speaking every day, and with an investment of less than one hundred dollars\\nfor travel and other expenses I was triumphantly elected.\\n\\nBy far the most interesting member of the legislature was the speaker, Henry J. Raymond.  He\\nwas one of the most remarkable men I ever met.  During the session I became intimate with him,\\nand the better I knew him the more I became impressed with his genius, the variety of his attainments,\\nthe perfection of his equipment, and his ready command of all his powers and resources. Raymond\\nwas then editor of the New York Tim')\n",

But let the reader consider whether any conjecture\\ncan be more improbable than the statement actually made.\\n\\nIt is, indeed, credible that ambition may prompt an unscrupulous man to make the most enormous\\nsacrifices of human life, and to perpetrate the most atrocious crimes, for the advancement\\nof his views of conquest. But that this great man—as he is usually reckoned even by adversaries—this\\nhero according to some—this illustrious warrior, and mighty sovereign—should have stooped to\\nbe guilty of an act of mean and petty malice worthy of a spiteful old woman,—a piece of paltry\\ncruelty which could not at all conduce to his success in the war, or produce any effect except\\nto degrade his country, and exasperate ours;—this, surely, is quite incredible. On this point\\nlet me refer to my prize-essay on The Freedom of the Will.\\n\\nI have there explained the true meaning and origin of the persistent\\nillusion that the will is entirely free in every single action; and\\nI have indicated the cause to which it is due. A large\\nportion of the English nation, and among these the whole of the Whig party, are said to have\\nexpressed the most vehement indignation, mingled with compassion, at the banishment from Europe,\\nand confinement in St. Helena, of this great man. No considerations of regard for the peace\\nand security of our own country, no dread of the power of so able and indefatigable a warrior,\\nand so inveterate an enemy, should have induced us, they thought, to subject this formidable\\npersonage to a confinement, which was far less severe than that to which he was said to have\\nsubjected such numbers of our countrymen, the harmless non-belligerent travellers, whom (according\\nto the story) he kidnapped in France, with no object but to gratify the basest and most unmanly\\nspite.\\n\\nBut that there is no truth in that story, and that it was not believed by those who manifested\\nso much sympathy and indignation on this great man\\'s account, is sufficiently proved by that\\nvery sympathy and indignation.\\n\\nThere are again other striking improbabilities connected with the Polish nation in the history\\nbefore us. Buonaparte is represented as having always expressed the strongest sympathy with\\nthat ill-used people; and they, as being devotedly attached to him, and fighting with the utmost\\nfidelity and bravery in his armies, in which some of them attained high commands. Now he had\\nit manifestly in his power at one period (according to the received accounts), with a stroke\\nof his pen, to re-establish Poland as an independent state. For, in his last Russian war, he\\nhad complete occupation of the country (of which the population was perfectly friendly); the\\nRussian portion of it was his by right of conquest; and Austria and Prussia, then his allies,\\nand almost his subjects, would gladly have resigned their portions in exchange for some of\\nthe provinces they had ceded to France, and which were, to him, of little value, but, to them,\\nimportant. And, indeed, Prussia was (as we are told) so thoroughly humbled and weakened that\\nhe might easily have enforced the cession of Prussian-Poland, even without any compensation.\\nAnd the re-establishment of the Polish kingdom would have been as evidently politic as it was\\nreasonable. The independence of a faithful and devoted ally, at enmity with the surrounding\\nnations—the very nations that were the most likely to combine (as they often had done) against\\nhim,—this would have given him, at no cost, a kind of strong garrison to maintain his power,\\nand keep his enemies in check.\\n\\nYet this most obvious step, the history tells us, he did not take; but made flattering speeches\\nto the Poles, used their services, and did nothing for them!\\n\\nThis is, alone, sufficiently improbable. But we are required moreover to believe that the Poles,—instead\\nof execrating this man, who had done them the unpardonable wrong of wantonly disappointing\\nthe expectations he had, for his own purposes, excited, thus adding treachery to ingratitude—instead\\nof this, continued to the last as much devoted to him as ever, and even now idolize his memory!\\nWe are to believe, in short, that this Buonaparte, not only in his own conduct and adventures\\nviolated all the established rules of probability, but also caused all other persons, as many\\nas came in contact with him, to act as no mortals ever did act before: may we not add, as no\\nmortals ever did act at all?\\n\\nMany other improbabilities might be added to the list, and will be found in the complete edition\\nof that history, from which some extracts will be presently given, and which has been published\\n(under the title of \"Historic Certainties\") by Aristarchus Newlight, with a learned commentary\\n(not, indeed, adopting the views contained in these pages, but) quite equal in ingenuity to\\na late work on the \"Hebrew Monarchy.\" \\n\\nDoes he fail to see that there are many who would act like them if only they could?\\n\\nMany a criminal dies more quietly on the scaffold than many a non-criminal\\nin the arms of his family. The one has perceived what his will is\\nand has discarded it. And thus it is that the magnitude and boldness of a fraud becomes its\\nbest support. The millions who for so many ages have believed in Mahomet or Brahma, lean as\\nit were on each other for support; and not having vigour of mind enough boldly to throw off\\nvulgar prejudices, and dare be wiser than the multitude, persuade themselves that what so many\\nhave acknowledged must be true. But I call on those who boast their philosophical freedom of\\nthought, and would fain tread in the steps of Hume and other inquirers of the like exalted\\nand speculative genius, to follow up fairly and fully their own principles, and, throwing off\\nthe shackles of authority, to examine carefully the evidence of whatever is proposed to them,\\nbefore they admit its truth.\\n\\nThat even in this enlightened age, as it is called, a whole nation may be egregiously imposed\\nupon, even in matters which intimately concern them, may be proved (if it has not been already\\nproved) by the following instance: it was stated in the newspapers, that, a month after the\\nbattle of Trafalgar, an English officer, who had been a prisoner of war, and was exchanged,\\nreturned to this country from France, and beginning to condole with his countrymen on the terrible\\ndefeat they had sustained, was infinitely astonished to learn that the battle of Trafalgar\\nwas a splendid victory. He had been assured, he said, that in that battle the English had been\\ntotally defeated; and the French were fully and universally persuaded that such was the fact.\\nNow if this report of the belief of the French nation was not true, the British Public were\\ncompletely imposed upon; if it were true, then both nations were, at the same time, rejoicing\\nin the event of the same battle, as a signal victory to themselves; and consequently one or\\nother, at least, of these nations must have been the dupes of their government: for if the\\nbattle was never fought at all, or was not decisive on either side, in that case both parties\\nwere deceived. This instance, I conceive, is absolutely demonstrative of the point in question.\\n\\n')\n",

The copyright for that edition is expired and the text is in the\\npublic domain. This ebook is not copyrighted and is also in the public\\ndomain.\\n\\nPREFACE TO THE FRENCH TRANSLATION.\\n   BY THE ABBE DE CAZALES. Its style was\\nunpretending, its ideas simple, its tone unassuming, its sentiments\\nunexaggerated, and its every sentence expressive of the most complete\\nand entire submission to the Church. Yet, at the same time, it would\\nhave been difficult anywhere to meet with a more touching and lifelike\\nparaphrase of the Gospel narrative. He thought that a book possessing\\nsuch qualities deserved to be known on this side the Rhine, and that\\nthere could be no reason why it should not be valued for its own sake,\\nindependent of the somewhat singular source whence it emanated.\\n\\nStill, the translator has by no means disguised to himself that this work is written, in the\\nfirst place, for Christians; that is to say, for men who have the right to be very diffident\\nin giving credence to particulars concerning facts which are articles of faith; and although\\nhe is aware that St. Bonaventure and many others, in their paraphrases of the Gospel history,\\nhave mixed up traditional details with those given in the sacred text, even these examples\\nhave not wholly reassured him. St. Bonaventure professed only to give a paraphrase, whereas\\nthese revelations appear to be something more. It is certain that the holy maiden herself gave\\nthem no higher title than that of dreams, and that the transcriber of her narratives treats\\nas blasphemous the idea of regarding them in any degree as equivalent to a fifth Gospel; still\\nit is evident that the confessors who exhorted Sister Emmerich to relate what she saw, the\\ncelebrated poet who passed four years near her couch, eagerly transcribing all he heard her\\nsay, and the German Bishops, who encouraged the publication of his book, considered it as something\\nmore than a paraphrase. Some explanations are needful on this head.\\n\\nThe writings of many Saints introduce us into a new, and, if I may be allowed the expression,\\na miraculous world. In all ages there have been revelations about the past, the present, the\\nfuture, and even concerning things absolutely inaccessible to the human intellect. In the present\\nday men are inclined to regard these revelations as simple hallucinations, or as caused by\\na sickly condition of body.\\n\\nThe Church, according to the testimony of her most approved writers, recognises three descriptions\\nof ecstasy; of which the first is simply natural, and entirely brought about by certain physical\\ntendencies and a highly imaginative mind; the second divine or angelic, arising from intercourse\\nheld with the supernatural world; and the third produced by infernal agency. (See, on this\\nhead, the work of Cardinal Bona, De Discretione Spirituum.) Lest we should here write a book\\ninstead of a preface, we will not enter into any development of this doctrine, which appears\\nto us highly philosophical, and without which no satisfactory explanation can be given on the\\nsubject of the soul of man and its various states.\\n\\nThe Church directs certain means to be employed to ascertain by what spirit these ecstasies\\nare produced, according to the maxim of St. John: 'Try the spirits, if they be of God.' (1\\nJn 4:1). When circumstances or events claiming to be supernatural have been properly examined\\naccording to certain rules, the Church has in all ages made a selection from them.\\n\\nMany persons who have been habitually in a state of ecstasy have been canonised, and their\\nbooks approved. But this approbation has seldom amounted to more than a declaration that these\\nbooks contained nothing contrary to faith, and that they were likely to promote a spirit of\\npiety among the faithful. For the Church is only founded on the word of Christ and on the revelations\\nmade to the Apostles. Whatever may since have been revealed to certain saints possesses purely\\na relative value, the reality of which may even be disputed--it being one of the admirable\\ncharacteristics of the Church, that, though inflexibly one in dogma, she allows entire liberty\\nto the human mind in all besides. Thus, we may believe private revelations, above all, when\\nthose persons to whom they were made have been raised by the Church to the rank of Saints publicly\\nhonoured, invoked, and venerated; but, even in these cases, we may, without ceasing to be perfectly\\northodox, dispute their authenticity and divine origin. It is the place of reason to dispute\\nand to select as it sees best.\\n\\nWith regard to the rule for discerning between the good and the evil spirit, it is no other,\\naccording to all theologians, than that of the Gospel. A fructibus eorum cognoscetis eos. By\\ntheir fruits you shall know them. It must be examined in the first place whether the person\\nwho professes to have revelations mistrusts what passes within himself; whether he would prefer\\na more common path; whether far from boasting of the extraordinary graces which he receives,\\nhe seeks to hide them, and only makes them known through obedience; and, finally, whether he\\nis continually advancing in humility, mortification, and charity. Next, the revelations themselves\\nmust be very closely examined into; it must be seen whether there is anything in them contrary\\nto faith; whether they are conformable to Scripture and Apostolic tradition; and whether they\\nare related in a headstrong spirit, or in a spirit of entire submission to the Church.\\n\\nWhoever reads the life of Anne Catherine Emmerich, and her book, will be satisfied that no\\nfault can be found in any of these respects either with herself or with her revelations. Her\\nbook resembles in many points the writings of a great number of saints, and her life also bears\\nthe most striking similitude to theirs. To be convinced of this fact, we need but study the\\nwritings or what is related of Saints Francis of Assisi, Bernard, Bridget, Hildegard, Catherine\\nof Genoa, Catherine of Sienna, Ignatius, John of the Cross, Teresa, and an immense number of\\nother holy persons who are less known. So much being conceded, it is clear that in considering\\nSister Emmerich to have been inspired by God's Holy Spirit, we are not ascribing more merit\\nto her book than is allowed by the Church to all those of the same class. They are all edifying,\\nand may serve to promote piety, which is their sole object. We must not exaggerate their importance\\nby holding as an absolute fact that they proceed from divine inspiration, a favour so great\\nthat its existence in any particular case should not be credited save with the utmost circumspection.\\n\\nWith regard, however, to our present publication, it may be urged that, considering the superior\\ntalents of the transcriber of Sister Emmerich's narrations, the language and expressions which\\nhe has made use of may not always have been identical with those which she employed. We have\\nno hesitation whatever in allowing the force of this argument. Most fully do we believe in\\nthe entire sincerity of M. Clement Brentano, because we both know and love him, and, besides,\\nhis exemplary piety and the retired life which he leads, secluded from a world in which it\\nwould depend but on himself to hold the highest place, are guarantees amply sufficient to satisfy\\nany impartial mind of his sincerity. A poem such as he might publish, if he only pleased, would\\ncause him to be ranked at once among the most eminent of the German poets, whereas the office\\nwhich he has taken upon himself of secretary to a poor visionary has brought him nothing but\\ncontemptuous raillery. Nevertheless, we have no intention to assert that in giving the conversations\\nand discourses of Sister Emmerich that order and coherency in which they were greatly wanting,\\nand writing them down in his own way, he may not unwittingly have arranged, explained, and\\nembellished them. But this would not have the effect of destroying the originality of the recital,\\nor impugning either the sincerity of the nun, or that of the writer.\\n\\nThe translator professes to be unable to understand how any man can write for mere writing's\\nsake, and without considering the probable effects which his work will produce. This book,\\nsuch as it is, appears to him to be at once unusually edifying, and highly poetical. It is\\nperfectly clear that it has, properly speaking, no literary pretensions whatever. Neither the\\nuneducated maiden whose visions are here relate, nor the excellent Christian writer who had\\npublished them in so entire a spirit of literary disinterestedness, ever had the remotest idea\\nof such a thing. And yet there are not, in our opinion, many highly worked-up compositions\\ncalculated to produce an effect in any degree comparable to that which will be brought about\\nby the perusal of this unpretending little work. It is our hope that it will make a strong\\nimpression even upon worldlings, and that in many hearts it will prepare the way for better\\nideas,--perhaps even for a lasting change of life.\\n\\nIn the next place, we are not sorry to call public attention in some degree to all that class\\nof phenomena which preceded the foundation of the Church, which has since been perpetuated\\nuninterruptedly, and which too many Christians are disposed to reject altogether, either through\\nignorance and want of reflection, or purely through human respect. This is a field which has\\nhitherto been but little explored historically, psychologically, and physiologically; and it\\nwould be well if reflecting minds were to bestow upon it a careful and attentive investigation.\\nTo our Christian readers we must remark that this work has received the approval of ecclesiastical\\nauthorities. It has been prepared for the press under the superintendence of the two late Bishops\\nof Ratisbonne, Sailer and Wittman. These names are but little known in France; but in Germany\\nthey are identical with learning, piety, ardent charity, and a life wholly devoted to the maintenance\\nand propagation of the Catholic faith. Many French priests have given their opinion that the\\ntranslation of a book of this character could not but tend to nourish piety, without, however,\\ncountenancing that weakness of spirit which is disposed to lend more importance in some respects\\nto private than to general revelations, and consequently to substitute matters which we are\\nsimply permitted to believe, in the place of those which are of faith.\\n\\nWe feel convinced that no one will take offence at certain details given on the subject of\\nthe outrages which were suffered by our divine Lord during the course of his passion. Our readers\\nwill remember the words of the psalmist: 'I am a worm and no man; the reproach of men, and\\nthe outcast of the people;' (Ps 22:6) and those of the Apostle: 'Tempted in all things like\\nas we are, without sin.' (Heb 4:15). Did we stand in need of a precedent, we should request\\nour readers to remember how plainly and crudely Bossuet describes the same scenes in the most\\neloquent of his four sermons on the Passion of our Lord. On the other hand, there have been\\nso many grand platonic or rhetorical sentences in the books published of late years, concerning\\nthat abstract entity; on which the writers have been pleased to bestow the Christian title\\nof the Word, or Logos, that it may be eminently useful to show the Man-God, the Word made flesh,\\nin all the reality of his life on earth, of his humiliation, and of his sufferings. It must\\nbe evident that the cause of truth, and still more that of edification, will not be the losers.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe following meditations will probably rank high among many similar works which the contemplative\\nlove of Jesus has produced; but it is our duty here plainly to affirm that they have no pretensions\\nwhatever to be regarded as history.1 They are but intended to take one of the lowest places\\namong those numerous representations of the Passion which have been given us by pious writers\\nand artists, and to be considered at the very utmost as the Lenten meditations of a devout\\nnun, related in all simplicity, and written down in the plainest and most literal language,\\nfrom her own dictation. To these meditations, she herself never attached more than a mere human\\nvalue, and never related them except through obedience, and upon the repeated commands of the\\ndirectors of her conscience.\\n\\nThe writer of the following pages was introduced to this holy religious by Count Leopold de\\nStolberg. (The Count de Stolberg is one of the most eminent converts whom the Catholic Church\\nhas made from Protestantism. He died in 1819.) Dean Bernard Overberg, her director extraordinary,\\nand Bishop Michael Sailer, who had often been her counsellor and consoler, urged her to relate\\nto us in detail all that she experienced; and the latter, who survived her, took the deepest\\ninterest in the arrangement and publication of the notes taken down from her dictation. (The\\nBishop of Ratisbonne, one of the most celebrated defenders of the faith in Germany.) These\\nillustrious and holy men, now dead, and whose memory is blessed, were in continual communion\\nof prayer with Anne Catherine, whom they loved and respected, on account of the singular graces\\nwith which God had favoured her. The editor of this book received equal encouragement, and\\nmet with no less sympathy in his labours, from the late Bishop of Ratisbonne, Mgr. Wittman.\\n(Mgr. Wittman was the worthy successor of Sailer, and a man of eminent sanctity, whose memory\\nis held in veneration by all the Catholics of the south of Germany.) This holy Bishop, who\\nwas so deeply versed in the ways of Divine grace, and so well acquainted with its effects on\\ncertain souls, both from his private investigations of the subject, and his own experience,\\ntook the most lively interest in all that concerned Anne Catherine, and on hearing of the work\\nin which the editor of this book was engaged, he strongly exhorted him to publish it. 'These\\nthings have not been communicated to you for nothing,' would he often say; 'God had his views\\nin all. Publish something at least of what you know, for you will thereby benefit many souls.'\\nHe at the same time brought forward various instances from his own experience and that of others,\\nshowing the benefit which had been derived from the study of works of a similar character.\\nHe delighted in calling such privileged souls as Anne Catherine the marrow of the bones of\\nthe Church, according to the expression of St. John Chrysostom, medulla enim hujus mundi sunt,\\nand he encouraged the publication of their lives and writings as far as lay in his power.\\n\\nThe editor of this book being taken by a kind friend to the dying bed of the holy Bishop, had\\nno reason whatever to expect to be recognised, as he had only once in his life conversed with\\nhim for a few minutes; nevertheless the dying saint knew him again, and after a few most kind\\nwords blessed and exhorted him to continue his work for the glory of God.\\n\\nEncouraged by the approbation of such men, we therefore yield to the wishes of many virtuous\\nfriends in publishing the Meditations on the Passion, of this humble religious, to whom God\\ngranted the favour of being at times simple, ingenuous, and ignorant as a child, while at others\\nshe was clear sighted, sensible, possessed of a deep insight into the most mysterious and hidden\\nthings, and consumed with burning and heroic zeal, but ever forgetful of self, deriving her\\nwhole strength from Jesus alone, and steadfast in the most perfect humility and entire self-abnegation.\\n\\nWe give our readers a slight sketch of her life, intending at some future day to publish her\\nbiography more in full.\\n\\nThe Life Of Anne Catherine Emmerich,\\n\\nReligious Of The Order Of St. Augustine,\\n\\nAt The Convent Of Agnetenberg, Dulmen, Westphalia.\\n\\nVenerable Anne Catherine Emmerich2 was born at Flamske, a village situated about a mile and\\na half from Coesfeld, in the bishopric of Munster, on the 8th of September 1774, and was baptised\\nin the church of St. James at Coesfeld. Her parents, Bernard Emmerich and Anne Hiller, were\\npoor peasants, but distinguished for their piety and virtue.\\n\\nThe childhood of Anne Catherine bore a striking resemblance to that of the Venerable Anne Garzias\\nde St. Barthelemi, of Dominica del Paradiso, and of several other holy persons born in the\\nsame rank of life as herself. Her angel-guardian used to appear to her as a child; and when\\nshe was taking care of sheep in the fields, the Good Shepherd himself, under the form of a\\nyoung shepherd, would frequently come to her assistance. From childhood she was accustomed\\nto have divine knowledge imparted to her in visions of all kinds, and was often favoured by\\nvisits from the Mother of God and Queen of Heaven, who, under the form of a sweet, lovely,\\nand majestic lady, would bring the Divine Child to be, as it were, her companion, and would\\nassure her that she loved and would ever protect her. Many of the saints would also appear\\nto her, and receive from her hands the garlands of flowers which she had prepared in honour\\nof their festivals. All these favours and visions surprised the child less than if an earthly\\nprincess and the lords and ladies of her court had come to visit her. Nor was she, later in\\nlife, more surprised at these celestial visits, for her innocence caused her to feel far more\\nat her ease with our Divine Lord, his Blessed Mother and the Saints, than she could ever be\\nwith even the most kind and amiable of her earthly companions. The names of Father, Mother,\\nBrother, and Spouse, appeared to her expressive of the real connections subsisting between\\nGod and man, since the Eternal word had been pleased to be born of a woman, and so to become\\nour Brother, and these sacred titles were not mere words in her mouth.\\n\\nWhile yet a child, she used to speak with innocent candour and simplicity of all that she saw,\\nand her listeners would be filled with admiration at the histories she would relate from Holy\\nWrit; but their questions and remarks having sometimes disturbed her peace of mind, she determined\\nto keep silence on such subjects for the future. In her innocence of heart, she thought that\\nit was not right to talk of things of this sort, that other persons never did so, and that\\nher speech should be only Yea, yea, and Nay, nay, or Praise be to Jesus Christ. The visions\\nwith which she was favoured were so like realities, and appeared to her so sweet and delightful,\\nthat she supposed all Christian children were favoured with the same; and she concluded that\\nthose who never talked on such subjects were only more discreet and modest than herself, so\\nshe resolved to keep silence also, to be like them.\\n\\nAlmost from her cradle she possessed the gift of distinguishing what was good or evil, holy\\nor profane, blessed or accursed, in material as well as in spiritual things, thus resembling\\nSt. Sibyllina of Pavia, Ida of Louvain, Ursula Benincasa, and some other holy souls. In her\\nearliest childhood she used to bring out of the fields useful herbs, which no one had ever\\nbefore discovered to be good for anything, and plant them near her father's cottage, or in\\nsome spot where she was accustomed to work and play; while on the other hand she would root\\nup all poisonous plants, and particularly those ever used for superstitious practices or in\\ndealings with the devil. Were she by chance in a place where some great crime had been committed,\\nshe would hastily run away, or begin to pray and do penance. She used also to perceive by intuition\\nwhen she was in a consecrated spot, return thanks to God, and be filled with a sweet feeling\\nof peace. When a priest passed by with the Blessed Sacrament, even at a great distance from\\nher home or from the place where she was taking care of her flock, she would feel a strong\\nattraction in the direction whence he was coming, run to meet him, and be kneeling in the road,\\nadoring the Blessed Sacrament, long before he could reach the spot.\\n\\nShe knew when any object was consecrated, and experienced a feeling of disgust and repugnance\\nwhen in the neighbourhood of old pagan cemeteries, whereas she was attracted to the sacred\\nremains of the saints as steel by the magnet. When relics were shown to her, she knew what\\nsaints they had belonged to, and could give not only accounts of the minutest and hitherto\\nunknown particulars of their lives, but also histories of the relics themselves, and of the\\nplaces where they had been preserved. During her whole life she had continual intercourse with\\nthe souls in purgatory; and all her actions and prayers were offered for the relief of their\\nsufferings. She was frequently called upon to assist them, and even reminded in some miraculous\\nmanner, if she chanced to forget them. Often, while yet very young, she used to be awakened\\nout of her sleep by bands of suffering souls, and to follow them on cold winter's nights with\\nbare feet, the whole length of the Way of the Cross to Coesfeld, though the ground was covered\\nwith snow.\\n\\nFrom her infancy to the day of her death she was indefatigable in relieving the sick, and in\\ndressing and curing wounds and ulcers, and she was accustomed to give to the poor every farthing\\nshe possessed. So tender was her conscience, that the slightest sin she fell into caused her\\nsuch pain as to make her ill, and absolution then always restored her immediately to health.\\n\\nThe extraordinary nature of the favours bestowed on her by Almighty God was no hindrance in\\nthe way of her devoting herself to hard labour, like any other peasant-girl; and we may also\\nbe allowed to observe that a certain degree of the spirit of prophecy is not unusually to be\\nfound among her country men and women. She was taught in the school of suffering and mortification,\\nand there learned lessons of perfection. She allowed herself no more sleep or food than was\\nabsolutely necessary; passed whole hours in prayer every night; and in winter often knelt out\\nof doors on the snow. She slept on the ground on planks arranged in the form of a cross. Her\\nfood and drink consisted of what was rejected by others; she always kept the best parts even\\nof that for the poor and sick, and when she did not know of anyone to give them to, she offered\\nthem to God in a spirit of child-like faith, begging him to give them to some person who was\\nmore in need than herself. When there was anything to be seen or heard which had no reference\\nto God or religion, she found some excuse for avoiding the spot to which others were hastening,\\nor, if there, closed her eyes and ears. She was accustomed to say that useless actions were\\nsinful, and that when we denied our bodily senses any gratification of this kind, we were amply\\nrepaid by the progress which we made in the interior life, in the same manner as pruning renders\\nvines and other fruittrees more productive. From her early youth, and wherever she went, she\\nhad frequent symbolical visions, which showed her in parables, as it were, the object of her\\nexistence, the means of attaining it, and her future sufferings, together with the dangers\\nand conflicts which she would have to go through.\\n\\nShe was in her sixteenth year, when one day, whilst at work in the fields with her parents\\nand sisters, she heard the bell ringing at the Convent of the Sisters of the Annunciation,\\nat Coesfeld. This sound so inflamed her secret desire to become a nun, and had so great an\\neffect upon her, that she fainted away, and remained ill and weak for a long time after. When\\nin her eighteenth year she was apprenticed at Coesfeld to a dressmaker, with whom she passed\\ntwo years, and then returned to her parents. She asked to be received at the Convents of the\\nAugustinians at Borken, of the Trappists at Darfeld, and of the Poor Clares at Munster; but\\nher poverty, and that of these convents, always presented an insuperable obstacle to her being\\nreceived. At the age of twenty, having saved twenty thalers (about 3l. English), which she\\nhad earned by her sewing, she went with this little sum--a perfect fortune for a poor peasant-girl--to\\na pious organist of Coesfeld, whose daughter she had known when she first lived in the town.\\nHer hope was that, by learning to play on the organ, she might succeed in obtaining admittance\\ninto a convent. But her irresistible desire to serve the poor and give them everything she\\npossessed left her no time to learn music, and before long she had so completely stripped herself\\nof everything, that her good mother was obliged to bring her bread, milk, and eggs, for her\\nown wants and those of the poor, with whom she shared everything. Then her mother said: 'Your\\ndesire to leave your father and myself, and enter a convent, gives us much pain; but you are\\nstill my beloved child, and when I look at your vacant seat at home, and reflect that you have\\ngiven away all your savings, so as to be now in want, my heart is filled with sorrow, and I\\nhave now brought you enough to keep you for some time.' Anne Catherine replied: 'Yes, dear\\nmother, it is true that I have nothing at all left, because it was the holy will of God that\\nothers should be assisted by me; and since I have given all to him, he will now take care of\\nme, and bestow his divine assistance upon us all.' She remained some years at Coesfeld, employed\\nin labour, good works, and prayer, being always guided by the same inward inspirations. She\\nwas docile and submissive as a child in the hands of her guardian-angel.\\n\\nAlthough in this brief sketch of her life we are obliged to omit many interesting circumstances,\\nthere is one which we must not pass over in silence. When about twenty-four years of age, she\\nreceived a favour from our Lord, which has been granted to many persons devoted in an especial\\nmanner to meditation on his painful Passion; namely, to experience the actual and visible sufferings\\nof his sacred Head, when crowned with thorns. The following is the account she herself has\\ngiven of the circumstances under which so mysterious a favour was bestowed upon her: 'About\\nfour years previous to my admittance into the convent, consequently in 1798, it happened that\\nI was in the Jesuits' Church at Coesfeld, at about twelve o'clock in the day, kneeling before\\na crucifix and absorbed in meditation, when all on a sudden I felt a strong but pleasant heat\\nin my head, and I saw my Divine Spouse, under the form of a young man clothed with light, come\\ntowards me from the altar, where the Blessed Sacrament was preserved in the tabernacle. In\\nhis left hand he held a crown of flowers, in his right hand a crown of thorns, and he bade\\nme choose which I would have. I chose the crown of thorns; he placed it on my head, and I pressed\\nit down with both hands. Then he disappeared, and I returned to myself, feeling, however, violent\\npain around my head. I was obliged to leave the church, which was going to be closed. One of\\nmy companions was kneeling by my side, and as I thought she might have seen what happened to\\nme, I asked her when we got home whether there was not a wound on my forehead, and spoke to\\nher in general terms of my vision, and of the violent pain which had followed it. She could\\nsee nothing outwardly, but was not astonished at what I told her, because she knew that I was\\nsometimes in an extraordinary state, without her being able to understand the cause. The next\\nday my forehead and temples were very much swelled, and I suffered terribly. This pain and\\nswelling often returned, and sometimes lasted whole days and nights. I did not remark that\\nthere was blood on my head until my companions told me I had better put on a clean cap, because\\nmine was covered with red spots. I let them think whatever they liked about it, only taking\\ncare to arrange my head dress so as to hide the blood which flowed from my head, and I continued\\nto observe the same precaution even after I entered the convent, where only one person perceived\\nthe blood, and she never betrayed my secret.'\\n\\nSeveral other contemplative persons, especially devoted to the passion of our Lord, have been\\nadmitted to the privilege of suffering the torture inflicted by the crown of thorns, after\\nhaving seen a vision in which the two crowns were offered them to choose between, for instance,\\namong others, St. Catherine of Sienna, and Pasithea of Crogis, a Poor Clare of the same town,\\nwho died in 1617.\\n\\nThe writer of these pages may here be allowed to remark that he himself has, in full daylight,\\nseveral times seen blood flow down the forehead and face, and even beyond the linen wrapped\\nround the neck of Anne Catherine. Her desire to embrace a religious life was at length gratified.\\nThe parents of a young person whom the Augustinian nuns of Dulmen wished to receive into their\\norder, declared that they would not give their consent except on condition that Anne Catherine\\nwas taken at the same time. The nuns yielded their assent, though somewhat reluctantly, on\\naccount of their extreme poverty; and on the 13th November 1802, one week before the feast\\nof the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin, Anne Catherine entered on her novitiate. At the\\npresent day vocations are not so severely tested as formerly; but in her case, Providence imposed\\nspecial trials, for which, rigorous as they were, she felt she never could be too grateful.\\nSufferings or privations, which a soul, either alone or in union with others, imposes upon\\nherself, for God's greater glory, are easy to bear; but there is one cross more nearly resembling\\nthe cross of Christ than any other, and that is, lovingly and patiently to submit to unjust\\npunishment, rebuffs, or accusations. It was the will of God that during her year's novitiate\\nshe should, independently of the will of any creature, be tried as severely as the most strict\\nmistress of novices could have done before any mitigations had been allowed in the rules. She\\nlearned to regard her companions as instruments in the hands of God for her sanctification;\\nand at a later period of her life many other things appeared to her in the same light. But\\nas it was necessary that her fervent soul should be constantly tried in the school of the Cross,\\nGod was pleased that she should remain in it all her life.\\n\\nIn many ways her position in the convent was excessively painful. Not one of her companions,\\nnor even any priest or doctor, could understand her case. She had learned, when living among\\npoor peasants, to hide the wonderful gifts which God had bestowed on her; but the case was\\naltered now that she was in familiar intercourse with a large number of nuns, who, though certainly\\ngood and pious, were filled with ever-increasing feelings of curiosity, and even of spiritual\\njealousy in her regard. Then, the contracted ideas of the community, and the complete ignorance\\nof the nuns concerning all those exterior phenomena by which the interior life manifests itself,\\ngave her much to endure, the more so, as these phenomena displayed themselves in the most unusual\\nand astonishing manner. She heard everything that was said against her, even when the speakers\\nwere at on end of the convent and she at the other, and her heart was most deeply wounded as\\nif by poisoned arrows. Yet she bore all patiently a lovingly without showing that she knew\\nwhat was said of her. More than once charity impelled her to cast herself at the feet of some\\nnun who was particularly prejudiced against her, and ask her pardon with tears. Then, she was\\nsuspected of listening at the doors, for the private feelings of dislike entertained against\\nher became known, no one knew how, and the nuns felt uncomfortable and uneasy, in spite of\\nthemselves, when in her company.\\n\\nWhenever the rule (the minutest point of which was sacred in her eyes) was neglected in the\\nslightest degree, she beheld in spirit each infringement, and at times was inspired to fly\\nto the spot where the rule was being broken by some infringement of the vow of poverty, or\\ndisregards of the hours of silence, and she would then repeat suitable passages from the rule,\\nwithout having ever learned them. She thus became an object of aversion to all those religious\\nwho broke the rule; and her sudden appearance among them had almost the effect of apparitions.\\nGod had bestowed upon her the gift of tears to so great an extent, that she often passed whole\\nhours in the church weeping over the sins and ingratitude of men, the sufferings of the Church,\\nthe imperfections of the community, and her own faults. But these tears of sublime sorrow could\\nbe understood by none but God, before whom she shed them, and men attributed them to mere caprice,\\na spirit of discontent, or some ot\")\n",

There he was introduced to young Monteleon, son of a former ambassador at our Court,\\nwho had been much liked.  The young ecclesiastic was called the Abbe Portocarrero, a name regarded\\nwith favour in France.  Monteleon came from the Hague, and was going to Madrid.  Portocarrero\\ncame from Madrid, and was going back there.  What more natural than that the two young men\\nshould travel in company?  What less natural than that the two young men, meeting each other\\nby pure accident in Paris, should be charged by the ambassador with any packet of consequence,\\nhe having his own couriers, and the use, for the return journey, of those sent to him from\\nSpain?  In fact, it may be believed that these young people themselves were perfectly ignorant\\nof what they were charged with, and simply believed that, as they were going to Spain, the\\nambassador merely seized the occasion to entrust them with some packet of no special importance.\\n\\nThey set out, then, at the commencement of December, furnished with passports from the King--(for\\nAlberoni had openly caused almost a rupture between the two Courts)--with a Spanish banker,\\nwho had been established in England, where he had become bankrupt for a large amount, so that\\nthe English government had obtained permission from the Regent to arrest him, if they could,\\nanywhere in France.  It will sometimes be perceived that I am ill-instructed in this affair;\\nbut I can only tell what I know: and as for the rest, I give my conjectures.  In fact, the\\nAbbe Dubois kept everybody so much in the dark, that even M. le Duc d'Orleans was not informed\\nof all.\\n\\nWhether the arrival of the Abbe Portocarrero in Paris, and his short stay there, seemed suspicious\\nto the Abbe Dubois and his emissaries, or whether he had corrupted some of the principal people\\nof the Spanish Ambassador and this Court, and learned that these young men were charged with\\na packet of importance; whether there was no other mystery than the bad company of the bankrupt\\nbanker, and that the anxiety of Dubois to oblige his friends the English, induced him to arrest\\nthe three travellers and seize their papers, lest the banker should have confided his to the\\nyoung men, I know not: but however it may have been, it is certain that the Abbe Dubois arrested\\nthe three travellers at Poitiers, and carried off their papers, a courier bringing these papers\\nto him immediately afterwards.\\n\\nGreat things sometimes spring from chance.  The courier from Poitiers entered the house of\\nthe Abbe Dubois just as the Regent entered the opera.  Dubois glanced over the papers, and\\nwent and related the news of this capture to M. le Duc Orleans, as he left his box.  This prince,\\nwho was accustomed to shut himself up with his roues at that hour, did so with a carelessness\\nto which everything yielded, under pretext that Dubois had not had sufficient time to examine\\nall the papers.  The first few hours of the morning he was not himself.  His head, still confused\\nby the fumes of the wine and by the undigested supper of the previous night, was not in a state\\nto understand anything, and the secretaries of state have often told me that was the time they\\ncould make him sign anything. This was the moment taken by Dubois to acquaint the Regent with\\nas much or as little of the contents of the papers as he thought fit.  The upshot of their\\ninterview was, that the Abbe was allowed by the Duc d'Orleans to have the control of this matter\\nentirely in his own hands.\\n\\n\")\n"
